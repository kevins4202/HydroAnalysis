products singlet oxygen simulated drinking water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps have been reported in surface water systems all over the world and several have been included in the priority lists by european union eu and the united states environmental protection agency usepa ebele et al 2017 kim and homan 2020 for instance a study from south korea has shown 16 different ppcps in various rivers drinking water and effluent kim et al 2007 sadutto et al 2021 reported 32 ppcps in mediterranean coastal wetlands which were associated with different anthropogenic and spatial factors ppcps have also been found in the surface water systems of china and their abundance has been reported in the source water table s1 chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2021b and tap water in different regions of china table s2 jiang et al 2019b liu et al 2019 currently in china it is of great concern to mitigate the ppcps in drinking water and to ensure the safe delivery of tap water to consumers jiang et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2019 multiple homogeneous peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been used for the elimination of ppcps e g sulfamethoxazole by fe2 pms wang et al 2020a atenolol by uv pms liu et al 2013 benzophenone 4 by microwave pms wang et al 2021 amoxicillin by co3o4 pms guo et al 2013 and carbamazepine by comgfe ldo pms hong et al 2020 compared with homogeneous catalysis such as pms activated by fe2 and the activation of pms by energy such as uv and microwave heterogeneous activation of pms by metal oxides and composites are relatively energy free and independent of ph hu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 however problems of catalyst recovery recycling agglomeration and metal leaching are still of important concerns catalytic ceramic membranes ccms fabricated with metal based catalysts for the activation of pms have shown effectiveness in the elimination of ppcps co3o4 based ccms synthesized by the wet impregnation method have shown fast kinetics for activating pms and degradation of sulfamethoxazole bao et al 2019 wang et al 2019c has synthesized hollow fiber cuo based ccms and used them as activators for pms for the degradation of bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole fan et al 2020 prepared a cofe2o4 decorated flat sheet ccms via a hydrothermal method which could effectively activate pms for the degradation of ofloxacin therefore the ccms pms system would be a promising system for removing ppcps radical oxidation e g hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and superoxide anion radical o2 and nonradical oxidation singlet oxygen 1o2 are commonly proved as the main mechanisms for the degradation of organics in the ccms pms system ding et al 2020 kohantorabi et al 2021 the fabrication of ceramic membranes with metal based catalysts can solve the problems of catalyst recovery and recycling as well as agglomeration however toxic metals such as co cu and ce have been found to be an impediment in the widespread of such ccms pms systems bao et al 2019 fan et al 2020 lee et al 2022 much more effort is required to use environmentally friendly material with sufficient catalytic performance and synthesize ccms with long term stability and durability meanwhile it would be more meaningful to study the ppcps mixture with trace concentrations in real water matrices instead of only selecting one model ppcps with a high concentration far from the actual situation in this study mn2o3 based flat sheet ccms mn ccms

5 h in a ball milling bowl and refined under vacuum conditions then the composites were transferred to an automatic sieve shaker and aged for 48 h the flat sheet al2o3 ceramic support was made by

three types of matrices i e i ultrapure water upw ii river water rw and iii suwanee river natural organic matter srnom solution as simulated drinking water the simulated drinking water was prepared by spiking srnom into upw to achieve the total organic carbon toc to be 2 mg c l the basic quality parameters of rw were presented in table s4 the mn ccms pms system was operated as a submerged dead end one way filtration mode as shown in fig s1 the effluent was not circulated to the membrane cell the concentration of influent ppcps the flow rate of the influent and the hydraulic residence time of the system were 500 µg l 60 lmh and 1 5 min respectively the pms solution was added by a peristaltic pump the transmembrane pressure tmp of the filtration system was automatically measured by a pressure gage and recorded by a digital recorder the contribution of noncatalytic oxidation by pms was calculated as follows noncatalytic total degradation catalytic adsorption where the contribution of catalytic for each ppcps mixture was quantified by the quenching experiments the role of adsorption was estimated through backwashing the mn ccms with twice the revolution speed of the peristaltic pump at fixed time intervals 1 ml effluent was taken and filtered with 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe syringe filters then immediately quenched by 50 μl na2s2o3 0 1 mol l solution after each experiment the membranes were cleaned with a higher dose of pms 1 mm for 30 min and then cleaned by upw for 30 min then mn ccms were dried in an oven at 45 for 24 h for the next experiment the

spe by using spe cartridge waters oasis hlb usa was performed before measurement wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mn ccms the characteristics of contact angles porosities and pure water fluxes on cms vs mn ccms are presented in table s7 compared to cms 21 8 1 6 the contact angles of mn ccms were increased from 19 5 1 5 1 0 wt mn2o3 to 45 1 1 2 4 0 wt mn2o3 however the porosities and pure water fluxes were decreased from 28 6 0 33 and 32 20 0 37 lmh kpa 1 0 wt mn2o3 to 20 3 0 62 and 14 85 0 31 lmh kpa 4 0 wt mn2o3 respectively while increasing mn2o3 loadings for mn ccms the increase in contact angles and the decrease in porosities would cause a decrease in the pure water flux the actual picture of the synthesized ceramic membranes are shown in fig 1 a with the increase of manganese content the color of ceramic membranes became darker the surface morphologies and cross sectional views of the cm and mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings are presented in fig 1b the average thickness of the membrane layer for cm and mn ccms were around 120 10 µm and 145 15 µm respectively for surface morphologies of mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings mn ccms with 1 0 wt and 4 0 wt of mn2o3 presented in the form of block while for cms and 2 0 wt of mn2o3 presented in the form of particles the uniform elemental distributions of al o si and mn were found on the surface of mn ccms as shown in fig 1c fig 1d shows the crystalline structures of cms and mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings by xrd patterns as for cms the strong characteristic diffraction peaks centered at 2θ values of 25 6 012 35 2 104 43 4 113 52 5 024 and 57 5 116 were well indexed as hexagonal al2o3 jcpdf 46 1212 as for different loadings of mn ccms only the al2o3 crystalline phase was found while no obvious diffraction peak of mn2o3 was observed reasons for this phenomenon might be that the relative loadings of mn2o3 are low in our study and with a high dispersion degree wu et al 2019a meanwhile after calcinated at 1250 which is higher than the melting point of mn2o3 mn2o3 was presented in an amorphous form wu et al 2019b the amorphous form of mn2o3 in the mn ccms with a higher surface area and more active sites would finally benefit the activation ability for pms guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2007 the oxidation states of different elements measured by xps for mn ccms and cms are presented in fig 2 the spectrum of al 2p could be ascribed to al o al representing that al2o3 mainly covered the surface of cms both sub peaks of al o al and al o mn were found in mn ccms which can greatly alleviate the aggregation of mn2o3 and the leaching of mn during catalytic membrane filtration according to previous research bao et al 2019 the distribution of lattice oxygen species ol and hydroxyl species oh for cms and mn ccms was 41 6 and 58 4 vs 62 2 and 37 8 respectively the obvious increase in ol in mn ccms was ascribed to the contribution of oxides from mn2o3 the high resolution of mn 2p peaks for mn ccms have shown in fig 2c the binding energy values of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 were 652 04 ev and 640 41 ev respectively with a spin orbit splitting value of 11 6 ev which was in line with previous researches about mn2o3 salavati niasari et al 2009 zhou et al 2021 mn3 640 4 ev and mn4 644 2 ev were the two main mn valences in mn ccms with a distribution of 85 2 and 14 8 respectively mn 2p was found in xps survey spectrum in mn ccms in fig 2f which further demonstrated the successful loading of mn2o3 3 2 effects of mn2o3 loading pms dosage and ph the performance of mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings dosages of pms and ph values toward the degradation of ppcps mixture in simulated drinking water is presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a when the loading of mn2o3 increased from 1 0 wt to 2 0 wt the activation performance for pms by mn ccms was increased noticeably otc apap ofl tc amo ran and tia were almost fully degraded by 2 0 wt mn2o3 however a further increase in mn2o3 4 0 wt caused a slight reduction in removal performance than that of 2 0 wt it could attribute to the lower porosity and smaller bet of mn ccms which could cause less availability of active sites therefore 2 0 wt of mn2o3 was chosen as the optimal loading for mn ccms seven ppcps otc ofl tc amo ran cip and tia have shown similar removals at dosages of pms from 0 1 to 0 3 mm and presenting 0 1 mm as a satisfactory dose for their removal fig 3b however the impacts of pms dosages were significant for four ppcps i e apap trim ate and nap with the highest differences in removals of around 83 87 94 and 87 for 0 01 mm and 0 3 mm pms respectively meanwhile while increasing pms concentrations from 0 01 mm to 0 3 mm the net increase in tmp was 1 69 kpa to 0 12 kpa respectively thus in order to obtain the best removal efficiencies for the eleven ppcps mixture and the least membrane fouling 0 3 mm pms was chosen as the final dosage the mn ccms pms system showed satisfactory removals for ppcps mixture under the ph of 4 05 9 15 fig 3c while further increased ph to 11 0 the decrease in the degradation of ofl trim ate and nap was more than 60 thus in this study we didn t adjust the initial ph 6 29 0 02 while performing the experiments 3 3 performance of mn ccms pms for the degradation of ppcps the performance of mn ccms pms for the degradation of ppcps mixture was tested in three different water matrices including upw srnom solution and rw results are presented in fig 4 the mn ccms pms system regardless of water matrix has shown extraordinary removal with a total reduction of ppcps above 80 in merely 2 min and around 90 after 10 min of filtration the insignificant difference p 0 05 anova in a total reduction of ppcps up to 93 90 and 89 in upw srnom solution and rw respectively showed the versatility of the mn ccms pms system toward the degradation of ppcps in order to mimic the real situation of ppcps the effectiveness of the mn ccms pms system has also been tested at trace level of ppcps mixture 200 ng l and results were compared with those of higher concentration 500 µg l the mn ccms pms system has successfully fully removed the ppcps at trace level except for the ate 73 and nap 95 these results inferred that the mn ccms pms system could be applied to emergency control both with a higher concentration and practical concentration of ppcps in drinking water meanwhile the activated sludge respiration inhibition test showed that the toxicity of ppcps mixture was reduced by 85 9 after being treated by the mn ccms pms system fig s3 this study is novel in discussing the degradation performance of trace concentration of ppcps mixture which is more realistic in practical water matrix as shown in fig 4c and 4d the mn ccms pms showed a significant difference in the performance from that of cms pms p 0 05 anova in pristine cms pms system the maximum total reduction in ppcps was less than 60 compared to 93 in mn ccms pms four of the ppcps i e apap trim ate and nap have shown higher differences in performances between the cms pms vs mn ccms pms with the removals of 12 vs 100 10 0 vs 62 16 vs 64 and 32 vs 94 respectively both of the two systems showed excellent removal efficiencies for otc tia ran and amo removals of each ppcps in both mn ccms pms and cms pms systems in different water matrices were presented in fig s4 as for the mn ccms pms system the degradation sequence of ppcps mixture was uniform in the order of ran tia amootcofl tc cip apap nap ate trim for the three water matrices compared to previous studies on the degradation of single compound bao et al 2019 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wu et al 2019b this study is novel in providing breakthrough results for the extension of ccms pms toward real applications and simultaneous degradation of ppcps mixture with trace concentrations in different water matrices 3 4 roles of catalytic and noncatalytic oxidation for the removal of ppcps in order to further understand the removal mechanism for different ppcps by the mn ccms pms system the degradation contributions of the ppcps were divided into three categories i catalytic by mn ccms pms ii noncatalytic by pms oxidation and iii adsorption by mn ccms the mass balance of ppcps presented in fig 5 showed the various phenomena for the degradation of ppcps mixture five ppcps ran tia amo tc and otc have been found with above 50 degradation by noncatalytic oxidation the main reason is that pms has a greater ability to remove ppcps containing tertiary aliphatic amine functional groups compared to those with primary or secondary aliphatic amines yang et al 2018b zhou et al 2018 mechanisms for this phenomenon is that the oxygen addition reactions are started by the transfer of oxygen from oo bond of pms to ppcps followed by electrophilic reaction between pms and ppcps finally ppcps are degraded through hydration reaction formation of nitrogen oxides and dealkylation zhou et al 2018 etc adsorption has played a very limited role in removing ppcps and the total removal was amounted to be 3 1 the highest reduction through adsorption has been recorded for cip 10 as shown in fig 5 catalytic oxidation plays an important role for the degradation of ofl 92 1 nap 91 7 trim 85 8 ate 81 2 apap 78 5 and cip 76 7 the functional groups of piperazinyl oxazinyl and carboxyl of ofl are the main active sites that can be easily attacked by 1o2 gao et al 2019 it was reported that nap was firstly attacked by o2 to form carbon centered radical followed by the cleavage of carboxyl and further oxidized by 1o2 and o2 fayyaz et al 2021 wang et al 2018 luo et al 2012 showed that 1o2 reacted with 2 4 diaminoprimidine portion of trim through a 2 2 cycloaddition forming a zwitterionic intermediate after which a 1 3 benzyl shift and rearrangement happened by bond scission to form two stable products the aniline ring of apap can be directly oxidized by 1o2 through hydroxylation and ring opening and the cn bond cleavage of apap led to the decomposition of apap cai et al 2022 the degradation mechanism for cip by 1o2 included the oxidation of the piperazine the defluorination and hydroxylation on the pyridine ring or benzo ring as well as the decarbonylation and decarboxylation chen et al 2022c meanwhile based on the previous researches we also found that 1o2 played a major role in the degradation of ofl chen et al 2022d cip yu et al 2020b nap bai et al 2020 apap fan et al 2019b ate cui et al 2021 for the pms based advanced oxidation processes which further demonstrated the accurate results of this research based on the above results the following sequence of preferential mechanisms for removing ppcps was recorded as catalytic 54 7 noncatalytic 42 3 adsorption 3 0 this study provided insights into different phenomena involved in the removal of ppcps in the mn ccms pms systems suggesting that the necessity of mn ccms and optimization of performance should be based on the category of ppcps available in the water environment for example in practical engineering applications for organics containing primary or secondary or tertiary aliphatic amine functional groups or with enough electron rich moieties noncatalytic oxidation by pms alone can be considered as a priority for water purification instead of using the catalytic system of mn ccms pms 3 5 possible mechanism in the mn ccms pms system the dominant ros for the degradation of different ppcps in srnom solution were determined through quenching experiments and epr results were presented in fig 6 meoh is used to quench so4 and oh zhu et al 2017 and tba is used to scavenge oh saputra et al 2014 the addition of meoh 200 mm and tba 200 mm has not shown any substantial changes in ppcps mixture removal indicating the absence of so4 and oh although liu et al 2021 showed that meoh and tba could accelerate the pms decomposition 25 ph 5 and 20 ph 7 the remaining concentration of pms is still sufficient enough for the degradation of ppcps according to the results shown in fig 3b which further demonstrated the accuracy of the quenching experiment afterward the contribution of the 1o2 for the degradation of ppcps was quenched by β carotene 0 05 0 2 mm with reaction rate constant of k 1o2 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 yu et al 2020a in the presence of β carotene the performance of mn ccms pms was greatly decreased which confirmed the extensive existence of 1o2 in the mn ccms pms system however β carotene showed no obvious quenching effects on the degradation of ran and tia which indicated that both of them were removed by pms oxidation lastly the role of o2 and ros adsorped by mn ccms were confirmed by p bq 1 mm jawad et al 2014 and ki 0 5 mm hu et al 2018 for the removal of ppcps respectively as shown in fig 6c and 6d both p bq and ki showed a few influences on the degradation of trim ate and nap since no obvious so4 and oh were found in this system the adsorbed ros was mainly related to o2 which acted as a precursor of 1o2 the dominant ros in mn ccms pms has also been verified by epr spectroscopy meanwhile differences in ros generation with or without water matrix conditions have also been compared and presented in fig 6e and fig s5 firstly dmpo as a spinning trapping agent was tried in upw and srnom solution neither dmpo so4 nor dmpo oh adducts were recorded for the mn ccms pms system these results validated the findings of the above quenching experiments showing the unnoticeable role of so4 and oh for the degradation of ppcps on the other hand temp as a spin trapping agent has provided an intense triplet signal 1 1 1 of temp 1o2 adduct in both upw and srnom solution and the self dissociation of pms has also shown a very weak triple signal of temp 1o2 adduct the intensities of triplet signals of temp 1o2 adduct for different loadings of mn2o3 in the mn ccms pms systems were found following their potential to activate pms for the degradation of ppcps fig 3a the highest intense triplet signal was recorded in 2 0 wt mn2o3 mn ccms pms system followed by 4 0 wt mn2o3 and 1 0 wt mn2o3 it was reported that oxygen vacancies ov the defect sites on the surface of metal oxides played an important role in the generation of 1o2 bu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a as shown in f abundant ov was found in different loadings of mn ccms with the relative intensities of ov in the order of 2 0 wt 4 0 wt 1 0 wt which was also in accordance with results showed in fig 3 ov serving as the active sites was in favor of interfacial electron transfer for the redox of mn3 mn4 and could adsorb pms through electron deprivation resulting in accelerating the generation of 1o2 li et al 2019 lu et al 2018 for further understanding the activation mechanism of pms by mn ccms the chemical states of mn ccms before and after reaction were studied by xps as shown in fig 2 and fig s6 the distribution of mn3 vs mn4 before and after reaction changed from 85 2 vs 14 8 to 75 6 vs 24 4 which manifested the redox processes between mn3 and mn4 during the reaction meanwhile the ratio of ol oh changed from 1 64 to 0 19 before and after oxidation reaction showing the participation of both ol and oh in the reaction the decrease of ol also indicated the formation of ov which would further be changed into active oxygen o and react with pms to generate 1o2 liu et al 2018 and the formation of ov can also activate oh to produce 1o2 tan et al 2017 based on the above results the possible mechanism in the mn ccms pms system for the degradation of ppcps mixture was proposed as shown in fig 7 firstly mn ⅲ can combine with pms to generate o2 which would be the precursor of 1o2 eqs 1 3 fan et al 2019a yang et al 2018a while mn ⅳ can react with pms to form so5 eq 4 and 1o2 can also be generated by the reaction of so5 in the solution via eq 5 wang et al 2019b the transformation of ol to ov would accelerate the redox couple of mn3 mn4 in the crystal lattice and resulting in the generation of active oxygen o which would generate 1o2 by react with pms eqs 6 7 chen et al 2020 meanwhile the oxygen formed from the decomposition of h2o2 would obtain electron from ov to form o2 eqs 8 9 which would generate 1o2 via eqs 2 3 finally 1o2 can also be generated by the self decomposition of pms via eq 10 chen et al 2020 1 mn ⅲ oh hso5 mn ⅲ o oso3 h2o mn ⅳ oh o2 2hso4 2 2o2 2h2o 1o2 h2o2 2oh 3 2o2 2h 1o2 h2o2 4 mn ⅳ oh hso5 mn ⅳ o oso3 h2o mn ⅲ oh so5 h 5 2so5 h2o 1 51o2 2hso4 6 2mn ⅳ ol

system was tested on the optimized conditions and results were presented in fig 8 six matching removals were recorded for the mn ccms pms system representing the stability in the performance of mn ccms for the activation of pms and degradation of ppcps mixture after the six cycles of repetition the total change in ppcps removal was less than 3 the distribution of ppcps remaining was also found similar after each filtration p 0 05 anova showing the uniform treatability and degradation potential meanwhile during the six repeatability experiments the mn leaching was found in a range from 1 9 to 3 6 µg l table s8 which was recorded to be fewer compared with previous reported ccms such as 2 8 mg l mn wu et al 2019b 0 17 mg l cu luo et al 2018 0 14 mg l co fan et al 2020 and 0 45 mg l co wang et al 2020b meanwhile based on the sem images shown in fig s7 and changes in bet porosity contact angle and pure water flux of mn ccms listed in table s7 no significant differences were found which further indicated the stability of mn ccms these results evidenced that the synthesis scheme was robust in providing a stable performance of mn ccms ppcps in the aquatic environment provide extensive precursors for the formation of c dbps and n dbps which raised health concerns in drinking water systems hua et al 2019 li et al 2020 the efficacy of mn ccms pms has been checked for the reduction of different dbps formation potential dbpfp in srnom and rw and results were presented in fig 8b the initial dbpfp of srnom and rw were presented in table s9 as shown in table s9 under the same initial concentration of ppcps the initial dbpfp values for srnom and rw were different which indicated that the dbpfp was greatly influenced by water matrices a substantial reduction in dbpfp has been noted after being treated by the mn ccms pms system similar removal sequences of dbpfp have been recorded in both matrices i e ndma 90 chcl3 60 dcaa 50 tcaa 45 and chcl2br 98 ndma 90 chcl3 80 dcaa 40 tcaa 25 in srnom and rw respectively however chcl2br was non detectable in srnom solution the above results have proved a substantial potential for the mn ccms pms system to control the dbpfp by ppcps mixture and other organics in different natural water matrices the extent of mineralization in the different matrices was also compared and presented in fig s8 the mn ccms pms has shown better toc removal in rw containing ppcps than srnom with ppcps the maximum toc removals for srnom solution and rw were 28 and 65 respectively removals of ppcps and toc would be reasons for the elimination of dbpfp by the mn ccms pms system overall these results have shown extraordinary stability of mn ccms for the activation of pms with advantages of effective removal of ppcps in different water matrices noticeable reduction in dbpfp and stability composite with fewer leaching of mn meanwhile instead of using pure manganese oxide for membrane layer as reported in previous studies in this research the membrane layer only contained 2 0 wt of manganese oxide aluminum oxide 98 0 wt which just brought a marginal increase in membrane cost 5 compared with the commercial aluminum oxide ceramic membrane which demonstrated good economic viability for practical application 4 conclusions manganese based catalytic ceramic membrane was prepared for the activation of pms the mn ccms pms system has shown equal suitability for the degradation of ppcps in upw srnom solution and rw presenting uniform effectivity of the systems and above 90 removal of ppcps was achieved in 10 min in all water matrices as for the degradation of eleven ppcps the contribution was in the order of catalytic 54 7 noncatalytic 42 3 adsorption 3 0 the degradation of ran tia amo tc and otc mainly caused by noncatalytic oxidation nonradical pathways through 1o2 were the main degradation route for ppcps confirmed by β carotene and triplet signal by temp the ov played an important role for the generation of 1o2 repeatability experiments have proved extraordinary stability of the mn ccms pms system for degradation of ppcps with fewer reductions less than 3 after six filtration cycles a significant reduction of precursors of c and n dbps also made mn ccms pms attractive from the public health perspective slight leaching of mn in permeate confirmed the robustness of the synthesis scheme

products singlet oxygen simulated drinking water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps have been reported in surface water systems all over the world and several have been included in the priority lists by european union eu and the united states environmental protection agency usepa ebele et al 2017 kim and homan 2020 for instance a study from south korea has shown 16 different ppcps in various rivers drinking water and effluent kim et al 2007 sadutto et al 2021 reported 32 ppcps in mediterranean coastal wetlands which were associated with different anthropogenic and spatial factors ppcps have also been found in the surface water systems of china and their abundance has been reported in the source water table s1 chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2021b and tap water in different regions of china table s2 jiang et al 2019b liu et al 2019 currently in china it is of great concern to mitigate the ppcps in drinking water and to ensure the safe delivery of tap water to consumers jiang et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2019 multiple homogeneous peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been used for the elimination of ppcps e g sulfamethoxazole by fe2 pms wang et al 2020a atenolol by uv pms liu et al 2013 benzophenone 4 by microwave pms wang et al 2021 amoxicillin by co3o4 pms guo et al 2013 and carbamazepine by comgfe ldo pms hong et al 2020 compared with homogeneous catalysis such as pms activated by fe2 and the activation of pms by energy such as uv and microwave heterogeneous activation of pms by metal oxides and composites are relatively energy free and independent of ph hu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 however problems of catalyst recovery recycling agglomeration and metal leaching are still of important concerns catalytic ceramic membranes ccms fabricated with metal based catalysts for the activation of pms have shown effectiveness in the elimination of ppcps co3o4 based ccms synthesized by the wet impregnation method have shown fast kinetics for activating pms and degradation of sulfamethoxazole bao et al 2019 wang et al 2019c has synthesized hollow fiber cuo based ccms and used them as activators for pms for the degradation of bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole fan et al 2020 prepared a cofe2o4 decorated flat sheet ccms via a hydrothermal method which could effectively activate pms for the degradation of ofloxacin therefore the ccms pms system would be a promising system for removing ppcps radical oxidation e g hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and superoxide anion radical o2 and nonradical oxidation singlet oxygen 1o2 are commonly proved as the main mechanisms for the degradation of organics in the ccms pms system ding et al 2020 kohantorabi et al 2021 the fabrication of ceramic membranes with metal based catalysts can solve the problems of catalyst recovery and recycling as well as agglomeration however toxic metals such as co cu and ce have been found to be an impediment in the widespread of such ccms pms systems bao et al 2019 fan et al 2020 lee et al 2022 much more effort is required to use environmentally friendly material with sufficient catalytic performance and synthesize ccms with long term stability and durability meanwhile it would be more meaningful to study the ppcps mixture with trace concentrations in real water matrices instead of only selecting one model ppcps with a high concentration far from the actual situation in this study mn2o3 based flat sheet ccms mn ccms

5 h in a ball milling bowl and refined under vacuum conditions then the composites were transferred to an automatic sieve shaker and aged for 48 h the flat sheet al2o3 ceramic support was made by

three types of matrices i e i ultrapure water upw ii river water rw and iii suwanee river natural organic matter srnom solution as simulated drinking water the simulated drinking water was prepared by spiking srnom into upw to achieve the total organic carbon toc to be 2 mg c l the basic quality parameters of rw were presented in table s4 the mn ccms pms system was operated as a submerged dead end one way filtration mode as shown in fig s1 the effluent was not circulated to the membrane cell the concentration of influent ppcps the flow rate of the influent and the hydraulic residence time of the system were 500 µg l 60 lmh and 1 5 min respectively the pms solution was added by a peristaltic pump the transmembrane pressure tmp of the filtration system was automatically measured by a pressure gage and recorded by a digital recorder the contribution of noncatalytic oxidation by pms was calculated as follows noncatalytic total degradation catalytic adsorption where the contribution of catalytic for each ppcps mixture was quantified by the quenching experiments the role of adsorption was estimated through backwashing the mn ccms with twice the revolution speed of the peristaltic pump at fixed time intervals 1 ml effluent was taken and filtered with 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe syringe filters then immediately quenched by 50 μl na2s2o3 0 1 mol l solution after each

spe by using spe cartridge waters oasis hlb usa was performed before measurement wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mn ccms the characteristics of contact angles porosities and pure water fluxes on cms vs mn ccms are presented in table s7 compared to cms 21 8 1 6 the contact angles of mn ccms were increased from 19 5 1 5 1 0 wt mn2o3 to 45 1 1 2 4 0 wt mn2o3 however the porosities and pure water fluxes were decreased from 28 6 0 33 and 32 20 0 37 lmh kpa 1 0 wt mn2o3 to 20 3 0 62 and 14 85 0 31 lmh kpa 4 0 wt mn2o3 respectively while increasing mn2o3 loadings for mn ccms the increase in contact angles and the decrease in porosities would cause a decrease in the pure water flux the actual picture of the synthesized ceramic membranes are shown in fig 1 a with the increase of manganese content the color of ceramic membranes became darker the surface morphologies and cross sectional views of the cm and mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings are presented in fig 1b the average thickness of the membrane layer for cm and mn ccms were around 120 10 µm and 145 15 µm respectively for surface morphologies of mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings mn ccms with 1 0 wt and 4 0 wt of mn2o3 presented in the form of block while for cms and 2 0 wt of mn2o3 presented in the form of particles the uniform elemental distributions of al o si and mn were found on the surface of mn ccms as shown in fig 1c fig 1d shows the crystalline structures of cms and mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings by xrd patterns as for cms the strong characteristic diffraction peaks centered at 2θ values of 25 6 012 35 2 104 43 4 113 52 5 024 and 57 5 116 were well indexed as hexagonal al2o3 jcpdf 46 1212 as for different loadings of mn ccms only the al2o3 crystalline phase was found while no obvious diffraction peak of mn2o3 was observed reasons for this phenomenon might be that the relative loadings of mn2o3 are low in our study and with a high dispersion degree wu et al 2019a meanwhile after calcinated at 1250 which is higher than the melting point of mn2o3 mn2o3 was presented in an amorphous form wu et al 2019b the amorphous form of mn2o3 in the mn ccms with a higher surface area and more active sites would finally benefit the activation ability for pms guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2007 the oxidation states of different elements measured by xps for mn ccms and cms are presented in fig 2 the spectrum of al 2p could be ascribed to al o al representing that al2o3 mainly covered the surface of cms both sub peaks of al o al and al o mn were found in mn ccms which can greatly alleviate the aggregation of mn2o3 and the leaching of mn during catalytic membrane filtration according to previous research bao et al 2019 the distribution of lattice oxygen species ol and hydroxyl species oh for cms and mn ccms was 41 6 and 58 4 vs 62 2 and 37 8 respectively the obvious increase in ol in mn ccms was ascribed to the contribution of oxides from mn2o3 the high resolution of mn 2p peaks for mn ccms have shown in fig 2c the binding energy values of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 were 652 04 ev and 640 41 ev respectively with a spin orbit splitting value of 11 6 ev which was in line with previous researches about mn2o3 salavati niasari et al 2009 zhou et al 2021 mn3 640 4 ev and mn4 644 2 ev were the two main mn valences in mn ccms with a distribution of 85 2 and 14 8 respectively mn 2p was found in xps survey spectrum in mn ccms in fig 2f which further demonstrated the successful loading of mn2o3 3 2 effects of mn2o3 loading pms dosage and ph the performance of mn ccms with different mn2o3 loadings dosages of pms and ph values toward the degradation of ppcps mixture in simulated drinking water is presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a when the loading of mn2o3 increased from 1 0 wt to 2 0 wt the activation performance for pms by mn ccms was increased noticeably otc apap ofl tc amo ran and tia were almost fully degraded by 2 0 wt mn2o3 however a further increase in mn2o3 4 0 wt caused a slight reduction in removal performance than that of 2 0 wt it could attribute to the lower porosity and smaller bet of mn ccms which could cause less availability of active sites therefore 2 0 wt of mn2o3 was chosen as the optimal loading for mn ccms seven ppcps otc ofl tc amo ran cip and tia have shown similar removals at dosages of pms from 0 1 to 0 3 mm and presenting 0 1 mm as a satisfactory dose for their removal fig 3b however the impacts of pms dosages were significant for four ppcps i e apap trim ate and nap with the highest differences in removals of around 83 87 94 and 87 for 0 01 mm and 0 3 mm pms respectively meanwhile while increasing pms concentrations from 0 01 mm to 0 3 mm the net increase in tmp was 1 69 kpa to 0 12 kpa respectively thus in order to obtain the best removal efficiencies for the eleven ppcps mixture and the least membrane fouling 0 3 mm pms was chosen as the final dosage the mn ccms pms system showed satisfactory removals for ppcps mixture under the ph of 4 05 9 15 fig 3c while further increased ph to 11 0 the decrease in the degradation of ofl trim ate and nap was more than 60 thus in this study we didn t adjust the initial ph 6 29 0 02 while performing the experiments 3 3 performance of mn ccms pms for the degradation of ppcps the performance of mn ccms pms for the degradation of ppcps mixture was tested in three different water matrices including upw srnom solution and rw results are presented in fig 4 the mn ccms pms system regardless of water matrix has shown extraordinary removal with a total reduction of ppcps above 80 in merely 2 min and around 90 after 10 min of filtration the insignificant difference p 0 05 anova in a total reduction of ppcps up to 93 90 and 89 in upw srnom solution and rw respectively showed the versatility of the mn ccms pms system toward the degradation of ppcps in order to mimic the real situation of ppcps the effectiveness of the mn ccms pms system has also been tested at trace level of ppcps mixture 200 ng l and results were compared with those of higher concentration 500 µg l the mn ccms pms system has successfully fully removed the ppcps at trace level except for the ate 73 and nap 95 these results inferred that the mn ccms pms system could be applied to emergency control both with a higher concentration and practical concentration of ppcps in drinking water meanwhile the activated sludge respiration inhibition test showed that the toxicity of ppcps mixture was reduced by 85 9 after being treated by the mn ccms pms system fig s3 this study is novel in discussing the degradation performance of trace concentration of ppcps mixture which is more realistic in practical water matrix as shown in fig 4c and 4d the mn ccms pms showed a significant difference in the performance from that of cms pms p 0 05 anova in pristine cms pms system the maximum total reduction in ppcps was less than 60 compared to 93 in mn ccms pms four of the ppcps i e apap trim ate and nap have shown higher differences in performances between the cms pms vs mn ccms pms with the removals of 12 vs 100 10 0 vs 62 16 vs 64 and 32 vs 94 respectively both of the two systems showed excellent removal efficiencies for otc tia ran and amo removals of each ppcps in both mn ccms pms and cms pms systems in different water matrices were presented in fig s4 as for the mn ccms pms system the degradation sequence of ppcps mixture was uniform in the order of ran tia amootcofl tc cip apap nap ate trim for the three water matrices compared to previous studies on the degradation of single compound bao et al 2019 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wu et al 2019b this study is novel in providing breakthrough results for the extension of ccms pms toward real applications and simultaneous degradation of ppcps mixture with trace concentrations in different water matrices 3 4 roles of catalytic and noncatalytic oxidation for the removal of ppcps in order to further understand the removal mechanism for different ppcps by the mn ccms pms system the degradation contributions of the ppcps were divided into three categories i catalytic by mn ccms pms ii noncatalytic by pms oxidation and iii adsorption by mn ccms the mass balance of ppcps presented in fig 5 showed the various phenomena for the degradation of ppcps mixture five ppcps ran tia amo tc and otc have been found with above 50 degradation by noncatalytic oxidation the main reason is that pms has a greater ability to remove ppcps containing tertiary aliphatic amine functional groups compared to those with primary or secondary aliphatic amines yang et al 2018b zhou et al 2018 mechanisms for this phenomenon is that the oxygen addition reactions are started by the transfer of oxygen from oo bond of pms to ppcps followed by electrophilic reaction between pms and ppcps finally ppcps are degraded through hydration reaction formation of nitrogen oxides and dealkylation zhou et al 2018 etc adsorption has played a very limited role in removing ppcps and the total removal was amounted to be 3 1 the highest reduction through adsorption has been recorded for cip 10 as shown in fig 5 catalytic oxidation plays an important role for the degradation of ofl 92 1 nap 91 7 trim 85 8 ate 81 2 apap 78 5 and cip 76 7 the functional groups of piperazinyl oxazinyl and carboxyl of ofl are the main active sites that can be easily attacked by 1o2 gao et al 2019 it was reported that nap was firstly attacked by o2 to form carbon centered radical followed by the cleavage of carboxyl and further oxidized by 1o2 and o2 fayyaz et al 2021 wang et al 2018 luo et al 2012 showed that 1o2 reacted with 2 4 diaminoprimidine portion of trim through a 2 2 cycloaddition forming a zwitterionic intermediate after which a 1 3 benzyl shift and rearrangement happened by bond scission to form two stable products the aniline ring of apap can be directly oxidized by 1o2 through hydroxylation and ring opening and the cn bond cleavage of apap led to the decomposition of apap cai et al 2022 the degradation mechanism for cip by 1o2 included the oxidation of the piperazine the defluorination and hydroxylation on the pyridine ring or benzo ring as well as the decarbonylation and decarboxylation chen et al 2022c meanwhile based on the previous researches we also found that 1o2 played a major role in the degradation of ofl chen et al 2022d cip yu et al 2020b nap bai et al 2020 apap fan et al 2019b ate cui et al 2021 for the pms based advanced oxidation processes which further demonstrated the accurate results of this research based on the above results the following sequence of preferential mechanisms for removing ppcps was recorded as catalytic 54 7 noncatalytic 42 3 adsorption 3 0 this study provided insights into different phenomena involved in the removal of ppcps in the mn ccms pms systems suggesting that the necessity of mn ccms and optimization of performance should be based on the category of ppcps available in the water environment for example in practical engineering applications for organics containing primary or secondary or tertiary aliphatic amine functional groups or with enough electron rich moieties noncatalytic oxidation by pms alone can be considered as a priority for water purification instead of using the catalytic system of mn ccms pms 3 5 possible mechanism in the mn ccms pms system the dominant ros for the degradation of different ppcps in srnom solution were determined through quenching experiments and epr results were presented in fig 6 meoh is used to quench so4 and oh zhu et al 2017 and tba is used to scavenge oh saputra et al 2014 the addition of meoh 200 mm and tba 200 mm has not shown any substantial changes in ppcps mixture removal indicating the absence of so4 and oh although liu et al 2021 showed that meoh and tba could accelerate the pms decomposition 25 ph 5 and 20 ph 7 the remaining concentration of pms is still sufficient enough for the degradation of ppcps according to the results shown in fig 3b which further demonstrated the accuracy of the quenching experiment afterward the contribution of the 1o2 for the degradation of ppcps was quenched by β carotene 0 05 0 2 mm with reaction rate constant of k 1o2 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 yu et al 2020a in the presence of β carotene the performance of mn ccms pms was greatly decreased which confirmed the extensive existence of 1o2 in the mn ccms pms system however β carotene showed no obvious quenching effects on the degradation of ran and tia which indicated that both of them were removed by pms oxidation lastly the role of o2 and ros adsorped by mn ccms were confirmed by p bq 1 mm jawad et al 2014 and ki 0 5 mm hu et al 2018 for the removal of ppcps respectively as shown in fig 6c and 6d both p bq and ki showed a few influences on the degradation of trim ate and nap since no obvious so4 and oh were found in this system the adsorbed ros was mainly related to o2 which acted as a precursor of 1o2 the dominant ros in mn ccms pms has also been verified by epr spectroscopy meanwhile differences in ros generation with or without water matrix conditions have also been compared and presented in fig 6e and fig s5 firstly dmpo as a spinning trapping agent was tried in upw and srnom solution neither dmpo so4 nor dmpo oh adducts were recorded for the mn ccms pms system these results validated the findings of the above quenching experiments showing the unnoticeable role of so4 and oh for the degradation of ppcps on the other hand temp as a spin trapping agent has provided an intense triplet signal 1 1 1 of temp 1o2 adduct in both upw and srnom solution and the self dissociation of pms has also shown a very weak triple signal of temp 1o2 adduct the intensities of triplet signals of temp 1o2 adduct for different loadings of mn2o3 in the mn ccms pms systems were found following their potential to activate pms for the degradation of ppcps fig 3a the highest intense triplet signal was recorded in 2 0 wt mn2o3 mn ccms pms system followed by 4 0 wt mn2o3 and 1 0 wt mn2o3 it was reported that oxygen vacancies ov the defect sites on the surface of metal oxides played an important role in the generation of 1o2 bu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a as shown in f abundant ov was found in different loadings of mn ccms with the relative intensities of ov in the order of 2 0 wt 4 0 wt 1 0 wt which was also in accordance with results showed in fig 3 ov serving as the active sites was in favor of interfacial electron transfer for the redox of mn3 mn4 and could adsorb pms through electron deprivation resulting in accelerating the generation of 1o2 li et al 2019 lu et al 2018 for further understanding the activation mechanism of pms by mn ccms the chemical states of mn ccms before and after reaction were studied by xps as shown in fig 2 and fig s6 the distribution of mn3 vs mn4 before and after reaction changed from 85 2 vs 14 8 to 75 6 vs 24 4 which manifested the redox processes between mn3 and mn4 during the reaction meanwhile the ratio of ol oh changed from 1 64 to 0 19 before and after oxidation reaction showing the participation of both ol and oh in the reaction the decrease of ol also indicated the formation of ov which would further be changed into active oxygen o and react with pms to generate 1o2 liu et al 2018 and the formation of ov can also activate oh to produce 1o2 tan et al 2017 based on the above results the possible mechanism in the mn ccms pms system for the degradation of ppcps mixture was proposed as shown in fig 7 firstly mn ⅲ can combine with pms to generate o2 which would be the precursor of 1o2 eqs 1 3 fan et al 2019a yang et al 2018a while mn ⅳ can react with pms to form so5 eq 4 and 1o2 can also be generated by the reaction of so5 in the solution via eq 5 wang et al 2019b the transformation of ol to ov would accelerate the redox couple of mn3 mn4 in the crystal lattice and resulting in the generation of active oxygen o which would generate 1o2 by react with pms eqs 6 7 chen et al 2020 meanwhile the oxygen formed from the decomposition of h2o2 would obtain electron from ov to form o2 eqs 8 9 which would generate 1o2 via eqs 2 3 finally 1o2 can also be generated by the self decomposition of

system was tested on the optimized conditions and results were presented in fig 8 six matching removals were recorded for the mn ccms pms system representing the stability in the performance of mn ccms for the activation of pms and degradation of ppcps mixture after the six cycles of repetition the total change in ppcps removal was less than 3 the distribution of ppcps remaining was also found similar after each filtration p 0 05 anova showing the uniform treatability and degradation potential meanwhile during the six repeatability experiments the mn leaching was found in a range from 1 9 to 3 6 µg l table s8 which was recorded to be fewer compared with previous reported ccms such as 2 8 mg l mn wu et al 2019b 0 17 mg l cu luo et al 2018 0 14 mg l co fan et al 2020 and 0 45 mg l co wang et al 2020b meanwhile based on the sem images shown in fig s7 and changes in bet porosity contact angle and pure water flux of mn ccms listed in table s7 no significant differences were found which further indicated the stability of mn ccms these results evidenced that the synthesis scheme was robust in providing a stable performance of mn ccms ppcps in the aquatic environment provide extensive precursors for the formation of c dbps and n dbps which raised health concerns in drinking water systems hua et al 2019 li et al 2020 the efficacy of mn ccms pms has been checked for the reduction of different dbps formation potential dbpfp in srnom and rw and results were presented in fig 8b the initial dbpfp of srnom and rw were presented in table s9 as shown in table s9 under the same initial concentration of ppcps the initial dbpfp values for srnom and rw were different which indicated that the dbpfp was greatly influenced by water matrices a substantial reduction in dbpfp has been noted after being treated by the mn ccms pms system similar removal sequences of dbpfp have been recorded in both matrices i e ndma 90 chcl3 60 dcaa 50 tcaa 45 and chcl2br 98 ndma 90 chcl3 80 dcaa 40 tcaa 25 in srnom and rw respectively however chcl2br was non detectable in srnom solution the above results have proved a substantial potential for the mn ccms pms system to control the dbpfp by ppcps mixture and other organics in different natural water matrices the extent of mineralization in the different matrices was also compared and presented in fig s8 the mn ccms pms has shown better toc removal in rw containing ppcps than srnom with ppcps the maximum toc removals for srnom solution and rw were 28 and 65 respectively removals of ppcps and toc would be reasons for the elimination of dbpfp by the mn ccms pms system overall these results have shown extraordinary stability of mn ccms for the activation of pms with advantages of effective removal of ppcps in different water matrices noticeable reduction in dbpfp and stability composite with fewer leaching of mn meanwhile instead of using pure manganese oxide for membrane layer as reported in previous studies in this research the membrane layer only contained 2 0 wt of manganese oxide aluminum oxide 98 0 wt which just brought a marginal increase in membrane cost 5 compared with the commercial aluminum oxide ceramic membrane which demonstrated good economic viability for practical application 4 conclusions manganese based catalytic ceramic membrane was prepared for the activation of pms the mn ccms pms system has shown equal suitability for the degradation of ppcps in upw srnom solution and rw presenting uniform effectivity of the systems and above 90 removal of ppcps was achieved in 10 min in all water matrices as for the degradation of eleven ppcps the contribution was in the order of catalytic 54 7 noncatalytic 42 3 adsorption 3 0 the degradation of ran tia amo tc and otc mainly caused by noncatalytic oxidation nonradical pathways through 1o2 were the main degradation route for ppcps confirmed by β carotene and triplet signal by temp the ov played an important role for the generation of 1o2 repeatability experiments have proved extraordinary stability of the mn ccms pms system for degradation of ppcps with fewer reductions less than 3 after six filtration cycles a significant reduction of precursors of c and n dbps also made mn ccms pms attractive from the public health perspective slight leaching of mn in permeate confirmed the robustness of the synthesis scheme

15221,nitrite no2 production in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems cdwdss is among the first bulk water indicators of a nitrification event and is typically quantified using ion

oxidation wahman and speitel 2012 it may also be present at fluctuating concentrations from agricultural runoff into source waters stets et al 2020 limiting its usability as a nitrification indicator

2017 based on the review of the literature summarized in table 1 there are two primary concerns hindering the adoption of no2 cms for nitrification detection in cdwdss 1 accuracy at low no2 concentrations needed to detect ba ox in its early stages and 2 generalizability among different source waters due to differences in uv spectra of natural organic matter nom in their study of wastewater containing no2 between 0 1 3 1 mg l 1 n rieger et al 2004 determined a 95 prediction interval of 0 14 mg l 1 n for a cm formulated using uva230 240 this implies a predicted no2 concentration of 0 15 mg l 1 n or greater would be needed to produce a 95 prediction interval that does not include zero and conclude ba ox has occurred in comparison typical trigger levels for no2 are 0 01 0 05 mg l 1 n to indicate ba ox in cdwdss awwa 2013 more generally the no2 method detection limit mdl can be calculated using established procedures usepa 2016 but mdls have not been reported for any of the uva based cms in table 1 in terms of generalizability the significant independent variables sivs in no2 uva cms are the selected uva wavelengths however these are typically not reported nor are the corresponding coefficients preventing assessment of the cms for quantifying no2 in other source waters additionally in the no2 cm developed by wang et al 2021 the influence of dissolved organic carbon doc was mitigated using empirical correction factors indicating the cm was sensitive to nom and thus could be source water specific uva first uva and second uva derivatives may help overcome issues of cm accuracy and generalizability an increase in uva derivative degree can reveal meaningful spectral features or remove unwanted ones allowing characterization of analytes beyond direct measurement with the uva spectra thomas and burgess 2017 uva and uva can resolve overlapping peaks in the uva spectra by differentiating adjacent features and revealing peaks that are otherwise obscured ojeda and rojas 2013 uva 215 217 is zero for no3 bolzan et al 1999 and therefore allows for no2 quantification in waters with varying no3 wang et al 2019 used uva 217 to quantify no2 in river water at 0 1 1 4 mg l 1 n table 1 in the presence of no3 however the influence of other constituents typical in cdwdss on the uva spectra is unknown these species include 1 nom for which doc is a common surrogate rosario ortiz et al 2007 2 inorganics such as bromide br monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 free ammonia species ammonium ion nh4 and ammonia nh3 and dissolved inorganic carbon species carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate ion hco3 and carbonate ion co3 2 and 3 disinfection byproducts such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma that despite being present at low ng l 1 levels in cdwdss can co occur with no2 zeng and mitch 2016 and have relatively large ɛ spectra plumlee and reinhard 2007 variations in these constituents may impact the accuracy of uva and uva based cms and or hinder their generalizability cms for no3 and the sum of no2 and no3 are discussed in s1 2 of the sm see also tables s1 and s2 table 1 shows no2 cms have also been formulated using ɛ uva200 300 with no2 no3 and cl in seawater wang et al 2021 and ɛ uva 260 380 with no2 no3 and h2o2 in a plasma liquid solution he et al 2017 however the ɛ uva200 300 cm had a lower r2 0 71 compared to that using uva r2 0 99 despite having about four times as many sivs 100 vs 26 the ɛ uva 260 380 cm was calibrated with no2 between 7 140 mg l 1 n in a nom free water a concentration range and background matrix atypical from those in cdwdss where no2 1 mg l 1 n and doc is 1 5 mg l 1 c awwa 2013 while low level no2 quantification using ɛ uva cms is unproven these fundamentally based models should be equivalent to uva cms which are based on gross measures provided the ɛ spectra of all the contributing species are accounted for or eliminated with spectral derivatives to this end nom has not been previously considered in these ɛ uva cms and is likely source water specific at least in its zeroth derivative the objective of this study was to develop and compare no2 cms formulated using fundamental i e ɛ n uva n where n is the derivative order and gross measure i e uva n approaches for identifying ba ox in its early stages i e no2 at 0 01 1 mg l 1 n under typical cdwds conditions the ɛ n uva n cm was developed to be generalizable and insensitive to nom and other common species in cdwdss adjusted r2 adj r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to optimize model parameter selection which were wavelengths for the ɛ n uva n cm and wavelengths coefficients and a constant for the uva n cm first uva spectra were obtained in synthetic waters from 200 to 400 nm for various concentrations of no2 no3 nh2cl free ammonia species br cl and dissolved inorganic carbon species along with three nom types to determine their respective ɛ spectra additionally ɛ spectra for nhcl2 and ndma were acquired from the literature li and blatchley 2009 plumlee and reinhard 2007 yin et al 2020 the zeroth first and second derivatives of the uva and ɛ spectra were used to guide formulation of the no2 cms to mitigate potential nom interferences thus enhancing their generalizability among different source waters thirteen laboratory scale biofilm annular reactor bar tests were completed with four feedwaters two from fayetteville arkansas usa fay1 and fay2 and two from dallas texas usa dal1 and dal2 each bar test consisted of a period of biological stability followed by a purposeful decrease in nh2cl and increase in free ammonia species to stimulate growth of nitrifying bacteria and in turn ba ox to no2 uva spectra were measured daily along with no2 and no3 by ion chromatography ic no2 ɛ n uva n and uva n cms were developed by calibrating cms with fay1 data and validating cms against fay2 dal1 and dal2 data a series of no2 challenge samples that spanned a continuum of relevant water chemistries and field

species were measured using hach method 10200 at 655 nm on a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu while hach method 8167 lists 530 nm as the target collection wavelength 552 nm was used here based on previous work that showed a wider linear range compared to 530 nm granderson et al 2013 standard curves for total chlorine nh2cl and free ammonia species were between 0 02 5 0 mg l 1 cl2 0 045 4 5 mg l 1 cl2 and 0 02 0 5 mg l 1 n respectively each standard curve consisted of at least five points and had r2 values greater than 0 99 anions were measured using a metrohm 850 ic with conductivity and uv detectors the target analytes included no2 no3 cl and br for which seven point standard curves were collected between 0 01 5 0 mg l 1 and had r2 values greater than 0 99 the no2 and no3 concentrations measured by ic are referred to herein as ic no2 and ic no3 respectively and reported in units of mg l 1 n the ic was run twice weekly during the bar tests and as such the sample hold times ranged from a few hours up to about three days during this period samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and were not acidified to minimize no2 oxidation to no3 wahman and speitel 2012 control tests completed under conditions like the bar tests indicated no significant no2 oxidation to no3 during the storage time in the presence of doc as shown in table s3 and detailed in the sm s2 1 uva spectra were measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu 2450 from 600 nm down to 200 nm in 1 nm increments in quartz cuvettes with 5 0 or 1 0 cm pathlengths uva spectra were blanked with

individually for each target analyte in 4 mm nahco3 buffer sm s2 4 and table s5 which was blank subtracted such that the resultant standard curves represented the target analyte only a range of 0 0045 0 65 absorbance units was used for the ɛ calculations equation 2 was used in cases where three or more standard concentrations fell within this range otherwise equation 1 was used derivative

equations to solve for each ck by selecting n distinct wavelengths that minimized the rmse between the simulated and measured no2 concentrations the chemicals and derivative order n were selected based on ɛ and uva spectra presented in section 3 1 and sm s3 3 respectively given the variability between successive derivatives linked to the electronic noise of spectrophotometers a smoothing procedure was used the savitsky golay method savitzky and golay 1964 was used to simultaneously smooth the spectra and calculate the uva and ɛ derivatives with the objective of enhancing their signal to noise ratio causse et al 2017 kus et al 1996 the target analyte concentrations were determined by minimizing the rmse for all odd numbers of smoothing points nsp between 5 25 i e between 2 12 nm on either side of a given wavelength to determine the n distinct wavelengths for equation 3 the rmse was minimized between the simulated and measured no2 concentrations of the fay1 samples like procedures used by others etheridge et al 2014 wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 the freeware program r crawley 2007 was used to calculate the rmse for all possible wavelength combinations between the ranges shown in table s6 of sm s2 5 the boundaries of which varied with nsp the linear system of equations was inputted to the r function solve as a matrix the resultant n wavelengths and nsp combination that produced a minimum rmse for fay1 was validated against the other bar feedwaters and the no2 challenge and field samples the sm s2 6 details the methods used to formulate the multivariate nth derivative uva n cms that were compared to the ɛ n uva n cms to assess the potential impacts of nhcl2 and ndma on the no2 cm ɛ of these species were discretized from literature published spectra using webplotdigitizer 4 6 ɛ for nhcl2 was digitized by combining the spectra reported by blatchley and colleagues which included li and blatchley 2009 from 200 229 nm and yin et al 2020 from 230 350 nm ɛ for ndma was digitized from plumlee and reinhard 2007 between 200 380 nm spectral derivatives for nhcl2 and ndma were calculated as described previously in this subsection 2 5 no2 cm validation and mdl determinations the no2 cms were evaluated against a series of challenge and field samples as part of the model validation sixty challenge samples were formulated using twelve background waters each spiked at five no2 concentrations 0 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 mg l 1 n the background waters were dosed with nom in 1 mm bicarbonate buffer ph 8 0 amended with br at 0 80 mg l 1 br and no3 at 0 25 mg l 1 n the three nom types o nom s nom and m nom were added at doc concentrations of 1 0 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c seven uva spectra measurements were collected for no2 at 0 mg l 1 n to determine the mdl based on method blanks mdlb and 0 05 and 0 10 mg l 1 n to determine the mdl based on spiked samples mdls the greater of the mdlb or mdls was selected as the mdl for each cm usepa 2016 triplicate uva spectra measurements were collected for the greater no2 concentrations 0 20 and 0 30 mg l 1 n and because these concentrations were greater than ten times the estimated mdl they were only used for cm validation field samples were collected from two cdwdss experiencing nitrification one in colorado and the other in oklahoma and referred to herein as cdwdss a and b respectively samples were collected from three locations in each system targeting water ages corresponding to short average and long residence times for cdwds a the estimated hydraulic residence times were 1 7 and 21 days for cdwds b these times were 0 5 1 and 2 days no2 was spiked to each of these six field samples at five levels 0 i e background 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 mg l 1 n and quantified by ic to compare to the cm as part of the model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 ɛ and ɛ spectra of cdwds relevant species fig 1 a shows the ɛ spectra of seven inorganics i e nh2cl nhcl2 no2 no3 br hco3 and co3 2 ndma and three noms i e o nom s nom and m nom with ɛ between 1 10 000 l mol 1 cm 1 from 200 400 nm inorganics nh4 nh3 and cl with ɛ between 0 001 1 l mol 1 cm 1 appeared as spectra noise and thus were not shown no2 no3 br and ndma had the greatest ɛ values between 200 230 nm and the three noms had relatively large ɛ values between 260 400 nm nh2cl and nhcl2 had ɛ peak maxima at 244 nm and 294 nm respectively which were nearly identical to that reported by others margerum et al 1994 valentine et al 1986 no2 and no3 had local ɛ peak maxima at 354 and 302 nm respectively which are peaks that have been used for quantification in nom free waters margerum et al 1994 the three nom ɛ values were greater than that of no2 and no3 between about 250 400 nm and differed from one another the ɛ spectra in fig 1a indicated that no2 and no3 have relatively large ɛ values between 200 230 nm but the differences in the nom spectra could produce source water specific interferences that may be relevant in cdwdss a similar issue was observed with the ɛ spectra fig s1 inset although the magnitudes of the nom spectra were smaller compared to those of no2 and no3 indicating wavelength based derivatives could help mitigate nom influence i e source water dependence fig 1b shows the ɛ spectra of the seven inorganics ndma and three nom types between 210 390 nm br had the greatest ɛ peak maxima 55 1 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 211 nm followed by no3 31 0 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 226 nm ndma 34 3 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 228 nm and no2 12 1 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 232 nm wavelengths at which the ɛ spectra crossed zero occurred at 224 nm for no2 and 217 nm for no3 in agreement with others bolzan et al 1999 causse et al 2017 crumpton et al 1992 eckford and fedorak 2002 ferree and shannon 2001 pons et al 2017 suzuki and kuroda 1987 wang et al 2019 ɛ spectra of the dissolved inorganic carbon species were circa zero the fig 1b inset shows the three nom ɛ spectra had a maximum magnitude of about 0 2 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 240 nm and were like one another this result suggests no2 quantification by ɛ spectra should not be heavily influenced by nom i e source water independent the ɛ spectra for nh2cl varied from 1 4 to 1 3 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 between 210 300 nm and is present in cdwdss at concentrations up to 4 mg l 1 cl2 awwa 2013 while the ɛ of nhcl2 was similar in magnitude fig 1b it is typically present at low concentrations relative to nh2cl similarly ndma forms at low ng l 1 levels in cdwdss zeng and mitch 2016 which is about six orders of magnitude less than the inorganic nitrogen species therefore despite having ɛ peaks similar in magnitude to no2 and no3 it is unlikely ndma would impact no2 quantification using ɛ spectra based on the ɛ spectra in fig 1b and typical concentrations in cdwdss a ɛ uva model for no2 quantification would need to include no2 no3 br and nh2cl minimal impacts on ɛ uva model accuracy should be incurred by excluding species that 1 form at low concentrations in cdwdss such as ndma and nhcl2 or 2 have low ɛ spectra such as nom and dissolved inorganic carbon species or too low of ɛ spectra to meaningfully determine ɛ such as free ammonia species and cl 3 2 ɛ uva cm development and validation the ɛ uva cm calibration and validation used the bar effluent the chemistry of which is detailed in the sm s3 2 tables s7 and s8 the cm was calibrated with the fay1 feedwater uva sm s3 3 fig s2f and the ɛ spectra of no2 no3 br and nh2cl fig 1b λ1 λ4 represented the sivs in the ɛ uva cm and were selected to minimize the rmse between the ɛ uva cm simulated no2 concentrations and fay1 ic no2 data table s7 n 275 λ1 λ4 were 213 225 229 and 253 nm respectively and table s9 in sm s3 4 lists the corresponding ɛ of no2 no3 br and nh2cl fig s3 in sm s3 5 shows the rmse of the ɛ uva cm decreased as nsp increased from 5 to 13 with a minimum for 21 i e yellow shaded box in fig s3 the nsp was not provided for the no2 cms listed in table 1 preventing comparisons to previously developed models for the optimized nsp of 21 fig 2 a shows the linear correlation between ɛ uva simulated no2 concentrations ɛ uva no2 and ic no2 was strong adj r2 0 992 n 275 as shown in fig 1b λ1 213 nm is near the minimum ɛ for no2 and maximum ɛ for br λ2 225 nm is near a zero ɛ for no2 and maximum ɛ for no3 at λ3 229 nm ɛ for no3 and no2 are relatively large and that for br is near zero lastly at λ4 253 nm ɛ for all four target species are circa zero fig 2b shows the rmse of the fay1 residuals was 0 033 mg l 1 n and the average residual was 0 005 mg l 1 n indicating a slight negative bias fig 2c shows that the ɛ uva cm applied to out of sample bar test data dal1 dal2 and fay2 had a strong correlation adj r2 0 987 n 376 the insets in fig 2c show the samples measured with the 1 and 5 cm cuvettes separately the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette had less variability near zero ic no2 compared to those measured with the 1 cm cuvette fig 2d shows the corresponding residuals had a rmse of 0 039 mg l 1 n and an average residual of 0 014 mg l 1 n the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette figs 2d inset had a rmse of 0 020 mg l 1 n about one half that of all the out of sample data rmse 0 039 mg l 1 n this result indicates that the ɛ uva cm was more accurate for the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette presumably because of greater signal to noise ratios this topic is addressed further in section 3 4 the no2 mdl of the ɛ uva cm was 0 050 mg l 1 n sm s3 6 table s10 suitable for early detection of nitrification in cdwdss awwa 2013 but about five times greater than the mdl for ic no2 of 0 011 mg l 1 n sm s3 7 table s11 for comparison the mdl for the usepa diazotization nitrite method 8507 was estimated as 0 010 mg l 1 n based on the reported 95 ci of 0 003 mg l 1 n hach company 2019 and an assumed seven repeat measurements the mdl of the hach sl1000 which is a portable analyzer nitrite chemkey was estimated as 0 047 mg l 1 n based on the reported 95 ci of 0 011 mg l 1 n while the fundamentally based ɛ uva cm was strong fig 2 a gross measure uva cm was developed next for comparison purposes and to assess the generalizability of each approach 3 3 no2 uva cm development and validation fig s4 and table s12 in sm s3 8 show the uva cm calibrated using fay1 had three sivs 221 235 and 253 nm an estimated coefficient for each siv and an estimated constant of 0 050 mg l 1 n the latter of which guarantees the residuals are unbiased berthouex and brown 2002 the no2 mdl for the uva cm was 0 066 mg l 1 n table s13 which was in part a function of the relatively high estimated constant of 0 050 mg l 1 n figs s4c and d and table s12 show out of sample validation testing with dal1 dal2 and fay2 resulted in an adj r2 of 0 991 and rmse of 0 040 mg l 1 n indicating the uva cm accurately simulated no2 concentration in the other feedwaters however the residuals had a positive bias at ic no2 greater than about 0 6 mg l 1 n indicating under simulation at these greater no2 concentrations 3 4 comparison of ic no2 with no2 simulated using the ɛ uva and uva cms in the bar tests figs 3 a and c respectively show the bar dal2 tests d2 a and d2 b 1 measured nh2cl free ammonia and ic no2 concentrations and 2 simulated no2 concentrations from the ɛ uva and uva cms the uva spectra for these bar tests were collected with a 5 cm pathlength cuvette figs 3b and d show the corresponding residuals for each cm simulated no2 concentration relative to the measured ic no2 with their corresponding rmses for phases 1 2 and 3 the rmses for the cms were less than 0 015 mg l 1 n in phases 1 and 2 where no no2 production occurred but as large as 0 041 mg l 1 n in phase 3 where ba ox occurred this result indicates both cms tracked ic no2 closely throughout d2 a and d2 b simulated no2 concentrations with the ɛ uva cm were less than the mdl of 0 050 mg l 1 n in phases 1 and 2 and exceeded the mdl in phase 3 these observations indicated the ɛ uva cm did not produce any false positives i e simulated no2 concentrations above the mdl in phases 1 and 2 and reliably detected ba ox to no2 in its early stages under conditions relevant to cdwdss similarly simulated no2 concentrations with the uva cm were less than its mdl of 0 066 mg l 1 n in phases 1 and 2 and exceeded the mdl in phase 3 figs for the other bar tests are shown for fay1 in sm s3 9 figs s5 f1 a f1 b and f1 c and s6 f1 d and f1 e dal1 in figs s7 d1 a and d1 b and s8 d1 c and d1 d and fay2 in fig s9 f2 a and f2 b the uva spectra for these figures were collected with a 1 cm pathlength cuvette except for the yellow shaded portions of d1 c and d1 d in fig s8 for which a 5 cm cuvette was used the cm residuals in fig s8b and d show the ɛ uva cm more closely matched the uva cm with the 5 cm cuvette suggesting that spectrophotometer noise produced scatter at low no2 concentrations and the additional fitting parameters in the uva cm i e seven total a constant plus three sivs each with a coefficient compared to the ɛ uva cm i e four total consisting of four sivs modulated this instrument noise for the ɛ uva cm the rmses ranged from 1 0 015 0 070 mg l 1 n for fay1 2 0 023 0 064 mg l 1 n for dal1 and 3 0 018 0 035 mg l 1 n for fay2 for the uva cm the rmses ranged from 1 0 003 0 065 mg l 1 n for fay1 2 0 013 0 035 mg l 1 n for dal1 and 3 0 007 0 019 mg l 1 n for fay2 like fig 3 there were no false positives in phases 1 and 2 with the uva cm for fay1 figs s5 and s6 dal1 figs s7 and s8 and fay2 fig s9 while most observations in phase 3 exceeded the mdl with the ɛ uva cm the mdl was exceeded in phases 1 and 2 indicating false positives on several days with the 1 cm cuvette but no false positives with the 5 cm cuvette this result demonstrated the 5 cm cuvette modulated the spectrophotometer noise at low no2 concentrations thereby eliminating false positives regardless both cms accurately tracked ic no2 and reliably indicated the onset of ba ox the generalizability of the no2 cms is discussed next 3 5 no2 challenge samples fig 4 shows no2 challenge samples where ic no2 was compared to the simulated no2 concentrations from the ɛ uva and uva cms challenge samples contained br at 0 87 mg l 1 br no3 at 0 27 mg l 1 n and either o nom s nom or m nom at 1 0 2 5 3 5 or 5 0 mg l 1 c these water chemistry conditions spanned a continuum of nom concentrations typical in cdwdss and bromide was greater than in the bar samples table s4 for the ɛ uva cm fig 4a c and e most observations were within the grey shaded band which represents 0 05 mg l 1 n on either side of the one to one line deviations greater than 0 05 mg l 1 n occurred for samples formulated with 3 5 mg l 1 c of o nom fig 4a and 5 0 mg l 1 c of either s nom fig 4c and m nom fig 4e this finding indicates that the ɛ uva cm was generalizable in terms of br no3 and lower i e 1 0 and 2 5 mg l 1 c nom concentrations but was less accurate at the greater i e 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c nom concentrations the inset of fig 1b shows that the ɛ of the three nom types differed at λ1 213 nm but not at λ2 λ4 225 229 and 253 nm therefore while ɛ mitigated the influence of nom on no2 simulation by the ɛ uva cm it did not eliminate it the likely source of this influence could be inferred by comparison to the uva cm the uva cm fig 4b d and f circles consistently under simulated ic no2 by about 0 1 mg l 1 n regardless of nom concentration or source to ascertain whether this under simulation was due to the background br and no3 a water containing these inorganics but no nom was blank subtracted in the uva cm fig 4b d and f triangles following this subtraction of the background br and no3 all samples fell near the one to one line and within the grey shaded band given fay1 had variable no3 up to 2 0 mg l 1 n table s7 but constant and low br table s4 this result indicates the spiked br in no2 challenge samples was the likely source of the deviation from the one to one line fig 4b d and f circles while the uva cm was sensitive to br it was insensitive to nom consistent with the significant wavelengths of 221 235 and 253 nm in which ɛ for the three nom types were similar fig 1b furthermore the nom influence in the ɛ uva cm could be attributed to λ1 213 nm fig 1b inset which was the lowest siv supplementing evaluation of the ɛ uva cm with experimental challenge samples the ɛ uva cm was assessed for nhcl2 and ndma using published information for chloramine systems the potential interferences of nhcl2 and ndma on the ɛ uva cm were found to be of minor importance and are detailed in the sm s3 10 1 and s3 10 2 respectively the ɛ uva cm would also be applicable to free chlorine systems with naturally occurring ammonia as detailed in sm s3 10 3 3 6 practical field demonstration of the ɛ uva chemometric model fig 5 shows the comparison of no2 simulated with the ɛ uva cm with ic no2 for samples from cdwdss a and b fig 5a shows the background un spiked water chemistry of the samples from cdwdss a and b total chlorine and nh2cl were similar for a given system and sample location and decreased with increasing hydraulic residence time i e from short to medium to long for a given cdwds the doc was about 1 5 mg l 1 c in a and 3 7 mg l 1 c in cdwds b which was a suitable range to challenge the accuracy of the ɛ uva cm ic no2 was below detection in cdwds a and increased from 0 08 to 0 22 mg l 1 n in cdwds b which was evidence of an ongoing nitrification event ic no3 increased from 0 02 to 0 29 mg l 1 n in cdwds a which was also evidence of nitrification and about 0 40 mg l 1 n throughout cdwds b lastly br was below detection throughout cdwds a and decreased from about 0 06 mg l 1 br to below detection in cdwds b fig 5b shows good agreement between the no2 simulated with the ɛ uva cm and ic no2 in the no2 spiked waters this result was particularly notable for the samples from cdwds b that had 3 7 mg l 1 c doc given the nom based interferences shown in fig 4 at 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c for ic no2 less than 0 2 mg l ¹ n all samples were within the grey shaded region that represents 0 05 mg l ¹ n of the 1 1 line minor deviations occurred at greater ic no2 but overall the results in fig 5 demonstrate the applicability of the ɛ uva cm to waters from cdwdss undergoing nitrification 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that ɛ uva and uva cms can be used to accurately simulate no2 at 0 05 1 0 mg l 1 n and detect ba ox under conditions relevant in cdwdss the implications of this work are as follows ɛ spectra of nom varied amongst three nom types but these differences were mitigated in the ɛ spectra relative to those of no2 no3 br and nh2cl fig 1b the ɛ uva cm used ɛ for no2 no3 br and nh2cl included four sivs 213 225 229 and 253 nm had an mdl of 0 050 mg l 1 n and accurately simulated no2 concentrations in the bar tests figs 3 s5 s9 particularly for the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette the uva cm included three sivs 221 235 and 253 nm and their corresponding coefficients along with a constant of 0 050 mg l 1 n had an mdl of 0 066 mg l 1 n and accurately simulated no2 concentrations in the bar tests figs 3 s5 s9 regardless of cuvette pathlength 1 cm and 5 cm no2 challenge samples with background br no3 and nom were accurately simulated 0 05 mg l 1 n with the ɛ uva cm at nom concentrations up to 2 5 mg l 1 c but deviations 0 1 mg l 1 n occurred at nom concentrations of 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c and were attributed to the siv at 213 nm under simulated by about 0 1 mg l 1 n with the uva cm which was attributed to 0 87 mg l 1 br no2 spiked field samples from two cdwdss were accurately simulated 0 05 mg l 1 n with the ɛ uva cm including field samples with a doc 3 5 mg l 1 c that produced deviations in challenge samples this result indicated nom based interferences in real waters are likely source water specific utilities considering adoption of the ɛ uva chemometric model for no₂ quantification in their cdwdss should first perform matrix spike checks to assess if potential water specific interferences not considered in this study occur in their waters a practical extension of the current results is to incorporate the ɛ uva cm into a uva based sensor system for assessment in full scale cdwdss and or storage tanks the mdl of the ɛ uva cm 0 050 mg l 1 n was like portable no2 measurements i e 0 047 mg l 1 n with the hach sl1000 nitrite chemkey but does not require reagents future research should also consider using this cm to assess the efficacy of

15221,nitrite no2 production in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems cdwdss is among the first bulk water indicators of a nitrification event and is typically quantified using ion

2017 based on the review of the literature summarized in table 1 there are two primary concerns hindering the adoption of no2 cms for nitrification detection in cdwdss 1 accuracy at low no2 concentrations needed to detect ba ox in its early stages and 2 generalizability among different source waters due to differences in uv spectra of natural organic matter nom in their study of wastewater containing no2 between 0 1 3 1 mg l 1 n rieger et al 2004 determined a 95 prediction interval of 0 14 mg l 1 n for a cm formulated using uva230 240 this implies a predicted no2 concentration of 0 15 mg l 1 n or greater would be needed to produce a 95 prediction interval that does not include zero and conclude ba ox has occurred in comparison typical trigger levels for no2 are 0 01 0 05 mg l 1 n to indicate ba ox in cdwdss awwa 2013 more generally the no2 method detection limit mdl can be calculated using established procedures usepa 2016 but mdls have not been reported for any of the uva based cms in table 1 in terms of generalizability the significant independent variables sivs in no2 uva cms are the selected uva wavelengths however these are typically not reported nor are the corresponding coefficients preventing assessment of the cms for quantifying no2 in other source waters additionally in the no2 cm developed by wang et al 2021 the influence of dissolved organic carbon doc was mitigated using empirical correction factors indicating the cm was sensitive to nom and thus could be source water specific uva first uva and second uva derivatives may help overcome issues of cm accuracy and generalizability an increase in uva derivative degree can reveal meaningful spectral features or remove unwanted ones allowing characterization of analytes beyond direct measurement with the uva spectra thomas and burgess 2017 uva and uva can resolve overlapping peaks in the uva spectra by differentiating adjacent features and revealing peaks that are otherwise obscured ojeda and rojas 2013 uva 215 217 is zero for no3 bolzan et al 1999 and therefore allows for no2 quantification in waters with varying no3 wang et al 2019 used uva 217 to quantify no2 in river water at 0 1 1 4 mg l 1 n table 1 in the presence of no3 however the influence of other constituents typical in cdwdss on the uva spectra is unknown these species include 1 nom for which doc is a common surrogate rosario ortiz et al 2007 2 inorganics such as bromide br monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 free ammonia species ammonium ion nh4 and ammonia nh3 and dissolved inorganic carbon species carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate ion hco3 and carbonate ion co3 2 and 3 disinfection byproducts such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma that despite being present at low ng l 1 levels in cdwdss can co occur with no2 zeng and mitch 2016 and have relatively large ɛ spectra plumlee and reinhard 2007 variations in these constituents may impact the accuracy of uva and uva based cms and or hinder their generalizability cms for no3 and the sum of no2 and no3 are discussed in s1 2 of the sm see also tables s1 and s2 table 1 shows no2 cms have also been formulated using ɛ uva200 300 with no2 no3 and cl in seawater wang et al 2021 and ɛ uva 260 380 with no2 no3 and h2o2 in a plasma liquid solution he et al 2017 however the ɛ uva200 300 cm had a lower r2 0 71 compared to that using uva r2 0 99 despite having about four times as many sivs 100 vs 26 the ɛ uva 260 380 cm was calibrated with no2 between 7 140 mg l 1 n in a nom free water a concentration range and background matrix atypical from those in cdwdss where no2 1 mg l 1 n and doc is 1 5 mg l 1 c awwa 2013 while low level no2 quantification using ɛ uva cms is unproven these fundamentally based models should be equivalent to uva cms which are based on gross measures provided the ɛ spectra of all the contributing species are accounted for or eliminated with spectral derivatives to this end nom has not been previously considered in these ɛ uva cms and is likely source water specific at least in its zeroth derivative the objective of this study was to develop and compare no2 cms formulated using fundamental i e ɛ n uva n where n is the derivative order and gross measure i e uva n approaches for identifying ba ox in its early stages i e no2 at 0 01 1 mg l 1 n under typical cdwds conditions the ɛ n uva n cm was developed to be generalizable and insensitive to nom and other common species in cdwdss adjusted r2 adj r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to optimize model parameter selection which were wavelengths for the ɛ n uva n cm and wavelengths coefficients and a constant for the uva n cm first uva spectra were obtained in synthetic waters from 200 to 400 nm for various concentrations of no2 no3 nh2cl free ammonia species br cl and dissolved inorganic carbon species along with three nom types to determine their respective ɛ spectra additionally ɛ spectra for nhcl2 and ndma were acquired from the literature li and blatchley 2009 plumlee and reinhard 2007 yin et al 2020 the zeroth first and second derivatives of the uva and ɛ spectra were used to guide formulation of the no2 cms to mitigate potential nom interferences thus enhancing their generalizability among different source waters thirteen laboratory scale biofilm annular reactor bar tests were completed with four feedwaters two from fayetteville arkansas usa fay1 and fay2 and two from dallas texas usa dal1 and dal2 each bar test consisted of a period of biological stability followed by a purposeful decrease in nh2cl and increase in free ammonia species to stimulate growth of nitrifying bacteria and in turn ba ox to no2 uva spectra were measured daily along with no2 and no3 by ion chromatography ic no2 ɛ n uva n and uva n cms were developed by calibrating cms with fay1 data and validating cms against fay2 dal1 and dal2 data a series of no2 challenge samples that spanned a continuum of relevant water chemistries and field samples from two cdwdss were also evaluated 2 methods and materials 2 1 analytical all analyses were completed at room temperature 21 23 c sample ph was measured using a thermo orion ph electrode

previous work that showed a wider linear range compared to 530 nm granderson et al 2013 standard curves for total chlorine nh2cl and free ammonia species were between 0 02 5 0 mg l 1 cl2 0 045 4 5 mg

uv detectors the target analytes included no2 no3 cl and br for which seven point standard curves were collected between 0 01 5 0 mg l 1 and had r2 values greater than 0 99 the no2 and no3 concentrations measured by ic are referred to herein as ic no2 and ic no3 respectively and reported in units of mg l 1 n the ic was run twice weekly during the bar tests and as such the sample hold times ranged from a few hours up to about three days during this period samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and were not acidified to minimize no2 oxidation to no3 wahman and speitel 2012 control tests completed under conditions like the bar tests indicated no significant no2 oxidation to no3 during the storage time in the presence of doc as shown in table s3 and detailed in the sm s2

equations to solve for each ck by selecting n distinct wavelengths that minimized the rmse between the simulated and measured no2 concentrations the chemicals and derivative order n were selected based on ɛ and uva spectra presented in section 3 1 and sm s3 3 respectively given the variability between successive derivatives linked to the electronic noise of spectrophotometers a smoothing procedure was used the savitsky golay method savitzky and golay 1964 was used to simultaneously smooth the spectra and calculate the uva and ɛ derivatives with the objective of enhancing their signal

combination that produced a minimum rmse for fay1 was validated against the other bar feedwaters and the no2 challenge and field samples the sm s2 6 details the methods used to formulate the multivariate nth derivative uva n cms that were compared to the ɛ n uva n cms to assess the potential impacts of nhcl2 and ndma on the no2 cm ɛ of these species were discretized from literature published spectra using webplotdigitizer 4 6 ɛ for nhcl2 was digitized by combining the spectra reported by blatchley and colleagues which included li and blatchley 2009 from 200 229 nm and yin et al 2020 from 230 350 nm ɛ for ndma was digitized from plumlee and reinhard 2007 between 200 380 nm spectral derivatives for nhcl2 and ndma were calculated as described previously in this subsection 2 5 no2 cm validation and mdl determinations the no2 cms were evaluated against a series of challenge and field samples as part of the model validation sixty challenge samples were formulated using twelve background waters each spiked at five no2 concentrations 0 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 mg l 1 n the background waters were dosed with nom in 1 mm bicarbonate buffer ph 8 0 amended with br at 0 80 mg l 1 br and no3 at 0 25 mg l 1 n the three nom types o nom s nom and m nom were added at doc concentrations of 1 0 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c seven uva spectra measurements were collected for no2 at 0 mg l 1 n to determine the mdl based on method blanks mdlb and 0 05 and 0 10 mg l 1 n to determine the mdl based on spiked samples mdls the greater of the mdlb or mdls was selected as the mdl for each cm usepa 2016 triplicate uva spectra measurements were collected for the greater no2 concentrations 0 20 and 0 30 mg l 1 n and because these concentrations were greater than ten times the estimated mdl they were only used for cm validation field samples were collected from two cdwdss experiencing nitrification one in colorado and the other in oklahoma and referred to herein as cdwdss a and b respectively samples were collected from three locations in each system targeting water ages corresponding to short average and long residence times for cdwds a the estimated hydraulic residence times were 1 7 and 21 days for cdwds b these times were 0 5 1 and 2 days no2 was spiked to each of these six field samples at five levels 0 i e background 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 mg l 1 n and quantified by ic to compare to the cm as part of the model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 ɛ and ɛ spectra of cdwds relevant species fig 1 a shows the ɛ spectra of seven inorganics i e nh2cl nhcl2 no2 no3 br hco3 and co3 2 ndma and three noms i e o nom s nom and m nom with ɛ between 1 10 000 l mol 1 cm 1 from 200 400 nm inorganics nh4 nh3 and cl with ɛ between 0 001 1 l mol 1 cm 1 appeared as spectra noise and thus were not shown no2 no3 br and ndma had the greatest ɛ values between 200 230 nm and the three noms had relatively large ɛ values between 260 400 nm nh2cl and nhcl2 had ɛ peak maxima at 244 nm and 294 nm respectively which were nearly identical to that reported by others margerum et al 1994 valentine et al 1986 no2 and no3 had local ɛ peak maxima at 354 and 302 nm respectively which are peaks that have been used for quantification in nom free waters margerum et al 1994 the three nom ɛ values were greater than that of no2 and no3 between about 250 400 nm and differed from one another the ɛ spectra in fig 1a indicated that no2 and no3 have relatively large ɛ values between 200 230 nm but the differences in the nom spectra could produce source water specific interferences that may be relevant in cdwdss a similar issue was observed with the ɛ spectra fig s1 inset although the magnitudes of the nom spectra were smaller compared to those of no2 and no3 indicating wavelength based derivatives could help mitigate nom influence i e source water dependence fig 1b shows the ɛ spectra of the seven inorganics ndma and three nom types between 210 390 nm br had the greatest ɛ peak maxima 55 1 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 211 nm followed by no3 31 0 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 226 nm ndma 34 3 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 228 nm and no2 12 1 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 232 nm wavelengths at which the ɛ spectra crossed zero occurred at 224 nm for no2 and 217 nm for no3 in agreement with others bolzan et al 1999 causse et al 2017 crumpton et al 1992 eckford and fedorak 2002 ferree and shannon 2001 pons et al 2017 suzuki and kuroda 1987 wang et al 2019 ɛ spectra of the dissolved inorganic carbon species were circa zero the fig 1b inset shows the three nom ɛ spectra had a maximum magnitude of about 0 2 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 at 240 nm and were like one another this result suggests no2 quantification by ɛ spectra should not be heavily influenced by nom i e source water independent the ɛ spectra for nh2cl varied from 1 4 to 1 3 l mol 1 cm 1 nm 2 between 210 300 nm and is present in cdwdss at concentrations up to 4 mg l 1 cl2 awwa 2013 while the ɛ of nhcl2 was similar in magnitude fig 1b it is typically present at low concentrations relative to nh2cl similarly ndma forms at low ng l 1 levels in cdwdss zeng and mitch 2016 which is about six orders of magnitude less than the inorganic nitrogen species therefore despite having ɛ peaks similar in magnitude to no2 and no3 it is unlikely ndma would impact no2 quantification using ɛ spectra based on the ɛ spectra in fig 1b and typical concentrations in cdwdss a ɛ uva model for no2 quantification would need to include no2 no3 br and nh2cl minimal impacts on ɛ uva model accuracy should be incurred by excluding species that 1 form at low concentrations in cdwdss such as ndma and nhcl2 or 2 have low ɛ spectra such as nom and dissolved inorganic carbon species or too low of ɛ spectra to meaningfully determine ɛ such as free ammonia species and cl 3 2 ɛ uva cm development and validation the ɛ uva cm calibration and validation used the bar effluent the chemistry of which is detailed in the sm s3 2 tables s7 and s8 the cm was calibrated with the fay1 feedwater uva sm s3 3 fig s2f and the ɛ spectra of no2 no3 br and nh2cl fig 1b λ1 λ4 represented the sivs in the ɛ uva cm and were selected to minimize the rmse between the ɛ uva cm simulated no2 concentrations and fay1 ic no2 data table s7 n 275 λ1 λ4 were 213 225 229 and 253 nm respectively and table s9 in sm s3 4 lists the corresponding ɛ of no2 no3 br and nh2cl fig s3 in sm s3 5 shows the rmse of the ɛ uva cm decreased as nsp increased from 5 to 13 with a minimum for 21 i e yellow shaded box in fig s3 the nsp was not provided for the no2 cms listed in table 1 preventing comparisons to previously developed models for the optimized nsp of 21 fig 2 a shows the linear correlation between ɛ uva simulated no2 concentrations ɛ uva no2 and ic no2 was strong adj r2 0 992 n 275 as shown in fig 1b λ1 213 nm is near the minimum ɛ for no2 and maximum ɛ for br λ2 225 nm is near a zero ɛ for no2 and maximum ɛ for no3 at λ3 229 nm ɛ for no3 and no2 are relatively large and that for br is near zero lastly at λ4 253 nm ɛ for all four target species are circa zero fig 2b shows the rmse of the fay1 residuals was 0 033 mg l 1 n and the average residual was 0 005 mg l 1 n indicating a slight negative bias fig 2c shows that the ɛ uva cm applied to out of sample bar test data dal1 dal2 and fay2 had a strong correlation adj r2 0 987 n 376 the insets in fig 2c show the samples measured with the 1 and 5 cm cuvettes separately the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette had less variability near zero ic no2 compared to those measured with the 1 cm cuvette fig 2d shows the corresponding residuals had a rmse of 0 039 mg l 1 n and an average residual of 0 014 mg l 1 n the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette figs 2d inset had a rmse of 0 020 mg l 1 n about one half that of all the out of sample data rmse 0 039 mg l 1 n this result indicates that the ɛ uva cm was more accurate for the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette presumably because of greater signal to noise ratios this topic is addressed further in section 3 4 the no2 mdl of the ɛ uva cm was 0 050 mg l 1 n sm s3 6 table s10 suitable for early detection of nitrification in cdwdss awwa 2013 but about five times greater than the mdl for ic no2 of 0 011 mg l 1 n sm s3 7 table s11 for comparison the mdl for the usepa diazotization nitrite method 8507 was estimated as 0 010 mg l 1 n based on the reported 95 ci of 0 003 mg l 1 n hach company 2019 and an assumed seven repeat measurements the mdl of the hach sl1000 which is a portable analyzer nitrite chemkey was estimated as 0 047 mg l 1 n based on the reported 95 ci of 0 011 mg l 1 n while the fundamentally based ɛ uva cm was strong fig 2 a gross measure uva cm was developed next for comparison purposes and to assess the generalizability of each approach 3 3 no2 uva cm development and validation fig s4 and table s12 in sm s3 8 show the uva cm calibrated using fay1 had three sivs 221 235 and 253 nm an estimated coefficient for each siv and an estimated constant of 0 050 mg l 1 n the latter of which guarantees the residuals are unbiased berthouex and brown 2002 the no2 mdl for the uva cm was 0 066 mg l 1 n table s13 which was in part a function of the relatively high estimated constant of 0 050 mg l 1 n figs s4c and d and table s12 show out of sample validation testing with dal1 dal2 and fay2 resulted in an adj r2 of 0 991 and rmse of 0 040 mg l 1 n indicating the uva cm accurately simulated no2 concentration in the other feedwaters however the residuals had a positive bias at ic no2 greater than about 0 6 mg l 1 n indicating under simulation at these greater no2 concentrations 3 4 comparison of ic no2 with no2 simulated using the ɛ uva and uva cms in the bar tests figs 3 a and c respectively show the bar dal2 tests d2 a and d2 b 1 measured nh2cl free ammonia and ic no2 concentrations and 2 simulated no2 concentrations from the ɛ uva and uva cms the uva spectra for these bar tests were collected with a 5 cm pathlength cuvette figs 3b and d show the corresponding residuals for each cm simulated no2 concentration relative to the measured ic no2 with their corresponding rmses for phases 1 2 and 3 the rmses for the cms were less than 0 015 mg l 1 n in phases 1 and 2 where no no2 production occurred but as large as 0 041 mg l 1 n in phase 3 where ba ox occurred this result indicates both cms tracked ic no2 closely throughout d2 a and d2 b simulated no2 concentrations with the ɛ uva cm were less than the mdl of 0 050 mg l 1 n in phases 1 and 2 and exceeded the mdl in phase 3 these observations indicated the ɛ uva cm did not produce any false positives i e simulated no2 concentrations above the mdl in phases 1 and 2 and reliably detected ba ox to no2 in its early stages under conditions relevant to cdwdss similarly simulated no2 concentrations with the uva cm were less than its mdl of 0 066 mg l 1 n in phases 1 and 2 and exceeded the mdl in phase 3 figs for the other bar tests are shown for fay1 in sm s3 9 figs s5 f1 a f1 b and f1 c and s6 f1 d and f1 e dal1 in figs s7 d1 a and d1 b and s8 d1 c and d1 d and fay2 in fig s9 f2 a and f2 b the uva spectra for these figures were collected with a 1 cm pathlength cuvette except for the yellow shaded portions of d1 c and d1 d in fig s8 for which a 5 cm cuvette was used the cm residuals in fig s8b and d show the ɛ uva cm more closely matched the uva cm with the 5 cm cuvette suggesting that spectrophotometer noise produced scatter at low no2 concentrations and the additional fitting parameters in the uva cm i e seven total a constant plus three sivs each with a coefficient compared to the ɛ uva cm i e four total consisting of four sivs modulated this instrument noise for the ɛ uva cm the rmses ranged from 1 0 015 0 070 mg l 1 n for fay1 2 0 023 0 064 mg l 1 n for dal1 and 3 0 018 0 035 mg l 1 n for fay2 for the uva cm the rmses ranged from 1 0 003 0 065 mg l 1 n for fay1 2 0 013 0 035 mg l 1 n for dal1 and 3 0 007 0 019 mg l 1 n for fay2 like fig 3 there were no false positives in phases 1 and 2 with the uva cm for fay1 figs s5 and s6 dal1 figs s7 and s8 and fay2 fig s9 while most observations in phase 3 exceeded the mdl with the ɛ uva cm the mdl was exceeded in phases 1 and 2 indicating false positives on several days with the 1 cm cuvette but no false positives with the 5 cm cuvette this result demonstrated the 5 cm cuvette modulated the spectrophotometer noise at low no2 concentrations thereby eliminating false positives regardless both cms accurately tracked ic no2 and reliably indicated the onset of ba ox the generalizability of the no2 cms is discussed next 3 5 no2 challenge samples fig 4 shows no2 challenge samples where ic no2 was compared to the simulated no2 concentrations from the ɛ uva and uva cms challenge samples contained br at 0 87 mg l 1 br no3 at 0 27 mg l 1 n and either o nom s nom or m nom at 1 0 2 5 3 5 or 5 0 mg l 1 c these water chemistry conditions spanned a continuum of nom concentrations typical in cdwdss and bromide was greater than in the bar samples table s4 for the ɛ uva cm fig 4a c and e most observations were within the grey shaded band which represents 0 05 mg l 1 n on either side of the one to one line deviations greater than 0 05 mg l 1 n occurred for samples formulated with 3 5 mg l 1 c of o nom fig 4a and 5 0 mg l 1 c of either s nom fig 4c and m nom fig 4e this finding indicates that the ɛ uva cm was generalizable in terms of br no3 and lower i e 1 0 and 2 5 mg l 1 c nom concentrations but was less accurate at the greater i e 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c nom concentrations the inset of fig 1b shows that the ɛ of the three nom types differed at λ1 213 nm but not at λ2 λ4 225 229 and 253 nm therefore while ɛ mitigated the influence of nom on no2 simulation by the ɛ uva cm it did not eliminate it the likely source of this influence could be inferred by comparison to the uva cm the uva cm fig 4b d and f circles consistently under simulated ic no2 by about 0 1 mg l 1 n regardless of nom concentration or source to ascertain whether this under simulation was due to the background br and no3 a water containing these inorganics but no nom was blank subtracted in the uva cm fig 4b d and f triangles following this subtraction of the background br and no3 all samples fell near the one to one line and within the grey shaded band given fay1 had variable no3 up to 2 0 mg l 1 n table s7 but constant and low br table s4 this result indicates the spiked br in no2 challenge samples was the likely source of the deviation from the one to one line fig 4b d and f circles while the uva cm was sensitive to br it was insensitive to nom consistent with the significant wavelengths of 221 235 and 253 nm in which ɛ for the three nom types were similar fig 1b furthermore the nom influence in the ɛ uva cm could be attributed to λ1 213 nm fig 1b inset which was the lowest siv supplementing evaluation of the ɛ uva cm with experimental challenge samples the ɛ uva cm was assessed for nhcl2 and ndma using published information for chloramine systems the potential interferences of nhcl2 and ndma on the ɛ uva cm were found to be of minor importance and are detailed in the sm s3 10 1 and s3 10 2 respectively the ɛ uva cm would also be applicable to free chlorine systems with naturally occurring ammonia as detailed in sm s3 10 3 3 6 practical field demonstration of the ɛ uva chemometric model fig 5 shows the comparison of no2 simulated with the ɛ uva cm with ic no2 for samples from cdwdss a and b fig 5a shows the background un spiked water chemistry of the samples from cdwdss a and b total chlorine and nh2cl were similar for a given system and sample location and decreased with increasing hydraulic residence time i e from short to medium to long for a given cdwds the doc was about 1 5 mg l 1 c in a and 3 7 mg l 1 c in cdwds b which was a suitable range to challenge the accuracy of the ɛ uva cm ic no2 was below detection in cdwds a and increased from 0 08 to 0 22 mg l 1 n in cdwds b which was evidence of an ongoing nitrification event ic no3 increased from 0 02 to 0 29 mg l 1 n in cdwds a which was also evidence of nitrification and about 0 40 mg l 1 n throughout cdwds b lastly br was below detection throughout cdwds a and decreased from about 0 06 mg l 1 br to below detection in cdwds b fig 5b shows good agreement between the no2 simulated with the ɛ uva cm and ic no2 in the no2 spiked waters this result was particularly notable for the samples from cdwds b that had 3 7 mg l 1 c doc given the nom based interferences shown in fig 4 at 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c for ic no2 less than 0 2 mg l ¹ n all samples were within the grey shaded region that represents 0 05 mg l ¹ n of the 1 1 line minor deviations occurred at greater ic no2 but overall the results in fig 5 demonstrate the applicability of the ɛ uva cm to waters from cdwdss undergoing nitrification 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that ɛ uva and uva cms can be used to accurately simulate no2 at 0 05 1 0 mg l 1 n and detect ba ox under conditions relevant in cdwdss the implications of this work are as follows ɛ spectra of nom varied amongst three nom types but these differences were mitigated in the ɛ spectra relative to those of no2 no3 br and nh2cl fig 1b the ɛ uva cm used ɛ for no2 no3 br and nh2cl included four sivs 213 225 229 and 253 nm had an mdl of 0 050 mg l 1 n and accurately simulated no2 concentrations in the bar tests figs 3 s5 s9 particularly for the samples measured with the 5 cm cuvette the uva cm included three sivs 221 235 and 253 nm and their corresponding coefficients along with a constant of 0 050 mg l 1 n had an mdl of 0 066 mg l 1 n and accurately simulated no2 concentrations in the bar tests figs 3 s5 s9 regardless of cuvette pathlength 1 cm and 5 cm no2 challenge samples with background br no3 and nom were accurately simulated 0 05 mg l 1 n with the ɛ uva cm at nom concentrations up to 2 5 mg l 1 c but deviations 0 1 mg l 1 n occurred at nom concentrations of 3 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 c and were attributed to the siv at 213 nm under simulated by about 0 1 mg l 1 n with the uva cm which was attributed to 0 87 mg l 1 br no2 spiked field samples from two cdwdss were accurately simulated 0 05 mg l 1 n with the ɛ uva cm including field samples with a doc 3 5 mg l 1 c that produced deviations in challenge samples this result indicated nom based interferences in real waters are likely source water specific utilities considering adoption of the ɛ uva chemometric model for no₂ quantification in their cdwdss should first perform matrix spike checks to assess if potential water specific interferences not considered in this study occur in their waters a practical extension of the current results is to incorporate the ɛ uva cm into a uva based sensor system for assessment in full scale cdwdss and or storage tanks the mdl of the ɛ uva cm 0 050 mg l 1 n was like portable no2 measurements i e 0 047 mg l 1 n with the hach sl1000 nitrite chemkey but does not require reagents future research should also consider using this cm to assess the efficacy of

15222,waterborne enteric viruses in lakes especially at recreational water sites may have a negative impact on human health however their fate and transport in lakes are poorly understood in this study we propose a coupled water quality and quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model to study the transport fate and infection risk of four common waterborne viruses adenovirus enterovirus norovirus and rotavirus using lake geneva as a study site the measured virus load in raw sewage entering the lake was used as the source term in the water quality simulations for a hypothetical scenario of discharging raw wastewater at the lake surface after discharge into the lake virus inactivation was modeled as a function of water temperature and solar irradiance that varied both spatially and temporally during transport throughout the lake finally the probability of infection while swimming at a popular beach was quantified and compared among the four viruses norovirus was found to be the most abundant virus that causes an infection probability that is at least 10 times greater than the other viruses studied furthermore environmental inactivation was found to be an essential determinant in the infection risks posed by viruses to recreational water users we determined that infection risks by enterovirus and rotavirus could be up to 1000 times lower when virus inactivation by environmental stressors was accounted for compared with the scenarios considering hydrodynamic transport only finally the model highlighted the role of the wind field in conveying the contamination plume and hence in determining infection probability our simulations revealed that for beaches located west of the sewage discharge the infection probability under eastward wind was 43 lower than that under westward wind conditions this study highlights the potential of combining water quality simulation and virus specific risk assessment for a safe water resources usage and management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality simulation waterborne virus inactivation risk assessment human health data availability data measured virus concentrations

org 10 5281 zenodo 7386773 1 introduction human enteric viruses are frequent contaminants of recreational water aslan et al 2011 brouwer et al 2018 corsi et al 2016 and have been found to cause disease outbreaks cabelli 1983 sinclair et al 2009 yet viral contamination in recreational waters is rarely directly monitored because traditional culturing assays are time consuming and molecular techniques tend to overestimate the infectious virus concentrations in a sample farkas et al 2020 instead the microbial quality of surface water is often assessed by monitoring fecal indicator bacteria such as e coli who scientific group 1979 which are much easier to measure although previous studies of waterborne diseases outbreaks showed that bacteriological indicators are typically present when viral outbreaks occur the occurrence of fecal coliforms in recreational water sites does not necessarily indicate viral pollution sinclair et al 2009 thus it is critical to specifically consider viral pathogens when assessing the risk of infection during recreational water use nevertheless viral pathogens are typically not included in water quality monitoring programs boehm et al 2009 who 2021 although progress has been made in detecting enteric viruses in recreational water samples using pcr based molecular methods the temporal resolution of such measurements is limited due to the cost and complexity of the methods and the requirement of proficient expertise to perform the measurements tong et al 2011 adding to the complexity of monitoring efforts is environmental virus inactivation which is an important factor limiting the infectious virus concentration in the environment boehm et al 2018 if the source of contamination is located at a distance from the monitoring site and the polluted water has aged the virus concentration measured by molecular methods may greatly overestimate the infectious concentration hamza et al 2011 despite the challenges in monitoring waterborne pathogen contamination in natural water bodies scientists have long endeavored to understand the emergence and transport of pathogens in aquatic systems documented studies of waterborne pathogens in lakes trace back to the early 20th century mclaughlin 1912 entering the 21st century the concept of modeling rather than monitoring pathogen concentrations in lakes started to gain popularity modeling approaches offer opportunities for insight into pathogen concentrations at monitoring sites without the needs for frequent measurements numerical models have the potential to provide continuous information in space and time and three dimensional analysis is usually more accessible compared to monitoring methods among different approaches water quality models appear particularly suited to deal with virus transport effectively one reason is that a key factor determining the fate of viruses in the environment the inactivation of viruses which varies according to specific environmental conditions can be readily included in water quality models schijven et al 2015 the study of virus inactivation itself is therefore a crucial topic a meta analysis method to estimate the inactivation rate of different viruses as a function of water temperature solar irradiation virus species and various other parameters was recently put forward by boehm et al 2019 based on a systematic review of measured virus inactivation rates in surface waters nevertheless to the best of our knowledge this information has not yet been utilized to establish water quality models dedicated to the simulation of waterborne viruses in lakes water quality models that neglect impacts of virus inactivation fail to capture attenuation of risks due to spatial heterogeneity in transport most water quality models have been applied to non viral pathogens in lakes for example hipsey et al 2004 suggested a three dimensional model to predict cryptosporidium parvum oocyst dynamics in lakes and reservoirs a few years later these authors proposed a comprehensive process based model to address the issue of microbial pollution in aquatic systems hipsey et al 2008 though simulations for viral pathogens were lacking later studies coupled hydrodynamic models and microbial transport simulation for fecal indicator bacteria and cryptosporidium spp eregno et al 2016 tolouei et al 2019 however inactivation was either omitted or simply modeled as a constant value the results were furthermore coupled with a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra these studies thus assessed not only the fate and transport of pathogens in lakes but also the resulting risk of human infection apart from studies employing mechanistic models studies applying analytical regression or bayesian network approaches also demonstrated capability in predicting water quality conditions rigosi et al 2015 searcy et al 2018 trung thanh et al 2021 wong et al 2009 compared with bacterial or protistean pathogens less attention has been dedicated to simulating the risks posed by viruses in recreational water sites even though the health risks cause by viruses can outweigh those caused by bacteria viau et al 2011 one study specifically addressing risks resulting from viral contamination was performed by foreman et al 2015 who proposed a coupled hydrodynamic virus inactivation and risk model dedicated to the study of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus a fish virus that infects salmon and trout and causes important losses in fish farm industry however while these authors did consider virus inactivation the model did not account for temperature dependence of this process a similar approach was also used by sokolova et al 2015 to estimate the infection risk for human norovirus however this study focused on drinking water safety and virus inactivation was not considered a comprehensive tool to estimate microbial contamination based on a surface water quality model in combination with qmra was proposed by schijven et al 2015 this tool which was intended for rivers included thermal virus inactivation but not solar inactivation a study focusing specifically on the health risks exerted by different human viruses in lakes is imperative yet lacking models of health risks associated with human viral pathogens in lakes would aid policy decisions designed to reduce transmission in this work we propose a combined water quality and quantitative microbial risk assessment model to comprehensively study the transport fate and infection risk of four major human waterborne viral pathogens arising from wastewater discharge into a large lake we specifically focus on how environmental virus inactivation affects the risks at recreational water sites and we compare the risk levels of the different viruses included we use lake geneva located on the border of switzerland and france as a study site lake geneva has a surface area of 580 km2 and volume of 89 km3 with a maximum depth of 310 m it is used as a recreational site and as a drinking water source by more than 800 000 people and it also receives the discharge of several wastewater treatment plants our target virus species include adenovirus enterovirus norovirus and rotavirus these viruses are frequently detected in sewage gholipour et al 2022 lodder and de roda husman 2005 and are classified to have a moderate to high health significance who 2011 we incorporate spatially and temporally varying inactivation rates of these viruses in our module dedicated to virus simulations and we compute the risk of infection to swimmers at a popular recreational site at the shore of lake geneva for a hypothetical scenario of discharging raw wastewater at the surface of the lake 2 material and methods

direction solar radiation humidity and temperature were included as driving forces the water quality model based on a lagrangian framework was validated in a previous study li et al 2022 here we used the equivalent water quality model with identical dispersion coefficients though in a eulerian framework 2 2 virus inactivation modeling virus inactivation was modeled using the water quality module of delft3d directly coupled to the hydrodynamic module from meteolakes each virus species was regarded as a degradable tracer in this module the transport of viruses was passive and governed by the flow of the hydrodynamic module whereas the inactivation of each viral species was specifically defined in each grid cell according to the approach proposed by boehm et al 2019 1 l o g 10 k β 0 i 1 n β i x i ε where k is the first order inactivation rate constant day 1 for a given viral species β 0 represents the model estimate for background inactivation likely chemical and microbial processes under reference conditions in darkness at 15 β i represents the coefficient for each of the model variables x i temperature t 15 and irradiance i and ε is a gaussian white noise term representing the error in this study we included two inactivation processes namely thermal β t e m p t 15 c and solar inactivation β s o l a r i note that thermal inactivation may include both direct and indirect e g driven by temperature mediated changes in microbial grazing effects of water temperature on virus inactivation compared to the model by boehm et al 2019 the contribution of solar radiation was further refined while boehm et al 2019 modeled the contribution of solar inactivation as a binary value that depends solely on the presence or absence of sunlight we accounted here for daily cloud coverage and solar radiation conditions in lake geneva and modeled the solar inactivation as a continuous variable specifically we scaled the coefficients β s o l a r reported by boehm et al 2019 according to differences in irradiance observed throughout the year hereby the reported value of β s o l a r was assumed to represent irradiance conditions consistent with those observed on average during the month of august 2019 highest average monthly irradiance in 2019 the coefficients for other irradiance conditions were scaled linearly according to the value of the solar radiation measured to this end we used daily ground level radiation data for the lake geneva region provided by meteoswiss https www meteoswiss admin ch meteoswiss reports only global irradiance data whereas direct solar inactivation of enteric viruses depends mainly on the uvb range of 280 320 nm nelson et al 2018 here we assumed that the uvb range scales linearly with the global irradiance finally we also considered that the solar inactivation is a depth dependent process because lake water readily attenuates light in the uvb region the irradiance i z at each depth z was determined based on beer lambert s law 2 i z d z u v b 10 α u v b z where d z u v b j s 1 m 2 represents the downwelling irradiance obtained from meteoswiss and α u v b is the absorbance of the water column of lake geneva over the uvb range for lake geneva water we used an average lake water absorbance α 320 n m 0 02 cm 1 according to measurements olive et al 2020 values of β 0 β t e m p and β s o l a r at the surface were taken from the literature boehm et al 2019 whereas solar inactivation beneath the water surface was calculated according to eq 2 table 1 summarizes the β values used in the water quality simulations 2 3 sample collection and processing of raw sewage 24 h composite samples of raw sewage were obtained from the vidy wastewater treatment plant wwtp near lausanne which collects wastewater of 220 000 inhabitant equivalents samples were collected once a month between november 2018 and october 2019 collected samples were stored at 20 ºc until further processing prior to processing samples were thawed at room temperature to concentrate the samples 600 ml aliquots of raw sewage were sequentially filtered through a 2 µm glass fiber pre filters cat nº ap2007500 merck millipore burlington ma usa a 0 45 µm stericup filter cat nº s2hvu02re merck millipore and a 0 22 µm stericup filter cat nº scgvu02re merck millipore the filtrate was successively transferred in batches of 50 ml to four different centrifugal filter units with a size cut off of 100 kda centricon plus 70 cat nº ufc701008 merck millipore and centrifuged for 30 min at 300 g after centrifugation the filtrate was discarded and each centrifugal filter unit was loaded again with 50 ml sample until the entire 600 ml sample was processed finally the four different centrifugal filters were inverted and centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 g to obtain the viral concentrate eluted viruses from each centricon unit were pooled and the final volume of the viral concentrate was adjusted to 2 ml by using phosphate buffered saline cat nº 18 912 014 thermofisher scientific 2 4 nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr quantification viral nucleic acids na were extracted from 140 µl of viral concentrate by using the qiagen rna viral mini kit cat nº 22 906 qiagen valencia ca usa and the automated qiacube system qiagen valencia ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions for each processed batch of sample a negative extraction control consisting in dnase rnase free molecular water was included na were preserved at 80 ºc until further use previously published qpcr or rt qpcr assays were used to quantify the four waterborne viruses of interest namely human adenovirus bofill mas et al 2006 hernroth et al 2002 enterovirus fout et al 2016 monpoeho et al 2000 tsai et al 1993 noroviruses including genogroup gi da silva et al 2007 hoehne and schreier 2006 svraka et al 2007 genogroup gii kageyama et al 2003 loisy et al 2005 and genogroup giv miura et al 2013 and rotavirus zeng et al 2008 primers and probes used as well as the pcr thermal profiles used are detailed in the supplemental information table s1 all amplifications were performed in a final reaction volume of 25 µl and using ten fold diluted na viral extracts as a template to minimize inhibition for adenovirus master mixes were prepared using the taqman environmental master mix 2 0 life technologies foster city ca usa and 10 µl of ten fold diluted na extracts were added as template for enterovirus norovirus and rotavirus master mixes were prepared using rna ultrasense one step quantitative rt pcr system cat nº 11 732 927 invitrogen carlsbad ca usa and 5 µl of ten fold diluted na extracts were added as template all qpcr and rt qpcr reactions were performed on a mic qpcr cycler bio molecular systems upper coomera queensland australia all runs were performed in duplicate and included no template controls and negative extraction controls to identify any source of contamination during sample processing in order to provide an absolute quantification of genome copies gc qpcr and rt qpcr standard curves were generated for each viral target using double stranded dna gblocks gene fragments at known concentration purchased from integrated dna technologies coralville ia usa 2 5 temporal variations in virus concentrations in sewage parametric probability distributions were selected to describe variability and uncertainty in concentrations of each virus species based on monitoring data we employed two mixed poisson distributions the poisson lognormal distribution pln and the poisson gamma distribution pga to describe temporal variations and selected the better fit among the two according to their marginal deviance information criterion dicm values sylvestre et al 2021 a difference in dicm of a least 3 points was considered to be significant for model selection the probability density function of the poisson lognormal distribution for a random variable x here the virus count in the sewage sample is 3 p p l n x 0 μ v x e x p μ v x 1 μ s 2 π e x p ln μ ζ 2 2 s 2 d μ where v is the volume of the sample μ is the mean virus concentration in the sample ζ is the mean of the logarithm of the virus concentration and s is the standard deviation of the logarithm of the virus concentration the probability density function of the poisson gamma distribution for a random variable x is given by 4 p p g a x 0 μ v x e x p μ v x 1 γ γ δ μ γ δ 1 e x p μ γ d μ where v is the volume of the sample μ is the mean virus concentration in the sample and γ and δ are parameters of a gamma distribution which has a mean of γ δ and a variance of δ γ 2 mixed poisson distributions were chosen to fit the data as they allow for greater variability in the expected count of the sample than a poisson distribution with a fixed mean concentration haas et al 2014a bayesian inference was carried out using a monte carlo markov chain mcmc method as described in sylvestre et al 2021 briefly the priors selected for the lognormal distribution parameters were a diffuse uniform prior for the mean μ i u 10 10 and a vague exponential prior for the standard deviation σ i exp 0 1 three markov chains were run for 106 iterations after a burn in phase of 104 iterations temporal variations in sewage virus concentrations were illustrated with complementary cumulative distribution functions ccdf curves to assess the behavior of the upper tail of these distributions 2 6 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra the qmra process has four main components hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization fewtrell 2013 hazard identification serves to determine the pathogen or pathogen group of interest here the hazard is any event or activities that may cause the discharge of virus contaminated raw sewage into lake geneva such as a heavy rain event exposure assessment combines data on the pathogen concentration at the site of interest with information on the rate of intake by an individual particularly the contact time of lake water to swimmers or direct ingestion of lake water by swimmers for a conservative estimation we assumed that 100 ml of virus contaminated water is swallowed by one person during each recreational water event who 2003 this water intake is high compared to other studies which have reported that the average water volumes swallowed by adults and children in swimming pools are 16 ml and 37 ml respectively dufour et al 2006 we addressed the variability of this intake value in one of our simulation cases the risk characterization is done by integrating the exposure and dose response models to estimate per swimming event negative health outcomes infection as a function of the number of viruses ingested in this study the exponential dose response model were employed for enterovirus cliver 1981 beta poisson models were applied to adenovirus teunis et al 2016 and rotavirus haas et al 2014b ward et al 1986 and a beta binomial model was chosen for norovirus teunis et al 2020 curves of those dose response models are illustrated in the supplemental information fig s1 the virus dose response models were originally established using different dose units whereas viruses in this study were quantified in terms of genome copies section 2 4 therefore a dose harmonization was conducted to normalize the dose unit of the four types of virus of interest we followed the dose harmonization rule proposed by mcbride et al 2013 specifically we applied the following conversions shown in table 2 monte carlo stochastic simulations were performed to estimate uncertainties in the computation scheme using r v4 1 2 we considered uncertainties associated with virus sewage concentration but omitted those associated with water intake volumes this approach was chosen because the latter uncertainties were not expected to largely affect the relative impact of environmental virus inactivation on health risks which is the main object of this study we also did not consider uncertainties associated with dose response modeling as studies have shown that risks pose by some enteric viruses were insensitive to dose response parameters viau et al 2011 a total of 10 000 realizations were generated for each type of virus and the uncertainties were computed using a markov chain monte carlo method 2 7 case studies coupling water quality simulations and qmra using the abovementioned water quality model we can compute virus concentrations near the shore of lake geneva and when coupled to a qmra scheme this reveals the risk of infection here we performed case studies to assess the health risks to swimmers at the beach of morges a popular summer swimming spot fig 1 two wastewater treatment plants were considered as the major sources of virus contamination in the morges region namely the vidy wwtp 8 km east of morges beach and the morges wwtp 1 5 km east of morges beach fig 1 cases were analyzed assuming a failure in the wwtps due to technical difficulties extreme weather or any other possible cause in such cases untreated sewage is directly discharged into the surface water via the stormwater outlets near the vidy wwtp and the morges wwtp the sewage discharge was set to 0 7 m3 s and 5 m3 s for the morges wwtp and the vidy wwtp respectively based on their maximum capacities the water quality model simulated the fate and transport of viruses in this raw sewage after discharge into the lake for a time span over one week with three days of continuous release followed by four days of dry period without any discharge of raw wastewater driven by the actual meteorological conditions observed for periods in 2019 as boundary conditions simulations were performed every two weeks per month in 2019 yielding 24 cases in total the simulation results were then used as pathogen concentrations at the site of interest for the exposure assessment in the qmra scheme to estimate infection risks to swimmers we performed case studies to test four aspects that influence infection risks i number of contamination sources two scenarios were considered in the first contamination resulted from two simultaneous sources of contamination the vidy wwtp and the morges wwtp whereas in the second scenario vidy wwtp was the only source of contamination in this case study we also assessed the influence of intake water volume on the relative risk posed by the four viruses ii different inactivation processes here three scenarios of virus inactivation in the lake were simulated no inactivation transport only background β 0 inactivation and complete background thermal and solar eq 1 inactivation for the year of 2019 a summer case from august 18 to 25 and a winter case from december 8 to 15 were analyzed while not many people swim in the winter the latter time span was chosen to illustrate the dependence of environmental inactivation processes on season iii variations in virus concentration stochastic simulations were performed taking the variation of the sewage virus concentration into account for this case study the simulation was performed from december 8 to december 15 2019 iv wind direction the wind condition is one of the most critical factors influencing solute transport near the north shore of lake geneva bohle carbonell 1991 to determine the role of wind direction for infection risks results of all 24 simulation cases in 2019 were considered wind directions were categorized into two types the westward wind case which has a mean wind direction of less than 180 during the simulation period and the eastward wind case which has a mean wind direction of more than or equal to 180 during the simulation period this simplified categorization was used to explore the influence of relative wind directions as our observation site is located almost directly at the west of the discharge sites 3 results 3 1 virus concentrations in raw sewage the monthly measurements of the enteric viruses considered are illustrated in fig 2 rotavirus reached the highest concentration and peaked in the winter season while other viruses demonstrated less clear variation patterns according to the limited data set adenovirus and enterovirus had concentrations that were on average 1 3 orders of magnitude lower compared with those of rotavirus and norovirus for each of the viral species a poisson lognormal distribution and a poisson gamma distribution were employed to fit the measurement data because the ccdf curve of empirical data suggested bimodality for rotavirus fig s2 separate fits were performed for the summer june to november and winter december to may data table 3 summarizes the statistics of the pln and pga distributions the ccdf curves which indicate for each distribution the probability of exceeding a given virus concentration are shown in fig 3 as seen from fig 3 both pln and pga distributions fit the observed sewage virus concentrations well for the dicm calculations the pln method gave a slightly smaller deviance than the pga distribution in general the pln distribution for sewage virus concentrations was therefore selected for subsequent analyses fitting the rotavirus concentrations with unimodal pga and pln distributions resulted in a large uncertainty interval at high concentrations fig s2 the concentration curve shown in fig 2 indicated that there was a clear variation over the yearly data for rotavirus that could lead to the bimodal behavior confirming the need to separate data between summer and winter months 3 2 case studies coupling water quality simulations and qmra 3 2 1 effect of the number of contamination sources on virus concentration and infection risk fig 4 depicts the concentration of norovirus on august 20 and august 25 2019 during one simulation from august18 to august 25 2019 assuming both vidy and morges wwtps are sources of untreated sewage as shown in the graphs the maximum virus concentration at the water surface dropped more than one order of magnitude by august 25 near the shore after the releasing event that ended on august 20 the plume travelled mostly westward to morges from vidy bay whereas a small portion of the viruses were transported far to the east and reached close to montreux the virus concentration and risk levels at the beach site of morges was then investigated for the same simulation case and for the four types of viruses fig 5 illustrates the change of water quality in terms of virus concentration and infectious risk of the viruses over time while fig s3 demonstrates the results of the same case study yet with a lower water intake volume of only 16 ml per person as can be seen from fig 5a and c under the specific environmental conditions during august 18 to august 25 2019 the influence of the morges wwtp on the water quality of the beach site at morges is dominant despite discharge volume from morges being substantially lower than the discharge volume from vidy the first peak in virus concentration on august 19 is directly linked to the nearby release of the virus contaminated sewage when only the more distant vidy wwtp was considered fig 5c the virus concentrations at the beach of morges were lower in particular during the first five days of the simulation though they increased towards the end of the simulation period due to hydrodynamic transport a longer period of simulation revealed that the influence of this discharge event peaked on august 25 and then rapidly declined fig s4 the infection risks for most of the viruses were up to 100 times 2 logs lower in the scenario with only one contamination source apart from norovirus which remained high even with only one source of contamination fig 5d this exception for norovirus can be rationalized by the relatively high norovirus concentrations in the sewage along with the high assumed water intake rate 100 ml intake of lake water in one event and the dose response curve of norovirus which has a much lower 50 infectious dose 82 gc than the other viruses 799 to 1 4 105 gc fig s1 the risks posed by norovirus would decrease if an average intake value of 16 ml was chosen instead of the highly conservative100 ml fig s3 however while the risks associated with the other viruses declined almost linearly with the reduction of water intake the decrease in risks posed by norovirus was only minor because even at a lower water intake volume the ingested dose was high ultimately the relative risk posed by norovirus compared to the other three viruses was thus larger at low water intake volumes compared to higher ones finally it is worth noting that a higher virus concentration does not always lead to higher infection risk among different virus types fig 5c and d specifically adenovirus could pose a higher risk than rotavirus even when the concentration of adenovirus was lower 3 2 2 contribution of different environmental inactivation processes on virus concentration and infection risk figs 6 and 7 depicts the nearshore virus concentrations a d and the probability of infection risks e h for the four types of viruses included in this study under different inactivation conditions in the summer case and the winter case respectively as the figures indicate environmental stressors have different impacts on the four virus species studied depending on the season for the summer case study when comparing nearshore virus concentrations resulting from transport alone red traces in fig 6 to those resulting from both transport and environmental inactivation blue traces it is evident that environmental inactivation affected enterovirus and rotavirus concentrations to a greater extent than norovirus however even norovirus concentrations were lowered by more than 60 due to environmental inactivation when all stressors were included compared to the concentration arising from transport alone fig 6c the relative contributions of the different environmental inactivation processes also varied between viruses as revealed in fig 6a d thermal and solar inactivation contributed 35 of the total inactivation rate averaged from the results of the four types of viruses whereas background inactivation contributed 65 yet the contribution of solar and thermal inactivation was much higher for adenovirus 62 and norovirus 51 than for enterovirus 5 and rotavirus 23 whose inactivation were dominated by background inactivation the influence of environmental stressors on the infection risks therefore also differed between virus species fig 6e f at the end of the simulation background and solar inactivation combined could reduce the infection risk by about three orders of magnitude for enterovirus on august 25 fig 6f difference between red and blue trace whereas for norovirus the environmental stressors only reduced the risk level by 15 compared to the cases where only transport was considered however the situation in the winter case study revealed some different characteristics compared with the summer case simulations first it is noticeable that in the winter case simulations with a complete inactivation blue traces yielded a higher virus concentration and risks compared with the simulations considering only the background inactivation black traces this result is associated with the fact that the background inactivation was defined for a constant reference temperature of 15 ºc the actual water temperature in winter however is below 15 ºc the rate constant for complete inactivation which includes temperature effects is therefore lower than that of the background scenario second peak nearshore virus concentrations under the specific conditions of the winter scenario were lower than those in the summer scenario this can be attributed to both differences in the hydrodynamic conditions as well as the concentrations in sewage fig 2 the combined effect is particularly pronounced for enterovirus which exhibits lower sewage concentrations in december than in august fig 2 and which therefore exhibited about 20 fold lower nearshore concentrations in the winter third the impact of environmental stressors on the infectious virus concentrations blue traces was minor for all viruses the largest absolute decline in concentration at the end of the simulation period due to virus inactivation was observed for norovirus but corresponded to only 0 18 gc ml in winter december 15 panel 7c in comparison in the summer scenario the reduction in norovirus concentration at the end of the simulation period was 7 83 gc ml august 25 panel 6c on a relative scale environmental stressors had the greatest effect on enterovirus followed by rotavirus similar to what was observed in summer and finally consistent with lower virus concentrations the mean infections risk for all the four viruses were also slightly lower for the winter case compared with the summer case in particular for enterovirus the differences between the risks obtained from transport alone red trace and those including complete virus inactivation blue trace were also much smaller in winter with the largest difference at around only 1 log at the end of the simulation for enterovirus december 15 panel 7f 3 2 3 variability in infection risk due to variations in virus concentration in sewage as was discussed above virus concentrations in sewage are subject to some variation fig 2 and this variation can be modeled by a poisson lognormal distribution fig 3 fig 8 depicts how variations in virus concentrations can influence the infection risk at the morges beach using a stochastic simulation performed for december 2019 here the results are based on the best fit parameterization of the pln distribution for each enteric virus type the effect of the parametric uncertainty of the pln distribution is illustrated in the supplemental file figs s5 and s6 the inclusion of parametric uncertainty gives a wider range in the possible risk values however the variability in the virus concentration is still the dominant factor in determining the shape of the risk curves as depicted in the graphs the infection risk of norovirus remained the highest among the virus species considered while enterovirus had the lowest risk levels among the four viruses studied adenovirus had the largest range of probabilities of infection per swimming event which spanned from below 10 4 to around 10 this large range can be attributed to the comparatively high variance in the concentrations of adenovirus in the raw sewage 3 2 4 influence of wind direction on infection risks simulations were carried out twice per month for all of 2019 and the resulting risk levels at the morges beach are summarized in table 4 categorized by wind conditions we emphasize that the simulated risk levels are conservative given the high water intake volume of 100 ml used norovirus had the highest mean event risk throughout the year whereas enterovirus had the lowest infection risk which was more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that of norovirus under eastward wind conditions the infection risks of all viruses were noticeably lower than that under westward wind conditions except for norovirus which was acute under both wind conditions on average the infection risks under eastward wind conditions were 43 lower than that under westward wind conditions 4 discussion in this work we coupled measured virus concentrations in sewage virus transport virus inactivation and qmra models to investigate the fate of waterborne viruses from their release at pipe outlets to the risks they pose to human at recreational water sites among the viruses studied it was demonstrated that norovirus had the highest annual mean risk while the mean risk exerted by enterovirus was several orders of magnitude lower table 4 this finding is aligned with previous studies indicating that norovirus causes the highest risks among many commonly found enteric viruses soller et al 2010 vergara et al 2016 adenovirus and rotavirus had similar annual mean risks which were also at least one order lower than that of norovirus the measurements of sewage virus concentration indicated possible seasonality for the enteric viruses especially for rotavirus two simple parametric distributions the pln and pga distributions were able to fit the virus measurement data well these mixed distributions provide alternatives for studies concerning characterization of wastewater virus concentrations using simple component distributions which typically rely on weibull verani et al 2019 vergara et al 2016 or lognormal distributions sunger et al 2019 to describe pathogen concentrations we found that physical distance from the contamination source and meteorological parameters e g irradiance wind as well as season were essential factors affecting infection risks and that the inclusion of environmental inactivation in risk assessments could lead to substantially lower risk estimates compared to transport processes alone the case studies highlighted the importance of combining water quality simulations and qmra for the study of fate and transport of waterborne viruses near recreational water sites in lakes such significance is needless to say not confined in the scope of recreational sites in lakes but also confirmed by studies dedicated to drinking water systems sokolova et al 2015 and rivers and catchments schijven et al 2015 4 1 the distance to the contamination sources has direct influence on the risk intuitively the relative distance to contamination site is likely a critical factor influencing the concentration levels and resulting infection risks at the observation site of interest this has been well confirmed by our simulation of two contamination sources that are either distant vidy wwtp or close morges wwtp to the beach of interest fig 5 the maximum virus concentration was more than 30 times lower if contamination stemmed only from the distant site vidy wwtp compared with the scenario with contributions from both sites even though the discharge rate at the vidy wwtp was much larger than that at morges wwtp 5 m3 s versus 0 7 m3 s the major contamination at the beach of morges was triggered by the discharge at morges wwtp the lake water between vidy bay and the morges beach site thus served as a buffer area and diluted the virus plume to a large extent however while the infection risks of adenovirus enterovirus and rotavirus dropped significantly if only one contamination site was considered that of norovirus did not experience much reduction compared with the case with both sources this highlights the exceptionally infectious nature of norovirus even at small concentrations which is also related to the exceptionally acute dose response relationship another important aspect controlling the risk level was the time elapsed since the contamination event which has been mentioned in many other studies boehm et al 2018 demonstrated that aging of contamination can largely affect the resultant risks and wu et al 2020 indicated that lack of information on the contamination age impedes reliable estimation of the health risk taking adenovirus as an example in the week long simulation case with two sources the maximum risk reached 0 35 whereas three days later this risk level was below 0 016 if an individual were informed of such virus releasing events and the transport dynamics one may plan recreational water activities accordingly and avert the risk of being infected by adenovirus by more than 20 fold 1 3 log coupling hydrodynamics and environmental decay alleviates the challenge of not knowing the age of a contamination plume which is particularly problematic when water quality is assessed based on indicators 4 2 environmental stressors noticeably reduce the infection probability exerted by viruses with low background inactivation in summer but effects in the winter are minor adding on the effect of transport and dilution which are critical factors in many cases environmental inactivation further lowered the infection risk in particular during the summer and in most pronounced fashion for enterovirus however different viruses underwent very different levels of inactivation and the contribution of different environmental stressors also varied between virus species and seasons for the summer on average the fraction of inactivation by solar and thermal stressors was much greater for adenovirus and norovirus than for enterovirus and rotavirus fig 6 this can be explained by the lower background inactivation rate of adenovirus and norovirus combined with comparatively high thermal inactivation coefficients table 1 correspondingly the reduction of infection risks was also significantly different among viruses risk reduction due to environmental inactivation was up to three orders of magnitude larger for enterovirus than for adenovirus and norovirus for the winter however the effect of environmental stressors on virus inactivation was less pronounced than in the summer the background simulation which assumes a reference water temperature of 15 ºc showed a reduction in virus concentration compared to transport alone fig 7 this reduction is also evident in the complete scenario which accounted for the actual water temperature encountered in winter however compared to the background simulation the effect of environmental stressors was smaller reflecting the fact that environmental stressors are less effective at inactivating viruses at low temperatures the results in winter also imply that inactivation due to solar radiation was relatively weak as the reduction of inactivation due to low temperature outweighed the increase of inactivation brought about by winter solar radiation the minor contribution of radiation on virus inactivation in cold seasons was also reported in studies concerning infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus by foreman et al 2015 these case studies indicate that combining comprehensive water quality simulation and qmra is necessary in dealing with risk evaluation for waterborne virus transport processes in natural water bodies with the necessity of specific consideration for different types of viruses and seasonality 4 3 infection probability depends on dominant wind direction by summarizing the 24 simulation cases in 2019 the annual risk characterization permits a statistical analysis on the risk levels and some essential factors affecting the risks such as wind fields since the beach site of morges is located west of both the vidy bay and the morges wwtp an eastward wind would favor the lower concentrations at the observation site the risks under eastward wind conditions were noticeably lower than that under westward wind conditions take norovirus as an example under persistent eastward wind conditions the contamination plume could travel as far east as to the rhône river inlet while under strong westward winds even though the plume did not reach the rhône river outlet at geneva the contaminant was observed in the petit lac the small western part of lake geneva si fig s7 these results highlight the importance of the impact of hydrodynamic transport on virus concentrations as well as the unrivalled power of water quality models in offering an inclusive prediction of the fate and transport of virus in lakes which was also addressed in infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus transport studies for coastal regions foreman et al 2015 4 4 limitations and outlook the framework proposed in our study expands the scope of coupled water quality and risk models to viruses in lakes however several limitations remain firstly only background temperature driven and solar inactivation of virus were considered in our study while other factors may also contribute to virus removal from the water column for instance the model could be expanded to include virus adsorption to particles and subsequent settling processes which has been mostly addressed in wastewater treatment rather than in natural water bodies templeton et al 2008 once field studies provide sufficient data to parameterize this process secondly model validation is challenging it is difficult to conduct sampling campaigns for virus concentration measurements at recreational sites because infectious virus concentration is often low and only a fraction of viruses circulating in the environment can be quantified by available culturing systems it is also not possible to overcome this limitation by performing spike in experiments with human virus in the field due to biosafety considerations a field measurement campaign to validate the model would have gone beyond the scope of this work but is envisioned for future applications of the model thirdly the current parameterization of environmental virus inactivation is based on an integrated data set across water bodies and virus strains for higher simulation accuracy site and viral strain specific parameterization would be beneficial finally the qmra could be further refined specifically our data set of sewage virus concentrations was too small to rigorously capture seasonality trends to improve the results and reduce the uncertainties in an intuitive way more data of the sewage virus concentration measurement would be favorable in addition we used single scenario values for the water intake volume the dose response curves and dose harmonization factors in reality however these values are variables and scenario dependent for example schets et al 2011 found that the water intake volume was dependent on gender age and where the swimming activities take place furthermore dose response curves vary depending on assumptions regarding the susceptibility of the hosts messner et al 2014 or aggregation of the virus van abel et al 2017 and finally the dose harmonization was found to be dependent on virus species as well as the culturing method applied jonsson et al 2008 to incorporate these uncertainties together with our study could further consolidate the risk assessment for waterborne virus in lakes 5 conclusions this study proposes a coupled water quality and risk model to assess the fate of waterborne viruses from their release to the environment to the associated risks they pose to human at a recreational water site our case studies indicate that both transport and environmental inactivation processes are essential in determining the virus concentration at a site of interest furthermore the incorporation of spatially and temporally varying inactivation processes in water quality models is important for evaluating the infection risks the relative significance of transport and environmental stressors on the infection risks were demonstrated to be highly dependent on the season meteorological conditions wind direction and the virus type of concern environmental stressors tend to enhance virus inactivation in summer whereas in winter the effects are in part attenuated by colder water temperatures averaged over a year the infection risks with a mean wind direction that is blowing from the observation site towards the discharge location were 43 lower than that under the reverse condition for the site of concern in this study the results further showed that norovirus was the most problematic virus species among the four viruses studied and posed a risk that was usually at least one order of magnitude greater than that posed by the other viruses however as one example showed with an informed assessment of the water quality near the beach and an enlightened plan to carry out recreational water activities one may avert the risk of infection by waterborne virus by more than 20 folds only by delaying the timing of water related activities for three days despite certain limitations this study serves as one of the first endeavors to integrate virus concentration measurement virus transport and spatiotemporally varying inactivation simulation as well as qmra for risk evaluation of waterborne viruses at recreational water sites the model proposed

15222,waterborne enteric viruses in lakes especially at recreational water sites may have a negative impact on human health however their fate and transport in lakes are poorly understood in this study we propose a coupled water quality and quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model to study the transport fate and infection risk of four common waterborne viruses adenovirus enterovirus norovirus and rotavirus using lake geneva as a study site the measured virus load in raw sewage entering the lake was used as the source term in the water quality simulations for a hypothetical scenario of discharging raw wastewater at the lake surface after discharge into the lake virus inactivation was modeled as a function of water temperature and solar irradiance that varied both spatially and temporally during transport throughout the lake finally the probability of infection while swimming at a popular beach was quantified and compared among the four viruses norovirus was found to be the most abundant virus that causes an infection probability that is at least 10 times greater than the other viruses studied furthermore environmental inactivation was found to be an essential determinant in the infection risks posed by viruses to recreational water users we determined that infection risks by enterovirus and rotavirus could be up to 1000 times lower when virus inactivation by environmental stressors was accounted for compared with the scenarios considering hydrodynamic transport only finally the model highlighted the role of the wind field in conveying the contamination plume and hence in determining infection probability our simulations revealed that for beaches located west of the sewage discharge the infection probability under eastward wind was 43 lower than that under westward wind conditions this study highlights the potential of combining water quality simulation and virus specific risk assessment for a safe water resources usage and

disease outbreaks cabelli 1983 sinclair et al 2009 yet viral contamination in recreational waters is rarely directly monitored because traditional culturing assays are time consuming and molecular techniques tend to overestimate the infectious virus concentrations in a sample farkas et al 2020 instead the microbial quality of surface water is often assessed by monitoring fecal indicator bacteria such as e coli who scientific group 1979 which are much easier to measure although previous studies of waterborne diseases outbreaks showed that bacteriological indicators are typically present when viral outbreaks occur the occurrence of fecal coliforms in recreational water sites does not necessarily indicate viral pollution sinclair et al 2009 thus it is critical to specifically consider viral pathogens when assessing the risk of infection during recreational water use nevertheless viral pathogens are typically not included in water quality monitoring programs boehm et al 2009 who 2021 although progress has been made in detecting enteric viruses in recreational water samples using pcr based molecular methods the temporal resolution of such measurements is limited due to the cost and complexity of the methods and the requirement of proficient expertise to perform the measurements tong et al 2011 adding to the complexity of monitoring efforts is environmental virus inactivation which is an important factor limiting the infectious virus concentration in the environment boehm et al 2018 if the source of contamination is located at a distance from the monitoring site and the polluted water has aged the virus concentration measured by molecular methods may greatly overestimate the infectious concentration hamza et al 2011 despite the challenges in monitoring waterborne pathogen contamination in natural water bodies scientists have long endeavored to understand the emergence and transport of pathogens in aquatic systems documented studies of waterborne pathogens in lakes trace back to the early 20th century mclaughlin 1912 entering the 21st century the concept of modeling rather than monitoring pathogen concentrations in lakes started to gain popularity modeling approaches offer opportunities for insight into pathogen concentrations at monitoring sites without the needs for frequent measurements numerical models have the potential to provide continuous information in space and time and three dimensional analysis is usually more accessible compared to monitoring methods among different approaches water quality models appear particularly suited to deal with virus transport effectively one reason is that a key factor determining the fate of viruses in the environment the inactivation of viruses which varies according to specific environmental conditions can be readily included in water quality models schijven et al 2015 the study of virus inactivation itself is therefore a crucial topic a meta analysis method to estimate the inactivation rate of different viruses as a function of water temperature solar irradiation virus species and various other parameters was recently put forward by boehm et al 2019 based on a systematic review of measured virus inactivation rates in surface waters nevertheless to the best of our knowledge this information has not yet been utilized to establish water quality models dedicated to the simulation of waterborne viruses in lakes water quality models that neglect impacts of virus inactivation fail to capture attenuation of risks due to spatial heterogeneity in transport most water quality models have been applied to non viral pathogens in lakes for example hipsey et al 2004 suggested a three dimensional model to predict cryptosporidium parvum oocyst dynamics in lakes and reservoirs a few years later these authors proposed a comprehensive process based model to address the issue of microbial pollution in aquatic systems hipsey et al 2008 though simulations for viral pathogens were lacking later studies coupled hydrodynamic models and microbial transport simulation for fecal indicator bacteria and cryptosporidium spp eregno et al 2016 tolouei et al 2019 however inactivation was either omitted or simply modeled as a constant value the results were furthermore coupled with a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra these studies thus assessed not only the fate and transport of pathogens in lakes but also the resulting risk of human infection apart from studies employing mechanistic models studies applying analytical regression or bayesian network approaches also demonstrated capability in predicting water quality conditions rigosi et al 2015 searcy et al 2018 trung thanh et al 2021 wong et al 2009 compared with bacterial or protistean pathogens less attention has been dedicated to simulating the risks posed by viruses in recreational water sites even though the health risks cause by viruses can outweigh those caused by bacteria viau et al 2011 one study specifically addressing risks resulting from viral contamination was performed by foreman et al 2015 who proposed a coupled hydrodynamic virus inactivation and risk model dedicated to the study of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus a fish virus that infects salmon and trout and causes important losses in fish farm industry however while these authors did consider virus inactivation the model did not account for temperature dependence of this process a similar approach was also used by sokolova et al 2015 to estimate the infection risk for human norovirus however this study focused on drinking water safety and virus inactivation was not considered a comprehensive tool to estimate microbial contamination based on a surface water quality model in combination with qmra was proposed by schijven et al 2015 this tool which was intended for rivers included thermal virus inactivation but not solar inactivation a study focusing specifically on the health risks exerted by different human viruses in lakes is imperative yet lacking models of health risks associated with human viral pathogens in lakes would aid policy decisions designed to reduce transmission in this work we propose a combined water quality and quantitative microbial risk assessment model to comprehensively study the transport fate and infection risk of four major human waterborne viral pathogens arising from wastewater discharge into a large lake we specifically focus on how environmental virus inactivation affects the risks at recreational water sites and we compare the risk levels of the different viruses included we use lake geneva located on the border of switzerland and france as a study site lake geneva has a surface area of 580 km2 and volume of 89 km3 with a maximum depth of 310 m it is used as a recreational site and as a drinking water source by more than 800 000 people and it also receives the discharge of several wastewater treatment plants our target virus species include adenovirus enterovirus norovirus and rotavirus these viruses are frequently detected in sewage gholipour et al 2022 lodder and de roda husman 2005 and are classified to have a moderate to high health significance who 2011 we incorporate spatially and temporally varying inactivation rates of these viruses in our module dedicated to virus simulations and we compute the risk of infection to swimmers at a popular recreational site at the shore of lake geneva for a hypothetical scenario of discharging raw wastewater at the surface of the lake 2 material and methods 2 1 hydrodynamic modeling delft3d an open source three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic and water quality simulation software https oss deltares nl web delft3d was employed to perform numerical simulations in the shore region of lake geneva both the hydrodynamic flow and the water quality dwaq modules were used the flow model in delft3d solves the shallow water equations as well as the transport equations in 3d deltares 2015 while the water quality module computes solute transport under a eulerian framework directly coupled to the hydrodynamic module the hydrodynamic model with 100 layers in the vertical direction using the z layer gridding system a horizontal grid resolution of around 400 m and a time step of 1 min has been fully calibrated and validated baracchini et al 2020a we employed the result of the hydrodynamic model which has been placed on an online simulation platform for lake geneva http meteolakes ch baracchini et al 2020b meteorological conditions such as wind direction solar radiation humidity and temperature were included as driving forces the water quality model based on a lagrangian framework was validated in a previous study li et al 2022 here we used the equivalent water quality model with identical dispersion coefficients though in a eulerian framework 2 2 virus inactivation modeling virus inactivation was modeled using the water quality module of delft3d directly coupled to the hydrodynamic module from meteolakes each virus species was regarded as a degradable tracer in this module the transport of viruses was passive and governed by the flow of the hydrodynamic module whereas the inactivation of each viral species was specifically defined in each grid cell according to the approach proposed by boehm et al 2019 1 l o g 10 k β 0 i 1 n β i x i ε where k is the first order inactivation rate constant day 1 for a given viral species β 0 represents the model estimate for background inactivation likely chemical and microbial processes under reference conditions in darkness at 15 β i represents the coefficient for each of the model variables x i temperature t 15 and irradiance i and ε is a gaussian white noise term representing the error in this study we included two inactivation processes namely thermal β t e m p t 15 c and solar inactivation β s o l a r i note that thermal inactivation may include both direct and indirect e g driven by temperature mediated changes in microbial grazing effects of water temperature on virus inactivation compared to the model by boehm et al 2019 the contribution of solar radiation was further refined while boehm et al 2019 modeled the contribution of solar inactivation as a binary value that depends solely on the presence or absence of sunlight we accounted here for daily cloud coverage and solar radiation conditions in lake geneva and modeled the solar inactivation as a continuous variable specifically we scaled the coefficients β s o l a r reported by boehm et al 2019 according to differences in irradiance observed throughout the year hereby the reported value of β s o l a r was assumed to represent irradiance conditions consistent with those observed on average during the month of august 2019 highest average monthly irradiance in 2019 the coefficients for other irradiance conditions were scaled linearly according to the value of the solar radiation measured to this end we used daily ground level radiation data for the lake geneva region provided by meteoswiss https www meteoswiss admin ch meteoswiss reports only global irradiance data whereas direct solar inactivation of enteric viruses depends mainly on the uvb range of 280 320 nm nelson et al 2018 here we assumed that the uvb range scales linearly with the global irradiance finally we also considered that the solar inactivation is a depth dependent process because lake water readily attenuates light in the uvb region the irradiance i z at each depth z was determined based on beer lambert s law 2 i z d z u v b 10 α u v b z where d z u v b j s 1 m 2 represents the downwelling irradiance obtained from meteoswiss and α u v b is the absorbance of the water column of lake geneva over the uvb range for lake geneva water we used an average lake water absorbance α 320 n m 0 02 cm 1 according to measurements olive et al 2020 values of β 0 β t e m p and β s o l a r at the surface were taken from the literature boehm et al 2019 whereas solar inactivation beneath the water surface was calculated according to eq 2 table 1 summarizes the β values used in the water quality simulations 2 3 sample collection and processing of raw sewage 24 h composite samples of raw sewage were obtained from the vidy wastewater treatment plant wwtp near lausanne which collects wastewater of 220 000 inhabitant equivalents samples were collected once a month between november 2018 and october 2019 collected samples were stored at 20 ºc until further processing prior to processing samples were thawed at room temperature to concentrate the samples 600 ml aliquots of raw sewage were sequentially filtered through a 2 µm glass fiber pre filters cat nº ap2007500 merck millipore burlington ma usa a 0 45 µm stericup filter cat nº s2hvu02re merck millipore and a 0 22 µm stericup filter cat nº scgvu02re merck millipore the filtrate was successively transferred in batches of 50 ml to four different centrifugal filter units with a size cut off of 100 kda centricon plus 70 cat nº ufc701008 merck millipore and centrifuged for 30 min at 300 g after centrifugation the filtrate was discarded and each centrifugal filter unit was loaded again with 50 ml sample until the entire 600 ml sample was processed finally the four different centrifugal filters were inverted and centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 g to obtain the viral concentrate eluted viruses from each centricon unit were pooled and the final volume of the viral concentrate was adjusted to 2 ml by using phosphate buffered saline cat nº 18 912 014 thermofisher scientific 2 4 nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr quantification viral nucleic acids na were extracted from 140 µl of viral concentrate by using the qiagen rna viral mini kit cat nº 22 906 qiagen valencia ca usa and the automated qiacube system qiagen valencia ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions for each processed batch of sample a negative extraction control consisting in dnase rnase free molecular water was included na were preserved at 80 ºc until further use previously published qpcr or rt qpcr assays were used to quantify the four waterborne viruses of interest namely human adenovirus bofill mas et al 2006 hernroth et al 2002 enterovirus fout et al 2016 monpoeho et al 2000 tsai et al 1993 noroviruses including genogroup gi da silva et al 2007 hoehne and schreier 2006 svraka et al 2007 genogroup gii kageyama et al 2003 loisy et al 2005 and genogroup giv miura et al 2013 and rotavirus zeng et al 2008 primers and probes used as well as the pcr thermal profiles used are detailed in the supplemental information table s1 all amplifications were performed in a final reaction volume of 25 µl and using ten fold diluted na viral extracts as a template to minimize inhibition for adenovirus master mixes were prepared using the taqman environmental master mix 2 0 life technologies foster city ca usa and 10 µl of ten fold diluted na extracts were added as template for enterovirus norovirus and rotavirus master mixes were prepared using rna ultrasense one step quantitative rt pcr system cat nº 11 732 927 invitrogen carlsbad ca usa and 5 µl of ten fold diluted na extracts were added as template all qpcr and rt qpcr reactions were performed on a mic qpcr cycler bio molecular systems upper coomera queensland australia all runs were performed in duplicate and included no template controls and negative extraction controls to identify any source of contamination during sample processing in order to provide an absolute quantification of genome copies gc qpcr and rt qpcr standard curves were generated for each viral target using double stranded dna gblocks gene fragments at known concentration purchased from integrated dna technologies coralville ia usa 2 5 temporal variations in virus concentrations in sewage parametric probability distributions were selected to describe variability and uncertainty in concentrations of each virus species based on monitoring data we employed two mixed poisson distributions the poisson lognormal distribution pln and the poisson gamma distribution pga to describe temporal variations and selected the better fit among the two according to their marginal deviance information criterion dicm values sylvestre et al 2021 a difference in dicm of a least 3 points was considered to be significant for model selection the probability density function of the poisson lognormal distribution for a random variable x here the virus count in the sewage sample is 3 p p l n x 0 μ v x e x p μ v x 1 μ s 2 π e x p ln μ ζ 2 2 s 2 d μ where v is the volume of the sample μ is the mean virus concentration in the sample ζ is the mean of the logarithm of the virus concentration and s is the standard deviation of the logarithm of the virus concentration the probability density function of the poisson gamma distribution for a random variable x is given by 4 p p g a x 0 μ v x e x p μ v x 1 γ γ δ μ γ δ 1 e x p μ γ d μ where v is the volume of the sample μ is the mean virus concentration in the sample and γ and δ are parameters of a gamma distribution which has a mean of γ δ and a variance of δ γ 2 mixed poisson distributions were chosen to fit the data as they allow for greater variability in the expected count of the sample than a poisson distribution with a fixed mean concentration haas et al 2014a bayesian inference was carried out using a monte carlo markov chain mcmc method as described in sylvestre et al 2021 briefly the priors selected for the lognormal distribution parameters were a diffuse uniform prior for the mean μ i u 10 10 and a vague exponential prior for the standard deviation σ i exp 0 1 three markov chains were run for 106 iterations after a burn in phase of 104 iterations temporal variations in sewage virus concentrations were illustrated with complementary cumulative distribution functions ccdf curves to assess the behavior of the upper tail of these distributions 2 6 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra the qmra process has four main components hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization fewtrell 2013 hazard identification serves to determine the pathogen or pathogen group of interest here the hazard is any event or activities that may cause the discharge of virus contaminated raw sewage into lake geneva such as a heavy rain event exposure assessment combines data on the pathogen concentration at the site of interest with information on the rate of intake by an individual particularly the contact time of lake water to swimmers or direct ingestion of lake water by swimmers for a conservative estimation we assumed that 100 ml of virus contaminated water is swallowed by one person during each recreational water event who 2003 this water intake is high compared to other studies which have reported that the average water volumes swallowed by adults and children in swimming pools are 16 ml and 37 ml respectively dufour et al 2006 we addressed the variability of this intake value in one of our simulation cases the risk characterization is done by integrating the exposure and dose response models to estimate per swimming event negative health outcomes infection as a function of the number of viruses ingested in this study the exponential dose response model were employed for enterovirus cliver 1981 beta poisson models were applied to adenovirus teunis et al 2016 and rotavirus haas et al 2014b ward et al 1986 and a beta binomial model was chosen for norovirus teunis et al 2020 curves of those dose response models are illustrated in the supplemental information fig s1 the virus dose response models were originally established using different dose units whereas viruses in this study were quantified in terms of genome copies section 2 4 therefore a dose harmonization was conducted to normalize the dose unit of the four types of virus of interest we followed the dose harmonization rule proposed by mcbride et al 2013 specifically we applied the following conversions shown in table 2 monte carlo stochastic simulations were performed to estimate uncertainties in the computation scheme using r v4 1 2 we considered uncertainties associated with virus sewage concentration but omitted those associated with water intake volumes this approach was chosen because the latter uncertainties were not expected to largely affect the relative impact of environmental virus inactivation on health risks which is the main object of this study we also did not consider uncertainties associated with dose response modeling as studies have shown that risks pose by some enteric viruses were insensitive to dose response parameters viau et al 2011 a total of 10 000 realizations were generated for each type of virus and the uncertainties were computed using a markov chain monte carlo method 2 7 case studies coupling water quality simulations and qmra using the abovementioned water quality model we can compute virus concentrations near the shore of lake geneva and when coupled to a qmra scheme this reveals the risk of infection here we performed case studies to assess the health risks to swimmers at the beach of morges a popular summer swimming spot fig 1 two wastewater treatment plants were considered as the major sources of virus contamination in the morges region namely the vidy wwtp 8 km east of morges beach and the morges wwtp 1 5 km east of morges beach fig 1 cases were analyzed assuming a failure in the wwtps due to technical difficulties extreme weather or any other possible cause in such cases untreated sewage is directly discharged into the surface water via the stormwater outlets near the vidy wwtp and the morges wwtp the sewage discharge was set to 0 7 m3 s and 5 m3 s for the morges wwtp and the vidy wwtp respectively based on their maximum capacities the water quality model simulated the fate and transport of viruses in this raw sewage after discharge into the lake for a time span over one week with three days of continuous release followed by four days of dry period without any discharge of raw wastewater driven by the actual meteorological conditions observed for periods in 2019 as boundary conditions simulations were performed every two weeks per month in 2019 yielding 24 cases in total the simulation results were then used as pathogen concentrations at the site of interest for the exposure assessment in the qmra scheme to estimate infection risks to swimmers we performed case studies to test four aspects that influence infection risks i number of contamination sources two scenarios were considered in the first contamination resulted from two simultaneous sources of contamination the vidy wwtp and the morges wwtp whereas in the second scenario vidy wwtp was the only source of contamination in this case study we also assessed the influence of intake water volume on the relative risk posed by the four viruses ii different inactivation processes here three scenarios of virus inactivation in the lake were simulated no inactivation transport only background β 0 inactivation and complete background thermal and solar eq 1 inactivation for the year of 2019 a summer case from august 18 to 25 and a winter case from december 8 to 15 were analyzed while not many people swim in the winter the latter time span was chosen to illustrate the dependence of environmental inactivation processes on season iii variations in virus concentration stochastic simulations were performed taking the variation of the sewage virus concentration into account for this case study the simulation was performed from december 8 to december 15 2019 iv wind direction the wind condition is one of the most critical factors influencing solute transport near the north shore of lake geneva bohle carbonell 1991 to determine the role of wind direction for infection risks results of all 24 simulation cases in 2019 were considered wind directions were categorized into two types the westward wind case which has a mean wind direction of less than 180 during the simulation period and the eastward wind case which has a mean wind direction of more than or equal to 180 during the simulation period this simplified categorization was used to explore the influence of relative wind directions as our observation site is located almost directly at the west of the discharge sites 3 results 3 1 virus concentrations in raw sewage the monthly measurements of the enteric viruses considered are illustrated in fig 2 rotavirus reached the highest concentration and peaked in the winter season while other viruses demonstrated less clear variation patterns according to the limited data set adenovirus and enterovirus had concentrations that were on average 1 3 orders of magnitude lower compared with those of rotavirus and norovirus for each of the viral species a poisson lognormal distribution and a poisson gamma distribution were employed to fit the measurement data because the ccdf curve of empirical data suggested bimodality for rotavirus fig s2 separate fits were performed for the summer june to november and winter december to may data table 3 summarizes the statistics of the pln and pga distributions the ccdf curves which indicate for each distribution the probability of exceeding a given virus concentration are shown in fig 3 as seen from fig 3 both pln and pga distributions fit the observed sewage virus concentrations well for the dicm calculations the pln method gave a slightly smaller deviance than the pga distribution in general the pln distribution for sewage virus concentrations was therefore selected for subsequent analyses fitting the rotavirus concentrations with unimodal pga and pln distributions resulted in a large uncertainty interval at high concentrations fig s2 the concentration curve shown in fig 2 indicated that there was a clear variation over the yearly data for rotavirus that could lead to the bimodal behavior confirming the need to separate data between summer and winter months 3 2 case studies coupling water quality simulations and qmra 3 2 1 effect of the number of contamination sources on virus concentration and infection risk fig 4 depicts the concentration of norovirus on august 20 and august 25 2019 during one simulation from august18 to august 25 2019 assuming both vidy and morges wwtps are sources of untreated sewage as shown in the graphs the maximum virus concentration at the water surface dropped more than one order of magnitude by august 25 near the shore after the releasing event that ended on august 20 the plume travelled mostly westward to morges from vidy bay whereas a small portion of the viruses were transported far to the east and reached close to montreux the virus concentration and risk levels at the beach site of morges was then investigated for the same simulation case and for the four types of viruses fig 5 illustrates the change of water quality in terms of virus concentration and infectious risk of the viruses over time while fig s3 demonstrates the results of the same case study yet with a lower water intake volume of only 16 ml per person as can be seen from fig 5a and c under the specific environmental conditions during august 18 to august 25 2019 the influence of the morges wwtp on the water quality of the beach site at morges is dominant despite discharge volume from morges being substantially lower than the discharge volume from vidy the first peak in virus concentration on august 19 is directly linked to the nearby release of the virus contaminated sewage when only the more distant vidy wwtp was considered fig 5c the virus concentrations at the beach of morges were lower in particular during the first five days of the simulation though they increased towards the end of the simulation period due to hydrodynamic transport a longer period of simulation revealed that the influence of this discharge event peaked on august 25 and then rapidly declined fig s4 the infection risks for most of the viruses were up to 100 times 2 logs lower in the scenario with only one contamination source apart from norovirus which remained high even with only one source of contamination fig 5d this exception for norovirus can be rationalized by the relatively high norovirus concentrations in the sewage along with the high assumed water intake rate 100 ml intake of lake water in one event and the dose response curve of norovirus which has a much lower 50 infectious dose 82 gc than the other viruses 799 to 1 4 105 gc fig s1 the risks posed by norovirus would decrease if an average intake value of 16 ml was chosen instead of the highly conservative100 ml fig s3 however while the risks associated with the other viruses declined almost linearly with the reduction of water intake the decrease in risks posed by norovirus was only minor because even at a lower water intake volume the ingested dose was high ultimately the relative risk posed by norovirus compared to the other three viruses was thus larger at low water intake volumes compared to higher ones finally it is worth noting that a higher virus concentration does not always lead to higher infection risk among different virus types fig 5c and d specifically adenovirus could pose a higher risk than rotavirus even when the concentration of adenovirus was lower 3 2 2 contribution of different environmental inactivation processes on virus concentration and infection risk figs 6 and 7 depicts the nearshore virus concentrations a d and the probability of infection risks e h for the four types of viruses included in this study under different inactivation conditions in the summer case and the winter case respectively as the figures indicate environmental stressors have different impacts on the four virus species studied depending on the season for the summer case study when comparing nearshore virus concentrations resulting from transport alone red traces in fig 6 to those resulting from both transport and environmental inactivation blue traces it is evident that environmental inactivation affected enterovirus and rotavirus concentrations to a greater extent than norovirus however even norovirus concentrations were lowered by more than 60 due to environmental inactivation when all stressors were included compared to the concentration arising from transport alone fig 6c the relative contributions of the different environmental inactivation processes also varied between viruses as revealed in fig 6a d thermal and solar inactivation contributed 35 of the total inactivation rate averaged from the results of the four types of viruses whereas background inactivation contributed 65 yet the contribution of solar and thermal inactivation was much higher for adenovirus 62 and norovirus 51 than for enterovirus 5 and rotavirus 23 whose inactivation were dominated by background inactivation the influence of environmental stressors on the infection risks therefore also differed between virus species fig 6e f at the end of the simulation background and solar inactivation combined could reduce the infection risk by about three orders of magnitude for enterovirus on august 25 fig 6f difference between red and blue trace whereas for norovirus the environmental stressors only reduced the risk level by 15 compared to the cases where only transport was considered however the situation in the winter case study revealed some different characteristics compared with the summer case simulations first it is noticeable that in the winter case simulations with a complete inactivation blue traces yielded a higher virus concentration and risks compared with the simulations considering only the background inactivation black traces this result is associated with the fact that the background inactivation was defined for a constant reference temperature of 15 ºc the actual water temperature in winter however is below 15 ºc the rate constant for complete inactivation which includes temperature effects is therefore lower than that of the background scenario second peak nearshore virus concentrations under the specific conditions of the winter scenario were lower than those in the summer scenario this can be attributed to both differences in the hydrodynamic conditions as well as the concentrations in sewage fig 2 the combined effect is particularly pronounced for enterovirus which exhibits lower sewage concentrations in december than in august fig 2 and which therefore exhibited about 20 fold lower nearshore concentrations in the winter third the impact of environmental stressors on the infectious virus concentrations blue traces was minor for all viruses the largest absolute decline in concentration at the end of the simulation period due to virus inactivation was observed for norovirus but corresponded to only 0 18 gc ml in winter december 15 panel 7c in comparison in the summer scenario the reduction in norovirus concentration at the end of the simulation period was 7 83 gc ml august 25 panel 6c on a relative scale environmental stressors had the greatest effect on enterovirus followed by rotavirus similar to what was observed in summer and finally consistent with lower virus concentrations the mean infections risk for all the four viruses were also slightly lower for the winter case compared with the summer case in particular for enterovirus the differences between the risks obtained from transport alone red trace and those including complete virus inactivation blue trace were also much smaller in winter with the largest difference at around only 1 log at the end of the simulation for enterovirus december 15 panel 7f 3 2 3 variability in infection risk due to variations in virus concentration in sewage as was discussed above virus concentrations in sewage are subject to some variation fig 2 and this variation can be modeled by a poisson lognormal distribution fig 3 fig 8 depicts how variations in virus concentrations can influence the infection risk at the morges beach using a stochastic simulation performed for december 2019 here the results are based on the best fit parameterization of the pln distribution for each enteric virus type the effect of the parametric uncertainty of the pln distribution is illustrated in the supplemental file figs s5 and s6 the inclusion of parametric uncertainty gives a wider range in the possible risk values however the variability in the virus concentration is still the dominant factor in determining the shape of the risk curves as depicted in the graphs the infection risk of norovirus remained the highest among the virus species considered while enterovirus had the lowest risk levels among the four viruses studied adenovirus had the largest range of probabilities of infection per swimming event which spanned from below 10 4 to around 10 this large range can be attributed to the comparatively high variance in the concentrations of adenovirus in the raw sewage 3 2 4 influence of wind direction on infection risks simulations were carried out twice per month for all of 2019 and the resulting risk levels at the morges beach are summarized in table 4 categorized by wind conditions we emphasize that the simulated risk levels are conservative given the high water intake volume of 100 ml used norovirus had the highest mean event risk throughout the year whereas enterovirus had the lowest infection risk which was more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that of norovirus under eastward wind conditions the infection risks of all viruses were noticeably lower than that under westward wind conditions except for norovirus which was acute under both wind conditions on average the infection risks under eastward wind conditions were 43 lower than that under westward wind conditions 4 discussion in this work we coupled measured virus concentrations in sewage virus transport virus inactivation and qmra models to investigate the fate of waterborne viruses from their release at pipe outlets to the risks they pose to human at recreational water sites among the viruses studied it was demonstrated that norovirus had the highest annual mean risk while the mean risk exerted by enterovirus was several orders of magnitude lower table 4 this finding is aligned with previous studies indicating that norovirus causes the highest risks among many commonly found enteric viruses soller et al 2010 vergara et al 2016 adenovirus and rotavirus had similar annual mean risks which were also at least one order lower than that of norovirus the measurements of sewage virus concentration indicated possible seasonality for the enteric viruses especially for rotavirus two simple parametric distributions the pln and pga distributions were able to fit the virus measurement data well these mixed distributions provide alternatives for studies concerning characterization of wastewater virus concentrations using simple component distributions which typically rely on weibull verani et al 2019 vergara et al 2016 or lognormal distributions sunger et al 2019 to describe pathogen concentrations we found that physical distance from the contamination source and meteorological parameters e g irradiance wind as well as season were essential factors affecting infection risks and that the inclusion of environmental inactivation in risk assessments could lead to substantially lower risk estimates compared to transport processes alone the case studies highlighted the importance of combining water quality simulations and qmra for the study of fate and transport of waterborne viruses near recreational water sites in lakes such significance is needless to say not confined in the scope of recreational sites in lakes but also confirmed by studies dedicated to drinking water systems sokolova et al 2015 and rivers and catchments schijven et al 2015 4 1 the distance to the contamination sources has direct influence on the risk intuitively the relative distance to contamination site is likely a critical factor influencing the concentration levels and resulting infection risks at the observation site of interest this has been well confirmed by our simulation of two contamination sources that are either distant vidy wwtp or close morges wwtp to the beach of interest fig 5 the maximum virus concentration was more than 30 times lower if contamination stemmed only from the distant site vidy wwtp compared with the scenario with contributions from both sites even though the discharge rate at the vidy wwtp was much larger than that at morges wwtp 5 m3 s versus 0 7 m3 s the major contamination at the beach of morges was triggered by the discharge at morges wwtp the lake water between vidy bay and the morges beach site thus served as a buffer area and diluted the virus plume to a large extent however while the infection risks of adenovirus enterovirus and rotavirus dropped significantly if only one contamination site was considered that of norovirus did not experience much reduction compared with the case with both sources this highlights the exceptionally infectious nature of norovirus even at small concentrations which is also related to the exceptionally acute dose response relationship another important aspect controlling the risk level was the time elapsed since the contamination event which has been mentioned in many other studies boehm et al 2018 demonstrated that aging of contamination can largely affect the resultant risks and wu et al 2020 indicated that lack of information on the contamination age impedes reliable estimation of the health risk taking adenovirus as an example in the week long simulation case with two sources the maximum risk reached 0 35 whereas three days later this risk level was below 0 016 if an individual were informed of such virus releasing events and the transport dynamics one may plan recreational water activities accordingly and avert the risk of being infected by adenovirus by more than 20 fold 1 3 log coupling hydrodynamics and environmental decay alleviates the challenge of not knowing the age of a contamination plume which is particularly problematic when water quality is assessed based on indicators 4 2 environmental stressors noticeably reduce the infection probability exerted by viruses with low background inactivation in summer but effects in the winter are minor adding on the effect of transport and dilution which are critical factors in many cases environmental inactivation further lowered the infection risk in particular during the summer and in most pronounced fashion for enterovirus however different viruses underwent very different levels of inactivation and the contribution of different environmental stressors also varied between virus species and seasons for the summer on average the fraction of inactivation by solar and thermal stressors was much greater for adenovirus and norovirus than for enterovirus and rotavirus fig 6 this can be explained by the lower background inactivation rate of adenovirus and norovirus combined with comparatively high thermal inactivation coefficients table 1 correspondingly the reduction of infection risks was also significantly different among viruses risk reduction due to environmental inactivation was up to three orders of magnitude larger for enterovirus than for adenovirus and norovirus for the winter however the effect of environmental stressors on virus inactivation was less pronounced than in the summer the background simulation which assumes a reference water temperature of 15 ºc showed a reduction in virus concentration compared to transport alone fig 7 this reduction is also evident in the complete scenario which accounted for the actual water temperature encountered in winter however compared to the background simulation the effect of environmental stressors was smaller reflecting the fact that environmental stressors are less effective at inactivating viruses at low temperatures the results in winter also imply that inactivation due to solar radiation was relatively weak as the reduction of inactivation due to low temperature outweighed the increase of inactivation brought about by winter solar radiation the minor contribution of radiation on virus inactivation in cold seasons was also reported in studies concerning infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus by foreman et al 2015 these case studies indicate that combining comprehensive water quality simulation and qmra is necessary in dealing with risk evaluation for waterborne virus transport processes in natural water bodies with the necessity of specific consideration for different types of viruses and seasonality 4 3 infection probability depends on dominant wind direction by summarizing the 24 simulation cases in 2019 the annual risk characterization permits a statistical analysis on the risk levels and some essential factors affecting the risks such as wind fields since the beach site of morges is located west of both the vidy bay and the morges wwtp an eastward wind would favor the lower concentrations at the observation site the risks under eastward wind conditions were noticeably lower than that under westward wind conditions take norovirus as an example under persistent eastward wind conditions the contamination plume could travel as far east as to the rhône river inlet while under strong westward winds even though the plume did not reach the rhône river outlet at geneva the contaminant was observed in the petit lac the small western part of lake geneva si fig s7 these results highlight the importance of the impact of hydrodynamic transport on virus concentrations as well as the unrivalled power of water quality models in offering an inclusive prediction of the fate and transport of virus in lakes which was also addressed in infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus transport studies for coastal regions foreman et al 2015 4 4 limitations and outlook the framework proposed in our study expands the scope of coupled water quality and risk models to viruses in lakes however several limitations remain firstly only background temperature driven and solar inactivation of virus were considered in our study while other factors may also contribute to virus removal from the water column for instance the model could be expanded to include virus adsorption to particles and subsequent settling processes which has been mostly addressed in wastewater treatment rather than in natural water bodies templeton et al 2008 once field studies provide sufficient data to parameterize this process secondly model validation is challenging it is difficult to conduct sampling campaigns for virus concentration measurements at recreational sites because infectious virus concentration is often low and only a fraction of viruses circulating in the environment can be quantified by available culturing systems it is also not possible to overcome this limitation by performing spike in experiments with human virus in the field due to biosafety considerations a field measurement campaign to validate the model would have gone beyond the scope of this work but is envisioned for future applications of the model thirdly the current parameterization of environmental virus inactivation is based on an integrated data set across water bodies and virus strains for higher simulation accuracy site and viral strain specific parameterization would be beneficial finally the qmra could be further refined specifically our data set of sewage virus concentrations was too small to rigorously capture seasonality trends to improve the results and reduce the uncertainties in an intuitive way more data of the sewage virus concentration measurement would be favorable in addition we used single scenario values for the water intake volume the dose response curves and dose harmonization factors in reality however these values are variables and scenario dependent for example schets et al 2011 found that the water intake volume was dependent on gender age and where the swimming activities take place furthermore dose response curves vary depending on assumptions regarding the susceptibility of the hosts messner et al 2014 or aggregation of the virus van abel et al 2017 and finally the dose harmonization was found to be dependent on virus species as well as the culturing method applied jonsson et al 2008 to incorporate these uncertainties together with our study could further consolidate the risk assessment for waterborne virus in lakes 5 conclusions this study proposes a coupled water quality and risk model to assess the fate of waterborne viruses from their release to the environment to the associated risks they pose to human at a recreational water site our case studies indicate that both transport and environmental inactivation processes are essential in determining the virus concentration at a site of interest furthermore the incorporation of spatially and temporally varying inactivation processes in water quality models is important for evaluating the infection risks the relative significance of transport and environmental stressors on the infection risks were demonstrated to be highly dependent on the season meteorological conditions wind direction and the virus type of concern environmental stressors tend to enhance virus inactivation in summer whereas in winter the effects are in part attenuated by colder water temperatures averaged over a year the infection risks with a mean wind direction that is blowing from the observation site towards the discharge location were 43 lower than that under the reverse condition for the site of concern in this study the results further showed that norovirus was the most problematic virus species among the four viruses studied and posed a risk that was usually at least one order of magnitude greater than that posed by the other viruses however as one example showed with an informed assessment of the water quality near the beach and an enlightened plan to carry out recreational water activities one may avert the risk of infection by waterborne virus by more than 20 folds only by delaying the timing of water related activities for three days despite certain limitations this study serves as one of the first endeavors to integrate virus concentration measurement virus transport and spatiotemporally varying inactivation simulation as well as qmra for risk evaluation of waterborne viruses at recreational water sites the model proposed here can be relatively easily refined and adapted for other locations and employed for comprehensive analysis and prediction of the fate and transport of waterborne viruses in the future declaration

15223,fluorine pollution has become a global public health problem due to its adverse health effects adsorption is the primary method for removing fluoride from drinking water however the adsorption method has disadvantages such as difficulty in recovering the adsorbent and the need to add additional chemicals for regeneration thereby causing secondary pollution which limits further industrial applications capacitive deionization cdi as an emerging water treatment technology has attracted widespread attention due to its advantages of simple operation low energy consumption and less environmental impact in this study a polypyrrole ppy film was prepared on a graphite substrate by electrodeposition and then metal organic framework ce zn bdc nh2 czbn was deposited on the ppy film by electrophoretic deposition to obtain czbn ppy electrode was obtained the czbn ppy anode was then coupled with the mno2 cathode for capacitive removal of fluoride in a cdi cell both czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior which can selectively and reversibly intercalate f czbn ppy and na mno2 ions as expected the czbn ppy mno2 system exhibits excellent fluorine removal performance in 1 2 v 100 mg l f solution the f removal capacity can reach 55 12 mg g it has high f selectivity in the presence of some common anions and can maintain high f removal ability even after five adsorption regeneration processes the mechanism of f removal was studied by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps f was mainly removed by electrostatic interaction and ion exchange with hydroxyl the excellent defluorination performance of the czbn ppy mno2 system makes it have good practical application prospects graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoride removal capacitive deionization removal capacity metal organic framework electrophoretic deposition electrosorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is an indispensable resource for human beings and it provides more than 97 of available freshwater globally vadiati et al 2018 however the availability of groundwater is often limited by water pollution as a monoatomic anion fluoride ion f is widely distributed in water and its main source is geological origin some minerals such as cryolite fluorite and fluorapatite are soluble in water and can release f to water yadav et al 2018 in addition human activities are also an important source of f in groundwater such as the discharge of iron and steel industrial waste chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural activities he et al 2020 fluoride is one of the necessary nutrients for the human body some studies show that human intake of a small amount of fluoride 0 5 1 5 mg l can help protect teeth and strengthen the exoskeleton however excessive fluoride intake will lead to health problems such as dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis li et al 2021 therefore the world health organization who sets the fluoride limit in drinking water at 1 5 mg l but aims at 0 8 1 2 mg l to prevent tooth decay and maintain bone strength barghouthi and amereih 2012 at present the main methods for fluoride removal in drinking water are coagulation precipitation castañeda et al 2020 changmai et al 2019 he et al 2015 ion exchange meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 membrane he et al 2017 electrodialysis bhatnagar et al 2011 adsorption guan et al 2022 ren et al 2021 yin et al 2022 yin et al 2021 and capacitive deionization jiang et al 2022 min et al 2020a wu et al 2016 etc adsorption is the most widely studied method for fluorine removal bai et al 2019 it has the advantages of high efficiency rapidity low cost and simple operation commonly used adsorbents include activated carbon activated alumina zeolite hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite like kumar et al 2019 however there are many problems to be solved urgently in the practical application of the adsorbent such as the difficulty of regeneration the regeneration of the adsorbent usually requires the addition of acid or alkali which causes secondary pollution in addition the powdered adsorbent will generate a large amount of waste residue after use which increases the recovery cost bai et al 2019 wang et al 2021 really exciting is that the electrosorption technology solves the above problems very well the main process of electrosorption is applying an electric field to a pair of parallel electrodes and then the wastewater flows between the electrodes this technology is also known as capacitive deionization cdi when the electrodes are charged various ions can be adsorbed when the applied voltage is short circuited or reversed the ions adsorbed on the electrodes are released into the solution due to electrostatic repulsion cdi method has become a research hotspot in recent years due to its simple operation low energy consumption easy regeneration and no secondary pollution xing et al 2020 the key of cdi technology is the design of electrode materials at present the electrode materials used for capacitive defluorination are mainly carbon materials cui et al 2012 dong et al 2021 such as biochar dong et al 2021 commercial activated carbon gaikwad and balomajumder 2017 graphene park et al 2021 carbon aerogel zhang et al 2022 and carbon nanotubes wu et al 2021 etc however the application of carbon materials is limited due to their low selectivity poor removal capacity and regeneration performance therefore it is still urgent to develop an efficient cdi electrode for fluoride removal from waste water metal organic frameworks mofs have shown great potentials as cdi electrode materials in recent years compared with traditional cdi electrode materials mofs based adsorbent materials have attracted much attention due to their special specific surface area different functional sites and tunable pore structure ahmadijokani et al 2021 at present some studies have been carried out on mofs materials as adsorbents for fluoride removal prabhu et al prepared a series of fumaric acid mediated mofs la fum zr fum and ce fum for arsenic and fluoride removal prabhu et al 2021 the langmuir maximum adsorption capacities of la fum zr fum and ce fum for arsenic fluoro salts were 2 689 4 240 1 666 2 255 and 2 174 4 155 mmol g respectively tan et al prepared a zirconium based metal organic framework mof 801 adsorbent for the adsorption of fluoride ions from water zhu et al 2018 the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is 19 42 mg g and the fluorine removal efficiency can reach about 79 after 4 cycles however most mofs can t be used directly as cdi electrodes because of their poor conductivity huang et al 2022 the current solution is mainly to combine mofs with a material with good conductivity or cdi electrodes were prepared by pyrolysis of mofs into porous carbon chang et al 2015 for the former the conductivity of the electrode is usually improved by compounding with carbon materials however recent studies have shown that the carbon electrode is easy to be oxidized in the cdi process which usually leads to poor cycle stability and limits its large scale application wang et al 2019 polypyrrole ppy is a typical conductive polymer which is considered as a promising electrode material due to its low cost high conductivity in doped state and easy large scale preparation compared with carbon materials ppy has good cycle stability and is suitable as conducting substrate of mofs xu et al 2017 at present the research on mofs as a cdi electrode is mainly concentrated in the field of seawater desalination and there is little research on its use in removing fluoride from water in this regard we prepared a metal organic framework ce zn bdc nh2 and polypyrrole composite czbn ppy among them the ce ions in the mofs can enhance the pseudocapacitive behavior of the electrode material and ppy was used as a conductive substrate to connect the mofs which improved the conductivity of the electrode and thus showed better defluorination performance in the cdi process besides the choice of electrode materials battery structure is usually potential influences for defluorination performance most of the traditional carbon electrodes are electric double layer electrodes the adsorption process is a purely physical process and the interaction between ions and the electrode interface is weak the adsorbed ions easily return to solution due to the repulsion of similar ions wang et al 2021 in order to eliminate the influence of the same ion and improve the deionization ability this study adopts the method of hybrid capacitance deionization hcdi that is the two electrodes use different materials the anode selectively adsorbs f and the cathode selectively adsorbs na currently the electrode materials used for selective adsorption of na are mainly polyanion compounds transition metal oxides transition metal carbides and transition metal sulfides liu et al 2021 etc in this study mno2 was chosen as the hcdi cathode in this work czbn ppy was used as the anode and mno2 was used as the cathode to form the hcdi system for selective adsorption of f and na in aqueous solution the morphology structure and electrochemical properties of the electrodes were characterized to fully understand the cdi mechanism of the electrodes the effect of the electrode on the fluoride removal ability under different operating conditions and solution conditions were investigated the regeneration performance of the electrodes was also investigated this study provides a new electrode material and technology option for fluoride removal from wastewater 2 experimental section the chemicals characterization electrochemical measurements and capacitive fluoride removal experiments information in this research can be found in the supporting information text s1 s2 s3 and s4 the synthesis process of ppy czbn czbn ppy and mno2 electrode were shown in fig 1 the experimental setup and the structure diagram of cdi cell were shown in fig s1 2 1 synthesis of czbn the ce zn bdc nh2 czbn was synthesized according to the procedure in the literature with some amendments ebrahim and bandosz 2013 in detail 4 5 mmol ce no3 3 6h2o 3mmol zn no3 2 6h2o were dissolved in 45 ml dimethylformamide dmf and then 7 5 mmol 2 aminoterephthalic acid bdc nh2 was added and stirred in the dmf solution above then metal salt solution was dropwise added into the ligand solution with vigorous moderate magnetic stirring then the mixture solution was sonicated for 1 h and then transferred to a solvothermal reactor for crystallization at 150 c for 24 h after that the reactor was cooled to room temperature naturally the product is collected through centrifugation and washed with dmf for several times to remove unreacted reactants the solvent exchange was performed with methanol for 12 h the final product was dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h 2 2 synthesis of ppy the polypyrrole ppy was synthesized through electropolymerization of pyrrole in a typical synthesis 2 g of chitosan was firstly dispersed in 500 ml of 2 v v acetic acid solution and then 3 475 ml pyrrole was adequately dispersed in chitosan solution both the anode and cathode were composed of graphite sheets with dimensions of 75 75 0 5 mm the electrode was immersed into the mixed solution and the electrodeposition of ppy was performed in galvanostat mode with current density of 5 ma cm2 for 10 min 2 3 synthesis of czbn ppy the czbn were deposited on ppy substrates czbn ppy by a typical electrophoretic deposition method epd the czbn powders of different mass was dispersed into 500 ml pure ethanol and ultrasonicated for 30 min and then the electrode sheets were immersed into the czbn suspension both the cathode and anode were composed of ppy electrode and graphite sheets respectively the czbn was deposited onto ppy electrode by applying a suitable constant voltage 50 80 v of 20 min and the distance between electrodes kept 2 cm the as deposited czbn ppy electrode was washed with ethanol for several times finally the prepared electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 50 c for 24 h the czbn ppy electrodes prepared from czbn suspensions with different concentrations of 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 g l were named as 10czbn ppy 30czbn ppy 50czbn ppy and 80czbn ppy respectively by calculating the mass difference between the electrodes before and after epd the czbn loadings amount were 0 18 0 53 0 89 1 42 mg cm2 respectively 2 4 synthesis of mno2 the mno2 electrode was prepared by cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition method liu et al 2016 the electrolyte for the deposition was prepared by dissolving 0 01m manganese acetate tetrahydrate and 0 02 m ammonium acetate in a solvent mixture of 90 ultrapure water and 10 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso both the anode and cathode were composed of graphite sheets with dimensions of 75 75 0 5 mm and saturated calomel electrode was used as reference electrode in a typical electrodeposition synthesis procedure the graphite electrode was treated between 1 5 and 2 5 v for 80 min at a scan rate of 100 mv s finally the mno2 electrode was rinsed with ultrapure water and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 50 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and characterizations fig 2 shows the sem images of graphite substrate ppy and 50czbn ppy as well as its corresponding eds elemental mapping from fig 2a it can be found that the surface of graphite substrate is relatively flat and a layer of bulk ppy is loaded after electrodeposition fig 2 c and d and a layer of ppy is evenly loaded after electrophoretic deposition shape of the czbn in fig 2 e and f the morphology of czbn deposited on ppy was consistent with that before deposition fig s2 a and b indicating that the electrophoretic deposition process did not destroy the structure of czbn the cross sectional view of 50czbn ppy in fig 2b can clearly see the three layer structure of graphite substrate ppy and czbn the highly conductive ppy acts as a continuous conductive pathway for rapid electron transport between graphite and czbn the elemental mapping fig 2g l shows the uniform distribution of c n o zn and ce fig s2c h shows the effect of different czbn suspension concentrations on the morphology of the czbn ppy electrode as anticipated increasing the concentration of czbn suspension can make czbn more densely deposited on the surface of the ppy film but it in turn affects the fluorine removal performance of the czbn ppy electrode this can be confirmed in subsequent cdi defluorination experiments fig s3 shows the sem image and corresponding eds elemental mapping image of 50czbn ppy after fluorine adsorption it is found that many fluffy substances appear after adsorption the eds elemental mapping shows the uniform distribution of f which confirms the adsorption of fluoride on the surface of 50czbn ppy fig s4 is the sem image of mno2 and its corresponding eds elemental mapping it can be seen from fig s4 a and b that the electrodeposited mno2 shows a flower like structure elemental mapping fig s4c e shows a uniform distribution of o and mn fig s5 shows the sem image of mno2 after adsorption of na adsorption and its corresponding eds elemental mapping many fluffy substances appears after adsorption indicating that na was successfully adsorbed on mno2 the uniform distribution of o mn and na which further confirms the adsorption of na on the surface of mno2 fig 3 a and b shows the xrd patterns of ppy czbn and czbn ppy grown with epd suspensions of different concentrations the diffraction peaks at 26 57 and 54 65 can be attributed to graphite substrate fig 3a jcpds card no 41 1487 while the other diffraction peaks at 9 92 17 20 and 19 7 are attributed to czbn fig 3b he et al 2020 the deposited czbn and czbn powder maintain the same crystal structure in addition the xrd patterns of czbn ppy grown with different concentrations of epd suspensions show that the relative diffraction peak intensity increases with the increase of epd concentration which means that more czbn was deposited on the ppy film fig 3c shows the ftir spectra of czbn and czbn ppy and there is no significant difference between the spectra of czbn ppy and czbn powder indicating that czbn ppy retains most of the characteristics of czbn the absorption peaks at 3460 cm 1 and 3365 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of n h and o h rikhari et al 2018 respectively the peak bands at 1555 cm 1 and 1385 cm 1 are attributed to the asymmetry and symmetric stretching vibration of carbonyl c o group in cooh abid et al 2013 the c h bending vibrations at 1250 cm 1 840 cm 1 and 768 cm 1 confirm the existence of benzene ring liu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the characteristic peaks at 582 cm 1 and 512 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibrations of ce o and zn o bonds in czbn aykac ozen and ozturk 2019 the ftir pattern confirms the successful synthesis and electrophoretic deposition of czbn the specific surface area and porosity of ppy czbn and czbn ppy were determined by nitrogen adsorption desorption method as shown in fig 3d all three samples exhibit type iv isotherms and type h3 hysteresis loops with typical microporous and mesoporous material structures gao et al 2020 the specific surface areas of ppy czbn and czbn ppy are 9 56 62 75 and 32 46 m2 g respectively indicating that the introduction of czbn increases the specific surface area of the electrode material the psd curves the inset of fig 3d further demonstrate the existence of micropores and mesopores in the as prepared materials the loose structure and porous properties of czbn ppy can provide more active sites and fast ion transport during cdi defluorination the composition and chemical valence states of ppy and 50czbn ppy were probed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 4 a the xps peaks of 50czbn ppy are ascribed to c 1s n 1s o 1s zn 2p and ce 3d for the c 1s spectrum in fig 4b three peaks of 284 8 286 3 and 288 6 ev correspond to c c c o c and o c o groups wang et al 2020 respectively the n 1s spectrum in fig 4c shows four types of n species n nh and n at 398 4 399 1 and 399 9 ev tan et al 2020 the high resolution o 1s spectrum in fig 4d are fitted to four peaks 529 2 531 2 532 6 and 533 3 ev which are ascribed to zn ce o oh o c o and adsorbed oxygen oads groups he et al 2020 these analyses are in good agreement with the ftir results for the zn 2p spectrum as shown in fig 4e the two peaks around 1044 8 and 1021 7 ev correspond to zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 with a spin energy separation of 23 ev which is consistent with the characteristics of zn2 the high resolution ce 3d spectrum shown in fig 4f consists of two parts i 903 6 and 899 2 ev for ce 3d3 2 and 885 1 and 881 0 ev for ce 3d5 2 of ce3 ii 916 5 906 3 and 901 0 ev for ce 3d3 2 and 898 0 886 9 and 882 7 ev for ce 3d5 2 of ce4 li et al 2018 the ce ions in the 50czbn ppy may enhance the fluoride removal performance of materials li et al 2019 the electrochemical performance of ppy czbn ppy and mno2 in 0 5 m naf solution were tested by a three electrode system as shown in fig s6 the area of cv curve increases with scan rate moreover the cv curves of ppy and czbn ppy are rectangular indicating that they play the role of pseudocapacitance in addition the cv curve area of ppy at 5 mv s is larger than that of czbn ppy fig 5 a and the specific capacitance of ppy is also the highest compared with czbn ppy samples fig 5b this indicates that the addition of ppy can increase the capacitance of czbn which improves the charge transport between the electrode and solution particularly there is a redox peak in the cv curve of mno2 electrode which is attributed to the na intercalation reaction at the mno2 electrode as shown in eq 1 tan et al 2020 tu et al 2021 1 mn o 2 n a e mnoona further insight into the capacitive defluorination process was carried out through eis testing fig 5c a nyquist plot consists of a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the mid low frequency region the diameter of the semicircle in the high frequency region represents the magnitude of charge transfer resistance rct the rct value of ppy 33 06 ω is greater than that of czbn ppy 10 31 1 14 1 12 and 1 15 ω for 10czbn ppy 30czbn ppy 50czbn ppy and 80cabn ppy respectively the reason for this phenomenon may be the decreased content of ppy after deposition of czbn furthermore in the mid low frequency region of the nyquist curve the real part of impedance z is linearly related to the negative 0 5 power of the angular frequency w 1 2 fig 5d from which the ion diffusion resistance rit can be obtained the rit of ppy 2 73 ω is lower than that of czbn ppy 3 36 3 58 3 22 and 2 92 ω for 10czbn ppy 30czbn ppy 50czbn ppy and 80cabn ppy respectively because ppy is a conductive polymer and it has low ionic diffusion resistance it can be further found that rit decreases with the increase of czbn content which is because czbn can specifically bind with f and the increase in czbn content enhances the ion transport between electrode and solution we also compared the electrochemical performance of ppy czbn and 50czbn ppy as shown in fig s7 it can be found that 50czbn ppy has higher capacitance and lower charge transfer resistance than czbn 3 2 cdi defluorination performance the f removal capacity of czbn ppy electrodes was investigated in batch mode fig 6 a reflects the change of f removal capacity with time at an initial f concentration of 10 mg l and an operating voltage of 1 2 v it can be remarkably found that the f removal capacity rises rapidly in the first 15 min and finally reaches equilibrium the final f concentration reaches about 1 22 1 53 2 52 and 2 11 mg l for 80 50 30 and 10czbn ppy mno2 electrode system respectively however the final concentration of naf solution treated with ppy mno2 without czbn coating is 7 10 mg l these results indicate the efficient enhancement on f removal through czbn coating noteworthy 80czbn ppy mno2 shows high removal efficiency for f and the treated wastewater can reach the standard of less than 1 5 mg l required by who although 80czbn ppy mno2 can reduce the f concentration to the standard recommended by who the combination between czbn and ppy in the outer layer is not strong due to the excessive loading of czbn this results in the instability of the electrode therefore 50czbn ppy mno2 electrodes were used in the follow up researches in actual production multiple pairs of electrodes can be connected in series to reduce the f concentration to the required standard value to this end we studied the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 at an initial f concentration of 5 mg l as a function of time as shown in fig s11 the final f concentration was 1 02 mg l which was less than the who recommended it shows that the idea of connecting multiple pairs of electrodes in series to reduce the f concentration to the required standard value is completely feasible in addition the f removal performance of ppy mno2 czbn mno2 and 50czbn ppy mno2 was compared fig s10 the results showed that the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 was significantly higher than that of czbn mno2 this further confirms that the introduction of ppy improves the f removal ability of the electrode we also studied the adsorption kinetics of the 50czbn ppy mno2 system as shown in fig s12 and the relevant parameters are listed in table s1 the fitting results show that the adsorption of f is more in line with the pseudo second order kinetic model and the adsorption process mainly chemical adsorption the charge utilization and energy loss during cdi defluorination were measured by charge efficiency the current transient curves and charge efficiency in solution were calculated for 50 30 10czbn ppy mno2 and ppy mno2 at 10 mg l f with a voltage of 1 2 v as shown in fig 6b the current graph drops sharply within 10 minutes and from its inset it can be seen that with the increase of czbn content the charge efficiency first increases and then decreases which may be due to the fact that more f are trapped with the introduction of czbn however with the further increase of czbn loading the f concentration is insufficient and the active adsorption sites are excessive thus resulting in a decrease in charge efficiency fig 6c shows the trade off curve between specific inverse energy consumption sec 1 and ion removal rate irr during cdi defluorination it can be seen that the sec 1 value of 10czbn ppy mno2 is always higher than other samples under the same irr this means that 10czbn ppy mno2 shows the most efficient energy usage wang et al 2021 the variation of the deionized product water specific gibbs free energy δg and the energy efficiency ee with the energy consumption ec during cdi defluorination are shown in fig 6d and s13 it can be seen that ee first increases and then decreases during the cdi defluorination process this is because in the whole process of f removal the main ions were removed first and the secondary ions were removed later finally the ee for 50czbn ppy mno2 were about 31 4 which were higher than those of 30czbn ppy mno2 29 0 10czbn ppy mno2 15 1 and ppy mno2 10 1 the f removal performance of 50czbn ppy mno2 for 10 mg l f naf under different applied voltage conditions was investigated as shown in fig 7 a when the applied voltage increases the f removal capacity shows first increasing and then decreasing according to the theoretical analysis of the electric double layer the rise of the voltage makes the electric double layer denser resulting in an increase in the adsorption capacity when the applied voltage reaches a certain threshold the excessive voltage will cause side reactions such as water electrolysis electrode material reaction etc which reduces the f removal performance of electrode materials and increases energy consumption it can be seen from fig s14 and s15 that sec 1 increases but charge efficiency and ee decrease with the increase of applied voltage it shows that the increase in voltage increases the total energy consumption and reduces the energy utilization rate the rise in applied voltage on the one hand the increase in the amount of ion adsorption and the effective energy consumption and on the other hand leads to the intensification of electrode side reactions which increases the ineffective energy consumption fig 7b shows the f removal performance of 50czbn ppy mno2 under different ph conditions the electrode exhibits high f removal performance under acidic and neutral conditions and the removal performance is the highest at ph 6 under acidic conditions the electrode surface has more positive charges and its electrostatic attraction with f is beneficial to the removal of excess fluoride however at lower ph the f removal capacity decreases because the content of hf2 in the solution starts to increase at lower ph causing a decrease in the removal ability of f the f removal performance decreased rapidly under alkaline conditions this is likely because the hydroxyl ion concentration in the solution is higher under alkaline conditions which competes with f for adsorption resulting in a decrease in the removal efficiency of f therefore it can be concluded that the czbn ppy electrode has better treatment capacity for neutral and acidic wastewater the effect of mass ratio beween mno2 and czbn ppy electrodes on the f removal ability was investigated as shown in fig 7c when the mass ratio of mno2 to 50czbn ppy was 1 2 the cdi system obtained the highest f removal capacity the effect of initial f concentration on the cdi defluorination ability of 50czbn ppy mno2 was investigated fig 7d with the increase of initial f concentration the f removal capacity increases the main reason is that the conductivity of the solution increases due to the increase of f concentration under the same electric field force ions are more likely to enter the electric double layer and be adsorbed the f removal capacity at an initial f concentration of 100 mg l was 55 12 mg g which was greatly higher than recently reported electrode materials in the literatures table 1 indicating that 50czbn ppy mno2 is a potential cdi defluorination electrode we also simulated the f removal data at different initial f concentrations using the langmuir and freundlich models as shown in fig s16 and the relevant parameters are listed in table s2 the fitting results show that the adsorption of f on 50czbn ppy is more in line with the langmuir model indicating that f is adsorbed in the form of a monolayer on the electrode surface the f removal capacity at different flow rates was explored as shown in fig s17 the larger the flow rate the better the f removal capacity this may be because the low flow rate will reduce the volume concentration of f resulting in reduced f removal capacity zhang et al 2022 however after 120 min the equilibrium concentrations of the three flow rates were all similar and the time to reach equilibrium was the shortest when the flow rate was 40 ml min so 40 ml min was chosen as the optimal flow rate the effect of common competing anions na3po4 na2so4 nano3 nacl in wastewater on the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 electrode was studied fig 7e the results show that in the range of 10 100 mg l competitive anions concentration the interference and competition of phosphate on f removal is the most serious which may be due to its higher negative charge density nitrates chlorides and sulfates have low interference effects on f removal the order of their influence is phosphate sulfate nitrate chloride we also investigated the effect of some cations nh4cl cacl2 and mgcl2 on the f removal ability of the 50czbn ppy mno2 electrode fig s18 the results showed that ammonium had little effect on the removal of f while calcium and magnesium ions could promote the removal of f which may be due to their interaction with f gao et al 2020 shao et al 2021 the regeneration performance of 50czbn ppy mno2 under application of 1 2 v reverse voltage and open circuit was investigated respectively as shown in fig s19 when a reverse voltage of 1 2 v is applied the f concentration can be regenerated to 70 of the initial concentration while the f concentration can only be regenerated to 26 of the initial concentration when the circuit is kept open it is shown that the electrostatic repulsion between f and the electrode is favorable for electrode regeneration the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 and czbn mno2 after 5 consecutive removal regeneration cycles was investigated as shown in fig 7f the f removal capacity of the 50czbn ppy mno2 electrode decreased slightly from 9 48 mg g to 7 83 mg g which was 84 of the initial f removal capacity it shows that czbn ppy is an efficient economical eco friendly and recyclable electrode material and has good practical application prospects however the f removal capacity of czbn mno2 electrode decreased slightly from 5 90 mg g to 2 04 mg g which was only 35 of the initial f removal capacity which indicated that the introduction of ppy had a positive effect on improving the removal regeneration cycle of the electrode effect 3 3 adsorption mechanism fig s20 shows the ftir spectra of 50czbn ppy electrode before and after defluorination it can be seen from the figure that the absorption peaks at 3460 cm 1 3365 cm 1 582 cm 1 and 512 cm 1 disappear after adsorption indicating that fluoride interacts with hydroxyl amino and metal to gain more insights into the cdi adsorption mechanism the xps spectra of 50czbn ppy and mno2 before and after naf adsorption were compared in fig 8 and s21 as shown in fig 8a and s21a f 1s and na 1s peaks can be observed after adsorption at anode and cathode which indicates that fluoride and sodium ions are well adsorbed in 50czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes respectively in the n 1s spectrum in fig 8b before and after f adsorption the peak area ratio of n decreases from 31 75 to 30 47 before and after adsorption and nh2 peak area ratio reduces from 21 87 to 8 63 however the peak area ratio of nh3 increases from 46 38 to 60 9 before and after adsorption owing to the existence of free h in water czbn ppy can be protonated by bonding additional h to the surface therefore these edge sites nh3 can intercalate anionic f through electrostatic interactions jeyaseelan et al 2021 in the o 1s spectrum in fig 8c before and after f adsorption the ce zn o peak area ratio decreases from 18 54 to 2 6 ce oh peak area ratio reduces from 47 34 to 18 41 while o c o peak area ratio increases from 21 94 to 62 72 and the peak area ratio of h2o elevates from 12 18 to 16 26 indicating that most of the hydroxyl groups oh in 50czbn ppy is replaced by fluoride through ligand exchange reactions gao et al 2020 the ce 3d spectra before and after f adsorption is shown in fig 8d the molar ratio of ce4 ce3 before and after adsorption increases from 0 14 to 0 64 indicating that the ce3 was converted into ce4 during the charging process thereby generating positive charges on the surface of the 50czbn ppy electrode anions are adsorbed to maintain charge balance li et al 2019 moreover in the mn 2p spectra of mno2 in fig s21b after f adsorption the molar ratio of high valence manganese to low valence manganese mn4 mn3 mn2 decreases from 0 64 to 0 25 which further proves the occurrence of na intercalation reaction at the mno2 electrode the schematic diagram of cdi defluorination mechanism is shown in fig 8e 4 conclusions in this work a fast efficient and membrane free cdi system was constructed with czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes which can efficiently and selectively remove f czbn ppy and na mno2 the faraday pseudocapacitive behavior of czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes significantly improves the f removal performance the removal capacity of 50czbn ppy for f can reaches 55 12 mg g in 1 2 v 100 mg l f solution which was greatly higher than recently reported electrode materials importantly it shows high f selectivity in the presence of some common anions the mechanism of f removal is mainly based on the electric double layer on the electrode surface the pseudocapacitance contributed by the redox reaction on the electrode surface the electrostatic adsorption of nh3 and the ion exchange of hydroxyl groups the electrode has good reusability and can maintain high f removal ability enen after five adsorption regeneration processes therefore the czbn ppy mno2 electrode system can be used as an efficient economical sustainable and environmentally friendly selective defluorination system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15223,fluorine pollution has become a global public health problem due to its adverse health effects adsorption is the primary method for removing fluoride from drinking water however the adsorption method has disadvantages such as difficulty in recovering the adsorbent and the need to add additional chemicals for regeneration thereby causing secondary pollution which limits further industrial applications capacitive deionization cdi as an emerging water treatment technology has attracted widespread attention due to its advantages of simple operation low energy consumption and less environmental impact in this study a polypyrrole ppy film was prepared on a graphite substrate by electrodeposition and then metal organic framework ce zn bdc nh2 czbn was deposited on the ppy film by electrophoretic deposition to obtain czbn ppy electrode was obtained the czbn ppy anode was then coupled with the mno2 cathode for capacitive removal of fluoride in a cdi cell both czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior which can selectively and reversibly intercalate f czbn ppy and na mno2 ions as expected the czbn ppy mno2 system exhibits excellent fluorine removal performance in 1 2 v 100 mg l f solution the f removal capacity can reach 55 12 mg g it has high f selectivity in the presence of some common anions and can maintain high f removal ability even after five adsorption regeneration processes the mechanism of f removal was studied by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps f was mainly removed by electrostatic interaction and ion exchange with hydroxyl the excellent defluorination performance of the czbn ppy mno2 system makes it have good practical application prospects graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoride removal capacitive deionization removal capacity metal organic framework electrophoretic deposition electrosorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is an indispensable resource for human beings and it provides more than 97 of available freshwater globally vadiati et al 2018 however the availability of groundwater is often limited by water pollution as a monoatomic anion fluoride ion f is widely distributed in water and its main source is geological origin some minerals such as cryolite fluorite and fluorapatite are soluble in water and can release f to water yadav et al 2018 in addition human activities are also an important source of f in groundwater such as the discharge of iron and steel industrial waste chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural activities he et al 2020 fluoride is one of the necessary nutrients for the human body some studies show that human intake of a small amount of fluoride 0 5 1 5 mg l can help protect teeth and strengthen the exoskeleton however excessive fluoride intake will lead to health problems such as dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis li et al 2021 therefore the world health organization who sets the fluoride limit in drinking water at 1 5 mg l but aims at 0 8 1 2 mg l to prevent tooth decay and maintain bone strength barghouthi and amereih 2012 at present the main methods for fluoride removal in drinking water are coagulation precipitation castañeda et al 2020 changmai et al 2019 he et al 2015 ion exchange meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 membrane he et al 2017 electrodialysis bhatnagar et al 2011 adsorption guan et al 2022 ren et al 2021 yin et al 2022 yin et al 2021 and capacitive deionization jiang et al 2022 min et al 2020a wu et al 2016 etc adsorption is the most widely studied method for fluorine removal bai et al 2019 it has the advantages of high efficiency rapidity low cost and simple operation commonly used adsorbents include activated carbon activated alumina zeolite hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite like kumar et al 2019 however there are many problems to be solved urgently in the practical application of the adsorbent such as the difficulty of regeneration the regeneration of the adsorbent usually requires the addition of acid or alkali which causes secondary pollution in addition the powdered adsorbent will generate a large amount of waste residue after use which increases the recovery cost bai et al 2019 wang et al 2021 really exciting is that the electrosorption technology solves the above problems very well the main process of electrosorption is applying an electric field to a pair of parallel electrodes and then the wastewater flows between the electrodes this technology is also known as capacitive deionization cdi when the electrodes are charged various ions can be adsorbed when the applied voltage is short circuited or reversed the ions adsorbed on the electrodes are released into the solution due to electrostatic repulsion cdi method has become a research hotspot in recent years due to its simple operation low energy consumption easy regeneration and no secondary pollution xing et al 2020 the key of cdi technology is the design of electrode materials at present the electrode materials used for capacitive defluorination are mainly carbon materials cui et al 2012 dong et al 2021 such as biochar dong et al 2021 commercial activated carbon gaikwad and balomajumder 2017 graphene park et al 2021 carbon aerogel zhang et al 2022 and carbon nanotubes wu et al 2021 etc however the application of carbon materials is limited due to their low selectivity poor removal capacity and regeneration performance therefore it is still urgent to develop an efficient cdi electrode for fluoride removal from waste water metal organic frameworks mofs have shown great potentials as cdi electrode materials in recent years compared with traditional cdi electrode materials mofs based adsorbent materials have attracted much attention due to their special specific surface area different functional sites and tunable pore structure ahmadijokani et al 2021 at present some studies have been carried out on mofs materials as adsorbents for fluoride removal prabhu et al prepared a series of fumaric acid mediated mofs la fum zr fum and ce fum for arsenic and fluoride removal prabhu et al 2021 the langmuir maximum adsorption capacities of la fum zr fum and ce fum for arsenic fluoro salts were 2 689 4 240 1 666 2 255 and 2 174 4 155 mmol g respectively tan et al prepared a zirconium based metal organic framework mof 801 adsorbent for the adsorption of fluoride ions from water zhu et al 2018 the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is 19 42 mg g and the fluorine removal efficiency can reach about 79 after 4 cycles however most mofs can t be used directly as cdi electrodes because of their poor conductivity huang et al 2022 the current solution is mainly to combine mofs with a material with good conductivity or cdi electrodes were prepared by pyrolysis of mofs into porous carbon chang et al 2015 for the former the conductivity of the electrode is usually improved by compounding with carbon materials however recent studies have shown that the carbon electrode is easy to be oxidized in the cdi process which usually leads to poor cycle stability and limits its large scale application wang et al 2019 polypyrrole ppy is a typical conductive polymer which is considered as a promising electrode material due to its low cost high conductivity in doped state and easy large scale preparation compared with carbon materials ppy has good cycle stability and is suitable as conducting substrate of mofs xu et al 2017 at present the research on mofs as a cdi electrode is mainly concentrated in the field of seawater desalination and there is little research on its use in removing fluoride from water in this regard we prepared a metal organic framework ce zn bdc nh2 and polypyrrole composite czbn ppy among them the ce ions in the mofs can enhance the pseudocapacitive behavior of the electrode material and ppy was used as a conductive substrate to connect the mofs which improved the conductivity of the electrode and thus showed better defluorination performance in the cdi process besides the choice of electrode materials battery structure is usually potential influences for defluorination performance most of the traditional carbon electrodes are electric double layer electrodes the adsorption process is a purely physical process and the interaction between ions and the electrode interface is weak the adsorbed ions easily return to solution due to the repulsion of similar ions wang et al 2021 in order to eliminate the influence of the same ion and improve the deionization ability this study adopts the method of hybrid capacitance deionization hcdi that is the two electrodes use different materials the anode selectively adsorbs f and the cathode selectively adsorbs na currently the electrode materials used for selective adsorption of na are mainly polyanion compounds transition metal oxides transition metal carbides and transition metal sulfides liu et al 2021 etc in this study mno2 was chosen as the hcdi cathode in this work czbn ppy was used as the anode and mno2 was used as the cathode to form the hcdi system for selective adsorption of f and na in aqueous solution the morphology structure and electrochemical properties of the electrodes were characterized to fully understand the cdi mechanism of the electrodes the effect of the electrode on the fluoride removal ability under different operating conditions and solution conditions were investigated the regeneration performance of the electrodes was also investigated this study provides a new electrode material and technology option for fluoride removal from wastewater 2 experimental section the chemicals characterization electrochemical measurements and capacitive fluoride removal experiments information in this research can be found in the supporting information text s1 s2 s3 and s4 the synthesis process of ppy czbn czbn ppy and mno2 electrode were shown in fig 1 the experimental setup and the structure diagram of cdi cell were shown in fig s1 2 1 synthesis of czbn the ce zn bdc nh2 czbn was synthesized according to the procedure in the literature with some amendments ebrahim and bandosz 2013 in detail 4 5 mmol ce no3 3 6h2o 3mmol zn no3 2 6h2o were dissolved in 45 ml dimethylformamide dmf and then 7 5 mmol 2 aminoterephthalic acid bdc nh2 was added and stirred in the dmf solution above then metal salt solution was dropwise added into the ligand solution with vigorous moderate magnetic stirring then the mixture solution was sonicated for 1 h and then transferred to a solvothermal reactor for crystallization at 150 c for 24 h after that the reactor was cooled to room temperature naturally the product is collected through centrifugation and washed with dmf for several times to remove unreacted reactants the solvent exchange was performed with methanol for 12 h the final product was dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h 2 2 synthesis of ppy the polypyrrole ppy was synthesized through electropolymerization of pyrrole in a typical synthesis 2 g of chitosan was firstly dispersed in 500 ml of 2 v v acetic acid solution and then 3 475 ml pyrrole was adequately dispersed in chitosan solution both the anode and cathode were composed of graphite sheets with dimensions of 75 75 0 5 mm the electrode was immersed into the mixed solution and the electrodeposition of ppy was performed in galvanostat mode with current density of 5 ma cm2 for 10 min 2 3 synthesis of czbn ppy the czbn were deposited on ppy substrates czbn ppy by a typical electrophoretic deposition method epd the czbn powders of different mass was dispersed into 500 ml pure ethanol and ultrasonicated for 30 min and then the electrode sheets were immersed into the czbn suspension both the cathode and anode were composed of ppy electrode and graphite sheets respectively the czbn was deposited onto ppy electrode by applying a suitable constant voltage 50 80 v of 20 min and the distance between electrodes kept 2 cm the as deposited czbn ppy electrode was washed with ethanol for several times finally the prepared electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 50 c for 24 h the czbn ppy electrodes prepared from czbn suspensions with different concentrations of 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 g l were named as 10czbn ppy 30czbn ppy 50czbn ppy and 80czbn ppy respectively by calculating the mass difference between the electrodes before and after epd the czbn loadings amount were 0 18 0 53 0 89 1 42 mg cm2 respectively 2 4 synthesis of mno2 the mno2 electrode was prepared by cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition method liu et al 2016 the electrolyte for the deposition was prepared by dissolving 0 01m manganese acetate tetrahydrate and 0 02 m ammonium acetate in a solvent mixture of 90 ultrapure water and 10 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso both the anode and cathode were composed of graphite sheets with dimensions of 75 75 0 5 mm and saturated calomel electrode was used as reference electrode in a typical electrodeposition synthesis procedure the graphite electrode was treated between 1 5 and 2 5 v for 80 min at a scan rate of 100 mv s finally the mno2 electrode was rinsed with ultrapure water and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 50 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and characterizations fig 2 shows the sem images of graphite substrate ppy and 50czbn ppy as well as its corresponding eds elemental mapping from fig 2a it can be found that the surface of graphite substrate is relatively flat and a layer of bulk ppy is loaded after electrodeposition fig 2 c and d and a layer of ppy is evenly loaded after electrophoretic deposition shape of the czbn in fig 2 e and f the morphology of czbn deposited on ppy was consistent with that before deposition fig s2 a and b indicating that the electrophoretic deposition process did not destroy the structure of czbn the cross sectional view of 50czbn ppy in fig 2b can clearly see the three layer structure of graphite substrate ppy and czbn the highly conductive ppy acts as a continuous conductive pathway for rapid electron transport between graphite and czbn the elemental mapping fig 2g l shows the uniform distribution of c n o zn and ce fig s2c h shows the effect of different czbn suspension concentrations on the morphology of the czbn ppy electrode as anticipated increasing the concentration of czbn suspension can make czbn more densely deposited on the surface of the ppy film but it in turn affects the fluorine removal performance of the czbn ppy electrode this can be confirmed in subsequent cdi defluorination experiments fig s3 shows the sem image and corresponding eds elemental mapping image of 50czbn ppy after fluorine adsorption it is found that many fluffy substances appear after adsorption the eds elemental mapping shows the uniform distribution of f which confirms the adsorption of fluoride on the surface of 50czbn ppy fig s4 is the sem image of mno2 and its corresponding eds elemental mapping it can be seen from fig s4 a and b that the electrodeposited mno2 shows a flower like structure elemental mapping fig s4c e shows a uniform distribution of o and mn fig s5 shows the sem image of mno2 after adsorption of na adsorption and its corresponding eds elemental mapping many fluffy substances appears after adsorption indicating that na was successfully adsorbed on mno2 the uniform distribution of o mn and na which further confirms the adsorption of na on the surface of mno2 fig 3 a and b shows the xrd patterns of ppy czbn and czbn ppy grown with epd suspensions of different concentrations the diffraction peaks at 26 57 and 54 65 can be attributed to graphite substrate fig 3a jcpds card no 41 1487 while the other diffraction peaks at 9 92 17 20 and 19 7 are attributed to czbn fig 3b he et al 2020 the deposited czbn and czbn powder maintain the same crystal structure in addition the xrd patterns of czbn ppy grown with different concentrations of epd suspensions show that the relative diffraction peak intensity increases with the increase of epd concentration which means that more czbn was deposited on the ppy film fig 3c shows the ftir spectra of czbn and czbn ppy and there is no significant difference between the spectra of czbn ppy and czbn powder indicating that czbn ppy retains most of the characteristics of czbn the absorption peaks at 3460 cm 1 and 3365 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of n h and o h rikhari et al 2018 respectively the peak bands at 1555 cm 1 and 1385 cm 1 are attributed to the asymmetry and symmetric stretching vibration of carbonyl c o group in cooh abid et al 2013 the c h bending vibrations at 1250 cm 1 840 cm 1 and 768 cm 1 confirm the existence of benzene ring liu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the characteristic peaks at 582 cm 1 and 512 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibrations of ce o and zn o bonds in czbn aykac ozen and ozturk 2019 the ftir pattern confirms the successful synthesis and electrophoretic deposition of czbn the specific surface area and porosity of ppy czbn and czbn ppy were determined by nitrogen adsorption desorption method as shown in fig 3d all three samples exhibit type iv isotherms and type h3 hysteresis loops with typical microporous and mesoporous material structures gao et al 2020 the specific surface areas of ppy czbn and czbn ppy are 9 56 62 75 and 32 46 m2 g respectively indicating that the introduction of czbn increases the specific surface area of the electrode material the psd curves the inset of fig 3d further demonstrate the existence of micropores and mesopores in the as prepared materials the loose structure and porous properties of czbn ppy can provide more active sites and fast ion transport during cdi defluorination the composition and chemical valence states of ppy and 50czbn ppy were probed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 4 a the xps peaks of 50czbn ppy are ascribed to c 1s n 1s o 1s zn 2p and ce 3d for the c 1s spectrum in fig 4b three peaks of 284 8 286 3 and 288 6 ev correspond to c c c o c and o c o groups wang et al 2020 respectively the n 1s spectrum in fig 4c shows four types of n species n nh and n at 398 4 399 1 and 399 9 ev tan et al 2020 the high resolution o 1s spectrum in fig 4d are fitted to four peaks 529 2 531 2 532 6 and 533 3 ev which are ascribed to zn ce o oh o c o and adsorbed oxygen oads groups he et al 2020 these analyses are in good agreement with the ftir results for the zn 2p spectrum as shown in fig 4e the two peaks around 1044 8 and 1021 7 ev correspond to zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 with a spin energy separation of 23 ev which is consistent with the characteristics of zn2 the high resolution ce 3d spectrum shown in fig 4f consists of two parts i 903 6 and 899 2 ev for ce 3d3 2 and 885 1 and 881 0 ev for ce 3d5 2 of ce3 ii 916 5 906 3 and 901 0 ev for ce 3d3 2 and 898 0 886 9 and 882 7 ev for ce 3d5 2 of ce4 li et al 2018 the ce ions in the 50czbn ppy may enhance the fluoride removal performance of materials li et al 2019 the electrochemical performance of ppy czbn ppy and mno2 in 0 5 m naf solution were tested by a three electrode system as shown in fig s6 the area of cv curve increases with scan rate moreover the cv curves of ppy and czbn ppy are rectangular indicating that they play the role of pseudocapacitance in addition the cv curve area of ppy at 5 mv s is larger than that of czbn ppy fig 5 a and the specific capacitance of ppy is also the highest compared with czbn ppy samples fig 5b this indicates that the addition of ppy can increase the capacitance of czbn which improves the charge transport between the electrode and solution particularly there is a redox peak in the cv curve of mno2 electrode which is attributed to the na intercalation reaction at the mno2 electrode as shown in eq 1 tan et al 2020 tu et al 2021 1 mn o 2 n a e mnoona further insight into the capacitive defluorination process was carried out through eis testing fig 5c a nyquist plot consists of a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the mid low frequency region the diameter of the semicircle in the high frequency region represents the magnitude of charge transfer resistance rct the rct value of ppy 33 06 ω is greater than that of czbn ppy 10 31 1 14 1 12 and 1 15 ω for 10czbn ppy 30czbn ppy 50czbn ppy and 80cabn ppy respectively the reason for this phenomenon may be the decreased content of ppy after deposition of czbn furthermore in the mid low frequency region of the nyquist curve the real part of impedance z is linearly related to the negative 0 5 power of the angular frequency w 1 2 fig 5d from which the ion diffusion resistance rit can be obtained the rit of ppy 2 73 ω is lower than that of czbn ppy 3 36 3 58 3 22 and 2 92 ω for 10czbn ppy 30czbn ppy 50czbn ppy and 80cabn ppy respectively because ppy is a conductive polymer and it has low ionic diffusion resistance it can be further found that rit decreases with the increase of czbn content which is because czbn can specifically bind with f and the increase in czbn content enhances the ion transport between electrode and solution we also compared the electrochemical performance of ppy czbn and 50czbn ppy as shown in fig s7 it can be found that 50czbn ppy has higher capacitance and lower charge transfer resistance than czbn 3 2 cdi defluorination performance the f removal capacity of czbn ppy electrodes was investigated in batch mode fig 6 a reflects the change of f removal capacity with time at an initial f concentration of 10 mg l and an operating voltage of 1 2 v it can be remarkably found that the f removal capacity rises rapidly in the first 15 min and finally reaches equilibrium the final f concentration reaches about 1 22 1 53 2 52 and 2 11 mg l for 80 50 30 and 10czbn ppy mno2 electrode system respectively however the final concentration of naf solution treated with ppy mno2 without czbn coating is 7 10 mg l these results indicate the efficient enhancement on f removal through czbn coating noteworthy 80czbn ppy mno2 shows high removal efficiency for f and the treated wastewater can reach the standard of less than 1 5 mg l required by who although 80czbn ppy mno2 can reduce the f concentration to the standard recommended by who the combination between czbn and ppy in the outer layer is not strong due to the excessive loading of czbn this results in the instability of the electrode therefore 50czbn ppy mno2 electrodes were used in the follow up researches in actual production multiple pairs of electrodes can be connected in series to reduce the f concentration to the required standard value to this end we studied the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 at an initial f concentration of 5 mg l as a function of time as shown in fig s11 the final f concentration was 1 02 mg l which was less than the who recommended it shows that the idea of connecting multiple pairs of electrodes in series to reduce the f concentration to the required standard value is completely feasible in addition the f removal performance of ppy mno2 czbn mno2 and 50czbn ppy mno2 was compared fig s10 the results showed that the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 was significantly higher than that of czbn mno2 this further confirms that the introduction of ppy improves the f removal ability of the electrode we also studied the adsorption kinetics of the 50czbn ppy mno2 system as shown in fig s12 and the relevant parameters are listed in table s1 the fitting results show that the adsorption of f is more in line with the pseudo second order kinetic model and the adsorption process mainly chemical adsorption the charge utilization and energy loss during cdi defluorination were measured by charge efficiency the current transient curves and charge efficiency in solution were calculated for 50 30 10czbn ppy mno2 and ppy mno2 at 10 mg l f with a voltage of 1 2 v as shown in fig 6b the current graph drops sharply within 10 minutes and from its inset it can be seen that with the increase of czbn content the charge efficiency first increases and then decreases which may be due to the fact that more f are trapped with the introduction of czbn however with the further increase of czbn loading the f concentration is insufficient and the active adsorption sites are excessive thus resulting in a decrease in charge efficiency fig 6c shows the trade off curve between specific inverse energy consumption sec 1 and ion removal rate irr during cdi defluorination it can be seen that the sec 1 value of 10czbn ppy mno2 is always higher than other samples under the same irr this means that 10czbn ppy mno2 shows the most efficient energy usage wang et al 2021 the variation of the deionized product water specific gibbs free energy δg and the energy efficiency ee with the energy consumption ec during cdi defluorination are shown in fig 6d and s13 it can be seen that ee first increases and then decreases during the cdi defluorination process this is because in the whole process of f removal the main ions were removed first and the secondary ions were removed later finally the ee for 50czbn ppy mno2 were about 31 4 which were higher than those of 30czbn ppy mno2 29 0 10czbn ppy mno2 15 1 and ppy mno2 10 1 the f removal performance of 50czbn ppy mno2 for 10 mg l f naf under different applied voltage conditions was investigated as shown in fig 7 a when the applied voltage increases the f removal capacity shows first increasing and then decreasing according to the theoretical analysis of the electric double layer the rise of the voltage makes the electric double layer denser resulting in an increase in the adsorption capacity when the applied voltage reaches a certain threshold the excessive voltage will cause side reactions such as water electrolysis electrode material reaction etc which reduces the f removal performance of electrode materials and increases energy consumption it can be seen from fig s14 and s15 that sec 1 increases but charge efficiency and ee decrease with the increase of applied voltage it shows that the increase in voltage increases the total energy consumption and reduces the energy utilization rate the rise in applied voltage on the one hand the increase in the amount of ion adsorption and the effective energy consumption and on the other hand leads to the intensification of electrode side reactions which increases the ineffective energy consumption fig 7b shows the f removal performance of 50czbn ppy mno2 under different ph conditions the electrode exhibits high f removal performance under acidic and neutral conditions and the removal performance is the highest at ph 6 under acidic conditions the electrode surface has more positive charges and its electrostatic attraction with f is beneficial to the removal of excess fluoride however at lower ph the f removal capacity decreases because the content of hf2 in the solution starts to increase at lower ph causing a decrease in the removal ability of f the f removal performance decreased rapidly under alkaline conditions this is likely because the hydroxyl ion concentration in the solution is higher under alkaline conditions which competes with f for adsorption resulting in a decrease in the removal efficiency of f therefore it can be concluded that the czbn ppy electrode has better treatment capacity for neutral and acidic wastewater the effect of mass ratio beween mno2 and czbn ppy electrodes on the f removal ability was investigated as shown in fig 7c when the mass ratio of mno2 to 50czbn ppy was 1 2 the cdi system obtained the highest f removal capacity the effect of initial f concentration on the cdi defluorination ability of 50czbn ppy mno2 was investigated fig 7d with the increase of initial f concentration the f removal capacity increases the main reason is that the conductivity of the solution increases due to the increase of f concentration under the same electric field force ions are more likely to enter the electric double layer and be adsorbed the f removal capacity at an initial f concentration of 100 mg l was 55 12 mg g which was greatly higher than recently reported electrode materials in the literatures table 1 indicating that 50czbn ppy mno2 is a potential cdi defluorination electrode we also simulated the f removal data at different initial f concentrations using the langmuir and freundlich models as shown in fig s16 and the relevant parameters are listed in table s2 the fitting results show that the adsorption of f on 50czbn ppy is more in line with the langmuir model indicating that f is adsorbed in the form of a monolayer on the electrode surface the f removal capacity at different flow rates was explored as shown in fig s17 the larger the flow rate the better the f removal capacity this may be because the low flow rate will reduce the volume concentration of f resulting in reduced f removal capacity zhang et al 2022 however after 120 min the equilibrium concentrations of the three flow rates were all similar and the time to reach equilibrium was the shortest when the flow rate was 40 ml min so 40 ml min was chosen as the optimal flow rate the effect of common competing anions na3po4 na2so4 nano3 nacl in wastewater on the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 electrode was studied fig 7e the results show that in the range of 10 100 mg l competitive anions concentration the interference and competition of phosphate on f removal is the most serious which may be due to its higher negative charge density nitrates chlorides and sulfates have low interference effects on f removal the order of their influence is phosphate sulfate nitrate chloride we also investigated the effect of some cations nh4cl cacl2 and mgcl2 on the f removal ability of the 50czbn ppy mno2 electrode fig s18 the results showed that ammonium had little effect on the removal of f while calcium and magnesium ions could promote the removal of f which may be due to their interaction with f gao et al 2020 shao et al 2021 the regeneration performance of 50czbn ppy mno2 under application of 1 2 v reverse voltage and open circuit was investigated respectively as shown in fig s19 when a reverse voltage of 1 2 v is applied the f concentration can be regenerated to 70 of the initial concentration while the f concentration can only be regenerated to 26 of the initial concentration when the circuit is kept open it is shown that the electrostatic repulsion between f and the electrode is favorable for electrode regeneration the f removal capacity of 50czbn ppy mno2 and czbn mno2 after 5 consecutive removal regeneration cycles was investigated as shown in fig 7f the f removal capacity of the 50czbn ppy mno2 electrode decreased slightly from 9 48 mg g to 7 83 mg g which was 84 of the initial f removal capacity it shows that czbn ppy is an efficient economical eco friendly and recyclable electrode material and has good practical application prospects however the f removal capacity of czbn mno2 electrode decreased slightly from 5 90 mg g to 2 04 mg g which was only 35 of the initial f removal capacity which indicated that the introduction of ppy had a positive effect on improving the removal regeneration cycle of the electrode effect 3 3 adsorption mechanism fig s20 shows the ftir spectra of 50czbn ppy electrode before and after defluorination it can be seen from the figure that the absorption peaks at 3460 cm 1 3365 cm 1 582 cm 1 and 512 cm 1 disappear after adsorption indicating that fluoride interacts with hydroxyl amino and metal to gain more insights into the cdi adsorption mechanism the xps spectra of 50czbn ppy and mno2 before and after naf adsorption were compared in fig 8 and s21 as shown in fig 8a and s21a f 1s and na 1s peaks can be observed after adsorption at anode and cathode which indicates that fluoride and sodium ions are well adsorbed in 50czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes respectively in the n 1s spectrum in fig 8b before and after f adsorption the peak area ratio of n decreases from 31 75 to 30 47 before and after adsorption and nh2 peak area ratio reduces from 21 87 to 8 63 however the peak area ratio of nh3 increases from 46 38 to 60 9 before and after adsorption owing to the existence of free h in water czbn ppy can be protonated by bonding additional h to the surface therefore these edge sites nh3 can intercalate anionic f through electrostatic interactions jeyaseelan et al 2021 in the o 1s spectrum in fig 8c before and after f adsorption the ce zn o peak area ratio decreases from 18 54 to 2 6 ce oh peak area ratio reduces from 47 34 to 18 41 while o c o peak area ratio increases from 21 94 to 62 72 and the peak area ratio of h2o elevates from 12 18 to 16 26 indicating that most of the hydroxyl groups oh in 50czbn ppy is replaced by fluoride through ligand exchange reactions gao et al 2020 the ce 3d spectra before and after f adsorption is shown in fig 8d the molar ratio of ce4 ce3 before and after adsorption increases from 0 14 to 0 64 indicating that the ce3 was converted into ce4 during the charging process thereby generating positive charges on the surface of the 50czbn ppy electrode anions are adsorbed to maintain charge balance li et al 2019 moreover in the mn 2p spectra of mno2 in fig s21b after f adsorption the molar ratio of high valence manganese to low valence manganese mn4 mn3 mn2 decreases from 0 64 to 0 25 which further proves the occurrence of na intercalation reaction at the mno2 electrode the schematic diagram of cdi defluorination mechanism is shown in fig 8e 4 conclusions in this work a fast efficient and membrane free cdi system was constructed with czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes which can efficiently and selectively remove f czbn ppy and na mno2 the faraday pseudocapacitive behavior of czbn ppy and mno2 electrodes significantly improves the f removal performance the removal capacity of 50czbn ppy for f can reaches 55 12 mg g in 1 2 v 100 mg l f solution which was greatly higher than recently reported electrode materials importantly it shows high f selectivity in the presence of some common anions the mechanism of f removal is mainly based on the electric double layer on the electrode surface the pseudocapacitance contributed by the redox reaction on the electrode surface the electrostatic adsorption of nh3 and the ion exchange of hydroxyl groups the electrode has good reusability and can maintain high f removal ability enen after five adsorption regeneration processes therefore the czbn ppy mno2 electrode system can be used as an efficient economical sustainable and environmentally friendly selective defluorination system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

been expanding to deliver water across china to meet water demands in populated and industrial areas water scarcity may threaten the ability to produce and distribute goods through supply chains yet it is not clear if ibwts transmit or buffer water scarcity throughout supply chains here we combine a national database of ibwt projects and multi region input output analysis to trace water transferred by ibwt and virtual scarce water scarcity weighted water use from ibwt sourcing basins to production sites then to end consumers the results indicate that production and final consumption of sectoral products have been increasingly supported by ibwt infrastructure with physically transferred water volumes doubling between 2007 and 2017 virtual scarce water is about half of the virtual water supporting the supply chain of the nation ibwt effectively reduced virtual scarce water supporting the supply chains of most provinces with the exposure to water scarcity reduced by a maximum of 56 7 and 15 0 for production and final consumption respectively ibwt infrastructure development can thus buffer water scarcity risk to the supply chain and should be considered in water management and sustainable development policy decisions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords inter basin water transfer water infrastructure virtual water transfer water sustainability input output

their spatial distribution is highly unequal and often mismatches water demands in many countries oki et al 2006 tang 2020 inter basin water transfer ibwt infrastructure is often constructed to bring freshwater supplies to locations that do not have enough water to support their population or economic activities shumilova et al 2018 rising et al 2022 global cumulative ibwt capacity has been risen since the 20th century and is projected to grow into the future rollason et al 2022 china has invested heavily in ibwt infrastructure to redistribute water across different river basins with varied levels of water endowment zhang et al 2015 sun et al 2021 often with economic social and environmental costs particularly for ibwt source basins ding et al 2020 for example china has spent more than 500 billion rmb yuan on the south to north water diversion project to connect the yangtze river to north china which is to date the largest ibwt scheme in the world in terms of the construction scale water transfer volume and distance nong et al 2020 water used throughout the production process of a good is referred to as virtual water allan 1992 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 so the transfer of agricultural and industrial products between regions through trade implies virtual water transfer dalin et al 2014 d odorico et al 2019 water can be spatially redistributed physically through ibwt projects gohari et al 2013 and virtually through embodied water in traded products and services suweis et al 2011 konar et al 2016 most previous research focused on the effect of physical or virtual water transfer alone yang et al 2013 li et al 2016 one exception by zhao et al 2015 has examined physical and virtual water transfers within china revealing their respective effects on water stress alleviation however we still do not understand well to what extent ibwt supports production supply chains and consumption water scarcity may threaten the ability to produce and distribute goods through supply chains when natural water availability is not able to meet water demand in a sustainable manner mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore regions industries and people may be vulnerable not only to local water scarcity but also to water scarcity facing upstream suppliers that are geographically distant qu et al 2018 to quantify water risks due to unsustainable water use in supply chains it is important to analyze virtual scarce water i e scarcity weighted water use instead of total virtual water volumes feng et al 2014 weinzettel and pfister 2019 the structure of virtual water networks may change significantly after adjusting for water scarcity zhao et al 2018 ibwt water replaces physical water use for production in water receiving basins with water from sourcing basins in this way ibwt generally increases water scarcity risk from sourcing basins by increasing water withdrawal in these basins and buffer water scarcity risk in water receiving basins by reducing local water use the changing water scarcity in ibwt sourcing and receiving basins is then transmitted throughout the supply chain whether ibwt transmits or buffer water scarcity in supply chains which is an important research question remains not addressed the goal of this study is to answer two important research questions 1 to what extent ibwt supports production and consumption of different regions and 2 does ibwt transmit or buffer water scarcity in supply chains distinguished from a previous study that focused on the impact of ibwt on regional water scarcity sun et al 2021 the novelty of this study lies in connecting physical water transfer with production trade and consumption through supply chains we trace physically transferred water from sourcing basins to recipients and then to end consumers through the supply chain in china from 2007 to 2017 this enables us to evaluate the role of ibwt in transmitting or buffering water scarcity along the supply chain at regional and sectoral levels to this end a database of ibwt projects in china was linked to a multi region input output mrio analysis to track physically transferred water embedded in various products for inter provincial and international trade the supporting role of ibwt in the supply chain was quantified from both the production and consumption perspectives the role of ibwt in either transmitting or buffering water scarcity along the supply chain was addressed using virtual scarce water analysis the results advance our understanding of the relationship between ibwt infrastructure and supply chains with implications for managing water scarcity risks in supply chains 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we compiled a new dataset consisting of inter basin water transfer projects in china based on a previous dataset sun et al 2021 and a few more projects across third order river basins supplementary information table s1 key information on ibwt projects including source and recipient provinces they might be the same in a project as a province often contains a number of river basins installed ibwt capacity project completion year target sectoral water uses agricultural industrial and domestic use was collected china s multi region input output mrio tables in 2007 2010 2012 2015 and 2017 liu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 which characterize transaction relations of products and services for both intermediate and final uses between sectors and provinces in monetary unit were used to simulate domestic virtual water transfer and export in china because these mrio tables have different sectoral divisions sectors of all the tables were harmonized into 30 sectors supplementary information table s2 agricultural industrial and domestic water uses at the provincial level were referenced from china water resources bulletins mwrc 2007 2017 these three categories of water use were disaggregated at the detailed sectoral level that is consistent to that of the mrio tables according to survey based fine sectoral level reconstruction water use data zhou et al 2020 and the intermediate input relationship of water production and supply sector in the mrio table as the operation data of water transfer projects are not available projects except the south to north water transfer project were assumed to operate at 80 installed capacity following a previous study sun et al 2021 considering that the south to north water diversion project was operated at a testing stage since 2014 we assumed that it operated at 50 installed capacity in 2017 according to online reports ibwt was also disaggregated into sectoral uses at a high resolution based on the project target water uses and quantitative sectoral water uses of the recipient province annual provincial level natural water availability and sectoral water use data between 2007 and 2017 mwrc 2007 2017 were downscaled at the 0 25 0 25 arc degree grid level based on variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model simulation results and other multiple sourced information following previous studies ma et al 2020 sun et al 2022 the grid level water availability and water uses were then aggregated at the sub basin level to assess water scarcity in the 76 sub basins of china s mainland 2 2 virtual water transfer accounting and ibwt embedded in the supply chain the estimation of china s domestic virtual water transfer and export follows the environmentally extended mrio analysis framework applied in many previous studies zhang and anadon 2014 sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 in the mrio table with r regions and n economic sectors the total economic output x a column vector comprised of rn elements can be expressed as a function of final consumption of different products y a column vector of rn elements 1 x i a 1 y where i is the unit matrix a is the matrix of technical coefficients i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix the sectoral water use vector w for sectoral production consisting of rn elements is introduced as 2 w d x d i a 1 y t y where d is a dialogical matrix of direct water use intensity representing the direct water use per unit output in each sector and t is an rn rn matrix of total water use intensity signifying total water use per unit product for final consumption virtual water transfer embedded in domestic and international supply chain can be derived based on eq 2 see supplementary information we also combined the multi regional input output table and ibwt data under the environmentally extended mrio analysis framework to trace physically transferred water along the supply chain in this way water was traced from sourcing basins to production sites according to the ibwt project database and then to domestic and international end consumers based on the mrio analysis when replacing general water use w in eq 2 with the use of ibwt denoted as w t ibwt for production use can be written 3 w t d t x d t i a 1 y t t y where d t is a dialogical matrix of direct ibwt intensity and t t is a matrix of total ibwt use intensity elements in d t and t t is not larger than corresponding ones in d and t because ibwt comprises only a share of sectoral water uses for production activities because mrio tables are available in 2007 2010 2012 2015 and 2017 water volumes from ibwt in corresponding years were introduced in eq 3 to track physically transferred water from production to final consumption 2 3 measuring the supporting role of ibwt for production and consumption ibwt supports both production activities and final consumption in china s supply chain here we developed two indicators to quantify the reliance of the supply chain on physical water transfer across different regions from both the production and consumption perspectives 4 s prod i w t i w i s cons i w f t i w f i where s prod i and s cons i are the supporting role of physical water transfer in the supply chain from the production and consumption perspectives in region i respectively w t i is physically transferred water for production and w f t i is physically transferred water embedded in products for final consumption these two indicators s prod i and s cons i are represented by a percentage value ranging from 0 indicating no support to 1 complete support 2 4 virtual scarce water accounting virtual scarce water is defined as scarcity weighted virtual water following previous research pfister et al 2009 water scarcity which is commonly demand driven liu et al 2017 sun et al 2021 is measured as the ratio of water use to water availability referred to as wta following many previous studies wada et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 vanham et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 because a smaller grid scale may not capture possible substantial distance between water abstraction and use within a grid cell and a larger scale may not be able to consider heterogeneity of spatial water resource and use ma et al 2020 sub basins are spatial units at which water scarcity assessment is considered adequate sun et al 2021 water scarcity in the year t is assessed for a sub basin of interest using the equation below 5 w t a t w u t w a where wu t indicates water use in year t and wa is the mean natural water availability in the sub basin of interest between 2007 and 2107 when ibwt is implemented wta t in one sub basin can be calculated following the previous study sun et al 2021 6 w t a t w u t i β w t i t w a β 1 water received from project i 1 water delivered in project i where wti t is the ibwt volume of project i in year t and i β w t i t denotes net ibwt volume of the sub basin of interest in year t a positive net ibwt volume indicates net delivering water volume to other sub basins and a negative net ibwt volume indicates net receiving water volume wta is then converted to water stress index wsi using a logistic function following a previous approach pfister et al 2009 7 w s i 1 1 e 11 5 w t a 1 0 01 1 wsi ranges from 0 01 assuming any water withdrawal has marginal local impact and 1 wsi is tuned to be 0 5 for a wta of 0 4 which is often considered as the threshold between moderate and significant water stress when replacing general water use w in eq 2 with the scarce water use i e water use weighted with wsi denoted as ws scarce water for production use can be written 8 w s d s x d s i a 1 y t s y where d s is a dialogical matrix of direct scarce water use intensity and t s is a matrix of total scarce water use intensity similarly virtual scarce water embedded in domestic and international supply chain can be computed based on eq 8 provincial level scarce water uses are needed in eq 8 within the boundary of each province water uses in different sub basins aggregated from grid level water uses are weighted by water stress index of corresponding sub basins and are then summed up to obtain scarce water use for that province 2 5 assessing the exposure of production and consumption to water scarcity the supply chain is exposed to water scarcity risk as the supply chain relies on scarce water resources two indicators are developed to quantify the exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity across different regions from both the production and consumption perspectives 9 e prod i w s i w i e cons i w f s i w f i where e prod i and e cons i are the exposure of production and final consumption to water scarcity in the supply chain of region i respectively w s i is scarce water resources used for production and w f s i is virtual scarce water embedded in products for final consumption these two indicators e prod i and e cons i are represented by a percentage value ranging from 0 indicating no exposure to 1 complete exposure 3 results 3 1 ibwt increases as infrastructure expands in china ibwt infrastructure has been increasingly built in china since the 1950s to meet growing water demands for cities and irrigation most ibwt projects have been constructed in the east of china where cities industries and croplands are concentrated these projects are distributed in 22 of 30 provincial level administrative units hereafter referred to as provinces for short in 2017 tibet hong kong macao and taiwan are not considered due to lack of data fig 1 and supplementary information fig s1 the installed ibwt capacity has reached 25 2 billion m3 yr 1 by 2007 and 57 8 billion m3 yr 1 by 2017 figs 1 and 2 a which is equivalent to 9 of the national water use fig 2b the majority of ibwt projects were constructed within provincial boundaries technological and economic development has enabled water to be transferred along increasing distances ibwt length in 1950 was less than 1000 km growing to more than 14 000 km in 2017 when the south to north water diversion project started to deliver water from downstream yangtze river to beijing tianjin hebei jiangsu and shandong provinces in 2014 the share of installed ibwt capacity across different provinces was increased to nearly one third the share of ibwt capacity within provincial boundaries about two thirds provinces receiving the most water through inter provincial ibwt were tianjin beijing and hebei located in water scarce north china plain whereas inter provincial ibwt sourcing provinces were hubei jiangsu shandong and hebei human water use is categorized into agricultural industrial domestic and eco environmental compensation uses within china mwrc 2007 2017 domestic water use include tertiary and household water uses an ibwt project may be designed for a specific water use or combination of uses in china ibwt are most often designed to provide urban water supplies to support important social functions and economic benefits there is an increasing trend in percentages of sectoral water uses that can be met by installed water transfer capacity the installed ibwt capacity is able to meet 16 4 domestic water demand and 13 0 industrial water demand of the nation in 2017 which are higher than that for agricultural water demand 6 5 fig 2b industrial and domestic water uses comprised 30 5 and 22 7 ibwt water which were higher than the shares of total water for industrial and domestic water uses 21 2 and 13 9 fig 2c this highlights that water from ibwt sources is particularly important to certain economic sectors i e to economic production in industrial and tertiary sectors 3 2 ibwt plays an increasing role in supporting the supply chains the majority of water transferred by ibwt in china over three quarters supports the production of primary secondary and tertiary goods with the remainder of ibwt volumes supporting household and eco environmental compensation uses here we traced physically transferred water through the supply chain using an environmentally extended mrio analysis in 2007 about 19 1 billion m3 water lower than the ibwt installed capacity was diverted among 18 provinces through tunnels channels and pumping schemes that connect different basins in which 15 5 billion m3 81 2 entered the supply chain and was virtually embedded in various products for final consumption supplementary information fig s2 in 2017 39 5 billion m3 water was diverted through ibwt to 21 provinces of this 30 9 billion m3 78 2 was used for production and supported the supply chain fig 3 although only 18 provinces physically received ibwt water in 2007 growing to 21 provinces in 2017 all of the other provinces and international consumers received virtual ibwt water in their receipts of products through the supply chain fig 3 the volume of ibwt water embedded in inter provincial trade through supply chains grew from 4 8 billion m3 in 2007 to 11 2 billion m3 in 2017 showing a 133 increase similarly ibwt water volumes transferred to international consumers through supply chains grew from 4 0 billion m3 in 2007 to 4 8 billion m3 in 2017 increase of 20 this constitutes 25 9 and 15 5 of china s ibwt water for production purpose in 2007 and 2017 respectively key provinces exporting ibwt water to international end consumers through the supply chain were jiangsu guangdong shanghai and henan all of which are recipients of large volumes of ibwt water ibwt supports both production activities and final consumption the volume of ibwt water doubled between 2007 2017 leading to increased support of ibwt in china s supply chain supplementary information fig s3 at the national level ibwt supported 5 9 of the water demand from the production perspective and 5 7 from the consumption perspective in 2017 the support of ibwt to china s export was higher s cons 7 3 than the domestic supply chain according to indicators that quantify supporting roles of ibwt for production and consumption ibwt water supports production and the supply chain in a varied manner across provinces a few provinces are heavily reliant on ibwt for example tianjin s production was mostly supported by ibwt with more than half of the water demand met by ibwt in 2017 s prod 76 9 followed by beijing jilin and shanghai s prod 56 2 21 7 and 20 2 respectively table 1 there was increased support of ibwt in production in 18 provinces from 2007 to 2017 with the largest increase occurring in beijing supplementary information fig s3 physical recipients of ibwt water were concentrated in a few provinces but virtual ibwt water was spread across china through the supply chain notably production in 8 provinces did not depend on ibwt in 2017 but they were all supported by ibwt from the consumption perspective end consumers in tianjin relied the most on ibwt in 2017 with virtual ibwt water constituting 16 5 virtual water embedded in the products for final consumption followed by beijing shanghai and henan s cons 12 7 12 5 and 11 8 respectively table 1 end consumers of all the provinces were increasingly supported by ibwt between 2007 and 2017 supplementary information fig s3 there are more economic connections between provinces than physical ibwt transfers so ibwt support of the supply chain from the consumption perspective has less skewness with s cons ranging between 1 5 and 16 5 in 2017 than the production perspective with s prod ranging between 0 and 76 9 in 2017 ibwt heterogeneously supports sectors throughout china s economy supplementary information fig s4 and s5 ibwt provides larger support to production and consumption of industrial s prod 11 6 and s cons 6 5 and tertiary s prod 9 4 and s cons 7 4 goods than to the agricultural production and consumption of the nation s prod 4 5 and s cons 3 6 in 2017 there are important differences in the support of ibwt to sectoral supply chains across provinces supplementary information fig s6 and s7 for example ibwt has little support to agricultural production but high support to industrial and tertiary production in guangdong where the center of china s manufacturing industries is located export of industrial and tertiary products from china was particularly supported by ibwt with ibwt water comprising 11 3 and 13 8 of total virtual water exports in 2017 in comparison to agricultural s cons 5 1 3 3 ibwt decreases the exposure of supply chains to water scarcity water scarcity poses risks to supply chains and economic prosperity ibwts will impact water scarcity risk by physically relocating water from sourcing basins to different destinations for production uses sun et al 2021 while ibwt directly mitigates water shortage in water receiving basins it also likely intensifies water stress in sourcing basins it is unclear if the role of ibwts is to buffer water scarcity risk e g by reducing water scarcity in production sites or to transmit water scarcity risk e g by introducing water scarcity from their sourcing basins in the supply chains here we traced virtual scarce water i e scarcity weighted water use which is considered as an indicator for unsustainable water use embedded in the supply chains from production to final consumption when total water use for production increased from 507 8 billion m3 in 2007 to 526 5 billion m3 in 2017 with an increase of 3 7 virtual scarce water embedded in the supply chain showed a smaller increase of 1 1 from 243 8 billion m3 to 246 6 billion m3 the expansion of ibwt infrastructure largely explains the difference between the trends of total virtual water and virtual scarce water in the supply chains importantly a decreasing trend of virtual scarce water for production is observed in water scarce provinces in north china that are recipients of ibwt waters in spite of increasing total water uses tianjin and beijing had decreased scarce water use in production by 42 4 and 35 8 between 2007 and 2017 however more than half of the provinces in china needed more scarce water to support their production or consumption between 2007 2017 supplementary information fig s8 a hypothetical no water transfer scenario which assumes water receiving basins would use the same amount of ibwt water from local resources is used to quantify the impacts of ibwt on changing the risk of the supply chain exposed to water scarcity in 2007 ibwt scenario saved 8 1 billion m3 virtual scarce water required for the supply chain in comparison to the hypothetical no water transfer scenario with virtual scarce water reaching 255 2 billion m3 fig 4 virtual scarce water required for the supply chain in 2017 would reach 262 7 billion m3 under the hypothetical no water transfer scenario which was 16 2 billion m3 more than the ibwt scenario fig 4 this means that ibwt overall reduces the reliance of the supply chain on scarce water resources however different provinces may benefit or suffer changing virtual scarce water volumes due to ibwt jiangsu province benefited most from ibwt with the largest volume of scarce water saved for both production saving 6 2 billion m3 and final consumption saving 3 6 billion m3 followed by shandong liaoning shanghai heilongjiang beijing and tianjin in 2017 these provinces were the top recipients of ibwt waters fig 1 in contrast shanxi jilin and qinghai included more scarce water in their production in ibwt scenario in comparison to hypothetical no water transfer scenario some provinces that did not directly receive ibwt water also benefited from ibwt with reduced reliance of final consumption on virtual scarce water virtual scarce water embedded in export for international end consumers was 32 4 billion m3 but would have been 36 1 billion m3 in the no water transfer scenario in 2017 with a saving of 3 7 billion m3 scarce water through ibwt virtual scarce water represents about half of the virtual water supporting chinese supply chains confirming the prevalence of water stress facing china s water supply systems we assessed the ratio of scarce water to total virtual water embedded in the supply chain to quantify the exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity the comparison between ibwt and hypothetical no water transfer scenarios showed that ibwt reduced the exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity from 50 8 to 50 1 at the national level in 2017 because the exposure showed high spatial heterogeneity ibwt was particularly important in reducing the exposure to water scarcity in a few provinces that received ibwt water tianjin shandong beijing and shanghai were the provinces benefitting most from ibwt in terms of reduced exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity from both the production and final consumption perspectives in 2017 fig 5 ibwt reduced water scarcity exposure of production between 0 1 and 56 7 across 20 provinces but increased water scarcity exposure of production in 3 provinces i e shanxi jilin and qinghai ibwt did not impact water scarcity exposure of production in the remaining 7 provinces in 2017 which changed water scarcity exposure less than 0 1 fig 5a ibwt have reduced exposure of end consumers to water scarcity across 29 provinces with the reduced exposure distributed in a less wide range i e between 0 7 and 15 0 qinghai which is faced with lower water scarcity exposure 38 under the ibwt scenario than national average 51 is the only province exposed to increased water scarcity for consumption in 2017 fig 5b the exposure of export through international supply chains to water scarcity was reduced from 51 7 to 47 3 by ibwt in 2017 exposure to water scarcity of provinces has been involved since 2007 fig 5 as an increasing number of ibwt projects were built production and final consumption of sectoral products benefited from ibwt to different degrees the exposure of agricultural industrial and tertiary production in china to water scarcity was reduced by 3 3 4 9 and 7 4 through ibwt in 2017 e prod 48 7 42 5 and 41 3 for these three sectors in water transfer scenario because agricultural products are important intermediate inputs to other sectoral goods final consumption of industrial and tertiary products in china was exposed to higher water scarcity than corresponding exposure in production e cons 46 7 and 46 1 reduced by 3 8 and 4 9 through ibwt in comparison to no water transfer scenario see supplementary fig s9 final consumption of agricultural goods is subject to lower exposure to water scarcity than production e cons 46 4 reduced by 2 7 through ibwt 4 discussion as the reach of ibwt infrastructure expands it is playing an increasingly important role in reducing direct and indirect water stress in china ibwt supported 6 5 of the total water use in china s supply chain in 2017 and the reliance of the supply chain on ibwt water can be much higher in a few provinces final consumption of economic goods has been increasingly supported by ibwt between 2007 and 2017 though a number of provinces did not receive ibwt water directly in their production activities physically transferred water has been indirectly incorporated in their supply chain of various products and increasingly supported the end consumers international end consumers have also witnessed an increase of support by ibwt infrastructure with increasing ibwt water embedded in exported products from china what matters in water use management is scarce water resources rather than neutral or abundant water weinzettel and pfister 2019 due to the scarcity value of water and different impacts of water use on local water resources and ecosystems feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 it is therefore important to see how ibwt impacts scarce water use throughout the supply chains our assessment showed that ibwt saved 20 6 billion m3 scarce water use in the supply chain in 2017 in comparison to no water transfer scenario and end consumers of all the provinces except qinghai benefited from ibwt with scarce water saving throughout the supply chains international end consumers were exposed to reduced water scarcity in the receipt of sectoral goods embedding physically transferred water this means that ibwt infrastructure allows water stressed regions to exploit new sources of surface water and hence allow sustainable water use to be institutionalized in a wider spatial range than river basin level through hydraulically connecting different basins thus we concluded that ibwt plays a crucial role in reducing water scarcity risks in supply chains and providing water security to economies and society in this study we measured virtual scarce water using average water availability information between 2007 and 2017 which shows virtual scarce water flows during average water balance conditions river basins may experience more extreme water scarcity in certain years such as during drought conditions huang et al 2021 our results on water scarcity risks should thus be understood in the context of average conditions during which water demands are typically more than 40 of average available supplies liu et al 2017 the results highlight the long term risks facing economic production and supply chains from chronic water stress in the basins of china rather than from short term water hazards such as droughts and floods we find that ibwt serves as a buffer to supply chains against such long term average water scarcity risk during short term drought conditions ibwt should also be effective in reducing virtual scarce water use through optimized allocation of water a few water stressed basins e g sub basins along the yellow river are ibwt sourcing basins that may transmit water stress through physical water transfers sun et al 2021 though water is physically transferred to more water scarce regions e g hai river sub basins ibwt receivers and end consumers should know water scarcity and supply chain risk upstream their supply chain production in ibwt sourcing basins is subject to higher exposure to water scarcity risk due to ibwt because providing water supply to external regions aggravates their water scarcity particularly jilin qinghai and shanxi provinces are faced with higher exposure to water scarcity in their production proper compensation from physical water recipients will prevent underestimation of water resources values and compensate water sourcing regions for their restricted local water development because ibwt is usually at high economic cost construction of conveyance channels reservoirs and pump stations and maintenance cost and primarily for industrial and domestic uses with high added values producers and water managers can signal the economic value of ibwt through the market for this important water input in order to balance the benefits and costs of ibwt it is important to apply a broad suite of institutions and policies e g demand oriented measures such as water pricing water markets water use efficiency improvements and water use structure upgrade to achieve sustainable water use and secure the supply chain of the nation optimizing combined ibwt infrastructure supply side and demand side measures e g pricing and conservation to enhance water and supply chain sustainability should be an important area for future research there are uncertainties due to data constraints in this analysis the main sources of uncertainty originate from our assumption of actual ibwt volumes based on installed project capacity sun et al 2021 disaggregation of fine resolution sectoral water uses based on multiple sourced data sectoral aggregation of the mrio data and tables liu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 different sources of the mrio data and water use disaggregation in the environmentally extended analysis these uncertainty sources are commonly shared by mrio based virtual water analysis sun et al 2022 despite these sources of uncertainty we used the best available information to enhance our understanding of the role of ibwt infrastructure in supporting supply chains in china we examined the sensitivity of virtual water accounting results to disaggregation of industrial and tertiary water uses by varying disaggregated sectoral water uses by 20 using the monte carlo method the results showed that virtual water accounting results are not sensitive to disaggregation of fine resolution water uses given fixed aggregated industrial and tertiary water use statistics in provinces of china with relative errors varying within 3 supplementary information fig s10 in addition we conducted the analysis based on mrio data from the same data source in a shorter period between 2007 and 2012 liu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 which showed a consistent trend of increasing ibwt water volumes embedded in the supply chains supplementary information fig s11 future efforts are needed to monitor high resolution spatial and sectoral water uses ibwt water volumes and mrio relationships towards improved understanding of ibwt roles at fine spatial scale and long time period 5 conclusions inter basin water transfer ibwt is an important infrastructure component of the coupled human water system here we provided a first national analysis of the ibwt and supply chain nexus using the environmentally extended mrio technique combined with project explicit ibwt database in china we differentiate between the use of scarce water and neutral abundant water in tracing virtual water along the supply chain as scarce water has a distinct scarcity value and its use may lead to adverse environmental and or social impacts based on this ibwt and supply chain nexus analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 economic production and final consumption through supply chains have been increasingly supported by ibwt infrastructure in china although only a limited number of provinces physically received ibwt water all of the other provinces and international consumers were supported by virtual ibwt water in a varied manner in their receipts of commodities through the supply chain 2 ibwt overall reduces the virtual scarce water embedded in sectoral production and final consumption and thus can buffer water scarcity risks to supply chains ibwt infrastructure allows water stressed regions to exploit new sources of surface water and hence allow sustainable water use to be institutionalized in a wider spatial range through hydraulically connecting different watersheds however it should be noted that ibwt increased water scarcity exposure of production in three provinces and water scarcity exposure of consumption in one province 3 virtual scarce water represents about half of the virtual water supporting chinese supply chains pointing to the prevalence of water stress facing china s water supply systems despite the fact that ibwt overall reduces water scarcity risk in china s supply chain there is still much unsustainable water use throughout china that policy makers may wish to consider in

been expanding to deliver water across china to meet water demands in populated and industrial areas water scarcity may threaten the ability to produce and distribute goods through supply chains yet it is not clear if ibwts transmit or buffer water scarcity throughout supply chains here we combine a national database of ibwt projects and multi region input output analysis to trace water transferred by ibwt and virtual scarce water scarcity weighted water use from ibwt sourcing basins to production sites then to end consumers the results indicate that production and final consumption of sectoral products have been increasingly supported by ibwt infrastructure with physically transferred water volumes doubling between 2007 and 2017 virtual scarce water is about half of the virtual water supporting the supply chain of the nation ibwt effectively reduced virtual scarce water supporting the supply chains of most provinces with the exposure to water scarcity reduced by a maximum of 56 7 and 15 0 for production and final consumption respectively ibwt infrastructure development can thus buffer water scarcity risk to the supply chain and should be considered in water management and

their spatial distribution is highly unequal and often mismatches water demands in many countries oki et al 2006 tang 2020 inter basin water transfer ibwt infrastructure is often constructed to bring freshwater supplies to locations that do not have enough water to support their population or economic activities shumilova et al 2018 rising et al 2022 global cumulative ibwt capacity has been risen since the 20th century and is projected to grow into the future rollason et al 2022 china has invested heavily in ibwt infrastructure to redistribute water across different river basins with varied levels of water endowment zhang et al 2015 sun et al 2021 often with economic social and environmental costs particularly for ibwt source basins ding et al 2020 for example china has spent more than 500 billion rmb yuan on the south to north water diversion project to connect the yangtze river to north china which is to date the largest ibwt scheme in the world in terms of the construction scale water transfer volume and distance nong et al 2020 water used throughout the production process of a good is referred to as virtual water allan 1992 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 so the transfer of agricultural and industrial products between regions through trade implies virtual water transfer dalin et al 2014 d odorico et al 2019 water can be spatially redistributed physically through ibwt projects gohari et al 2013 and virtually through embodied water in traded products and services suweis et al 2011 konar et al 2016 most previous research focused on the effect of physical or virtual water transfer alone yang et al 2013 li et al 2016 one exception by zhao et al 2015 has examined physical and virtual water transfers within china revealing their respective effects on water stress alleviation however we still do not understand well to what extent ibwt supports production supply chains and consumption water scarcity may threaten the ability to produce and distribute goods through supply chains when natural water availability is not able to meet water demand in a sustainable manner mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore regions industries and people may be vulnerable not only to local water scarcity but also to water scarcity facing upstream suppliers that are geographically distant qu et al 2018 to quantify water risks due to unsustainable water use in supply chains it is important to analyze virtual scarce water i e scarcity weighted water use instead of total virtual water volumes feng et al 2014 weinzettel and pfister 2019 the structure of virtual water networks may change significantly after adjusting for water scarcity zhao et al 2018 ibwt water replaces physical water use for production in water receiving basins with water from sourcing basins in this way ibwt generally increases water scarcity risk from sourcing basins by increasing water withdrawal in these basins and buffer water scarcity risk in water receiving basins by reducing local water use the changing water scarcity in ibwt sourcing and receiving basins is then transmitted throughout the supply chain whether ibwt transmits or buffer water scarcity in supply chains which is an important research question remains not addressed the goal of this study is to answer two important research questions 1 to what extent ibwt supports production and consumption of different regions and 2 does ibwt transmit or buffer water scarcity in supply chains distinguished from a previous study that focused on the impact of ibwt on regional water scarcity sun et al 2021 the novelty of this study lies in connecting physical water transfer with production trade and consumption through supply chains we trace physically transferred water from sourcing basins to recipients and then to end consumers through the supply chain in china from 2007 to 2017 this enables us to evaluate the role of ibwt in transmitting or buffering water scarcity along the supply chain at regional and sectoral levels to this end a database of ibwt projects in china was linked to a multi region input output mrio analysis to track physically transferred water embedded in various products for inter provincial and international trade the supporting role of ibwt in the supply chain was quantified from both the production and consumption perspectives the role of ibwt in either transmitting or buffering water scarcity along the supply chain was addressed using virtual scarce water analysis the results advance our understanding of the relationship between ibwt infrastructure and supply chains with implications for managing water scarcity risks in supply chains 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we compiled a new dataset consisting of inter basin water transfer projects in china based on a previous dataset sun et al 2021 and a few more projects across third order river basins supplementary information table s1 key information on ibwt projects including source and recipient provinces they might be the same in a project as a province often contains a number of river basins installed ibwt capacity project completion year target sectoral water uses agricultural industrial and domestic use was collected china s multi region input output mrio tables in 2007 2010 2012 2015 and 2017 liu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 which characterize transaction relations of products and services for both intermediate and final uses between sectors and provinces in monetary unit were used to simulate domestic virtual water transfer and export in china because these mrio tables have different sectoral divisions sectors of all the tables were harmonized into 30 sectors supplementary information table s2 agricultural industrial and domestic water uses at the provincial level were referenced from china water resources bulletins mwrc 2007 2017 these three categories of water use were disaggregated at the detailed sectoral level that is consistent to that of the mrio tables according to survey based fine sectoral level reconstruction water use data zhou et al 2020 and the intermediate input relationship of water production and supply sector in the mrio table as the operation data of water transfer projects are not available projects except the south to north water transfer project were assumed to operate at 80 installed capacity following a previous study sun et al 2021 considering that the south to north water diversion project was operated at a testing stage since 2014 we assumed that it operated at 50 installed capacity in 2017 according to online reports ibwt was also disaggregated into sectoral uses at a high resolution based on the project target water uses and quantitative sectoral water uses of the recipient province annual provincial level natural water availability and sectoral water use data between 2007 and 2017 mwrc 2007 2017 were downscaled at the 0 25 0 25 arc degree grid level based on variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model simulation results and other multiple sourced information following previous studies ma et al 2020 sun et al 2022 the grid level water availability and water uses were then aggregated at the sub basin level to assess water scarcity in the 76 sub basins of china s mainland 2 2 virtual water transfer accounting and ibwt embedded in the supply chain the estimation of china s domestic virtual water transfer and export follows the environmentally extended mrio analysis framework applied in many previous studies zhang and anadon 2014 sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 in the mrio table with r regions and n economic sectors the total economic output x a column vector comprised of rn elements can be expressed as a function of final consumption of different products y a column vector of rn elements 1 x i a 1 y where i is the unit matrix a is the matrix of technical coefficients i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix the sectoral water use vector w for sectoral production consisting of rn elements is introduced as 2 w d x d i a 1 y t y where d is a dialogical matrix of direct water use intensity representing the direct water use per unit output in each sector and t is an rn rn matrix of total water use intensity signifying total water use per unit product for final consumption virtual water transfer embedded in domestic and international supply chain can be derived based on eq 2 see supplementary information we also combined the multi regional input output table and ibwt data under the environmentally extended mrio analysis framework to trace physically transferred water along the supply chain in this way water was traced from sourcing basins to production sites according to the ibwt project database and then to domestic and international end consumers based on the mrio analysis when replacing general water use w in eq 2 with the use of ibwt denoted as w t ibwt for production use can be written 3 w t d t x d t i a 1 y t t y where d t is a dialogical matrix of direct ibwt intensity and t t is a matrix of total ibwt use intensity elements in d t and t t is not larger than corresponding ones in d and t because ibwt comprises only a share of sectoral water uses for production activities because mrio tables are available in 2007 2010 2012 2015 and 2017 water volumes from ibwt in corresponding years were introduced in eq 3 to track physically transferred water from production to final consumption 2 3 measuring the supporting role of ibwt for production and consumption ibwt supports both production activities and final consumption in china s supply chain here we developed two indicators to quantify the reliance of the supply chain on physical water transfer across different regions from both the production and consumption perspectives 4 s prod i w t i w i s cons i w f t i w f i where s prod i and s cons i are the supporting role of physical water transfer in the supply chain from the production and consumption perspectives in region i respectively w t i is physically transferred water for production and w f t i is physically transferred water embedded in products for final consumption these two indicators s prod i and s cons i are represented by a percentage value ranging from 0 indicating no support to 1 complete support 2 4 virtual scarce water accounting virtual scarce water is defined as scarcity weighted virtual water following previous research pfister et al 2009 water scarcity which is commonly demand driven liu et al 2017 sun et al 2021 is measured as the ratio of water use to water availability referred to as wta following many previous studies wada et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 vanham et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 because a smaller grid scale may not capture possible substantial distance between water abstraction and use within a grid cell and a larger scale may not be able to consider heterogeneity of spatial water resource and use ma et al 2020 sub basins are spatial units at which water scarcity assessment is considered adequate sun et al 2021 water scarcity in the year t is assessed for a sub basin of interest using the equation below 5 w t a t w u t w a where wu t indicates water use in year t and wa is the mean natural water availability in the sub basin of interest between 2007 and 2107 when ibwt is implemented wta t in one sub basin can be calculated following the previous study sun et al 2021 6 w t a t w u t i β w t i t w a β 1 water received from project i 1 water delivered in project i where wti t is the ibwt volume of project i in year t and i β w t i t denotes net ibwt volume of the sub basin of interest in year t a positive net ibwt volume indicates net delivering water volume to other sub basins and a negative net ibwt volume indicates net receiving water volume wta is then converted to water stress index wsi using a logistic function following a previous approach pfister et al 2009 7 w s i 1 1 e 11 5 w t a 1 0 01 1 wsi ranges from 0 01 assuming any water withdrawal has marginal local impact and 1 wsi is tuned to be 0 5 for a wta of 0 4 which is often considered as the threshold between moderate and significant water stress when replacing general water use w in eq 2 with the scarce water use i e water use weighted with wsi denoted as ws scarce water for production use can be written 8 w s d s x d s i a 1 y t s y where d s is a dialogical matrix of direct scarce water use intensity and t s is a matrix of total scarce water use intensity similarly virtual scarce water embedded in domestic and international supply chain can be computed based on eq 8 provincial level scarce water uses are needed in eq 8 within the boundary of each province water uses in different sub basins aggregated from grid level water uses are weighted by water stress index of corresponding sub basins and are then summed up to obtain scarce water use for that province 2 5 assessing the exposure of production and consumption to water scarcity the supply chain is exposed to water scarcity risk as the supply chain relies on scarce water resources two indicators are developed to quantify the exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity across different regions from both the production and consumption perspectives 9 e prod i w s i w i e cons i w f s i w f i where e prod i and e cons i are the exposure of production and final consumption to water scarcity in the supply chain of region i respectively w s i is scarce water resources used for production and w f s i is virtual scarce water embedded in products for final consumption these two indicators e prod i and e cons i are represented by a percentage value ranging from 0 indicating no exposure to 1 complete exposure 3 results 3 1 ibwt increases as infrastructure expands in china ibwt infrastructure has been increasingly built in china since the 1950s to meet growing water demands for cities and irrigation most ibwt projects have been constructed in the east of china where cities industries and croplands are concentrated these projects are distributed in 22 of 30 provincial level administrative units hereafter referred to as provinces for short in 2017 tibet hong kong macao and taiwan are not considered due to lack of data fig 1 and supplementary information fig s1 the installed ibwt capacity has reached 25 2 billion m3 yr 1 by 2007 and 57 8 billion m3 yr 1 by 2017 figs 1 and 2 a which is equivalent to 9 of the national water use fig 2b the majority of ibwt projects were constructed within provincial boundaries technological and economic development has enabled water to be transferred along increasing distances ibwt length in 1950 was less than 1000 km growing to more than 14 000 km in 2017 when the south to north water diversion project started to deliver water from downstream yangtze river to beijing tianjin hebei jiangsu and shandong provinces in 2014 the share of installed ibwt capacity across different provinces was increased to nearly one third the share of ibwt capacity within provincial boundaries about two thirds provinces receiving the most water through inter provincial ibwt were tianjin beijing and hebei located in water scarce north china plain whereas inter provincial ibwt sourcing provinces were hubei jiangsu shandong and hebei human water use is categorized into agricultural industrial domestic and eco environmental compensation uses within china mwrc 2007 2017 domestic water use include tertiary and household water uses an ibwt project may be designed for a specific water use or combination of uses in china ibwt are most often designed to provide urban water supplies to support important social functions and economic benefits there is an increasing trend in percentages of sectoral water uses that can be met by installed water transfer capacity the installed ibwt capacity is able to meet 16 4 domestic water demand and 13 0 industrial water demand of the nation in 2017 which are higher than that for agricultural water demand 6 5 fig 2b industrial and domestic water uses comprised 30 5 and 22 7 ibwt water which were higher than the shares of total water for industrial and domestic water uses 21 2 and 13 9 fig 2c this highlights that water from ibwt sources is particularly important to certain economic sectors i e to economic production in industrial and tertiary sectors 3 2 ibwt plays an increasing role in supporting the supply chains the majority of water transferred by ibwt in china over three quarters supports the production of primary secondary and tertiary goods with the remainder of ibwt volumes supporting household and eco environmental compensation uses here we traced physically transferred water through the supply chain using an environmentally extended mrio analysis in 2007 about 19 1 billion m3 water lower than the ibwt installed capacity was diverted among 18 provinces through tunnels channels and pumping schemes that connect different basins in which 15 5 billion m3 81 2 entered the supply chain and was virtually embedded in various products for final consumption supplementary information fig s2 in 2017 39 5 billion m3 water was diverted through ibwt to 21 provinces of this 30 9 billion m3 78 2 was used for production and supported the supply chain fig 3 although only 18 provinces physically received ibwt water in 2007 growing to 21 provinces in 2017 all of the other provinces and international consumers received virtual ibwt water in their receipts of products through the supply chain fig 3 the volume of ibwt water embedded in inter provincial trade through supply chains grew from 4 8 billion m3 in 2007 to 11 2 billion m3 in 2017 showing a 133 increase similarly ibwt water volumes transferred to international consumers through supply chains grew from 4 0 billion m3 in 2007 to 4 8 billion m3 in 2017 increase of 20 this constitutes 25 9 and 15 5 of china s ibwt water for production purpose in 2007 and 2017 respectively key provinces exporting ibwt water to international end consumers through the supply chain were jiangsu guangdong shanghai and henan all of which are recipients of large volumes of ibwt water ibwt supports both production activities and final consumption the volume of ibwt water doubled between 2007 2017 leading to increased support of ibwt in china s supply chain supplementary information fig s3 at the national level ibwt supported 5 9 of the water demand from the production perspective and 5 7 from the consumption perspective in 2017 the support of ibwt to china s export was higher s cons 7 3 than the domestic supply chain according to indicators that quantify supporting roles of ibwt for production and consumption ibwt water supports production and the supply chain in a varied manner across provinces a few provinces are heavily reliant on ibwt for example tianjin s production was mostly supported by ibwt with more than half of the water demand met by ibwt in 2017 s prod 76 9 followed by beijing jilin and shanghai s prod 56 2 21 7 and 20 2 respectively table 1 there was increased support of ibwt in production in 18 provinces from 2007 to 2017 with the largest increase occurring in beijing supplementary information fig s3 physical recipients of ibwt water were concentrated in a few provinces but virtual ibwt water was spread across china through the supply chain notably production in 8 provinces did not depend on ibwt in 2017 but they were all supported by ibwt from the consumption perspective end consumers in tianjin relied the most on ibwt in 2017 with virtual ibwt water constituting 16 5 virtual water embedded in the products for final consumption followed by beijing shanghai and henan s cons 12 7 12 5 and 11 8 respectively table 1 end consumers of all the provinces were increasingly supported by ibwt between 2007 and 2017 supplementary information fig s3 there are more economic connections between provinces than physical ibwt transfers so ibwt support of the supply chain from the consumption perspective has less skewness with s cons ranging between 1 5 and 16 5 in 2017 than the production perspective with s prod ranging between 0 and 76 9 in 2017 ibwt heterogeneously supports sectors throughout china s economy supplementary information fig s4 and s5 ibwt provides larger support to production and consumption of industrial s prod 11 6 and s cons 6 5 and tertiary s prod 9 4 and s cons 7 4 goods than to the agricultural production and consumption of the nation s prod 4 5 and s cons 3 6 in 2017 there are important differences in the support of ibwt to sectoral supply chains across provinces supplementary information fig s6 and s7 for example ibwt has little support to agricultural production but high support to industrial and tertiary production in guangdong where the center of china s manufacturing industries is located export of industrial and tertiary products from china was particularly supported by ibwt with ibwt water comprising 11 3 and 13 8 of total virtual water exports in 2017 in comparison to agricultural s cons 5 1 3 3 ibwt decreases the exposure of supply chains to water scarcity water scarcity poses risks to supply chains and economic prosperity ibwts will impact water scarcity risk by physically relocating water from sourcing basins to different destinations for production uses sun et al 2021 while ibwt directly mitigates water shortage in water receiving basins it also likely intensifies water stress in sourcing basins it is unclear if the role of ibwts is to buffer water scarcity risk e g by reducing water scarcity in production sites or to transmit water scarcity risk e g by introducing water scarcity from their sourcing basins in the supply chains here we traced virtual scarce water i e scarcity weighted water use which is considered as an indicator for unsustainable water use embedded in the supply chains from production to final consumption when total water use for production increased from 507 8 billion m3 in 2007 to 526 5 billion m3 in 2017 with an increase of 3 7 virtual scarce water embedded in the supply chain showed a smaller increase of 1 1 from 243 8 billion m3 to 246 6 billion m3 the expansion of ibwt infrastructure largely explains the difference between the trends of total virtual water and virtual scarce water in the supply chains importantly a decreasing trend of virtual scarce water for production is observed in water scarce provinces in north china that are recipients of ibwt waters in spite of increasing total water uses tianjin and beijing had decreased scarce water use in production by 42 4 and 35 8 between 2007 and 2017 however more than half of the provinces in china needed more scarce water to support their production or consumption between 2007 2017 supplementary information fig s8 a hypothetical no water transfer scenario which assumes water receiving basins would use the same amount of ibwt water from local resources is used to quantify the impacts of ibwt on changing the risk of the supply chain exposed to water scarcity in 2007 ibwt scenario saved 8 1 billion m3 virtual scarce water required for the supply chain in comparison to the hypothetical no water transfer scenario with virtual scarce water reaching 255 2 billion m3 fig 4 virtual scarce water required for the supply chain in 2017 would reach 262 7 billion m3 under the hypothetical no water transfer scenario which was 16 2 billion m3 more than the ibwt scenario fig 4 this means that ibwt overall reduces the reliance of the supply chain on scarce water resources however different provinces may benefit or suffer changing virtual scarce water volumes due to ibwt jiangsu province benefited most from ibwt with the largest volume of scarce water saved for both production saving 6 2 billion m3 and final consumption saving 3 6 billion m3 followed by shandong liaoning shanghai heilongjiang beijing and tianjin in 2017 these provinces were the top recipients of ibwt waters fig 1 in contrast shanxi jilin and qinghai included more scarce water in their production in ibwt scenario in comparison to hypothetical no water transfer scenario some provinces that did not directly receive ibwt water also benefited from ibwt with reduced reliance of final consumption on virtual scarce water virtual scarce water embedded in export for international end consumers was 32 4 billion m3 but would have been 36 1 billion m3 in the no water transfer scenario in 2017 with a saving of 3 7 billion m3 scarce water through ibwt virtual scarce water represents about half of the virtual water supporting chinese supply chains confirming the prevalence of water stress facing china s water supply systems we assessed the ratio of scarce water to total virtual water embedded in the supply chain to quantify the exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity the comparison between ibwt and hypothetical no water transfer scenarios showed that ibwt reduced the exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity from 50 8 to 50 1 at the national level in 2017 because the exposure showed high spatial heterogeneity ibwt was particularly important in reducing the exposure to water scarcity in a few provinces that received ibwt water tianjin shandong beijing and shanghai were the provinces benefitting most from ibwt in terms of reduced exposure of the supply chain to water scarcity from both the production and final consumption perspectives in 2017 fig 5 ibwt reduced water scarcity exposure of production between 0 1 and 56 7 across 20 provinces but increased water scarcity exposure of production in 3 provinces i e shanxi jilin and qinghai ibwt did not impact water scarcity exposure of production in the remaining 7 provinces in 2017 which changed water scarcity exposure less than 0 1 fig 5a ibwt have reduced exposure of end consumers to water scarcity across 29 provinces with the reduced exposure distributed in a less wide range i e between 0 7 and 15 0 qinghai which is faced with lower water scarcity exposure 38 under the ibwt scenario than national average 51 is the only province exposed to increased water scarcity for consumption in 2017 fig 5b the exposure of export through international supply chains to water scarcity was reduced from 51 7 to 47 3 by ibwt in 2017 exposure to water scarcity of provinces has been involved since 2007 fig 5 as an increasing number of ibwt projects were built production and final consumption of sectoral products benefited from ibwt to different degrees the exposure of agricultural industrial and tertiary production in china to water scarcity was reduced by 3 3 4 9 and 7 4 through ibwt in 2017 e prod 48 7 42 5 and 41 3 for these three sectors in water transfer scenario because agricultural products are important intermediate inputs to other sectoral goods final consumption of industrial and tertiary products in china was exposed to higher water scarcity than corresponding exposure in production e cons 46 7 and 46 1 reduced by 3 8 and 4 9 through ibwt in comparison to no water transfer scenario see supplementary fig s9 final consumption of agricultural goods is subject to lower exposure to water scarcity than production e cons 46 4 reduced by 2 7 through ibwt 4 discussion as the reach of ibwt infrastructure expands it is playing an increasingly important role in reducing direct and indirect water stress in china ibwt supported 6 5 of the total water use in china s supply chain in 2017 and the reliance of the supply chain on ibwt water can be much higher in a few provinces final consumption of economic goods has been increasingly supported by ibwt between 2007 and 2017 though a number of provinces did not receive ibwt water directly in their production activities physically transferred water has been indirectly incorporated in their supply chain of various products and increasingly supported the end consumers international end consumers have also witnessed an increase of support by ibwt infrastructure with increasing ibwt water embedded in exported products from china what matters in water use management is scarce water resources rather than neutral or abundant water weinzettel and pfister 2019 due to the scarcity value of water and different impacts of water use on local water resources and ecosystems feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 it is therefore important to see how ibwt impacts scarce water use throughout the supply chains our assessment showed that ibwt saved 20 6 billion m3 scarce water use in the supply chain in 2017 in comparison to no water transfer scenario and end consumers of all the provinces except qinghai benefited from ibwt with scarce water saving throughout the supply chains international end consumers were exposed to reduced water scarcity in the receipt of sectoral goods embedding physically transferred water this means that ibwt infrastructure allows water stressed regions to exploit new sources of surface water and hence allow sustainable water use to be institutionalized in a wider spatial range than river basin level through hydraulically connecting different basins thus we concluded that ibwt plays a crucial role in reducing water scarcity risks in supply chains and providing water security to economies and society in this study we measured virtual scarce water using average water availability information between 2007 and 2017 which shows virtual scarce water flows during average water balance conditions river basins may experience more extreme water scarcity in certain years such as during drought conditions huang et al 2021 our results on water scarcity risks should thus be understood in the context of average conditions during which water demands are typically more than 40 of average available supplies liu et al 2017 the results highlight the long term risks facing economic production and supply chains from chronic water stress in the basins of china rather than from short term water hazards such as droughts and floods we find that ibwt serves as a buffer to supply chains against such long term average water scarcity risk during short term drought conditions ibwt should also be effective in reducing virtual scarce water use through optimized allocation of water a few water stressed basins e g sub basins along the yellow river are ibwt sourcing basins that may transmit water stress through physical water transfers sun et al 2021 though water is physically transferred to more water scarce regions e g hai river sub basins ibwt receivers and end consumers should know water scarcity and supply chain risk upstream their supply chain production in ibwt sourcing basins is subject to higher exposure to water scarcity risk due to ibwt because providing water supply to external regions aggravates their water scarcity particularly jilin qinghai and shanxi provinces are faced with higher exposure to water scarcity in their production proper compensation from physical water recipients will prevent underestimation of water resources values and compensate water sourcing regions for their restricted local water development because ibwt is usually at high economic cost construction of conveyance channels reservoirs and pump stations and maintenance cost and primarily for industrial and domestic uses with high added values producers and water managers can signal the economic value of ibwt through the market for this important water input in order to balance the benefits and costs of ibwt it is important to apply a broad suite of institutions and policies e g demand oriented measures such as water pricing water markets water use efficiency improvements and water use structure upgrade to achieve sustainable water use and secure the supply chain of the nation optimizing combined ibwt infrastructure supply side and demand side measures e g pricing and conservation to enhance water and supply chain sustainability should be an important area for future research there are uncertainties due to data constraints in this analysis the main sources of uncertainty originate from our assumption of actual ibwt volumes based on installed project capacity sun et al 2021 disaggregation of fine resolution sectoral water uses based on multiple sourced data sectoral aggregation of the mrio data and tables liu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 different sources of the mrio data and water use disaggregation in the environmentally extended analysis these uncertainty sources are commonly shared by mrio based virtual water analysis sun et al 2022 despite these sources of uncertainty we used the best available information to enhance our understanding of the role of ibwt infrastructure in supporting supply chains in china we examined the sensitivity of virtual water accounting results to disaggregation of industrial and tertiary water uses by varying disaggregated sectoral water uses by 20 using the monte carlo method the results showed that virtual water accounting results are not sensitive to disaggregation of fine resolution water uses given fixed aggregated industrial and tertiary water use statistics in provinces of china with relative errors varying within 3 supplementary information fig s10 in addition we conducted the analysis based on mrio data from the same data source in a shorter period between 2007 and 2012 liu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 which showed a consistent trend of increasing ibwt water volumes embedded in the supply chains supplementary information fig s11 future efforts are needed to monitor high resolution spatial and sectoral water uses ibwt water volumes and mrio relationships towards improved understanding of ibwt roles at fine spatial scale and long time period 5 conclusions inter basin water transfer ibwt is an important infrastructure component of the coupled human water system here we provided a first national analysis of the ibwt and supply chain nexus using the environmentally extended mrio technique combined with project explicit ibwt database in china we differentiate between the use of scarce water and neutral abundant water in tracing virtual water along the supply chain as scarce water has a distinct scarcity value and its use may lead to adverse environmental and or social impacts based on this ibwt and supply chain nexus analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 economic production and final consumption through supply chains have been increasingly supported by ibwt infrastructure in china although only a limited number of provinces physically received ibwt water all of the other provinces and international consumers were supported by virtual ibwt water in a varied manner in their receipts of commodities through the supply chain 2 ibwt overall reduces the virtual scarce water embedded in sectoral production and final consumption and thus can buffer water scarcity risks to supply chains ibwt infrastructure allows water stressed regions to exploit new sources of surface water and hence allow sustainable water use to be institutionalized in a wider spatial range through hydraulically connecting different watersheds however it should be noted that ibwt increased water scarcity exposure of production in three provinces and water scarcity exposure of consumption in one province 3 virtual scarce water represents about half of the virtual water supporting chinese supply chains pointing to the prevalence of water stress facing china s water supply systems despite the fact that ibwt overall reduces water scarcity risk in china s supply chain there is still much unsustainable water use throughout china that policy makers may wish to consider in
