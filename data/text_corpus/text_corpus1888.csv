9440,after an extreme rainy event agricultural fields can be submerged by water stagnant water can be generated by river flooding or by soil saturation causing different damage level to crops in this work the flood event occurred on 3rd october 2020 in nw italy along the sesia river was assessed with special concern about damages affecting rice crop fields a method was proposed aimed at detecting flooded areas and giving an estimate of water depth wd based on free available copernicus data sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 and digital terrain model dtm in particular sentinel 1 pre and post event images were compared by differencing δvv δvv was processed at pixel level to detect submerged areas through the thresholding otsu s method a simplified morphological analysis was then performed by dtm tessellation to map wd a further step aimed at classifying submerged areas was achieved based on dtm and a proximity analysis making possible to separate areas where water was related to soil saturation from areas where water was coming from the river corine land cover 2018 level 3 and ndvi from a sentinel 2 pre event image were used to map crops that were still to be harvested at the time of flood these were the ones that were considered while estimating the potential economic loss a total of 255 ha of rice that still to be harvested were submerged but only 211 ha were affected by river overflow using local rice yield and price the resulting economic loss was about 2 200 000 keywords sar sentinel 1 sentinel 2 watershed segmentation flood mapping crops damage mapping 1 introduction floods and in general extreme meteorological events occur more frequently due to climate change their effects are particularly evident on crops and forests brown et al 2012 orusa et al 2020 sarvia et al 2021a agricultural damage assessment after extreme rainy events is ordinarily based on the joint evaluation of the local agricultural situation by mapping land use and soil characteristics and the hydraulic conditions of the event i e duration velocity intensity and amount transported material quantity floods can generate damages at different scales of analysis boccardo et al 2007 at the farm scale the impacts can affect buildings rural infrastructures e g irrigation channels and machineries resulting into extra costs for recovery efforts that can certainly condition revenues for several years apart morris and brewin 2014 within fields damages mainly concern soils that can be eroded and moved away by water depauperating top soil or accumulating new materials wilson et al 2011 moreover depending on the time of flood with respect to the growing season of local crops the yearly yield can be totally or partially compromised even depending on water flow strength and debris content morris and brewin 2014 monitoring conditions affecting flooded areas in the very next days after the events can certainly support damage assessment romali et al 2018 permitting a refinement of estimates and developing a support for the insurance companies in quantifying and mapping risks borgogno mondino et al 2019 sarvia et al 2020a sarvia et al 2019 in particular one important hydraulic parameter to be considered is the above ground level agl water depth wd many experiences proved a strict relationship between crops damage degree and wd molinari et al 2019 shrestha et al 2013 vozinaki et al 2015 negative consequences on crops can be root asphyxiation soil contamination and disease spreading with these premises the growing availability of free satellite data from earth observation missions are enormously increasing the opportunities of monitoring floods lin et al 2019 2016 rahman et al 2019 and their effects de petris et al 2021a different remote sensing techniques and hydrological models have been proposed for these purposes tarpanelli et al 2018 used radar altimetry while westra and de wulf 2009 based their deductions on moderate resolution image spectroradiometer modis data dano et al 2011 wang and xie 2018 reported an exhaustive review of remote sensing based applications for floods assessment synthetic aperture radar sar and multispectral data with special concern about those related to the copernicus program have been widely used to support emergency situations as natural disasters floods and vegetation related problems bian et al 2018 mason et al 2021 they are known to represent an efficient tool for civil protection purposes especially in rapid response where an immediate even rough damage estimate is required ajmar et al 2015 de petris et al 2020 2019 smith 1997 ordinarily flood monitoring and risk assessment are achieved by hydrological modelling based on flow energy balance equations involving several physical inputs i e precipitations air temperature physical parameters of soil topography vegetation puno et al 2021 2020 these models allow to simulate superficial and groundwater dynamics accounting for different hydrological processes including wd and can be summarized as it follows one dimensional 1d models as estry hec ras isis mike 11 rubicon sobek swmm knebl et al 2005 kourgialas and karatzas 2014 stoleriu et al 2020 vozinaki et al 2012 or 2d models for flood mapping as tuflow mike 21 delft fls rma feswms telemac banks et al 2014 ghimire 2013 ligier 2016 robins and davies 2011 syme 2001 these models are known to require many inputs that are often not easily available especially far away from rivers devia et al 2015 making difficult their application in a rapid mapping context typically these physical based models require a detailed geometric description of the river bed like flow rate manning s values river sections bottom slope and roughness of the analyzed river trait moreover the entire river system must be schematically represented taking care about all the connected elements interacting with the river stream junctions bridges and culverts or lateral structures pistocchi and mazzoli 2002 despite the huge literature concerning sar data application to monitor flood risk and its effects on urban and human activities sar imagery were poorly adopted to map flood damages in agricultural sector manavalan 2017 sanyal and lu 2004 shen et al 2019 tsyganskaya et al 2018 in this context this work presents a new method based on free available data satellite and elevation data to detect flooded crops and estimate wd allowing a near real time and continuous mapping of these variables the procedure is presented with reference to the flooding event occurred on 3rd october 2020 by the sesia river nw italy finally a rough economic loss assessment was proposed concerning the rice fields the main issues explored in this work are a a statistical based threshold selection criteria for flood delineation using sar data based on an adaptive method that makes it possible to automatically detect a threshold value accordingly to the specific area one is considering b water depth mapping over flooded crops avoiding hydrological models c stagnant water classification according to its source i e by river overflow or by soil saturation for better characterizing the effects of the event on crops all these issues were presented and discussed in the following sections the jointly used of free and near real time updated data allows to define a new procedure that could potentially give a rapid assessment of the effects of a flood on the agricultural sector supporting local restoration policies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area on 2nd october 2020 according to local meteorological data http www arpa piemonte it north west italy was affected by an intense rainfall 450 mm d 1 rainfall caused the flooding of the sesia river that develops at the border between piemonte and lombardia regions unfortunately the event occurred on a critical period close to the harvesting of rice the main crop in the area resulting in a significant damage to the local agriculture an area of interest aoi sizing about 1105 km2 fig 1 was selected including 58 italian municipalities the most of them located within the piemonte region that the river was running through in particular the flattest trait of the river was considered 2 2 available data 2 2 1 sentinel 1 imagery sentinel 1 s1 is one of the current largest space borne missions providing free and open accessible sar data having high temporal resolution from 6 to 2 days combining ascending descending orbits well fitting crop multi temporal monitoring requirements sar data processing is very complex and often data are not available free of charge as well stressed by grimaldi et al 2016 the complexity of sar data pre processing appears a key factor for sar data slow uptake by a wider user community reiche et al 2016 vollrath et al 2020 conversely google earth engine gee web based platform allows an immediate access to pre processed images making users to directly focus on their specific applications gorelick et al 2017 in this work s1 ground range detected grd interferometric wide iw swath image collection available in gee was used in particular s1 grd high resolution grdh collection is released with a squared pixel having a geometrical resolution of 10 m georeferenced into a user defined cartographic reference frame in this work set equal to wgs84 utm 32 n this collection was already pre processed by the sentinel 1 toolbox s1tbx veci et al 2014 and the correspondent backscattering coefficient σ db for vv and vh polarizations mapped as separate raster layers ordinarily water surfaces show very low backscattered signal in all polarizations manavalan 2017 manavalan et al 2017 p but the co polarized vv signal proved to be poorly affected by vegetation presence allowing a better detection of partially submerged areas manjusree et al 2012 therefore two vv polarized images one pre event and one post event were selected and directly processed by gee the reference image pre event was acquired on 28th september 2020 while the post event one was acquired on 3rd october 2020 the latter was used to explore flooded water distribution in the area fig 2 2 2 2 sentinel 2 imagery sentinel 2 s2 multispectral imagery was extensively adopted in vegetation mapping in order to map vegetated areas a single s2 image acquired on 28th september 2020 was selected and processed by gee collection titled copernicus s2 sr the image obtained was already calibrated in at the ground reflectance processing level 2 a and orthoprojected into the wgs84 utm 32 n reference frame red band 4 λ 665 nm and nir band 8 λ 842 nm bands were used for normalized difference vegetation index ndvi computation having a geometric resolution of 10 m some additional layers were also obtained mapping pixel quality scene classification map scl useful to masking out unreliable pixels 2 2 3 digital terrain model two gridded dtms available from piemonte and lombardia regional geoportals https www geoportale piemonte it cms http www geoportale regione lombardia it were used piemonte dtm is updated at 2011 and has a height precision of 30 cm 1 σ dtm borgogno mondino et al 2016 lombardia dtm is update at 2015 and has a precision of 30 cm 1 σ dtm biagi et al 2013 both were supplied in grid format with 5 m ground sample distance gsd in spite of the different updates these dtms represent the best resolute and accurate terrain models available for the aoi they were preventively mosaicked average was applied in overlapping areas and unitarily used for next processing 2 2 4 sesia river area a polygon vector layer mapping the sesia river area sra was extracted from the piemonte regional hydrologic network vector layer that was downloaded by the regional geoportal https www geoportale piemonte it cms bdtre modalita di pubblicazione e fruizione this layer was updated in 2020 having a nominal scale of 1 10000 2 2 5 corine land cover map the 2018 corine land cover clc2018 dataset level 3 was used to locate and map agricultural areas in aoi clc2018 was released for free from the land monitoring service copernicus https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover as vector layer having a nominal scale equal to 1 100000 level 3 of clc2018 is the most detailed level according to the hierarchical classification system adopted by the corine land cover project since it is design with a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha and minimum mapping unit of 100 m büttner 2014 table 1 shows agricultural classes and correspondent codes of clc2018 level 3 classification levels considered in this work 2 2 6 reference ground data to validate the proposed methodology the azienda agricola martinengo luigi sebastiano an important local farm located in the municipality of langosco province of pavia was involved in order to collect reference data rd on wd after the sesia river overflow a field survey campaign was carried out by the farm employees in particular wd was measured in the accessible fields using a graduated pole fig 3 the agricultural field recorded were delineated as polygons vector layer by photointerpretation on true color orthomosaic available on the piemonte regional geoportal www geoportale piemonte it updated to 2010 and having a geometric resolution of 20 cm subsequently the wd data obtained from the field survey were associated with the respective polygon a total of 61 rice plots were recorded and labelled as damaged 46 and 15 as undamaged fields rd are located in the municipality of caresana rosasco motta de conti and langosco within the aoi fig 4 unfortunately the size of fields is limited and authors are aware that this dataset does not perfectly fit statistical requirements nevertheless it represents ordinary availability of ground data from farmers when data are not directly managed by scientists in fact the most data from farmers generally rely on their autonomous collections and decision of making them public it should be noted that data regarding wd outside river brook are not ordinary available especially in the absence of an experimental design or moreover after an extreme and unexpected event such as a flood furthermore it is a fact that when dealing with floods a sample design cannot be programmed being impossible to a priori know where water will be present moreover water persistence above ground is limited in time making further difficult to get data about the situation before it is absorbed by soil nevertheless the average size of the collected fields was about 1 36 ha the authors found that the sample provided by local farmers including 61 rice fields having a total area about to 83 ha corresponding to about 3 4 of the expected flooded rice fields within the aoi about 2400 ha 2 2 7 agricultural economic loss assessment rice yield and market price were also considered in this work to complete the procedure with an estimation step as usually required when quantifying the impact of a flood after the event the average rice yield in this area was set to 7 t ha 1 tesio et al 2014 and the local price to 340 t 1 ismea 2021 2 3 data processing in fig 5 is presented the workflow adopted in this work datelined information and acronyms are reported in the next sections 2 3 1 flooded area mapping s1 data have already proved to be an effective tool to detect flooded areas bioresita et al 2018 p 1 ezzine et al 2020 twele et al 2016 flood detection is possible thanks to the strong specular reflection that affects sar signal lighting water surfaces this peculiar scattering mechanism makes a water pixel poorly scattering low signal all the polarizations based on this fact many methods were developed to map flooded pixels by thresholding manavalan 2017 many of them are based on an automatic selection of a proper threshold value in this context sezgin and sankur 2004 provided an exhaustive comparison about the performance of several grey level image thresholding techniques among these techniques the otsu s method otsu 1979 was cited as an effective technique kurita et al 1992 trier and jain 1995 to define automatic threshold based on image histogram such method is a nonparametric and unsupervised one based on the separability maximization of the tested classes in the image digital number domain in particular threshold that dichotomize the pixels into two classes i e flooded and not flooded areas is defined iteratively covering the entire histogram values range for each iteration within and between classes variances are calculated consequently the problem is reduced to an optimization problem searching for a threshold that minimize within class variances and maximize between class one given the difficulty of finding a robust threshold value by using only one post event acquisition the authors tried to achieve this problem proposing a thresholding method applied to the image difference resulting from the pre and a post event acquisition in particular the otsu s method was applied directly within gee to generate a binary classification mapping flooded and not flooded areas from the vv images difference pre and post event s1 images pre and post event images were preventively filtered by a circular median filter 50 m kernel size in order to minimize speckle related noise the vv image of 28th september ri and the one of the 3rd october 2020 were used to map the pre and post event situation respectively comparison was achieved by grid differencing to generate a new image hereinafter called δvv mapping local differences expectation for flooded pixels was that differences post minus pre were negative consequently all δvv pixels showing a value 0 were masked out with reference to remaining pixels δvv histogram was analyzed by otsu s method and an optimal threshold defined finally a classification hereinafter called flooded map fm mapping flooded value 1 and not flooded value 0 pixels was produced a further refinement was applied to remove small isolated flooded patches by counting fm inter pixel connections using the ee connectedpixelcount operator available in gee patches having less than 100 connections corresponding to a minimum mapping unit of 1 hectare approximately were masked out 2 3 2 vegetation masking flooded areas strictly depend on ground morphology while damage can vary according to local land cover and crops phenology flood can improve crop condition by depositing nutrients or water in the very early phenological stages differently in late stages it could compromise final yield moreover it also can be possible that a given crop was already harvested and therefore no damage occurred trying to map these different situations a vegetation mask was generated with reference to the ndvi image mapping the pre event conditions not vegetated pixels were masked out by thresholding the ndvi map ndvi 0 4 the threshold was selected according to several previous studies burgan and hartford 1993 gao 1996 ormsby et al 1987 zhang et al 2003 that proved that ordinarily vegetated areas show ndvi greater than 0 4 the initial assumption was that in the area the most diffused and valuable crop still to be harvested at the time of the flood was the rice ndvi was not used to get an estimate of the phenological stage of rice that was a priori known being the time of flood close to the harvest ndvi was just used to detect vegetated from not vegetated areas at the moment of the flood making possible to separate rice fields that had been already harvested ndvi 0 4 from the one still hosting rice ndvi 0 4 the resulting raster mask vegetation mask vm was used to address successive operations towards the only vegetated pixels included crops crops were finally mapped intersecting vm with the available clc2018 finally rice mapping was obtained with reference to the clc2018 but only rice fields showing ndvi 0 4 were assumed as still waiting for harvest and consequently determining an economical loss 2 3 3 water depth mapping as already mentioned crop damage is proportional to the agl wd molinari et al 2019 shrestha et al 2013 rapid mapping and timely damage estimation are important requirements while working with catastrophically event sarvia et al 2020b de petris et al 2021b in order to recover and restore farmers in this context geographical information systems gis and free geographical data can support such analysis in particular this work relies on the adoption of a simple morphological analysis of dtm to give an estimate of wd within flooded areas fig 6 dtm was properly segmented through the watershed algorithm available in system for automated geoscientific analyses gis saga gis vs 7 9 0 with the aim of identifying local terrain depressions naturally hosting water segmentation was performed using the following parameters method maxima join segments on saddle difference using a threshold equal to 0 8 resulting patches hereinafter called depression patches dps were mapped as polygons vectors layer dps was then intersected with fm to refine size patches to fit only flooded areas as detected by sar for each refined dp the minimum h min i and maximum h max i values of height from dtm were calculated by zonal statistics their difference h i defines the maximum potential thickness of the water layer that dp can contain h i was computed by the field calculator tool within saga gis and saved as new field in the correspondent attribute table according to eq 1 1 h i h max i h min i subsequently wd can be estimated according to eq 2 2 wd x y h i dtm x y h min i by taking eq 1 into eq 2 it can be noted that wd is only related to h max i and local elevation value dtm x y therefore a new raster layers h max i x y was then generated aligned to the available dtm by gridding dp with reference to h max i fields finally eq 3 was used to map wd x y in the area 3 wd x y h max i x y dtm x y 2 4 validation flooded areas detection accuracy was assessed by using rd in fact 61 reference fields were used for this purpose and they were labelled as flooded or not flooded during ground survey campaign rd polygons were rasterized into a gridded layer having the same resolution of fm finally the confusion matrix and related accuracies were computed comparing at the pixel level rd raster and fm subsequently for each rd field zonal statistics were performed in order to determine the mode value of wd consequently the mean absolute error mae between the value of wd derived from the field survey campaign and the estimated one was calculated using eq 4 at field level in order to test the wd map accuracy willmott and matsuura 2005 4 mae i 1 n x i r x i o n where n is total number of fields in rd x i r is reference wd value in the i th fields of rd x i o is the observed wd resulted by applying the proposed method authors are conscious that this sample size does not fully fit the ordinary statistical requirements nevertheless this situation can frequently appear during a common technology transfer operation especially in the agricultural sector 2 5 potential loss of rice yield during extreme rainy events submerged areas as detectable from satellite can be related to flood or to soil saturation in soil saturated areas stagnant water is clearer less sediments since mainly caused by rain conversely flooded areas are characterized by water caused by river dynamics where many sediments and debris are present additionally given the high laminar force of water flowing across fields lodged plants can also be present these phenomena therefore affect crops in a very different way in soil saturated areas stagnant water can submerge plants but after few hours it can be absorbed by soil or flowed away resulting in a minor damage with these premises a method to separate potential flooded areas from the soil saturated ones was proposed based again on the available dtm a mask of potential flooded areas was generated testing at pixel level if the local dtm x y value was lower than the altitude of the nearest river bank in this case the pixel was labelled as 1 flooded differently it was labeled as 0 not flooded the above mentioned condition was based on the assumption that ordinary water flow unlikely spreads along positive slopes gradient but conversely it naturally moves along a negative slope gradient lighthill and whitham 1955 zimmermann and church 2001 this assumption could be violated during extreme flows where flood mass can even move along positive gradients nevertheless some flow approximations are always needed to model hydrological processes bout and jetten 2018 a proximity grid analysis was performed considering dtm x y and river banks altitude the latter was obtained by clipping dtm by sra the allocation tool available in saga gis was used to associate the altitude of the closest river bank to the generic pixel a raster layer hereafter called river banks altitude rba having the same gsd of dtm was generated mapping allocation values a grid difference between rba and dtm x y was then performed and thresholded all pixels where difference value was greater than 0 5 m i e lower bound of uncertainty of dtm differences 2 σ dtm 0 5 m were labelled as potentially flooded code 1 all the other pixels were labelled as not flooded code 0 resulting classification potential flooded areas map pfam assumed to map the potentially flooded areas was intersected with vm and fm in order to map vegetated potentially hosting crops flooded areas from the submerged ones where water was detected but possibly related to rain and not to river flood therefore from the intersection of pfam fm and vm only active crops flooded by river overflow were isolated and remaining areas were masked out from subsequently computation a further investigation was then achieved to get an estimate of the potential yield loss and consequently of the associated economic lost income 3 results 3 1 flooded area mapping otsu s method was applied to δvv histogram fig 7a and the correspondent threshold values were found all δvv pixel values less than the threshold were labelled as flooded code 1 in fm and the others as not flooded code 0 in fm fig 7b the assumption was that flooded areas should present highly negative δvv values due to the dominant specular scattering mechanism that occurs when a water film covers the surface the found threshold value was equal to 6 94 δvv flooded area as mapped on 3rd october 2020 by s1 proved to be about 4300 ha in terms of land cover classes clc2018 level 3 table 2 shows the impact of floods in the agricultural context this analysis proved that rice was the most affected crop with more than 2390 flooded hectares over 72 of the flooded area classes 221 and 231 appeared to be not affected by the event 3 2 vegetation masking an ndvi map characterizing vegetation before the event was generated fig 8a all values greater than 0 4 were labelled as vegetated vm code 1 and the other ones were masked out vm fig 8b layer covers about 665 8 km2 an intersection between vm and agricultural clc classes was performed in order to map active vegetated crops fig 8b that probably were affected by flood whereby a total of 1151 ha of affected rice crops were found in aoi while the remaining 1244 ha of rice from the vm map appeared to be already harvested other clc classes such as 211 were also affected by the event table 3 unfortunately at the clc level it is not possible to specify these crops and consequently estimate the level of damage on this class 3 3 water depth mapping and validation fm accuracy was assessed by confusion matrix computation involving rasterized rd and fm according to table 4 proposed method results to be an effective tool to separate flooded areas from not flooded ones overall accuracy was 96 producer s and user s accuracy were found to be equal to 94 and 100 for flooded areas respectively moreover similar accuracies for not flooded areas were found to be high 100 and 89 respectively wd map and relative cumulative frequency distribution are reported in fig 9 mae of wd map calculated accordingly to eq 4 was about 0 42 m this result well fits the theoretical accuracy of dtm differences 0 5 m due to the high geometric regularity of soil surface in rice plots mae value suggests that the wd variation within a plot is insignificant and mainly driven by the random nature of the dtm accidental error common to all measurements 3 4 potential loss of rice yield according to pfam fig 10a potentially floodable areas resulted to be 46 245 ha with reference to vm and fm possibly flooded active crops mainly rice were detected these sized about 930 ha fig 10b additionally 221 ha were recognized as submerged i e showing water related to soil saturation from rain table 5 since only in flooded areas river related crop damage was retained as significant an assessment was performed to give an estimate of rice yield loss according to the above mentioned agricultural economic loss assessment section data potential yield loss resulted in 6510 tons corresponding to an economical income loss of 2 214 354 4 discussions ordinarily flooded areas mapping by hydrological models relies on physically based simulations involving meteorological data dtms river and soil features these models generate outputs resulting from local assumptions and simplifications as deeply discussed by devia et al 2015 sood and smakhtin 2015 differently sar satellite based approaches allows to detect actual submerged areas based on physical scattering mechanism i e surface scattering this reduces uncertainty related to the definition of the correct empirical parameters that hydrological models require sar image based methods are strictly dependent on a thresholding processing step whose performance strictly relies on the time after the event that a proper image can be available in fact it is expected that the number of flooded pixels decreases with the passing of days making weaker statistical deductions concerning δvv distribution analysis especially related to class separability de petris et al 2021a it is worth to remind that the majority of image thresholding techniques depends on patch size making otsu s method an exception since operating regardless of object size and consequently well fitting crop detection i e small patches lee et al 1990 as far as obtained results are concerned fm proved to correctly detect flooded fields with the respect to rd authors again remark that given the very small size of rd fields a rigorous validation was actually not possible this is a common condition while dealing with natural hazards related problems where data for validation are often missing due to unfavorable environmental conditions sometimes unsafe characterizing hit areas after the event nevertheless literature confirmed that the joint use of otsu s method and sar imagery is effective in flooded areas detection as reported by pulvirenti et al 2013 schumann et al 2010 with respect to study cases exactly concerning areas that are very closed to our study area i e northwestern part of po valley with special concerns about new issues that this work dealt with the problem related to the distinction between areas hosting water coming from rainfall soil saturation and those actually flooded by the river is certainly the most interesting one these two situations contemporarily occurring after a flooding event are expected to determine different damage levels to crops to take care about this pfam was generated based on proximity analysis allocation tool pfam proved to be affected by several simplifications a proximity analysis depends on dtm and sra geometric resolution and both altimetric and planimetric precision awange and kiema 2013 boccardo et al 2003 b water flow was assumed to only run along a negative slope gradient c since proximity analysis only maps the closest rba to the generic position an underestimation of flooded areas is expected in fact other points can also contribute to supply water to the same location d during the flood some obstacles can interrupt water flow from river to the generic point and consequently not taking care about this can generate an overestimation of areas potentially flooded by river for a complete transfer of this method to the operational compart further investigations are expected to be done the first one concerns the analysis of the effects of spatial connectivity and patchiness affecting both river and crops from this point of view only few works exist in literature suggesting that an important knowledge gap still persists thus requiring a proper investigation alaoui et al 2018 western et al 1998 moreover the lack of an updated crop type map represents a limit for a proper damage assessment over difference crops therefore future developments will be expected to involve in the proposed approach a crop type detection derived by remotely sensed data sarvia et al 2021b the second one concerns the effect of dtm accuracy in both the segmentation process and robustness of wd estimates specifically looking for the separated contribution of dtm absolute and relative accuracies dtm accuracy and spatial resolution is basic while dealing with geometric issues like water level mapping one constraint of the method is in fact that the dtm vertical uncertainty is lower than the expected value of the measure one is going to do it is well known that global dtms like aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer dtm v2 and srtm shuttle radar topography mission show a reduced absolute vertical accuracy about 10 m coupled with a pixel size of 30 and 90 m respectively these features make them not compliant with this type of analysis nevertheless the most of countries make available through their institutional geoportals more detailed and site specific dtms the most of them from lidar acquisitions having accuracies and resolutions consistent with the one we adopted for this work an absolute vertical accuracy of 0 5 m could be enough while working at the landscape level and when ground has to be compared with a water level that during a flood could significantly be over the meter moreover when a vertical absolute accuracy of 0 5 m is declared by suppliers it is expected that relative accuracy concerning height differences between points from the same dtm is higher making the data more and more proper as far as geometric resolution is concerned a dtm having a 5 5 m pixel size is perfectly consistent with a 1 25000 scale map and consequently proper for at landscape level analysis like the one required for floods affecting wide areas some refinements would be desirable concerning wd and water persistence effects on crop damage introducing a preliminary step for crop classification from satellite data and its characterization in terms of phenology sarvia et al 2021b this information will certainly drive to develop a more robust crop damage assessment making possible to overcome those approximations related to the adoption of a low resolution crop map like the corine land cover one is we remind that the clc minimum mapping unit is 25 ha and not all the crops are taken into considerations separately suggesting a more specific classification as far as flooded crops mapping is concerned the joint use of vm and clc2018 proved to effectively support rice damage assessment a critical point still persists concerning ndvi thresholding since depending on the adopted threshold value crop detection and related economic loss estimates can greatly vary concerning wd mapping accuracy of estimates was found to be 0 42 m mae this result is consistent with those other methods can generate specifically results obtained by the rapide tool proposed by scorzini et al 2018 showed a mae ranging between 0 28 and 0 79 m for the flood event occurred in lombardia region in november 2002 gatti 2016 found a wd mae varying between 0 42 and 0 73 m for the flood event occurred in sardegna region italy in november 2013 finally wd uncertainty from the present work was also consistent with the one from 2d hydrological models like fwdet that was applied in brazos river area texas usa during the flooding event occurred in september 2013 where an accuracy of 0 37 m was found cohen et al 2018 concerning agronomic issues it is worth to remind that water persistence de petris et al 2021a and vegetation stage can significantly affect the damage impact of crops rahman and di 2020 in this regard several indices were proposed in the literature for the evaluation of crop damage following natural disasters such as the vegetation condition index or the disaster vegetation damage index di et al 2018a 2018b however no works aim at estimating the wd with copernicus and dtm open data are currently present the possibility of mapping wd can be therefore useful to locally test in this particular case if rice was significantly or totally submerged since rice average height close to the harvest is about 0 80 m fogliatto et al 2012 wd information makes it possible to better quantify potential crop damage this is strictly related to the economic loss that the event possibly determined from this point of view according to the local price of rice 340 t 1 and to the nominal yield 7 t ha 1 the potential income loss was found to be equal to 2214354 this result can probably vary according to local damage level farmer s recovery effort rice varieties nevertheless it represents a first rapid estimate of local economic loss that well fits the requirements needed while working with disastrous events de petris et al 2021b sarvia et al 2020a 2020b 5 conclusions in this work the flood event occurred on 3rd october 2020 in nw italy along the sesia river was assessed with special concern about damages affecting rice crop fields a method was proposed aimed at detecting flooded areas and giving an estimate of wd based on free available copernicus data sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 and dtms in particular s1 grd iw pre and post event images were compared by differencing δvv δvv was processed at pixel level to detect submerged areas through the thresholding otsu s method a δvv value of 6 94 was found able to separate areas with and without stagnant water about the 4 of the aoi otsu s method was adopted to make objective the selection of the proper threshold value to map areas with and without water from s1 data the method is adaptive making possible to automatically detect the threshold value accordingly to the specific

tested in respect of local ground data resulting in a mae of 0 42 m a further step aimed at classifying submerged areas was achieved based on dtm and sra proximity analysis making possible to separate areas where water was related to soil saturation from areas where water was coming from the river clc2018 level 3 and ndvi from a s2 pre event image were used to map crops that were still to be harvested at the time of flood these were the ones that were considered while estimating the potential economic loss about 211 ha of rice were submerged by river flooding determine an economic loss of about 2 200 000 concluding in this work a simplified approach based on gis and free available data was proposed to support flood related damage estimation simplicity and cheapness of the approach coupled with the obtained wd uncertainty are certainly interesting if compared with more complex methods based on hydrological models these ordinarily require many inputs that are rarely available

9440,after an extreme rainy event agricultural fields can be submerged by water stagnant water can be generated by river flooding or by soil saturation causing different damage level to crops in this work the flood event occurred on 3rd october 2020 in nw italy along the sesia river was assessed with special concern about damages affecting rice crop fields a method was proposed aimed at detecting flooded areas and giving an estimate of water depth wd based on free available copernicus data sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 and digital terrain model dtm in particular sentinel 1 pre and post event

saturation from areas where water was coming from the river corine land cover 2018 level 3 and ndvi from a sentinel 2 pre event image were used to map crops that were still to be harvested at the time of flood these were the ones that were considered while estimating the potential economic loss a total of 255 ha of rice that still to be harvested were submerged but only 211 ha were affected by river overflow using local rice yield and price the resulting economic loss was about 2 200 000 keywords sar sentinel 1 sentinel 2 watershed segmentation flood mapping crops damage mapping 1 introduction floods and in general extreme meteorological events occur more frequently due to climate change their effects are particularly evident on crops and forests brown et al 2012 orusa et al 2020 sarvia et al 2021a agricultural damage assessment after extreme rainy events is ordinarily based on the joint evaluation of the local agricultural situation by mapping land use and soil characteristics and the hydraulic conditions of the event i e duration velocity intensity and amount transported material quantity floods can generate damages at different scales of analysis boccardo et al 2007 at the farm scale the impacts can affect buildings rural infrastructures e g irrigation channels and machineries resulting into extra costs for recovery efforts that can certainly condition revenues for several years apart morris and brewin 2014 within fields damages mainly concern soils that can be eroded and moved away by water depauperating top soil or accumulating new materials wilson et al 2011 moreover depending on the time of flood with respect to the growing season of local crops the yearly yield can be totally or partially compromised even depending on water flow strength and debris content morris and brewin 2014 monitoring conditions affecting flooded areas in the very next days after the events can certainly support damage assessment romali et al 2018 permitting a refinement of estimates and developing a support for the insurance companies in quantifying and mapping risks borgogno mondino et al 2019 sarvia et al 2020a sarvia et al 2019 in particular one important hydraulic parameter to be considered is the above ground level agl water depth wd many experiences proved a strict relationship between crops damage degree and wd molinari et

remote sensing techniques and hydrological models have been proposed for these purposes tarpanelli et al 2018 used radar altimetry while westra and de wulf 2009 based their deductions on moderate resolution image spectroradiometer modis data dano et al 2011 wang and xie 2018 reported an exhaustive review of remote sensing based applications for floods assessment synthetic aperture radar sar

problems bian et al 2018 mason et al 2021 they are known to represent an efficient tool for civil protection purposes especially in rapid response where an immediate even rough damage estimate is required ajmar et al 2015 de petris et al 2020 2019 smith 1997 ordinarily flood monitoring and risk assessment are achieved by hydrological modelling based on flow energy balance equations involving several physical inputs i e precipitations air temperature physical parameters of soil topography vegetation puno et al 2021 2020 these models allow to simulate superficial and groundwater dynamics accounting for different hydrological processes including wd and can be summarized as it follows one dimensional 1d models as estry hec ras isis mike 11 rubicon sobek swmm knebl et al 2005 kourgialas

syme 2001 these models are known to require many inputs that are often not easily available especially far away from rivers devia et al 2015 making difficult their application in a rapid mapping context typically these physical based models require a detailed geometric description of the river bed like flow rate manning s values river sections bottom slope and roughness of the analyzed river trait moreover the entire river system must be schematically represented taking care about all the connected elements interacting with the river stream junctions bridges and culverts or lateral structures pistocchi and mazzoli 2002 despite the huge literature concerning sar data application to monitor flood risk and its effects on urban and human activities sar imagery were poorly adopted to map flood damages in agricultural sector manavalan 2017 sanyal and lu 2004 shen et al 2019 tsyganskaya et al 2018 in this context this work presents a new method based on free available data satellite and elevation data to detect flooded crops and estimate wd allowing a near real time and continuous mapping of these variables the procedure is presented with reference to the flooding event occurred on 3rd october 2020 by the sesia river nw italy finally a rough economic loss assessment was proposed concerning the rice fields the main issues explored in this work are a a statistical based threshold selection criteria for flood delineation using sar data based on an adaptive method that makes it possible to automatically detect a threshold value accordingly to the specific area one is considering b water depth mapping over flooded crops avoiding hydrological models c stagnant water classification according to its source i e by river overflow or by soil saturation for better characterizing the effects of the event on crops all these issues were presented and discussed in the following sections the jointly used of free and near real time updated data allows to define a new procedure that could potentially give a rapid assessment of the effects of a flood on the agricultural sector supporting local restoration policies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area on 2nd october 2020 according to local meteorological data http www arpa piemonte it north west italy was affected by an intense rainfall 450 mm d 1 rainfall caused the flooding of the sesia river that develops at the border between piemonte and lombardia regions unfortunately the event occurred on a critical period close to the harvesting of rice the main crop in the area resulting in a significant damage to the local agriculture an area of interest aoi sizing about 1105 km2 fig 1 was selected including 58 italian municipalities the most of them located within the piemonte region that the river was running through in particular the flattest trait of the river was considered 2 2 available data 2 2 1 sentinel 1 imagery sentinel 1 s1 is one of the current largest space borne missions providing free and open accessible sar data having high temporal resolution from 6 to 2 days combining ascending descending orbits well fitting crop multi temporal monitoring requirements sar data processing is very complex and often data are not available free of charge as well stressed by grimaldi et al 2016 the complexity of sar data pre processing appears a key factor for sar data slow uptake by a wider user community reiche et al 2016 vollrath et al 2020 conversely google earth engine gee web based platform allows an immediate access to pre processed images making users to directly focus on their specific applications gorelick et al 2017 in this work s1 ground range detected grd interferometric wide iw swath image collection available in gee was used in particular s1 grd high resolution grdh collection is released with a squared pixel having a geometrical resolution of 10 m georeferenced into a user defined cartographic reference frame in this work set equal to wgs84 utm 32 n this collection was already pre processed by the sentinel 1 toolbox s1tbx veci et al 2014 and the correspondent backscattering coefficient σ db for vv and vh polarizations mapped as separate raster layers ordinarily water surfaces show very low backscattered signal in all polarizations manavalan 2017 manavalan et al 2017 p but the co polarized vv signal proved to be poorly affected by vegetation presence allowing a better detection of partially submerged areas manjusree et al 2012 therefore two vv polarized images one pre event and one post event were selected and directly processed by gee the reference image pre event was acquired on 28th september 2020 while the post event one was acquired on 3rd october 2020 the latter was used to explore flooded water distribution in the area fig 2 2 2 2 sentinel 2 imagery sentinel 2 s2 multispectral imagery was extensively adopted in vegetation mapping in order to map vegetated areas a single s2 image acquired on 28th september 2020 was selected and processed by gee collection titled copernicus s2 sr the image obtained was already calibrated in at the ground reflectance processing level 2 a and orthoprojected into the wgs84 utm 32 n reference frame red band 4 λ 665 nm and nir band 8 λ 842 nm bands were used for normalized difference vegetation index ndvi computation having a geometric resolution of 10 m some additional layers were also obtained mapping pixel quality scene classification map scl useful to masking out unreliable pixels 2 2 3 digital terrain model two gridded dtms available from piemonte and lombardia

these dtms represent the best resolute and accurate terrain models available for the aoi they were preventively mosaicked average was applied in overlapping areas and unitarily used for next processing 2 2 4 sesia river area a polygon vector layer mapping the sesia river area sra was extracted from the piemonte regional hydrologic network vector layer that was downloaded by the regional geoportal https www geoportale piemonte it cms bdtre modalita di pubblicazione e fruizione this layer was updated in 2020 having a nominal scale of 1 10000 2 2 5 corine land cover map the 2018 corine land cover clc2018 dataset level 3 was used to locate and map agricultural areas in aoi clc2018 was released for free from the land monitoring service copernicus https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover as vector layer having a nominal scale equal to 1 100000 level 3 of clc2018 is the most detailed level according to the hierarchical classification system adopted by the corine land cover project since it is design with a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha and minimum mapping unit of 100 m büttner 2014 table 1 shows agricultural classes and correspondent codes of clc2018 level 3 classification levels considered in this work 2 2 6 reference ground data to validate the proposed methodology the azienda agricola martinengo luigi sebastiano an important local farm located in the municipality of langosco province of pavia was involved in order to collect reference data rd on wd after the sesia river overflow a field survey campaign was carried out by the farm employees in particular wd was measured in the accessible fields using a graduated pole fig 3 the agricultural field recorded were delineated as polygons vector layer by photointerpretation on true color orthomosaic available on the piemonte regional geoportal www geoportale piemonte it updated to 2010 and having a geometric resolution of 20 cm subsequently the wd data obtained from the field survey were associated with the respective polygon a total of 61 rice plots were recorded and labelled as damaged 46 and 15 as undamaged fields rd are located in the municipality of caresana rosasco motta de conti and langosco within the aoi fig 4 unfortunately the size of fields is limited and authors are aware that this dataset does not perfectly fit statistical requirements nevertheless it represents ordinary availability of ground data from farmers when data are not directly managed by scientists in fact the most data from farmers generally rely on their autonomous collections and decision of making them public it should be noted that data regarding wd outside river brook are not ordinary available especially in the absence of an experimental design or moreover after an extreme and unexpected event such as a flood furthermore it is a fact that when dealing with floods a sample design cannot be programmed being impossible to a priori know where water will be present moreover water persistence above ground is limited in time making further difficult to get data about the situation before it is absorbed by soil nevertheless the average size of the collected fields was about 1 36 ha the authors found that the sample provided by local farmers including 61 rice fields having a total area about to 83 ha corresponding to about 3 4 of the expected flooded rice fields within the aoi about 2400 ha 2 2 7 agricultural economic loss assessment rice yield and market price were also considered in this work to complete the procedure with an estimation step as usually required when quantifying the impact of a flood after the event the average rice yield in this area was set to 7 t ha 1 tesio et al 2014 and the local price to 340 t 1 ismea 2021 2 3 data processing in fig 5 is presented the workflow adopted in this work datelined information and acronyms are reported in the next sections 2 3 1 flooded area mapping s1 data have already proved to be an effective tool to detect flooded areas bioresita et al 2018 p 1 ezzine et al 2020 twele et al 2016 flood detection is possible thanks to the strong specular reflection that affects sar signal lighting water surfaces this peculiar scattering mechanism makes a water pixel poorly scattering low signal all the polarizations based on this fact many methods were developed to map flooded pixels by thresholding manavalan 2017 many of them are based on an automatic selection of a proper threshold value in this context sezgin and sankur 2004 provided an exhaustive comparison about the performance of several grey level image thresholding techniques among these techniques the otsu s method otsu 1979 was cited as an effective technique kurita et al 1992 trier and jain 1995 to define automatic threshold based on image histogram such method is a nonparametric and unsupervised one based on the separability maximization of the tested classes in the image digital number domain in particular threshold that dichotomize the pixels into two classes i e flooded and not flooded areas is defined iteratively covering the entire histogram values range for each iteration within and between classes variances are calculated consequently the problem is reduced to an optimization problem searching for a threshold that minimize within class variances and maximize between class one given the difficulty of finding a robust threshold value by using only one post event acquisition the authors tried to achieve this problem proposing a thresholding method applied to the image difference resulting from the pre and a post event acquisition in particular the otsu s method was applied directly within gee to generate a binary classification mapping flooded and not flooded areas from the vv images difference pre and post event s1 images pre and post event images were preventively filtered by a circular median filter 50 m kernel size in order to minimize speckle related noise the vv image of 28th september ri and the one of the 3rd october 2020 were used to map the pre and post event situation respectively comparison was achieved by grid differencing to generate a new image hereinafter called δvv mapping local differences expectation for flooded pixels was that differences post minus pre were negative consequently all δvv pixels showing a value 0 were masked out with reference to remaining pixels δvv histogram was analyzed by otsu s method and an optimal threshold defined finally a classification hereinafter called flooded map fm mapping flooded value 1 and not flooded value 0 pixels was produced a further refinement was applied to remove small isolated flooded patches by counting fm inter pixel connections using the ee connectedpixelcount operator available in gee patches having less than 100 connections corresponding to a minimum mapping unit of 1 hectare approximately were masked out 2 3 2 vegetation masking flooded areas strictly depend on ground morphology while damage can vary according to local land cover and crops phenology flood can improve crop condition by depositing nutrients or water in the very early phenological stages differently in late stages it could compromise final yield moreover it also can be possible that a given crop was already harvested and therefore no damage occurred trying to map these different situations a vegetation mask was generated with reference to the ndvi image mapping the pre event conditions not vegetated pixels were masked out by thresholding the ndvi map ndvi 0 4 the threshold was selected according to several previous studies burgan and hartford 1993 gao 1996 ormsby et al 1987 zhang et al 2003 that proved that ordinarily vegetated areas show ndvi greater than 0 4 the initial assumption was that in the area the most diffused and valuable crop still to be harvested at the time of the flood was the rice ndvi was not used to get an estimate of the phenological stage of rice that was a priori known being the time of flood close to the harvest ndvi was just used to detect vegetated from not vegetated areas at the moment of the flood making possible to separate rice fields that had been already harvested ndvi 0 4 from the one still hosting rice ndvi 0 4 the resulting raster mask vegetation mask vm was used to address successive operations towards the only vegetated pixels included crops crops were finally mapped intersecting vm with the available clc2018 finally rice mapping was obtained with reference to the clc2018 but only rice fields showing ndvi 0 4 were assumed as still waiting for harvest and consequently determining an economical loss 2 3 3 water depth mapping as already mentioned crop damage is proportional to the agl wd molinari et al 2019 shrestha et al 2013 rapid mapping and timely damage estimation are important requirements while working with catastrophically event sarvia et al 2020b de petris et al 2021b in order to recover and restore farmers in this context geographical information systems gis and free geographical data can support such analysis in particular this work relies on the adoption of a simple morphological analysis of dtm to give an estimate of wd within flooded areas fig 6 dtm was properly segmented through the watershed algorithm available in system for automated geoscientific analyses gis saga gis vs 7 9 0 with the aim of identifying local terrain depressions naturally hosting water segmentation was performed using the following parameters method maxima join segments on saddle difference using a threshold equal to 0 8 resulting patches hereinafter called depression patches dps were mapped as polygons vectors layer dps was then intersected with fm to refine size patches to fit only flooded areas as detected by sar for each refined dp the minimum h min i and maximum h max i values of height from dtm were calculated by zonal statistics their difference h i defines the maximum potential thickness of the water layer that dp can contain h i was computed by the field calculator tool within saga gis and saved as new field in the correspondent attribute table according to eq 1 1 h i h max i h min i subsequently wd can be estimated according to eq 2 2 wd x y h i dtm x y h min i by taking eq 1 into eq 2 it can be noted that wd is only related to h max i and local elevation value dtm x y therefore a new raster layers h max i x y was then generated aligned to the available dtm by gridding dp with reference to h max i fields finally eq 3 was used to map wd x y in the area 3 wd x y h max i x y dtm x y 2 4 validation flooded areas detection accuracy was assessed by using rd in fact 61 reference fields were used for this purpose and they were labelled as flooded or not flooded during ground survey campaign rd polygons were rasterized into a gridded layer having the same resolution of fm finally the confusion matrix and related accuracies were computed comparing at the pixel level rd raster and fm subsequently for each rd field zonal statistics were performed in order to determine the mode value of wd consequently the mean absolute error mae between the value of wd derived from the field survey campaign and the estimated one was calculated using eq 4 at field level in order to test the wd map accuracy willmott and matsuura 2005 4 mae i 1 n x i r x i o n where n is total number of fields in rd x i r is reference wd value in the i th fields of rd x i o is the observed wd resulted by applying the proposed method authors are conscious that this sample size does not fully fit the ordinary statistical requirements nevertheless this situation can frequently appear during a common technology transfer operation especially in the agricultural sector 2 5 potential loss of rice yield during extreme rainy events submerged areas as detectable from satellite can be related to flood or to soil saturation in soil saturated areas stagnant water is clearer less sediments since mainly caused by rain conversely flooded areas are characterized by water caused by river dynamics where many sediments and debris are present additionally given the high laminar force of water flowing across fields lodged plants can also be present these phenomena therefore affect crops in a very different way in soil saturated areas stagnant water can submerge plants but after few hours it can be absorbed by soil or flowed away resulting in a minor damage with these premises a method to separate potential flooded areas from the soil saturated ones was proposed based again on the available dtm a mask of potential flooded areas was generated testing at pixel level if the local dtm x y value was lower than the altitude of the nearest river bank in this case the pixel was labelled as 1 flooded differently it was labeled as 0 not flooded the above mentioned condition was based on the assumption that ordinary water flow unlikely spreads along positive slopes gradient but conversely it naturally moves along a negative slope gradient lighthill and whitham 1955 zimmermann and church 2001 this assumption could be violated during extreme flows where flood mass can even move along positive gradients nevertheless some flow approximations are always needed to model hydrological processes bout and jetten 2018 a proximity grid analysis was performed considering dtm x y and river banks altitude the latter was obtained by clipping dtm by sra the allocation tool available in saga gis was used to associate the altitude of the closest river bank to the generic pixel a raster layer hereafter called river banks altitude rba having the same gsd of dtm was generated mapping allocation values a grid difference between rba and dtm x y was then performed and thresholded all pixels where difference value was greater than 0 5 m i e lower bound of uncertainty of dtm differences 2 σ dtm 0 5 m were labelled as potentially flooded code 1 all the other pixels were labelled as not flooded code 0 resulting classification potential flooded areas map pfam assumed to map the potentially flooded areas was intersected with vm and fm in order to map vegetated potentially hosting crops flooded areas from the submerged ones where water was detected but possibly related to rain and not to river flood therefore from the intersection of pfam fm and vm only active crops flooded by river overflow were isolated and remaining areas were masked out from subsequently computation a further investigation was then achieved to get an estimate of the potential yield loss and consequently of the associated economic lost income 3 results 3 1 flooded area mapping otsu s method was applied to δvv histogram fig 7a and the correspondent threshold values were found all δvv pixel values less than the threshold were labelled as flooded code 1 in fm and the others as not flooded code 0 in fm fig 7b the assumption was that flooded areas should present highly negative δvv values due to the dominant specular scattering mechanism that occurs when a water film covers the surface the found threshold value was equal to 6 94 δvv flooded area as mapped on 3rd october 2020 by s1 proved to be about 4300 ha in terms of land cover classes clc2018 level 3 table 2 shows the impact of floods in the agricultural context this analysis proved that rice was the most affected crop with more than 2390 flooded hectares over 72 of the flooded area classes 221 and 231 appeared to be not affected by the event 3 2 vegetation masking an ndvi map characterizing vegetation before the event was generated fig 8a all values greater than 0 4 were labelled as vegetated vm code 1 and the other ones were masked out vm fig 8b layer covers about 665 8 km2 an intersection between vm and agricultural clc classes was performed in order to map active vegetated crops fig 8b that probably were affected by flood whereby a total of 1151 ha of affected rice crops were found in aoi while the remaining 1244 ha of rice from the vm map appeared to be already harvested other clc classes such as 211 were also affected by the event table 3 unfortunately at the clc level it is not possible to specify these crops and consequently estimate the level of damage on this class 3 3 water depth mapping and validation fm accuracy was assessed by confusion matrix computation involving rasterized rd and fm according to table 4 proposed method results to be an effective tool to separate flooded areas from not flooded ones overall accuracy was 96 producer s and user s accuracy were found to be equal to 94 and 100 for flooded areas respectively moreover similar accuracies for not flooded areas were found to be high 100 and 89 respectively wd map and relative cumulative frequency distribution are reported in fig 9 mae of wd map calculated accordingly to eq 4 was about 0 42 m this result well fits the theoretical accuracy of dtm differences 0 5 m due to the high geometric regularity of soil surface in rice plots mae value suggests that the wd variation within a plot is insignificant and mainly driven by the random nature of the dtm accidental error common to all measurements 3 4 potential loss of rice yield according to pfam fig 10a potentially floodable areas resulted to be 46 245 ha with reference to vm and fm possibly flooded active crops mainly rice were detected these sized about 930 ha fig 10b additionally 221 ha were recognized as submerged i e showing water related to soil saturation from rain table 5 since only in flooded areas river related crop damage was retained as significant an assessment was performed to give an estimate of rice yield loss according to the above mentioned agricultural economic loss assessment section data potential yield loss resulted in 6510 tons corresponding to an economical income loss of 2 214 354 4 discussions ordinarily flooded areas mapping by hydrological models relies on physically based simulations involving meteorological data dtms river and soil features these models generate outputs resulting from local assumptions and simplifications as deeply discussed by devia et al 2015 sood and smakhtin 2015 differently sar satellite based approaches allows to detect actual submerged areas based on physical scattering mechanism i e surface scattering this reduces uncertainty related to the definition of the correct empirical parameters that hydrological models require sar image based methods are strictly dependent on a thresholding processing step whose performance strictly relies on the time after the event that a proper image can be available in fact it is expected that the number of flooded pixels decreases with the passing of days making weaker statistical deductions concerning δvv distribution analysis especially related to class separability de petris et al 2021a it is worth to remind that the majority of image thresholding techniques depends on patch size making otsu s method an exception since operating regardless of object size and consequently well fitting crop detection i e small patches lee et al 1990 as far as obtained results are concerned fm proved to correctly detect flooded fields with the respect to rd authors again remark that given the very small size of rd fields a rigorous validation was actually not possible this is a common condition while dealing with natural hazards related problems where data for validation are often missing due to unfavorable environmental conditions sometimes unsafe characterizing hit areas after the event nevertheless literature confirmed that the joint use of otsu s method and sar imagery is effective in flooded areas detection as reported by pulvirenti et al 2013 schumann et al 2010 with respect to study cases exactly concerning areas that are very closed to our study area i e northwestern part of po valley with special concerns about new issues that this work dealt with the problem related to the distinction between areas hosting water coming from rainfall soil saturation and those actually flooded by the river is certainly the most interesting one these two situations contemporarily occurring after a flooding event are expected to determine different damage levels to crops to take care about this pfam was generated based on proximity analysis allocation tool pfam proved to be affected by several simplifications a proximity analysis depends on dtm and sra geometric resolution and both altimetric and planimetric precision awange and kiema 2013 boccardo et al 2003 b water flow was assumed to only run along a negative slope gradient c since proximity analysis only maps the closest rba to the generic position an underestimation of flooded areas is expected in fact other points can also contribute to supply water to the same location d during the flood some obstacles can interrupt water flow from river to the generic point and consequently not taking care about this can generate an overestimation of areas potentially flooded by river for a complete transfer of this method to the operational compart further investigations are expected to be done the first one concerns the analysis of the effects of spatial connectivity and patchiness affecting both river and crops from this point of view only few works exist in literature suggesting that an important knowledge gap still persists thus requiring a proper investigation alaoui et al 2018 western et al 1998 moreover the lack of an updated crop type map represents a limit for a proper damage assessment over difference crops therefore future developments will be expected to involve in the proposed approach a crop type detection derived by remotely sensed data sarvia et al 2021b the second one concerns the effect of dtm accuracy in both the segmentation process and robustness of wd estimates specifically looking for the separated contribution of dtm absolute and relative accuracies dtm accuracy and spatial resolution is basic while dealing with geometric issues like water level mapping one constraint of the method is in fact that the dtm vertical uncertainty is lower than the expected value of the measure one is going to do it is well known that global dtms like aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer dtm v2 and srtm shuttle radar topography mission show a reduced absolute vertical accuracy about 10 m coupled with a pixel size of 30 and 90 m respectively these features make them not compliant with this type of analysis nevertheless the most of countries make available through their institutional geoportals more detailed and site specific dtms the most of them from lidar acquisitions having accuracies and resolutions consistent with the one we adopted for this work an absolute vertical accuracy of 0 5 m could be enough while working at the landscape level and when ground has to be compared with a water level that during a flood could significantly be over the meter moreover when a vertical absolute accuracy of 0 5 m is declared by suppliers it is expected that relative accuracy concerning height differences between points from the same dtm is higher making the data more and more proper as far as geometric resolution is concerned a dtm having a 5 5 m pixel size is perfectly consistent with a 1 25000 scale map and consequently proper for at landscape level analysis like the one required for floods affecting wide areas some refinements would be desirable concerning wd and water persistence effects on crop damage introducing a preliminary step for crop classification from satellite data and its characterization in terms of phenology sarvia et al 2021b this information will certainly drive to develop a more robust crop damage assessment making possible to overcome those approximations related to the adoption of a low resolution crop map like the corine land cover one is we remind that the clc minimum mapping unit is 25 ha and not all the crops are taken into considerations separately suggesting a more specific classification as far as flooded crops mapping is concerned the joint use of vm and clc2018 proved to effectively support rice damage assessment a critical point still persists concerning ndvi thresholding since depending on the adopted threshold value crop detection and related economic loss estimates can greatly vary concerning wd mapping accuracy of estimates was found to be 0 42 m mae this result is consistent with those other methods can generate specifically results obtained by the rapide tool proposed by scorzini et al 2018 showed a mae ranging between 0 28 and 0 79 m for the flood event occurred in lombardia region in november 2002 gatti 2016 found a wd mae varying between 0 42 and 0 73 m for the flood event occurred in sardegna region italy in november 2013 finally wd uncertainty from the present work was also consistent with the one from 2d hydrological models like fwdet that was applied in brazos river area texas usa during the flooding event occurred in september 2013 where an accuracy of 0 37 m was found cohen et al 2018 concerning agronomic issues it is worth to remind that water persistence de petris et al 2021a and vegetation stage can significantly affect the damage impact of crops rahman and di 2020 in this regard several indices were proposed in the literature for the evaluation of crop damage following natural disasters such as the vegetation condition index or the disaster vegetation damage index di et al 2018a 2018b however no works aim at estimating the wd with copernicus and dtm open data are currently present the possibility of mapping wd can be therefore useful to locally test in this particular case if rice was significantly or totally submerged since rice average height close to the harvest is about 0 80 m fogliatto et al 2012 wd information makes it possible to better quantify potential crop damage this is strictly related to the economic loss that the event possibly determined from this point of view according to the local price of rice 340 t 1 and to the nominal yield 7 t ha 1 the potential income loss was found to be equal to 2214354 this result can probably vary according to local damage level farmer s recovery effort rice varieties nevertheless it represents a first rapid estimate of local economic loss that well fits the requirements needed while working with disastrous events de petris et al 2021b sarvia et al 2020a 2020b 5 conclusions in this work the flood event occurred on 3rd october 2020 in nw italy along the sesia river was assessed with special concern about damages affecting rice crop fields a method was proposed aimed at detecting flooded areas and giving an estimate of wd based on free available copernicus data sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 and dtms in particular s1 grd iw pre and post event images were compared by differencing δvv δvv was processed at pixel level to detect submerged areas through the thresholding otsu s method a δvv value of 6 94 was found able to separate areas with and without stagnant water about the 4 of the aoi otsu s method was adopted to make objective the selection of the proper threshold value to map areas with and without water from s1 data the method is adaptive making possible to automatically detect the threshold value accordingly to the specific area one is considering a simplified morphological analysis was then performed by dtm tessellation to map dps these were interpreted as elementary units to refer wd estimates to the wd accuracy was tested in respect of local ground data resulting in a mae of 0 42 m a further step aimed at classifying submerged areas was achieved based on dtm and sra proximity analysis making possible to separate areas where water was related to soil saturation from areas where water was coming from the river clc2018 level 3 and ndvi from a s2 pre event image were used to map crops that were still to be harvested at the time of flood these were the ones that were considered while estimating the potential economic loss about 211 ha of rice were submerged by river flooding determine an economic loss of about 2 200 000 concluding in this work a simplified approach based on gis and free available data was proposed to support flood related damage estimation simplicity and cheapness of the approach coupled with the obtained wd uncertainty are certainly interesting if compared with more complex methods based on hydrological models these ordinarily require many inputs that are rarely available outside rivers and difficultly available for agricultural areas especially during an unexpected and extreme event such as flood declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we would like to thank dr sara martinengo for

9441,neoteric phenomena such as climate change scarce water availability and excessive fertilizer usage necessitate an augmentation of resource utilisation efficiencies in the agricultural sector there is a need to reorient the agroecosystems to curb stress on environmental resources while meeting rising socio economic objectives under changing hydro climatic conditions considering this optimal land allocation for diversified agriculture is essential we propose a combinatorial optimisation approach for land allocation considering agronomic socio economic environmental and hydro climatic objectives using bio inspired optimization algorithms the stochastic approach tackles the problem of optimal agricultural land allocation for crops in a multidimensional context by simultaneously addressing the conflicting goals of farm level risk management as well as district level contingency planning the efficiencies and sensitivity of the proposed framework are assessed through a case study of the dharwad district in karnataka india using the data water and fertilizer consumption and cost crop type cultivable land man and machine hours etc from the year 2019 2020 results indicate that multi objective genetic algorithm moga is more capable of optimising agricultural resources management by suggesting optimal land allocation for diversified crop planning although cuckoo search cs and particle search optimisation pso also produced productive pareto fronts they were observed to be less effective than moga the annual increase in profits and crop yield obtained using moga are 103 and 97 respectively while water usage is reduced by 5 compared to the conventional routines in dharwad the proposed hydro agronomic decision support framework dsf can be utilised to assist the ai enabled crop planning process for the sustainable management of agroecosystems graphical abstract ga1 keywords agronomy artificial intelligence crop diversification hydro

climate change mitigation enhancing crop production and farmers income minimizing environmental pollution and preserving biodiversity manimozhi and gayathri 2012 popp et al 2014 laborde et al 2021 intensified agricultural development to ensure global food security has led to several major problems in the form of greenhouse gases land degradation over application of fertilizers erosion water contamination and loss of genetic diversity kopittke et al 2019 presently the predominant response to the rising food demands has been the mono cropping of risk free crops in many developing countries

landscapes of many developing countries are being replaced by huge areas of monoculture farmed using extensive pesticides mineral fertilizers and fossil fuels over the past two decades proper management of resources essential to agronomic sustainability like availability of land water labor machinery and capital is lacking due to monocropping climate change industrialization of farmlands farm pollution and insufficient knowledge transfer to farmers resulting in non optimal usage of water and fertilizer annepu et al 2012 laborde et al 2021 semi arid regions in particular tend to be markedly more susceptible to these challenges the complex interactions among biophysical processes and economics have substantially impeded effective decision making primarily agricultural land allocation in developing countries esteve et al 2015 sustainable land management through an optimal agricultural land allocation will help address these challenges which is a multidimensional planning problem characterized by the conflicting goals of ecological adaptation hydro environmental and socio economic suitability srivastava and singh 2017 liang et al 2019 xie et al 2020 such land use optimization warrants shifting from traditional individualistic planning to a more collaborative multi scalar framework of diversified cropping design fikry et al 2021 advantages of optimal

planning land use changes based on trade offs with nature conservation and ecosystem services groot et al 2018 and d land use and management in changing hydro climatic conditions klein et al 2013 thus it needs socio economic and environmental development strategies to examine multi cropping in agronomic and hydroclimatic contexts esteve et al 2015 gallardo et al 2020 mathematical frameworks have been the primary solution to agricultural land use optimization srinivas et al 2020 over the past decade simulation systems that model various dimensions ranging from land distribution changes and their effects were developed diogo et al 2015 dang and kawasaki 2017 these models economic theory based explanatory model system dynamics and geographic information system gis models ptmapp acpf epic apex etc are essential to understanding the cause effect relationships among biophysical parameters land use decisions and hydro economic repercussions most of these models assume the maximum productivity of agricultural production systems arciniegas et al 2011 chakir and gallo 2013 spatial models montgomery et al 2016 sharma et al 2018a render agricultural planning on a topological scale using geographic information systems gis and remote sensing these algorithms use big spatial data for agricultural decision making this variant of mathematical modeling allows decision makers to leverage mappings of parameters like supply chains and irrigation systems however most of the previous models mentioned above have not simultaneously optimized agronomic socio economic environmental and hydro climatic objectives and thus underrated farmers and local practitioners response towards hydro climatic changes cochrane et al 2019 srinivas et al 2020 over the recent years artificial and swarm intelligence santé riveira et al 2008 zhao 2010 wang et al 2012 liu et al 2013 have been extensively applied to land allocation optimization the applicability of these models has been found to be restricted to small scale agricultural watersheds the algorithms used by these models are heuristic solutions that provide decision makers with solution sets and contextual knowledge about the solution space however the salient structure of classic intelligent modeling restricts the user to optimization of a singular objective the most popular variant of optimization algorithms applied to land use has consistently been programming models mosleh et al 2017 sharma et al 2018b ren et al 2019 modifying characteristics such as linearity and the number of objectives of these techniques allows for the quantitative redistribution of land use at multiple scales and dimensions zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2015b multi objective intelligent systems deploy artificial intelligence ai principles and programming models to provide a solution geared towards combinatorial optimization problems srivastava and singh 2017 this category of mathematical models has been gaining traction since the introduction of multi objective particle swarm optimization two decades ago coello and lechuga 2002 particle swarm optimisation mopso cuckoo search mocs and genetic algorithms moga have emerged as some of the cutting edge candidates for multi objective adaptations elsoragaby et al 2020 chen et al 2021 mopso and moga have been deployed successfully to solve problems such as commercial land allocation that present decision makers with less dimensionality than agricultural planning safarzadeh et al 2018 song and chen 2018 multi objective particle swarm optimization models have also proven to lend environmentally sustainable solutions to processes in the agricultural supply chain barak et al 2015 lee et al 2017 hajikhani et al 2018 mopso and mocs have also been applied successfully to the hydro economic facet of agriculture to optimise power as well as water usage hatamkhani and moridi 2019 rezaei and safavi 2020 limited studies have framed the agricultural land allocation problem as a combinatorial optimization problem that accounts for inherent uncertainties and conflicting goals bio inspired mathematical methods like intelligent and swarm algorithms which have long been recognised as the robust solution to combinatorial optimisations have not been used to heuristically address the issues discussed here past works also fail to address diversified land allocation for crops in all dimensions and agricultural landscapes of different sizes lin and li 2019 muñoz and park 2019 also the farm level socio economic demands constrained by biophysical processes and topological relationships that warrant district level planning are often neglected aerts et al 2003 shi et al 2014 the current study proposes a decision support framework dsf using multi objective bio inspired and ai algorithms mopso mocs moga for diversified land allocation allowing for a novel and detailed district level land allocation at agronomic landscapes of different sizes in the dharwad district of karnataka india these models delineate a comprehensive and logical system that represents farm level economic issues while addressing the district s agronomic socio economic environmental and hydro climatic objectives the pareto fronts of multi modal solutions resulting from these frameworks are conducive to optimization under complex objectives and constraints these heuristic solutions allow for practical decision making in conjunction with problem specific knowledge this perspective also highlights the irrigation policies and farming management required to encourage environmentally conscious agronomic productivity the aims of the study are as follows 1 diversified land allocation for crops as an agronomic combinatorial optimisation problem that represents the economic interests of farmers while reckoning with conflicting ecological concerns and societal uncertainties using bio inspired and artificial intelligence models 2 comparison with conventional land allocation statsitics and benchmarking of the efficacy of bio inspired methods mopso mocs moga in the agricultural landscapes of different sizes farm and district level 3 proposing hydro agronomic decision support framework dsf using the best optimization approach for agricultural management to guide practitioners on diversified agronomic management in different cropping seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydro agronomic framework as previously established current global circumstances strongly warrant a shift from farm based agricultural research to land allocation strategies on an ecological scale in this study we administered multi objective intelligent optimization algorithms to a case study in india to develop a decision support framework dsf that can guide the practitioners towards making decisions in optimal land allocation for crops in different seasons therefore the designed dsf was to determine an optimal agricultural land usage at a district level that simultaneously addresses the agronomic socio economic hydro climatic and environmental objectives of agribusiness within realistic resource constraints the methodology compares the roubustness of three algorithms namely mopso moga and mocs towards optimization of yield profit and water availability the deployed algorithms were constructed and implemented in matlab version 2020b using open source frameworks for multi objective optimizations victor 2021 yang 2021 fig 1 represents the entire dsf developed in the study data has been procured from karnataka department of agriculture india ksda 2020 and university of agricultural science bengaluru dharwad 2020 the region specific data collected for the case study was mathematically analysed to determine the coefficients and solutions of the objective functions of the algorithms the framework has been modeled to ultimately provide a practitioner with the seasonal optimal distribution of available land for different crop options at a farm and district level hence the paradigm of sustainable land allocation for crops has been defined as being populated by crop type season and area of land allocated to a particular crop as described below c crop type 1 2 3 7 s season kharif k rabi r or zaid z season in india x area of land allotted to c during s from a societal perspective the pressing priority is the augmentation of crop production to keep abreast of global demands and combat food insecurity on the other hand economic demands justify the optimisation of farmers net profits the environmental impacts of agriculture can be represented by a multitude of factors such as fertilizer and pesticide runoffs carbon footprints and mono cropping hydro climatic criterion primarily focus on minimisation of water consumption under different cropping seasons agriculture overview 2020 therefore the formulated hydro economic model delineates three independent objectives for optimizing land allocation these objectives are farm level profits district level yields and water usage the premise of mathematical optimization necessitates the collation of the requirements of the solution set with the resource availability of the problem space in the current context of agriculture only resources that are affected by controllable supply are taken into account for example water requirements will be the amount of water required by a crop under the district s climatic conditions the final set of features identified as essential to the sector s interpretation are given in table 1 the three selected objectives were subsequently analyzed to characterize them within the multi dimensionality of hydro agronomics eqs 1 3 1 z profit w 1 c s x d sp p cp 2 z yield w 2 c s x p 3 z water w 3 c s x w where the meanings of parameters in the above equations are given in table 1 w i i 1 2 3 weightage given to each objective function based on preferences of local practitioners and conservationists of study area w 1 0 40 w 2 0 40 w 3 0 20 the framework is completed by designating a quartet of constraints eqs 4 6 that anchor the solution sets to practical viability these equations limit the total usage of land l labour rmd and water w to the quantities available in the selected study area an additional condition also ensures the feasibility of the results by having cropping areas greater than the average land holdings in the region the constraint variables are explained in table 1 4 c x l x average land holdings 5 c s x rmd md 6 c x rw w the entire framework fig 1 has been implemented in the design and deployment of the three selected intelligence algorithms these algorithms mopso mops and moga have been described briefly in the subsequent sections 2 2 demand factor in profit calculation it is important to note that a more categorical calculation of profit as x sp p cp assumes that the entire yield suggested by these methods would be sold the crop demands of the study area is a mix of different crops basavaraj et al 2019 mafw 2017 if a farmer aims to sell huge amounts of a singular crop they would not be able to satisfy the market demand and would incur huge losses therefore any solution that suggests a pivot into the production of a singular crop owing to high yields and selling price such as onion would set off a fluctuation of the market economics basavaraj et al 2019 that forms the basis of the optimisation widespread and persistent cultivation of a singular crop would also lead to a depreciation of soil quality lemaire et al 2015 tamburini et al 2020 the profit calculation presupposes that the accessible selling prices sp input by decision makers into this framework will be reflective of the market of the region over the recent seasons this cost will therefore be heavily dependent on the consumer demand for the produce in question furthermore this demand for major crops has remained fairly consistent over the past decade of agricultural statistics basavaraj et al 2019 mafw 2017 thus we introduce a demand factor d into the calculation of profit as a fraction reflective of the actual observed conventional land allocation strategies of the study area this ensures a diversified land allocation for crops that is not only environmentally sustainable but also guarantees higher profits to the farmers 2 3 multi objective particle swarm optimisation mopso this approach searches multi dimensional spaces by imitating the flying patterns of flocks of birds lin et al 2018 after a random initialisation the flock of particles is allowed to fly through the problem space based on its cohesion separation and alignment the modulations of behaviours of individuals in the swarms are affected by the best global individual selected based on performance measures these leaders chosen by each individual marshal the search by segregating the search space into hypercubes after every iteration the individuals are assigned a velocity c based on leader positioning l and best historical individual positioning i eqs 7 9 are used in this model at any time 7 c xy t 1 k c xy t m 1 n 1 i t p t m 2 n 2 l t p t where c xy denotes the velocity of the x th member of the y th particle m 1 m 2 4 and 0 m 1 m 2 4 and 0 n 1 n 2 1 k is an inertia weight factor bounded by its limits this velocity is used to update the position of the flocks p at every iteration 8 p t 1 p t c t 1 the convergence of this simulation is accelerated as compared to traditional evolutionary solutions by introducing a flying potential f 9 c xy t 1 f k c xy t m 1 n 1 i t p t m 2 n 2 l t p t this algorithm also confers an essence of memory to its populations and allows individuals to enhance themselves from past encounters particle swarms are highly conducive to multi objective adaptations due to brisk convergence this remodelling is executed through a global repository that stores the learnings of each flight in the form of individual objective functions in the present context mopso treats different land allocation solutions as particles moving in the problem space the initial population of these solutions is defined as an equal division of land amongst the selected crops successively a population of 500 solutions are created such that the different positions determine objective values of profits water consumption and yield the designated velocity and inertial values of 5 and 0 4 respectively are abstract parameters that determine the rate of creation and mutation of solution towards minimisation of the objective functions 2 4 multi objective cuckoo search mocs cuckoo search is an algorithm that adapts the aggressive parasitic reproduction strategies of the cuckoo bird to exhibit high efficiency in handling multimodal nonlinearity chen et al 2021 this species has been observed to lay their eggs in the nests of other host birds that are predisposed to then discard the alien eggs or relinquish the nest as a whole analogously a mocs algorithm with n objectives is characterized by cuckoos that randomly choose host nests for their n eggs that represent solutions for the various objectives this randomisation is handled by a lévy flight eq 10 13 10 s x t 1 s x t k l é vy a where s x t represents the solutions eggs of cuckoo i at a time t the scalarity of the problem is handled by the step size k with a constant k 0 11 k k 0 s x t s y t after incorporation of the random walk algorithm in the form of lévy flight the generations are created as 12 s x t 1 0 01 x i j 1 a s x t s y t here i and j are drawn from normal distributions 13 i n 0 σ i 2 j n 0 σ j 2 finally a p represents the probability of a parasitic egg being discovered and abandoned followed by the building of a new nest with n eggs this process is akin to the crossover element of evolutionary algorithms that diversifies and accelerates the search mocs is adapted to the land allocation problem such that every nested egg is a crop distribution solution inefficient solutions are identified by calculating the objective functions and replaced by potentially healthier allocations the availability of nests depicts the population size of 500 over a thousand iterations 2 5 multi objective genetic algorithm moga genetic algorithms are a bio inspired heuristic search that emulates the evolutionary process of natural selection elsoragaby et al 2020 these algorithms are designed to iteratively engender successive generations of populations from which the fittest individuals are selected to create offspring solutions eqs 14 16 are used in this model for a problem space with n objectives this scalar fitness function g is constructed from a weighted sum of objective functions 14 g s x 1 n k x g x s where s refers to a selection generation of solutions in order to diversify populations and randomise the direction of search these weights k are not defined as constant for each selection 15 k x random x x 1 n random x at every generation of the evolution pairs of individuals are randomly selected with a probability p for a crossover process to generate new strings as 16 p s g s g min σ g s g min this crossover is followed up with additional diversification through mutations furthermore elitism of the population is preserved by selecting an intermittent optimal front these generations are terminated as defined by a predesignated stopping condition to produce a final pareto front the populations of individuals created and mutated in this algorithm are analogous to land allocation solutions the fitness of these solutions is evaluated based on values of the defined objective functions up to 500 solutions are iterated through a thousand times with a crossover function of 0 8 2 6 case study the selected region of dharwad district fig 2 in karnataka exemplifies the vulnerabilities as well as potential inherent to agronomic decision making in india this district is nestled amongst hills east of the western ghats at an average altitude of 768 m above sea level dharwad lies between the latitudes of 15º 15 to 15º 35 n and 75º 00 to 75º 20 e longitudes effectively occupying the north interior meteorological zone of the south east asian plateau it hosts a population of 1 8 million with around 180 thousand agriculturists the national agricultural research project of india classifies the region as being in the north transition zone in its agro climatic stratifications this sub region experiences a hot dry and subhumid climate and receives around 786 mm of annual rainfall from the southwest and northeast monsoons characteristic of the indian subcontinent being a predominantly agrarian economy around 262 square kilometres of the area that spans over 426 square kilometres tends to be employed for cropping the black and loamy soils prevalent in this topography further facilitate these agricultural activities more than half of the region is irrigated by means of canals 63 while wells open and bore wells tube wells tanks and lift irrigation make up a minority of the hydrologic sources pmksy 2016 the principal contingencies of this agricultural ecosystem are prone to droughts floods pests and diseases dharwad produces a large variety of crops including cereals horticultural strains medicinal plants and plantation crops seven major crops have been selected across these categories to facilitate the current study the agricultural seasons in dharwad are kharif april to september followed by rabi october and december and zaid january to march some of the important commercial and cereal kharif crops are cotton groundnut soybean blackgram jowar green gram and maize chilli and onion are grown later in the kharif period bengal gram wheat and jowar tend to be grown on residual soil moisture during the rabi season mango sapota guava and banana constitute the popular horticultural crops native to the region while peas brinjal tomato green chilli etc are the major vegetables the current case study utilised a set of seven crops distributed across planting seasons and crop types bengal gram chilli cotton groundnut jowar onion and wheat datasets namely resource availability and crop requirements table 2 were procured from the university of agricultural sciences bengaluru in india dharwad 2020 and karnataka department of agriculture india ksda 2020 and were used to calculate the coefficients of the objective functions and constraints eqs 1 3 the objective functions and constraint equations of the models were calibrated with coefficients calculated from resource availabilities and crop requirements table s1 represents the coefficients obtained using calibration procedure for instance collected data table 2a reflects that chillies tend to yield around 4465 kg of produce at a cultivational cost of 51 750 inr per hectare during kharif season in dharwad subsequently a farmer in this region can sell every kilogram of this produce for 35 inr the demand factor for this crop is set at 0 36 reflecting the 36 land allocation attributed to it in the current landscape according to eq 1 the profit accrued by a farmer choosing to cultivate chillies over x hectares of land would be 5134 x inr 446 5 0 36 35 51750 x correspondingly replacing the production rate p selling price sp demand factor d and cultivation costs cp of the selected 7 crops over two seasons before summing up the individual profits produces an objective function with variables representing the land allocated to each crop similar calibration was also undertaken for eqs 2 3 to obtain objective functions f1 f2 f3 as given in equations s1 s3 for brevity more details on calibration are given in section s1 of the supplementary material the selected intelligent algorithms were subsequently run on these objective functions to distribute the agricultural land for optimal profits yield and water usage the constraints of resource availability in dharwad were introduced in the form of penalty factors added to the objectives table 2b each algorithm has been run 10 times with the same initial population before calculating the average efficiencies across objectives of the solutions in the pareto front produced by each model for implementation of each algorithm the solution set with the highest efficiency score was taken as the representation of the solution set for comparison 3 results and discussion the chosen objectives concerning profit maximization water usage minimization and yield maximization contradict each other annepu et al 2012 considering this a hydro agronomic dsf of intelligent multi objective land allocation in the dharwad district has been developed the three algorithms mocs moga and mopso have been run on the objective functions eqs 1 3 and constraints eqs 4 6 the coefficients of the objective functions and the constraint equations have been obtained using the datasets resource availability and crop requirement mentioned in tables 2a 2b this process of calibration has already been explained in the section 2 5 and s1 supplementary material the simulated results are dispensed for four selected variables land distribution agricultural yields water requirements and farmer s income these variables manifest the multitude of socio economic and environmental risks that beset hydro agronomics on agricultural landscapes of different sizes farm and district level after running each algorithm mopso mocs and moga over 10 iterations the solution with the highest average efficiency across the triad of objectives has been selected as representative of the method the results exhibit significant differences particularly in the optimal land allocation for crops suggested by three algorithms 3 1 comparison of pareto fronts obtained using three algorithms as multi objective algorithms each iteration of these optimizations produced a set of non dominated solutions that make up a pareto front as illustrated in fig 3 the visualization of these solution sets for the selected optimizations reflects the convergence rates of the different intelligences as expected from salient diversity mopso fig 3c consistently presented more widely dispersed results as compared to moga fig 3a furthermore both these methods reflected a more traditional inverted triangle front as compared to mocs fig 3b that rapidly converged to a rectilinear set of solutions this phenomenon can be explained by the alignment of search directions of these algorithms parallel to the objective axes zidan et al 2018 it is also instructive to analyse the technical contrast in solutions pareto fronts produced by mopso moga and mocs algorithms the differences in mopso can be widely attributed to the memory salient to particle swarm optimization jiao and xu 2016 zidan et al 2018 this property implies that the velocity of the individuals in each iteration of mopso is controlled by their individual autobiography and correlative orientation in the population conversely genetic algorithms and cuckoo searches tend to engender successive generations from prevailing old solutions owing to the alignment of search directions of these algorithms parallel to the objective axes these technical disparities allow these algorithms to produce different degrees of diverse solutions even in the absence of a variegated seeding population although all three algorithms produce diverse solution sets mopso produces comparatively more diverse solutions fig 3 as mocs and moga tries to converge to more efficient solutions quickly the initial population distribution also proves to be more influential to algorithms like moga and mocs that can converge on local optima if initiated by a non diversified solution huang and safranek 2014 kumar and yadav 2022 mopso can carry out the search by the while developing several generations only the most optimist particle can transmit information onto the other particles and the searching speed is comparatively faster than mocs and moga jiao et al 2016 zidan et al 2018 the elements of moga and mocs undergo very large number of mutations causing a considerable increase in the search kumar and yadav 2022 moga and mocs generally converge towards a local optimum or even arbitrary points rather than the global optimum while mopso tries to find the global optima civicioglu and besdok 2013 3 2 optimal land allocation proposed by hydro agronomic dsf the results of optimal land distribution for the selected seven crops considering socio economic agronomic hydro climatic and environmental factors have been illustrated in table 3 the best non dominated solutions from each pareto front have been chosen to represent each algorithm for two simulation scenarios the two scenarios portray a small farm and large district availability of land for agricultural distribution by running the algorithms for the entire landscape of dharwad table 3a as well as over just the currently available agricultural area table 3b the results of the three algorithms have also been compared to the conventional land allocation for the seven crops fig 4 the conventional land allocation represents the overall land allocation practiced in the study area for past one decade depending on the market demand there is a conspicuous difference in the distribution of crops recommended by mocs and moga as compared to mopso and conventional land allocation for illustration for the larger landscape in kharif season moga allocates 12051 ha and 39848 ha land for the cultivation of bengal gram and jowar respectively table 3a and fig 4a on the other hand in kharif season mopso allocates 175 ha and 24085 ha of land for the cultivation of bengal gram and jowar respectively the same numbers for mocs are 7806 ha and 9207 ha respectively in the kharif season as compared to the conventional land allocation in rabi season for these crops moga has minimum deviation of 36 and 47 for bengal gram and jowar respectively table 3a in contrast mopso 98 69 and mocs 59 88 exhibit large deviations with conventionally followed apportionments for bengal gram and jowar it can be noted that the moga follows this thumb rule of equitable crop distributions to maximize the profits and yields while having minimum deviation from conventional allocations cao et al 2011 the socio economic pretexts and hydro ecological implications of these results have further been discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 3 socio economic impact on crops from table 4 and fig 5 it is observed that mocs 0 64 billion usd and mopso 0 71 billion usd lend themselves to the lower proficiency with respect to profits and yield in the larger landscape while moga achieved highest profit of 1 24 billion usd table 4a at the farm level table 4b mocs was projected to achieve a profit of 0 38 billion usd table 4b effectively halving the economic income of farmers as compared to conventional allocations the net crop yields in the cuckoo search optimization were calculated to be around 1 98 billion kgs making the distribution half as socially efficient as conventional practices mopso also presented the problem space with low socio economic proficiency with profits of 0 37 billion usd on a yield of 2 07 billion kgs on the other hand genetic algorithms moga produced results with 97 increase in yield 1 25 billion usd from conventional statistics and a 103 6 23 billion kgs rise in profits in addition to crop yields required to meet demands the social construct of agricultural allocations is profoundly impacted by the total land utilization of the sector in this regard the genetic algorithm was observed to exhibit the highest land utilisation of almost 100 303 597 ha of currently cultivated topography basavaraj et al 2019 mafw 2017 the solutions produced by mopso 136 043 ha and mocs 129 688 ha achieved hydro agronomic productivity with only around half of the available landscape table 3 we have already explained why the three algorithms exhibit variation in their results in the previous section 3 1 the hydro economic dsf simultaneously optimizes yield profit and water usage here water usage is considered from an environmental perspective even though models remain well within the boundary condition the study aims to offer a land allocation strategy to the farmers which requires minimum water usage to optimize agricultural practices from an environmental perspective table 4b indicates that for the smaller landscape water usage is 0 68 and 0 70 bcm using mocs and mopso algorithms respectively when moga is used to reap higher profits and yield this water usage is 1 55 bcm although results indicate that water utilization is comparatively more in case of moga still moga is considered superior because water usage has been given lesser weightage in the optimization eqs 1 3 secondly by suggesting a land allocation for diversified crops similar to conventional land use moga ensures better utilization of soil moisture and minerals this would improve soil quality and consequently the crops would require lesser water yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 performed a detailed analysis of 31 different field crop rotations and showed that diversified crop rotations enhance groundwater and could be an effective strategy for sustainable food production in water stressed agricultural regions bhogal and vatta 2021 recommended crop diversification to address the water stress situation in punjab india agricultural watersheds by conservation of groundwater reducing evapotranspiration revitalisation of soil leading to improved productivity minimization of fertilizers and pesticides and efficient use of resources 3 4 effect of land allocation on hydro economics benchmarking of solutions has been carried out in two steps by means of efficiency scores this metric was first used to select the best performing solutions from each pareto front produced by each algorithm and then to compare the results of the different algorithms table s2 supplementary section shows the efficiency scores obtained for all three algorithms this efficiency score collates the extent of the percentile achievement of the three objectives by different solution sets for example in table 4a moga produces the highest profit for larger landscape 1 25 billion usd and is attributed a p eff of 100 here the mopso solution incurs only 57 of the moga profits and therefore has a p eff of 57 similarly for larger landscape table 4a moga scores efficiencies of 100 and 52 on the yield 9 64 billion kg and water usage 1 92 bcm objectives respectively to give an average efficiency of 84 100 100 52 3 table s2 the selected algorithms exhibited a range of achievements of the hydrologic objectives as illustrated in fig 5 where efficiencies of profit yield and water consumption are represented by p eff y eff and w eff respectively as opposed to moga mopso and mocs presented mildly enhanced environmental competence water utilisation alongside socio economic efficiencies which are more comparable to conventional statistics table s2 fig 5 the mopso and mocs allocations were projected to utilise around 58 lesser water than the conventional distributions while moga provided only a 5 alleviation in this objective the healthy growth of crops has necessitated steadily rising supplies of irrigation water owing to plummeting groundwater tables diminishing soil moisture and increasingly inconsistent rainfall patterns yang et al 2020 this bolstered water requirement poses an unsustainable ecological burden in addition to being an obvious financial liability for farmers esteve et al 2015 additionally when agricultural yields increase there tends to be a proportional escalation in irrigation demands as reflected in table 2a it is observed that a cash crop like cotton requires 7800 cum per hectare to proffer a high yield of 2960 kg per hectare feike et al 2017 as opposed to cereals like bengal gram that consumes 4367 cubic metres of water to produce a 750 kg yield khorsand et al 2021 as illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 a distinct difference has been noted in distribution patterns and efficiencies of the algorithms as compared to conventional land allocation although all three intelligences were run on an initial population that reflected equal allocation of available lands amongst the selected crops moga produced higher profit and yield which were given more weightage based on profits and yield and comparison with conventional land allocation moga algorithm represents a feasible optimisation strategy for agricultural land allocation in the context of a practical agricultural decision making framework it is ideal to utilise a model that is capable of producing consistently efficient results without expecting local authorities to curate a mathematically viable embryonic population for each implementation this technical analysis indicates the scope for future work that interplays the properties of diversity and convergence in a hydro agronomic framework by interspersing mopso and moga successively and iteratively 4 conclusions and recommendations the study proposes a simple yet robust hydro economic dsf to the local conservationists and practitioners to optimize agricultural land allocation for diversified cropping while establishing trade offs among socio economic hydro climatic agronomic and environmental objectives a consistent solution space is found to be hosting the results of moga runs resulting in markedly smaller standard deviations within the pareto fronts the superiority of moga over mopso and mocs guides the scientific community and governmental bodies towards selecting a suitable approach for ascertaining a crop allocation solution that allows for sustainable growth of agronomy while ensuring the gratification of all stakeholders the underlying framework can also be effectively deployed to analyse a range of agricultural scheme scenarios such as irrigation and support price policies that account for socio economic and environmental penalties the success of the proposed multi objective architecture warrants a move from the traditional farm level decision making to an adaptation of ecoregion level planning that accounts for socio economic hydro climatic agronomic and environmental objectives on both small and large agricultural landscapes it also guides the practitioners towards making a shift from mono cropping to diversified cropping practices to ensure minimal usage of fertilizer and water while enhancing soil quality these positive attributes would not only enhance farmer s income and crop yield but would also render environmental benefits to agricultural landscape this work strives to advance the domain of intelligent agricultural planning and adaptation in agriculture based rural economies like india such a reconfiguration of the land allocation to encourage a sustainable development strategy is crucial in the context of globalisation the simple and flexible nature of the proposed framework allows the agricultural departments in creating market infrastructure increase public private investments to strengthen usage of intelligent models for enhancing crop productivity and farmer s income while ensuring environmental benefits despite such benefits there are certain limitations associated with the framework such lack of in depth assessment of climate parameters absence of geo spatial representation of the results and inability of the dsf to deal with uncertainty associated with optimization model objective functions and constraints the framework can be strengthened further by including the impact of climate parameters such as evapotranspiration precipitation available sunshine hours solar radiation wind speed etc future researchers could introduce vagueness and fuzzy intervals into the proposed architecture to represent the salient uncertainty of the agronomic sphere additionally the integration of geographic information systems to the configuration would allow for a spatial representation of the allocations the optimisations could also be designed to interpret and analyse images of eco regions through deep learning to facilitate a spatio temporal expansion of the model ultimately the

9441,neoteric phenomena such as climate change scarce water availability and excessive fertilizer usage necessitate an augmentation of resource utilisation efficiencies in the agricultural sector there is a need to reorient the agroecosystems to curb stress on environmental resources while meeting rising socio economic objectives under changing hydro climatic conditions considering this optimal land allocation for diversified agriculture is essential we propose a combinatorial optimisation approach for land allocation considering agronomic socio economic environmental and hydro climatic objectives using bio inspired optimization algorithms the stochastic approach tackles the problem of optimal agricultural land allocation for crops in a multidimensional context by simultaneously addressing the conflicting goals of farm level risk management as well as district level contingency planning the efficiencies and sensitivity of the proposed framework are assessed through a case study of the dharwad district in karnataka india using the data water and fertilizer consumption and cost crop type cultivable land man and machine hours etc from the year 2019 2020 results indicate that multi objective genetic algorithm moga is more capable of optimising agricultural resources management by suggesting optimal land allocation for diversified crop planning although cuckoo search cs and particle search optimisation pso also produced productive pareto fronts they were observed to be less effective than moga the annual increase in profits and crop yield obtained using moga are 103 and 97 respectively while water usage is reduced by 5 compared to the conventional routines in dharwad the proposed hydro agronomic decision support framework dsf can be

climate change mitigation enhancing crop production and farmers income minimizing environmental pollution and preserving biodiversity manimozhi and gayathri 2012 popp et al 2014 laborde et al 2021 intensified agricultural development to ensure global food security has led to several major problems in the form of greenhouse gases land degradation over application of fertilizers erosion water contamination and loss of genetic diversity kopittke et al 2019 presently the predominant response to the rising food demands has been the mono cropping of risk free crops in many developing countries of asia south america and africa deep et al 2018 thilagavathi and amudha 2019 zhongming et al 2019 according to food and agricultural organization bélanger and pilling 2019 biodiverse agricultural landscapes of many developing countries are being replaced by huge areas of monoculture farmed using extensive pesticides mineral fertilizers and fossil fuels over the past two decades proper management of resources essential to agronomic sustainability like availability of land water labor machinery and capital is lacking due to monocropping climate change industrialization of farmlands farm pollution and insufficient knowledge transfer to farmers resulting in non optimal usage of water and fertilizer annepu et al 2012 laborde et al 2021 semi arid regions in particular tend to be markedly more susceptible to these challenges the complex interactions among biophysical processes and economics have substantially impeded effective decision making primarily agricultural land allocation in developing countries esteve et al 2015 sustainable land management through an optimal agricultural land allocation will help address these challenges which is a multidimensional planning problem characterized by the conflicting goals of ecological adaptation hydro environmental and socio economic suitability srivastava and singh 2017 liang et al 2019 xie et al 2020 such land use optimization warrants shifting from traditional individualistic planning to a more collaborative multi scalar framework of diversified cropping design fikry et al 2021 advantages of optimal agricultural land use planning include a crop sequencing and allocation to maximize farmers income while satisfying objectives concerning enhancing biodiversity and preserving soil quality capitanescu

it needs socio economic and environmental development strategies to examine multi cropping in agronomic and hydroclimatic contexts esteve et al 2015 gallardo et al 2020 mathematical frameworks have been the primary solution to agricultural land use optimization srinivas et al 2020 over the past decade simulation systems that model various dimensions ranging from land distribution changes and their effects were developed diogo et al 2015 dang and kawasaki 2017 these models economic theory based explanatory model system dynamics and geographic information system gis models ptmapp acpf epic apex etc are essential to understanding the cause effect relationships among biophysical parameters land use decisions and hydro economic repercussions most of these models assume the maximum productivity of agricultural production systems arciniegas et al 2011 chakir and gallo 2013 spatial models montgomery et al 2016 sharma et al 2018a render agricultural planning on a topological scale using geographic information systems gis and remote sensing these algorithms use big spatial data for agricultural decision making this variant of mathematical modeling allows decision makers to leverage mappings of parameters like supply chains and irrigation systems however most of the previous models mentioned above have not simultaneously optimized agronomic socio economic environmental and hydro climatic objectives and thus underrated farmers and local practitioners response towards hydro climatic changes cochrane et al 2019 srinivas et al 2020 over the recent years artificial and swarm intelligence santé riveira et al 2008 zhao 2010 wang et al 2012 liu et al 2013 have been extensively applied to land allocation optimization the applicability of these models has been found to be restricted to small scale agricultural watersheds the algorithms used by these models are heuristic solutions that provide decision makers with solution sets and contextual knowledge about the solution space however the salient structure of classic intelligent modeling restricts the user to optimization of a singular objective the most popular variant of optimization algorithms applied to land use has consistently been programming models mosleh et al 2017 sharma et al 2018b ren et al 2019 modifying characteristics such as linearity and the number of objectives of these techniques allows for the quantitative redistribution of land use at multiple scales and dimensions zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2015b multi objective intelligent systems deploy artificial intelligence ai principles and programming models to provide a solution geared towards combinatorial optimization problems srivastava and singh 2017 this category of mathematical models has been gaining traction since the introduction of multi objective particle swarm optimization two decades ago coello and lechuga 2002 particle swarm optimisation mopso cuckoo search mocs and genetic algorithms moga have emerged as some of the cutting edge candidates for multi objective adaptations elsoragaby et al 2020 chen et al 2021 mopso and moga have been deployed successfully to solve problems such as commercial land allocation that present decision makers with less dimensionality than agricultural planning safarzadeh et al 2018 song and chen 2018 multi objective particle swarm optimization models have also proven to lend environmentally sustainable solutions to processes in the agricultural supply chain barak et al 2015 lee et al 2017 hajikhani et al 2018 mopso and mocs have also been applied successfully to the hydro economic facet of agriculture to optimise power as well as water usage hatamkhani and moridi 2019 rezaei and safavi 2020 limited studies have framed the agricultural land allocation problem as a combinatorial optimization problem that accounts for inherent uncertainties and conflicting goals bio inspired mathematical methods like intelligent and swarm algorithms which have long been recognised as the robust solution to combinatorial optimisations have not been used to heuristically address the issues discussed here past works also fail to address diversified land allocation for crops in all dimensions and agricultural landscapes of different sizes lin and li 2019 muñoz and park 2019 also the farm level socio economic demands constrained by biophysical processes and topological relationships that warrant district level planning are often neglected aerts et al 2003 shi et al 2014 the current study proposes a decision support framework dsf using multi objective bio inspired and ai algorithms mopso mocs moga for diversified land allocation allowing for a novel and detailed district level land allocation at agronomic landscapes of different sizes in the dharwad district of karnataka india these models delineate a comprehensive and logical system that represents farm level economic issues while addressing the district s agronomic socio economic environmental and hydro climatic objectives the pareto fronts of multi modal solutions resulting from these frameworks are conducive to optimization under complex objectives and constraints these heuristic solutions allow for practical decision making in conjunction with problem specific knowledge this perspective also highlights the irrigation policies and farming management required to encourage environmentally conscious agronomic productivity the aims of the study are as follows 1 diversified land allocation for crops as an agronomic combinatorial optimisation problem that represents the economic interests of farmers while reckoning with conflicting ecological concerns and societal uncertainties using bio inspired and artificial intelligence models 2 comparison with conventional land allocation statsitics and benchmarking of the efficacy of bio inspired methods mopso mocs moga in the agricultural landscapes of different sizes farm and district level 3 proposing hydro agronomic decision support framework dsf using the best optimization approach for agricultural management to guide practitioners on diversified agronomic management in different cropping seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydro agronomic framework as previously established current global circumstances strongly warrant a shift from farm based agricultural research to land allocation strategies on an ecological scale in this study we administered multi objective intelligent optimization algorithms to a case study in india to develop a decision support framework dsf that can guide the practitioners towards making decisions in optimal land allocation for crops in different seasons therefore the designed dsf was to determine an optimal agricultural land usage at a district level that simultaneously addresses the agronomic socio economic hydro climatic and environmental objectives of agribusiness within realistic resource constraints the methodology compares the roubustness of three algorithms namely mopso moga and mocs towards optimization of yield profit and water availability the deployed algorithms were constructed and implemented in matlab version 2020b using open source frameworks for multi objective optimizations victor 2021 yang 2021 fig 1 represents the entire dsf developed in the study data has been procured from karnataka department of agriculture india ksda 2020 and university of agricultural science bengaluru dharwad 2020 the region specific data collected for the case study was mathematically analysed to determine the coefficients and solutions of the objective functions of the algorithms the framework has been modeled to ultimately provide a practitioner with the seasonal optimal distribution of available land for different crop options at a farm and district level hence the paradigm of sustainable land allocation for crops has been defined as being populated by crop type season and area of land allocated to a particular crop as described below c crop type 1 2 3 7 s season kharif k rabi r or zaid z season in india x area of land allotted to c during s from a societal perspective the pressing priority is the augmentation of crop production to keep abreast of global demands and combat food insecurity on the other hand economic demands justify the optimisation of farmers net profits the environmental impacts of agriculture can be represented by a multitude of factors such as fertilizer and pesticide runoffs carbon footprints and mono cropping hydro climatic criterion primarily focus on minimisation of water consumption under different cropping seasons agriculture overview 2020 therefore the formulated hydro economic model delineates three independent objectives for optimizing land allocation these objectives are farm level profits district level yields and water usage the premise of mathematical optimization necessitates the collation of the requirements of the solution set with the resource availability of the problem space in the current context of agriculture only resources that are affected by controllable supply are taken into account for example water requirements will be the amount of water required by a crop under the district s climatic conditions the final set of features identified as essential to the sector s interpretation are given in table 1 the three selected objectives were subsequently analyzed to characterize them within the multi dimensionality of hydro agronomics eqs 1 3 1 z profit w 1 c s x d sp p cp 2 z yield w 2 c s x p 3 z water w 3 c s x w where the meanings of parameters in the above equations are given in table 1 w i i 1 2 3 weightage given to each objective function based on preferences of local practitioners and conservationists of study area w 1 0 40 w 2 0 40 w 3 0 20 the framework is completed by designating a quartet of constraints eqs 4 6 that anchor the solution sets to practical viability these equations limit the total usage of land l labour rmd and water w to the quantities available in the selected study area an additional condition also ensures the feasibility of the results by having cropping areas greater than the average land holdings in the region the constraint variables are explained in table 1 4 c x l x average land holdings 5 c s x rmd md 6 c x rw w the entire framework fig 1 has been implemented in the design and deployment of the three selected intelligence algorithms these algorithms mopso mops and moga have been described briefly in the subsequent sections 2 2 demand factor in profit calculation it is important to note that a more categorical calculation of profit as x sp p cp assumes that the entire yield suggested by these methods would be sold the crop demands of the study area is a mix of different crops basavaraj et al 2019 mafw 2017 if a farmer aims to sell huge amounts of a singular crop they would not be able to satisfy the market demand and would incur huge losses therefore any solution that suggests a pivot into the production of a singular crop owing to high yields and selling price such as onion would set off a fluctuation of the market economics basavaraj et al 2019 that forms the basis of the optimisation widespread and persistent cultivation of a singular crop would also lead to a depreciation of soil quality lemaire et al 2015 tamburini et al 2020 the profit calculation presupposes that the accessible selling prices sp input by decision makers into this framework will be reflective of the market of the region over the recent seasons this cost will therefore be heavily dependent on the consumer demand for the produce in question furthermore this demand for major crops has remained fairly consistent over the past decade of agricultural statistics basavaraj et al 2019 mafw 2017 thus we introduce a demand factor d into the calculation of profit as a fraction reflective of the actual observed conventional land allocation strategies of the study area this ensures a diversified land allocation for crops that is not only environmentally sustainable but also guarantees higher profits to the farmers 2 3 multi objective particle swarm optimisation mopso this approach searches multi dimensional spaces by imitating the flying patterns of flocks of birds lin et al 2018 after a random initialisation the flock of particles is allowed to fly through the problem space based on its cohesion separation and alignment the modulations of behaviours of individuals in the swarms are affected by the best global individual selected based on performance measures these leaders chosen by each individual marshal the search by segregating the search space into hypercubes after every iteration the individuals are assigned a velocity c based on leader positioning l and best historical individual positioning i eqs 7 9 are used in this model at any time 7 c xy t 1 k c xy t m 1 n 1 i t p t m 2 n 2 l t p t where c xy denotes the velocity of the x th member of the y th particle m 1 m 2 4 and 0 m 1 m 2 4 and 0 n 1 n 2 1 k is an inertia weight factor bounded by its limits this velocity is used to update the position of the flocks p at every iteration 8 p t 1 p t c t 1 the convergence of this simulation is accelerated as compared to traditional evolutionary solutions by introducing a flying potential f 9 c xy t 1 f k c xy t m 1 n 1 i t p t m 2 n 2 l t p t this algorithm also confers an essence of memory to its populations and allows individuals to enhance themselves from past encounters particle swarms are highly conducive to multi objective adaptations due to brisk convergence this remodelling is executed through a global repository that stores the learnings of each flight in the form of individual objective functions in the present context mopso treats different land allocation solutions as particles moving in the problem space the initial population of these solutions is defined as an equal division of land amongst the selected crops successively a population of 500 solutions are created such that the different positions determine objective values of profits water consumption and yield the designated velocity and inertial values of 5 and 0 4 respectively are abstract parameters that determine the rate of creation and mutation of solution towards minimisation of the objective functions 2 4 multi objective cuckoo search mocs cuckoo search is an algorithm that adapts the aggressive parasitic reproduction strategies of the cuckoo bird to exhibit high efficiency in handling multimodal nonlinearity chen et al 2021 this species has been observed to lay their eggs in the nests of other host birds that are predisposed to then discard the alien eggs or relinquish the nest as a whole analogously a mocs algorithm with n objectives is characterized by cuckoos that randomly choose host nests for their n eggs that represent solutions for the various objectives this randomisation is handled by a lévy flight eq 10 13 10 s x t 1 s x t k l é vy a where s x t represents the solutions eggs of cuckoo i at a time t the scalarity of the problem is handled by the step size k with a constant k 0 11 k k 0 s x t s y t after incorporation of the random walk algorithm in the form of lévy flight the generations are created as 12 s x t 1 0 01 x i j 1 a s x t s y t here i and j are drawn from normal distributions 13 i n 0 σ i 2 j n 0 σ j 2 finally a p represents the probability of a parasitic egg being discovered and abandoned followed by the building of a new nest with n eggs this process is akin to the crossover element of evolutionary algorithms that diversifies and accelerates the search mocs is adapted to the land allocation problem such that every nested egg is a crop distribution solution inefficient solutions are identified by calculating the objective functions and replaced by potentially healthier allocations the availability of nests depicts the population size of 500 over a thousand iterations 2 5 multi objective genetic algorithm moga genetic algorithms are a bio inspired heuristic search that emulates the evolutionary process of natural selection elsoragaby et al 2020 these algorithms are designed to iteratively engender successive generations of populations from which the fittest individuals are selected to create offspring solutions eqs 14 16 are used in this model for a problem space with n objectives this scalar fitness function g is constructed from a weighted sum of objective functions 14 g s x 1 n k x g x s where s refers to a selection generation of solutions in order to diversify populations and randomise the direction of search these weights k are not defined as constant for each selection 15 k x random x x 1 n random x at every generation of the evolution pairs of individuals are randomly selected with a probability p for a crossover process to generate new strings as 16 p s g s g min σ g s g min this crossover is followed up with additional diversification through mutations furthermore elitism of the population is preserved by selecting an intermittent optimal front these generations are terminated as defined by a predesignated stopping condition to produce a final pareto front the populations of individuals created and mutated in this algorithm are analogous to land allocation solutions the fitness of these solutions is evaluated based on values of the defined objective functions up to 500 solutions are iterated through a thousand times with a crossover function of 0 8 2 6 case study the selected region of dharwad district fig 2 in karnataka exemplifies the vulnerabilities as well as potential inherent to agronomic decision making in india this district is nestled amongst hills east of the western ghats at an average altitude of 768 m above sea level dharwad lies between the latitudes of 15º 15 to 15º 35 n and 75º 00 to 75º 20 e longitudes effectively occupying the north interior meteorological zone of the south east asian plateau it hosts a population of 1 8 million with around 180 thousand agriculturists the national agricultural research project of india classifies the region as being in the north transition zone in its agro climatic stratifications this sub region experiences a hot dry and subhumid climate and receives around 786 mm of annual rainfall from the southwest and northeast monsoons characteristic of the indian subcontinent being a predominantly agrarian economy around 262 square kilometres of the area that spans over 426 square kilometres tends to be employed for cropping the black and loamy soils prevalent in this topography further facilitate these agricultural activities more than half of the region is irrigated by means of canals 63 while wells open and bore wells tube wells tanks and lift irrigation make up a minority of the hydrologic sources pmksy 2016 the principal contingencies of this agricultural ecosystem are prone to droughts floods pests and diseases dharwad produces a large variety of crops including cereals horticultural strains medicinal plants and plantation crops seven major crops have been selected across these categories to facilitate the current study the agricultural seasons in dharwad are kharif april to september followed by rabi october and december and zaid january to march some of the important commercial and cereal kharif crops are cotton groundnut soybean blackgram jowar green gram and maize chilli and onion are grown later in the kharif period bengal gram wheat and jowar tend to be grown on residual soil moisture during the rabi season mango sapota guava and banana constitute the popular horticultural crops native to the region while peas brinjal tomato green chilli etc are the major vegetables the current case study utilised a set of seven crops distributed across planting seasons and crop types bengal gram chilli cotton groundnut jowar onion and wheat datasets namely resource availability and crop requirements table 2 were procured from the university of agricultural sciences bengaluru in india dharwad 2020 and karnataka department of agriculture india ksda 2020 and were used to calculate the coefficients of the objective functions and constraints eqs 1 3 the objective functions and constraint equations of the models were calibrated with coefficients calculated from resource availabilities and crop requirements table s1 represents the coefficients obtained using calibration procedure for instance collected data table 2a reflects that chillies tend to yield around 4465 kg of produce at a cultivational cost of 51 750 inr per hectare during kharif season in dharwad subsequently a farmer in this region can sell every kilogram of this produce for 35 inr the demand factor for this crop is set at 0 36 reflecting the 36 land allocation attributed to it in the current landscape according to eq 1 the profit accrued by a farmer choosing to cultivate chillies over x hectares of land would be 5134 x inr 446 5 0 36 35 51750 x correspondingly replacing the production rate p selling price sp demand factor d and cultivation costs cp of the selected 7 crops over two seasons before summing up the individual profits produces an objective function with variables representing the land allocated to each crop similar calibration was also undertaken for eqs 2 3 to obtain objective functions f1 f2 f3 as given in equations s1 s3 for brevity more details on calibration are given in section s1 of the supplementary material the selected intelligent algorithms were subsequently run on these objective functions to distribute the agricultural land for optimal profits yield and water usage the constraints of resource availability in dharwad were introduced in the form of penalty factors added to the objectives table 2b each algorithm has been run 10 times with the same initial population before calculating the average efficiencies across objectives of the solutions in the pareto front produced by each model for implementation of each algorithm the solution set with the highest efficiency score was taken as the representation of the solution set for comparison 3 results and discussion the chosen objectives concerning profit maximization water usage minimization and yield maximization contradict each other annepu et al 2012 considering this a hydro agronomic dsf of intelligent multi objective land allocation in the dharwad district has been developed the three algorithms mocs moga and mopso have been run on the objective functions eqs 1 3 and constraints eqs 4 6 the coefficients of the objective functions and the constraint equations have been obtained using the datasets resource availability and crop requirement mentioned in tables 2a 2b this process of calibration has already been explained in the section 2 5 and s1 supplementary material the simulated results are dispensed for four selected variables land distribution agricultural yields water requirements and farmer s income these variables manifest the multitude of socio economic and environmental risks that beset hydro agronomics on agricultural landscapes of different sizes farm and district level after running each algorithm mopso mocs and moga over 10 iterations the solution with the highest average efficiency across the triad of objectives has been selected as representative of the method the results exhibit significant differences particularly in the optimal land allocation for crops suggested by three algorithms 3 1 comparison of pareto fronts obtained using three algorithms as multi objective algorithms each iteration of these optimizations produced a set of non dominated solutions that make up a pareto front as illustrated in fig 3 the visualization of these solution sets for the selected optimizations reflects the convergence rates of the different intelligences as expected from salient diversity mopso fig 3c consistently presented more widely dispersed results as compared to moga fig 3a furthermore both these methods reflected a more traditional inverted triangle front as compared to mocs fig 3b that rapidly converged to a rectilinear set of solutions this phenomenon can be explained by the alignment of search directions of these algorithms parallel to the objective axes zidan et al 2018 it is also instructive to analyse the technical contrast in solutions pareto fronts produced by mopso moga and mocs algorithms the differences in mopso can be widely attributed to the memory salient to particle swarm optimization jiao and xu 2016 zidan et al 2018 this property implies that the velocity of the individuals in each iteration of mopso is controlled by their individual autobiography and correlative orientation in the population conversely genetic algorithms and cuckoo searches tend to engender successive generations from prevailing old solutions owing to the alignment of search directions of these algorithms parallel to the objective axes these technical disparities allow these algorithms to produce different degrees of diverse solutions even in the absence of a variegated seeding population although all three algorithms produce diverse solution sets mopso produces comparatively more diverse solutions fig 3 as mocs and moga tries to converge to more efficient solutions quickly the initial population distribution also proves to be more influential to algorithms like moga and mocs that can converge on local optima if initiated by a non diversified solution huang and safranek 2014 kumar and yadav 2022 mopso can carry out the search by the while developing several generations only the most optimist particle can transmit information onto the other particles and the searching speed is comparatively faster than mocs and moga jiao et al 2016 zidan et al 2018 the elements of moga and mocs undergo very large number of mutations causing a considerable increase in the search kumar and yadav 2022 moga and mocs generally converge towards a local optimum or even arbitrary points rather than the global optimum while mopso tries to find the global optima civicioglu and besdok 2013 3 2 optimal land allocation proposed by hydro agronomic dsf the results of optimal land distribution for the selected seven crops considering socio economic agronomic hydro climatic and environmental factors have been illustrated in table 3 the best non dominated solutions from each pareto front have been chosen to represent each algorithm for two simulation scenarios the two scenarios portray a small farm and large district availability of land for agricultural distribution by running the algorithms for the entire landscape of dharwad table 3a as well as over just the currently available agricultural area table 3b the results of the three algorithms have also been compared to the conventional land allocation for the seven crops fig 4 the conventional land allocation represents the overall land allocation practiced in the study area for past one decade depending on the market demand there is a conspicuous difference in the distribution of crops recommended by mocs and moga as compared to mopso and conventional land allocation for illustration for the larger landscape in kharif season moga allocates 12051 ha and 39848 ha land for the cultivation of bengal gram and jowar respectively table 3a and fig 4a on the other hand in kharif season mopso allocates 175 ha and 24085 ha of land for the cultivation of bengal gram and jowar respectively the same numbers for mocs are 7806 ha and 9207 ha respectively in the kharif season as compared to the conventional land allocation in rabi season for these crops moga has minimum deviation of 36 and 47 for bengal gram and jowar respectively table 3a in contrast mopso 98 69 and mocs 59 88 exhibit large deviations with conventionally followed apportionments for bengal gram and jowar it can be noted that the moga follows this thumb rule of equitable crop distributions to maximize the profits and yields while having minimum deviation from conventional allocations cao et al 2011 the socio economic pretexts and hydro ecological implications of these results have further been discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 3 socio economic impact on crops from table 4 and fig 5 it is observed that mocs 0 64 billion usd and mopso 0 71 billion usd lend themselves to the lower proficiency with respect to profits and yield in the larger landscape while moga achieved highest profit of 1 24 billion usd table 4a at the farm level table 4b mocs was projected to achieve a profit of 0 38 billion usd table 4b effectively halving the economic income of farmers as compared to conventional allocations the net crop yields in the cuckoo search optimization were calculated to be around 1 98 billion kgs making the distribution half as socially efficient as conventional practices mopso also presented the problem space with low socio economic proficiency with profits of 0 37 billion usd on a yield of 2 07 billion kgs on the other hand genetic algorithms moga produced results with 97 increase in yield 1 25 billion usd from conventional statistics and a 103 6 23 billion kgs rise in profits in addition to crop yields required to meet demands the social construct of agricultural allocations is profoundly impacted by the total land utilization of the sector in this regard the genetic algorithm was observed to exhibit the highest land utilisation of almost 100 303 597 ha of currently cultivated topography basavaraj et al 2019 mafw 2017 the solutions produced by mopso 136 043 ha and mocs 129 688 ha achieved hydro agronomic productivity with only around half of the available landscape table 3 we have already explained why the three algorithms exhibit variation in their results in the previous section 3 1 the hydro economic dsf simultaneously optimizes yield profit and water usage here water usage is considered from an environmental perspective even though models remain well within the boundary condition the study aims to offer a land allocation strategy to the farmers which requires minimum water usage to optimize agricultural practices from an environmental perspective table 4b indicates that for the smaller landscape water usage is 0 68 and 0 70 bcm using mocs and mopso algorithms respectively when moga is used to reap higher profits and yield this water usage is 1 55 bcm although results indicate that water utilization is comparatively more in case of moga still moga is considered superior because water usage has been given lesser weightage in the optimization eqs 1 3 secondly by suggesting a land allocation for diversified crops similar to conventional land use moga ensures better utilization of soil moisture and minerals this would improve soil quality and consequently the crops would require lesser water yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 performed a detailed analysis of 31 different field crop rotations and showed that diversified crop rotations enhance groundwater and could be an effective strategy for sustainable food production in water stressed agricultural regions bhogal and vatta 2021 recommended crop diversification to address the water stress situation in punjab india agricultural watersheds by conservation of groundwater reducing evapotranspiration revitalisation of soil leading to improved productivity minimization of fertilizers and pesticides and efficient use of resources 3 4 effect of land allocation on hydro economics benchmarking of solutions has been carried out in two steps by means of efficiency scores this metric was first used to select the best performing solutions from each pareto front produced by each algorithm and then to compare the results of the different algorithms table s2 supplementary section shows the efficiency scores obtained for all three algorithms this efficiency score collates the extent of the percentile achievement of the three objectives by different solution sets for example in table 4a moga produces the highest profit for larger landscape 1 25 billion usd and is attributed a p eff of 100 here the mopso solution incurs only 57 of the moga profits and therefore has a p eff of 57 similarly for larger landscape table 4a moga scores efficiencies of 100 and 52 on the yield 9 64 billion kg and water usage 1 92 bcm objectives respectively to give an average efficiency of 84 100 100 52 3 table s2 the selected algorithms exhibited a range of achievements of the hydrologic objectives as illustrated in fig 5 where efficiencies of profit yield and water consumption are represented by p eff y eff and w eff respectively as opposed to moga mopso and mocs presented mildly enhanced environmental competence water utilisation alongside socio economic efficiencies which are more comparable to conventional statistics table s2 fig 5 the mopso and mocs allocations were projected to utilise around 58 lesser water than the conventional distributions while moga provided only a 5 alleviation in this objective the healthy growth of crops has necessitated steadily rising supplies of irrigation water owing to plummeting groundwater tables diminishing soil moisture and increasingly inconsistent rainfall patterns yang et al 2020 this bolstered water requirement poses an unsustainable ecological burden in addition to being an obvious financial liability for farmers esteve et al 2015 additionally when agricultural yields increase there tends to be a proportional escalation in irrigation demands as reflected in table 2a it is observed that a cash crop like cotton requires 7800 cum per hectare to proffer a high yield of 2960 kg per hectare feike et al 2017 as opposed to cereals like bengal gram that consumes 4367 cubic metres of water to produce a 750 kg yield khorsand et al 2021 as illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 a distinct difference has been noted in distribution patterns and efficiencies of the algorithms as compared to conventional land allocation although all three intelligences were run on an initial population that reflected equal allocation of available lands amongst the selected crops moga produced higher profit and yield which were given more weightage based on profits and yield and comparison with conventional land allocation moga algorithm represents a feasible optimisation strategy for agricultural land allocation in the context of a practical agricultural decision making framework it is ideal to utilise a model that is capable of producing consistently efficient results without expecting local authorities to curate a mathematically viable embryonic population for each implementation this technical analysis indicates the scope for future work that interplays the properties of diversity and convergence in a hydro agronomic framework by interspersing mopso and moga successively and iteratively 4 conclusions and recommendations the study proposes a simple yet robust hydro economic dsf to the local conservationists and practitioners to optimize agricultural land allocation for diversified cropping while establishing trade offs among socio economic hydro climatic agronomic and environmental objectives a consistent solution space is found to be hosting the results of moga runs resulting in markedly smaller standard deviations within the pareto fronts the superiority of moga over mopso and mocs guides the scientific community and governmental bodies towards selecting a suitable approach for ascertaining a crop allocation solution that allows for sustainable growth of agronomy while ensuring the gratification of all stakeholders the underlying framework can also be effectively deployed to analyse a range of agricultural scheme scenarios such as irrigation and support price policies that account for socio economic and environmental penalties the success of the proposed multi objective architecture warrants a move from the traditional farm level decision making to an adaptation of ecoregion level planning that accounts for socio economic hydro climatic agronomic and environmental objectives on both small and large agricultural landscapes it also guides the practitioners towards making a shift from mono cropping to diversified cropping practices to ensure minimal usage of fertilizer and water while enhancing soil quality these positive attributes would not only enhance farmer s income and crop yield but would also render environmental benefits to agricultural landscape this work strives to advance the domain of intelligent agricultural planning and adaptation in agriculture based rural economies like india such a reconfiguration of the land allocation to encourage a sustainable development strategy is crucial in the context of globalisation the simple and flexible nature of the proposed framework allows the agricultural departments in creating market infrastructure increase public private investments to strengthen usage of intelligent models for enhancing crop productivity and farmer s income while ensuring environmental benefits despite such benefits there are certain limitations associated with the framework such lack of in depth assessment of climate parameters absence of geo spatial representation of the results and inability of the dsf to deal with uncertainty associated with optimization model objective functions and constraints the framework can be strengthened further by including the impact of climate parameters such as evapotranspiration precipitation available sunshine hours solar radiation wind speed etc future researchers could introduce vagueness and fuzzy intervals into the proposed architecture to represent the salient uncertainty of the agronomic sphere additionally the integration of geographic information systems to the configuration would allow for a spatial representation of the allocations the optimisations could also be designed to interpret and analyse images of eco regions through deep learning to facilitate a spatio temporal expansion of the model ultimately the

9442,snow and glaciers provide water to the densely populated downstream area of the tarim river basin which is an important irrigated agricultural area in china cotton is an important cash crop and meltwater is an important irrigation water source for cotton in this region in this study the spatiotemporal dependence of cotton yield on mountain meltwater resources in the subbasins of the tarim river basin was quantified by the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model with the degree day and cropr models during 1960 2017 the results showed that the changes in meltwater in all subbasins had a significantly increasing trend meltwater contributions to cotton irrigation and yield varied spatiotemporally along the area south of the tian shan mountains the meltwater contribution to irrigation showed a decreasing trend from west to east and the highest contribution of meltwater to cotton yield occurred in the weigan river basin followed by the aksu river basin and kaidu river basin along the northern karakoram mountains the meltwater contributions to cotton irrigation and yield first decreased and then increased from west to east in the whole basin 48 6 of total irrigation withdrawals originated from mountain snow and glacial meltwater and contributed an additional 55 9 to total cotton production during the study period the results provide important agricultural information for locations where shifts in water availability and demand are projected as a result of socioeconomic growth keywords meltwater irrigation cotton yield contribution tarim river basin 1 introduction water resources are extremely important for arid and semiarid regions in central asia due to its dry climate precipitation deficit and strong evaporation li et al 2013 maingi and marsh 2002 xu et al 2018 here an expanding population and the construction of reservoirs along the middle and lower reaches of river systems have increased the demand for water in densely populated urban areas hu et al 2021 li et al 2020b ruan et al 2020 zuo et al 2015 in addition with the rapid development of urbanization water pollution and deterioration of the water environment water scarcity has become increasingly serious the availability of water resources has direct influences on sustainable development chen et al 2009 hao et al 2007 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and issues related to water resources have garnered considerable attention in central asia li et al 2017 2015 yu et al 2003 central asian mountains hold one of the greatest concentrations of perennial snow and glaciers in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere aizen et al 2007 these water resources are of prominent importance for the population industry agriculture and natural vegetation where the only significant water supply occurs via streams from the surrounding mountain regions feng et al 2001 leiwen et al 2005 studies have shown that glacier and snow meltwater accounts for a considerable proportion of the total runoff in rivers the contributions to the total runoff from glacial snowmelt were 41 5 49 1 and 70 5 in the whole tarim river basin trb toxkan river and kunma like river respectively gao et al 2010 li et al 2020c zhao et al 2012 these meltwaters modulate the seasonal variation in river runoff cotton is an economically important crop in the trb and its total planting area encompasses more than 70 of the land due to its high economic value planting areas for cotton have increased dramatically saline land is the main land type in the increased planting area this increase in planting area inevitably leads to an increase in irrigation and saline alkaline soil amelioration consumes a large amount of water snow and glacier meltwater is important for cotton production because a constant supply of water for downstream irrigation results from the unique interplay between snow and glacial melt and rainfall concentrations in the spring summer and autumn biemans et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 however global warming has resulted in the recession of glaciers and reductions in glacial areas many studies have suggested that glacial areas in this region have decreased by more than 10 since the 1970 s aizen et al 2007 narama et al 2010 the recession of glaciers and reductions in glacial areas will provide more water for cotton plantations over the short term these changes benefit cotton planting however with the further recession of glaciers and reductions in glacial areas the amount of water available will drop off sharply these changes are serious threats to cotton productivity recent research has focused on the changing trends of meltwater precipitation and runoff duethmann et al 2015 ling et al 2013 2014 shen et al 2018 xu et al 2019 hydrological process modeling using glacio hydrological models hartmann et al 2016 li et al 2020c zhao et al 2012 water saving irrigation patterns chen et al 2019 2020 yang et al 2014b yu et al 2017a and the reformation of soil salinization in cultivated land wang et al 2021a 2021b less attention has been placed on the impacts of snow and glacial meltwater on cotton yields investigating and assessing the influence of snow and glacial meltwater on cotton yields can aid in regional water resource management and the adjustment of cotton planting areas and irrigation methods the linkage between snow and glacial meltwater and cotton yields needs to be clarified in this study the variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrologic model vic was used with degree day and cropr models to assess the spatial and intra annual variations in glacier and snow meltwater contributions to irrigation for the entire trb subsequently we quantified the dependence of downstream cotton production on snow and glacial meltwater from the mountains 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the trb is located in southern xinjiang in western china 34 45 n 73 97 e with a total area of approximately 1 02 106 km2 fig 1 this area is surrounded by the tianshan eastern pamir kunlun and karakorum mountains with elevations ranging from 156 8238 m xu et al 2019 the basin contains 144 rivers in eight river basins including aksu kaxkar yarkant weigan keriya qarqan hotan and kaidu fig 1 b precipitation is greater than 300 mm in the mountainous regions and below 50 mm in the lower basin more than 54 of precipitation occurs in june july and august the temperature ranges from 35 c in winter to 40 c in summer and the average air temperature is 7 6 c which has accelerated the regional drought situation in recent years tao et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 water resources in the basin are mainly generated by rainfall and glacier snow meltwater in mountainous regions gao et al 2010 the study area is an important irrigated agricultural area with high soil salinity and low irrigation availability as a drought tolerant crop cotton is suitable for growing in this region and its planting area has gradually increased 2 2 datasets in this paper daily climate data from 16 meteorological stations collected across the trb during the period of 1960 2017 were gathered from the china meteorological

fig 11 the average contribution of meltwater to cotton yields in the whole basin was 55 9 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of simulations of meltwater under climate warming the simulation of snow and glacier meltwater can provide basic information for regional water resource management for snow and glacier melt modeling the temperature index model has been widely used gao et al 2021 2012a zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 many studies have shown that the temperature index model is sufficient to simulate the daily variations in snow and glacier melting gao et al 2017 hock 2016 huss and hock 2018 in this study the vic model with a degree day model was used to assess meltwater runoff and total runoff the nse was 0 641 0 94 the rmse was 4 766 25 438 and the r2 was 0 81 0 97 fig 3 the vic degree day model simulated runoff well in the trb 4 2 discrepancies in meltwater in subbasins glaciers are a sensitive barometer of climate change and they grow or shrink in response to changes in temperature previous studies have shown that under climate change the change in meltwater in the trb has a significantly increasing trend gao et al 2010 shen et al 2003 zhao et al 2012 the results obtained in the present study are consistent with previous studies at the interannual scale the changes in meltwater in all river subbasins had a significantly increasing trend fig 4 this trend may be attributed to significant changes in temperature temperature is the only variable used to calculate meltwater statistical analysis showed that the temperature had a significantly increased trend fig 12 rising temperatures are causing rapid glacier shrinkage increasing negative glacier mass balances and meltwater li et al 2008 wei et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 the rate of increase in meltwater varied and the rates of change ranged from 0 02 mm 10a 1 to 1 7 mm 10a 1 fig 4 this may be because the temperatures were different among the subbasins fig 12 in addition the degree day factor was one of the main parameters used to calculate meltwater and the value of the degree day factor has large spatial variability gao et al 2010 previous studies have shown that the degree day factors of glacier and snow were from 2 2 to 13 0 mm d 1 1 and from 0 6 to 7 5 mm d 1 1 respectively in the study area gao et al 2010 zhang et al 2005 zhao et al 2020 and were affected by temperature altitude slope direction surface moraine condition and glacier movement nuimura et al 2011 scherler et al 2011 singh et al 2000 at the seasonal scale meltwater has strong seasonality during a year fig 5a h the contributions of meltwater to runoff occurred from may to september figs 5 6 zhao et al 2012 and li et al 2020c showed that the contributions of meltwater to runoff mainly occurred from may to september this is because temperature has significant seasonal variation and when the temperature is above a certain value glaciers and snow begin to melt gao et al 2010 kan et al 2018b however the contributions of meltwater to the total runoff in different subbasins varied this is also affected by temperature precipitation the degree day factor and glacier area it is worth nothing that in the weigan river basin and kaidu river basin the contribution of meltwater to streamflow was less than that of precipitation fig 5d g 6d g deng et al 2015 also found that streamflow changes in the kaidu basin in summer are mainly attributed to changes in mountain precipitation this may be due to the smaller glacier area in these two subbasins 4 3 the effects of climate change on the contributions of meltwater to cotton yield meltwater is one of the main water sources for irrigation during cotton growth and is very important for the normal growth and yield formation of cotton in the trb previous studies have emphasized that meltwater is crucial for agricultural production or cotton production biemans et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 however the influence of meltwater on cotton yield in the trb has not yet been quantified the results in this study suggested that the regional average contribution of meltwater to cotton yield was 55 9 in the trb due to differences in temperature and precipitation the contributions of meltwater to cotton yield varied among the subbasins and the values ranged from 9 6 83 5 temperature and precipitation are important factors that affect cotton growth in the trb li et al 2020a lutz et al 2014 statistical analysis showed that temperature and precipitation had a significantly increased trend in the subbasins fig 12 increasing temperature and precipitation will provide more water for cotton production however the effects of temperature and precipitation on cotton production varied among the subbasins the contributions of meltwater to cotton yields in the aksu river basin weigan river basin kaxkar river basin hotan river basin and keriya river basin showed no significant decreasing trend fig 11 a b d f g significant increasing trends were observed in the kaidu river basin and qarqan river basin fig 11 c h and significant decreasing trends occurred in the yarkant river basin fig 11 e the results suggested that the impact of precipitation on cotton yields was equal to that of temperature in the aksu river basin weigan river basin kaxkar river basin hotan river basin and keriya river basin less than that of temperature in the kaidu river basin and qarqan river basin and greater than that of temperature in the yarkant river basin 4 4 challenges to meltwater management in the trb water availability is an important factor for agricultural production in the trb yang et al 2014a yu et al 2017b due to low precipitation and the small amount of runoff generated within plain areas irrigated agriculture is particularly susceptible to changes in meltwater from mountain areas barnett et al 2005 lutz et al 2014 abundant glaciers and snow cover distributed in mountain regions are known as solid reservoirs and play an important role in forming the flow regime under climate warming kan et al 2018a yaning et al 2016 the climate shifts from a warm dry to a warm wet climate in the trb which has experienced increases in both air temperature and precipitation shi et al 2006 tao et al 2011 with increases in air temperature glaciers are in a state of shrinking and meltwater shows an increasing trend increasing meltwater will provide more water for cotton plantations and saline alkaline soil amelioration over the short term and will be good for cotton plantations however with further increases in temperature and decreases in the volume of glaciers meltwater will decrease due to accelerated glacier melting and the loss of glacier area shi et al 2016 ye et al 2008 with the retreat of glaciers the role of glaciers in regional water resource regulation will diminish or even completely disappear which will increase the risk of drought hampering agricultural activities zhao et al 2019 cotton planting area irrigation method and irrigation time have important effects on regional water resources meltwater resources and water resource use efficiency chen et al 2020 fang et al 2018 li et al 2010 a change in planting area leads to a change in total irrigation water irrigation methods especially water saving irrigation methods will improve the use efficiency of irrigation and reduce the useless consumption of irrigation zhang et al 2019 zhang and guo 2015 modifying the irrigation time especially to ensure irrigation water consumption in the water sensitive period and reduce irrigation water consumption in the non sensitive period can also improve the use efficiency of irrigation and achieve the purposes of saving water and increasing efficiency dang et al 2012 under the background of climate warming meltwater will decrease in the trb whether meltwater can meet the normal growth demands of cotton and how to adjust planting areas irrigation methods and irrigation times to improve the use efficiency of water resources and offset the negative impact of meltwater reduction under future climate conditions will be addressed in future research 5 conclusions meltwater is an important water resource for cotton production in the trb the contribution of glacier and snow meltwater to cotton irrigation and yields were evaluated based on the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model with the degree day

9442,snow and glaciers provide water to the densely populated downstream area of the tarim river basin which is an important irrigated agricultural area in china cotton is an important cash crop and meltwater is an important irrigation water source for cotton in this region in this study the spatiotemporal dependence of cotton yield on mountain meltwater resources in the subbasins of the tarim river basin was quantified by the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model with the degree day and cropr models during 1960 2017 the results showed that the changes in meltwater in all subbasins had a significantly increasing trend meltwater contributions to cotton irrigation and yield varied spatiotemporally along the area south of the tian shan mountains the meltwater contribution to irrigation showed a decreasing trend from west to east and the highest contribution of meltwater to cotton yield occurred in the weigan river basin followed by the aksu river basin and kaidu river basin along the northern karakoram mountains the meltwater contributions to cotton irrigation and yield first decreased and then increased from west to east in the whole basin 48 6 of total irrigation withdrawals originated from mountain snow and glacial meltwater and contributed an additional 55 9 to total cotton production during the study period the results provide important agricultural information for locations where shifts in water availability and demand are projected as a result of socioeconomic growth keywords meltwater irrigation cotton yield contribution tarim river basin 1 introduction water resources are extremely important for arid and semiarid regions in central asia due to its dry climate precipitation deficit and strong evaporation li et al 2013 maingi and marsh 2002 xu et al 2018 here an expanding population and the construction of reservoirs along the middle and lower reaches of river systems have increased the demand for water in densely populated urban areas hu et al 2021 li et al 2020b ruan et al 2020 zuo et al 2015 in addition with the rapid development of urbanization water pollution and deterioration of the water environment water scarcity has become increasingly serious the availability of water resources has direct influences on sustainable development chen et al 2009 hao et al 2007 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and issues related to water resources have garnered considerable attention in central asia li et al 2017 2015 yu et al 2003 central asian mountains hold one of the greatest concentrations of perennial snow and glaciers in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere aizen et al 2007 these water resources are of prominent importance for the population industry agriculture and natural vegetation where the only significant water supply occurs via streams from the surrounding mountain regions feng et al 2001 leiwen et al 2005 studies have shown that glacier and snow meltwater accounts for a considerable proportion of the total runoff in rivers the contributions to the total runoff from glacial snowmelt were 41 5 49 1 and 70 5 in the whole tarim river basin trb toxkan river and kunma like river respectively gao et al 2010 li et al 2020c zhao et al 2012 these meltwaters modulate the seasonal variation in river runoff cotton is an economically important crop in the trb and its total planting area encompasses more than 70 of the land due to its high economic value planting areas for cotton have increased dramatically saline land is the main land type in the increased planting area this increase in planting area inevitably leads to an increase in irrigation and saline alkaline soil amelioration consumes a large amount of water snow and glacier meltwater is important for cotton production because a constant supply of water for downstream irrigation results from the unique interplay between snow and glacial melt and rainfall concentrations in the spring summer and autumn biemans et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 however global warming has resulted in the recession of glaciers and reductions in glacial areas many studies have suggested that glacial areas in this region have decreased by more than 10 since the 1970 s aizen et al 2007 narama et al 2010 the recession of glaciers and reductions in glacial areas will provide more water for cotton plantations over the short term these changes benefit cotton planting however with the further recession of glaciers and reductions in glacial areas the amount of water available will drop off sharply these changes are serious threats to cotton productivity recent research has focused on the changing trends of meltwater precipitation and runoff duethmann et al 2015 ling et al 2013 2014 shen et al 2018 xu et al 2019

and the reformation of soil salinization in cultivated land wang et al 2021a 2021b less attention has been placed on the impacts of snow and glacial meltwater on cotton yields investigating and assessing the influence of snow and glacial meltwater on cotton yields can aid in regional water resource management and the adjustment of cotton planting areas and irrigation methods the linkage between snow and glacial meltwater and cotton yields needs to be clarified in this study the variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrologic model vic was used with degree day and cropr models to assess the spatial and intra annual variations in glacier and snow meltwater contributions to irrigation for the entire trb subsequently we quantified the dependence of downstream cotton production on snow and glacial meltwater from the mountains 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the trb is located in southern xinjiang in western china 34 45 n 73 97 e with a total area of approximately 1 02

basins including aksu kaxkar yarkant weigan keriya qarqan hotan and kaidu fig 1 b precipitation is greater than 300 mm in the mountainous regions and below 50 mm in the lower basin more than 54 of precipitation occurs in june july and august the temperature ranges from 35 c in winter to 40 c in summer and the average air temperature is 7 6 c which has accelerated the regional drought situation in recent years tao et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 water resources in the basin are mainly generated by rainfall and glacier snow meltwater in mountainous regions gao et al 2010 the study area is an important irrigated agricultural area with high soil salinity and low irrigation availability as a drought tolerant crop cotton is suitable for growing in this region and its planting area has gradually increased 2 2 datasets in this paper daily climate data from 16 meteorological stations collected across the trb during the period of 1960 2017 were gathered from the china meteorological

fig 11 the average contribution of meltwater to cotton yields in the whole basin was 55 9 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of simulations of meltwater under climate warming the simulation of snow and glacier meltwater can provide basic information for regional water resource management for snow and glacier melt modeling the temperature index model has been widely used gao et al 2021 2012a zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 many studies have shown that the temperature index model is sufficient to simulate the daily variations in snow and glacier melting gao et al 2017 hock 2016 huss and hock 2018 in this study the vic model with a degree day model was used to assess meltwater runoff and total runoff the nse was 0 641 0 94 the rmse was 4 766 25 438 and the r2 was 0 81 0 97 fig 3 the vic degree day model simulated runoff well in the trb 4 2 discrepancies in meltwater in subbasins glaciers are a sensitive barometer of climate change and they grow or shrink in response to changes in temperature previous studies have shown that under climate change the change in meltwater in the trb has a significantly increasing trend gao et al 2010 shen et al 2003 zhao et al 2012 the results obtained in the present study are consistent with previous studies at the interannual scale the changes in meltwater in all river subbasins had a significantly increasing trend fig 4 this trend may be attributed to significant changes in temperature temperature is the only variable used to calculate meltwater statistical analysis showed that the temperature had a significantly increased trend fig 12 rising temperatures are causing rapid glacier shrinkage increasing negative glacier mass balances and meltwater li et al 2008 wei et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 the rate of increase in meltwater varied and the rates of change ranged from 0 02 mm 10a 1 to 1 7 mm 10a 1 fig 4 this may be because the temperatures were different among the subbasins fig 12 in addition the degree day factor was one of the main parameters used to calculate meltwater and the value of the degree day factor has large spatial variability gao et al 2010 previous studies have shown that the degree day factors of glacier and snow were from 2 2 to 13 0 mm d 1 1 and from 0 6 to 7 5 mm d 1 1 respectively in the study area gao et al 2010 zhang et al 2005 zhao et al 2020 and were affected by temperature altitude slope direction surface moraine condition and glacier movement nuimura et al 2011 scherler et al 2011 singh et al 2000 at the seasonal scale meltwater has strong seasonality during a year fig 5a h the contributions of meltwater to runoff occurred from may to september figs 5 6 zhao et al 2012 and li et al 2020c showed that the contributions of meltwater to runoff mainly occurred from may to september this is because temperature has significant seasonal variation and when the temperature is above a certain value glaciers and snow begin to melt gao et al 2010 kan et al 2018b however the contributions of meltwater to the total runoff in different subbasins varied this is also affected by temperature precipitation the degree day factor and glacier area it is worth nothing that in the weigan river basin and kaidu river basin the contribution of meltwater to streamflow was less than that of precipitation fig 5d g 6d g deng et al 2015 also found that streamflow changes in the kaidu basin in summer are mainly attributed to changes in mountain precipitation this may be due to the smaller glacier area in these two subbasins 4 3 the effects of climate change on the contributions of meltwater to cotton yield meltwater is one of the main water sources for irrigation during cotton growth and is very important for the normal growth and yield formation of cotton in the trb previous studies have emphasized that meltwater is crucial for agricultural production or cotton production biemans et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 however the influence of meltwater on cotton yield in the trb has not yet been quantified the results in this study suggested that the regional average contribution of meltwater to cotton yield was 55 9 in the trb due to differences in temperature and precipitation the contributions of meltwater to cotton yield varied among the subbasins and the values ranged from 9 6 83 5 temperature and precipitation are important factors that affect cotton growth in the trb li et al 2020a lutz et al 2014 statistical analysis showed that temperature and precipitation had a significantly increased trend in the subbasins fig 12 increasing temperature and precipitation will provide more water for cotton production however the effects of temperature and precipitation on cotton production varied among the subbasins the contributions of meltwater to cotton yields in the

production in the trb yang et al 2014a yu et al 2017b due to low precipitation and the small amount of runoff generated within plain areas irrigated agriculture is particularly susceptible to changes in meltwater from mountain areas barnett et al 2005 lutz et al 2014 abundant glaciers and snow cover distributed in mountain regions are known as solid reservoirs and play an important role in forming the flow regime under climate warming kan et al 2018a yaning et al 2016 the climate shifts from a warm dry to a warm wet climate in the trb which has experienced increases in both air temperature and precipitation shi et al 2006 tao et al 2011 with increases in air temperature glaciers are in a state of shrinking and meltwater shows an increasing trend increasing meltwater will provide more water for cotton plantations and saline alkaline soil amelioration over the short term and will be good for cotton plantations however with further increases in temperature and decreases in the volume of glaciers meltwater will decrease due to accelerated glacier melting and the loss of glacier area shi et al 2016 ye et al 2008 with the retreat of glaciers the role of glaciers in regional water resource regulation will diminish or even completely disappear which will increase the risk of drought hampering agricultural activities zhao et al 2019 cotton planting area irrigation method and irrigation time have important effects on regional water resources meltwater resources and water resource use efficiency chen et al 2020 fang et al 2018 li et al 2010 a change in planting area leads to a change in total irrigation water irrigation methods especially water saving irrigation methods will improve the use efficiency of irrigation and reduce the useless consumption of irrigation zhang et al 2019 zhang and guo 2015 modifying the irrigation time especially to ensure irrigation water consumption in the water sensitive period and reduce irrigation water consumption in the non sensitive period can also improve the use efficiency of irrigation and achieve the purposes of saving water and increasing efficiency dang et al 2012 under the background of climate warming meltwater will decrease in the trb whether meltwater can meet the normal growth demands of cotton and how to adjust planting areas irrigation methods and irrigation times to improve the use efficiency of water resources and offset the negative impact of meltwater reduction under future climate conditions will be addressed in future research 5 conclusions meltwater is an important water resource for cotton production in the trb the contribution of glacier and snow meltwater to cotton irrigation and yields were evaluated based on the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model with the degree day and cropr models as the temperature precipitation degree day factor and glacier area were different among the subbasins the changes in meltwater contributions of meltwater to irrigation and cotton yield varied spatiotemporally the changes in meltwater in all river subbasins had a significantly increasing trend and the rates of change ranged from 0 02 mm 10a 1 to 1 70 mm 10a 1 among the subbasins the contribution of meltwater to irrigation showed significant increasing trends in the keriya river basin and qarqan river basin and significant decreasing trends in the kaxkar river basin

9443,subsurface tile drainage is recognized as a significant source of sediment and particulate phosphorus pp in the midwestern u s however the role of subsurface flow pathway and source water connectivity dynamics on sediment transport is poorly understood the overarching objective of this study was to investigate sediment and pp loading dynamics for a midwestern subsurface tile drained agroecosystem and assess the governing flow pathway and water sources impacting subsurface sediment loads in this study we used a recently developed framework that couples event based hydrograph recession and specific conductance end member mixing analysis sc emma to assess governing drivers of sediment transport through tile we collected high frequency specific conductance turbidity and subsurface discharge data from an edge of field eof tile main located in northwestern ohio for 15 months multiple linear regression mlr analysis and hysteresis analysis were employed to evaluate the impact of pathway connectivity dynamics on flow weighted mean total suspended solids tss concentrations the mlr analysis showed that quickflow of new water q quick new had the highest flow weighted mean sediment concentrations and that concentrations associated with quickflow of old water i e matrix macropore exchange were variable analysis using the hysteresis index hi showed that hysteresis characteristics magnitude and direction for separated hydrographs using the pathway connectivity framework deviated from hi values of subsurface discharge q tile and highlighted the importance of q quick new through much of the monitoring period for events immediately following tillage and cover crop application in fall 2019 we found q quick old was the primary form of preferential flow peak sediment concentrations coincided with q quick old and event sediment loadings during these events decreased relative to the previous fall the findings suggest that reducing preferential transport of new water may be an effective strategy for reducing sediment and particulate p loadings at the edge of field keywords tile drainage hysteresis analysis phosphorus water quality subsurface 1 introduction quantifying sediment and particulate phosphorus pp transport dynamics is of increasing interest in subsurface tile drained landscapes given recent findings that pp fate plays an important role in eutrophic conditions of receiving waterbodies e g casillas ituarte et al 2020 the impact of hydrologic and sediment transport processes on pp loadings at the field scale in tile drained landscapes remains poorly understood jiang et al 2021 previous work has attributed fine sediments in tile drains to erosion from surface soils during storm events that are transported to tile drains via preferential flowpaths thus partially bypassing the filtration capacity of the soil matrix michaud and laverdière 2004 turunen et al 2017 collins et al 2019 nevertheless laboratory studies of preferential flow through undisturbed soil cores have indicated that subsurface flow ionic strength of water and matrix macropore interaction may also result in subsurface sediment erosion and transport hendricks 1993 jacobsen et al 1997 schelde et al 2002 rousseau et al 2004 wilson et al 2018 there is a need for sediment and pp research from tile drained agroecosystems to improve understanding of flow pathway and water source impacts on pp loadings from tiles christianson et al 2016 jiang et al 2021 subsurface flow pathways have been identified as significant drivers of sediment erosion and transport it is postulated that preferential flow paths play a significant role because macropores provide rapid connectivity from surface to tiles in contrast with micropore pathways in the soil matrix that are usually considered too small for conveyance of sediment particles turunen et al 2017 akay and fox 2007 frey et al 2016 the connectivity of surface waters to the subsurface via macropores provides a rapid pathway for detached surface particles to bypass soil filtration capacity and move from surface to tiles through turbulent conduits stone and wilson 2006 poirier et al 2012 grangeon et al 2021 sediments eroded from the subsurface are derived from particle detachment from macropore walls or from seeping from matrix to macropores warsta et al 2013 wilson et al 2018 highly turbulent flow in macropores can result in a positive feedback loop in which erosion of macropore walls enlarges macropore conduits creating greater volumes of flow and shear stresses and thus a subsequent increase in erosion kaplan et al 1993 wilson et al 2016 and wilson et al 2020 bernatek jakiel et al 2020 to better understand subsurface sediment erosion and transport processes within tile drained fields it is critical to study subsurface flow pathway dynamics source water properties have also been identified to play a key role in subsurface sediment erosion and transport macropore walls are envisioned to have chemical exchange interactions with water and can release or retain particles depending on source water chemical properties majdalani et al 2007 water sources with lower ionic strength are more erosive as compared to water with high ionic content because the lesser ionic strength results in greater osmotic potential which results in weaker links between soil particles thus increasing particle detachment by mechanical pressure miyazaki 1993 tessier et al 1999 rousseau et al 2004 it is also well established that preferential flows contain both low ionic strength event water and high ionic strength soil water klaus et al 2013 williams et al 2016b smith et al 2018 pluer et al 2020 nazari et al 2021 seepage of matrix water to preferential flow paths i e matrix macropore exchange can result in translocation of sediment from the soil matrix to preferential flowpaths wilson et al 2018 and therefore potentially impact sediment loadings to tile cumulatively these findings highlight that assessing sediment transport drivers to tile require hydrograph separation techniques that consider not only the flow pathway e g quick and slow flow paths but also water source e g rainfall event water vs pre event soil water continuous measurements of tile flowrates and electrical conductivity have enabled separation of both flow pathway and water source connectivity dynamics in subsurface drainage waters nazari et al 2021 hydrograph recession analysis has been successfully applied in subsurface drained landscapes for partitioning quick and slow flow pathways of water during storm events schilling and helmers 2008 mellander et al 2013 ford et al 2019 husic et al 2019 nazari et al 2020 further continuous conductance measurements in tile drain waters have been coupled with endmember unmixing models for partitioning event and pre event water sources during stormflows e g smith et al 2018 pluer et al 2020 these methodologies were recently coupled into a flow pathway connectivity framework that discretizes hydrographs into rapid transport of event water rapid transport of pre event water slow transport of event water and slow transport of pre event water nazari et al 2021 given the importance of both water source and flow pathways on erosion and transport processes coupling these hydrograph partitions with sediment measurements from tiles could provide new insights to governing processes controlling tile sediment loadings continuous in situ sensor measurements of turbidity have rarely been applied in tile drainage despite their widespread use as a reliable surrogate for measuring sediment concentration dynamics at high frequencies in many watershed scale applications turbidity sensors have become robust and economically feasible for use as a surrogate of suspended sediment concentrations in fluvial environments sherriff et al 2016 snyder et al 2018 pickering and ford 2021 continuous monitoring of turbidity has been used to assess sediment hysteresis dynamics which can provide insights into sediment peaks and source exhaustion sediment storage availability and mobilization pathways and lag time between discharge and peak sediment concentration williams 1989 duvert et al 2010 lloyd et al 2016a sherriff et al 2016 grangeon et al 2021 performing hysteresis analysis on separated hydrograph fractions has not been reported to our knowledge but may improve insights into tile sediment loading dynamics and prevailing flow pathways and water sources impacting sediment delivery the overarching objective of this study was to investigate sediment and pp loading dynamics for a midwestern subsurface tile drained agroecosystem and assess the governing flow pathway and water sources impacting subsurface sediment loads to meet this objective specific tasks of this study included 1 quantify sediment and pp concentration and loading dynamics in a subsurface tile drained field typical of fine textured midwestern agroecosystems 2 assess the impact of flow pathway and water source connectivity on sediment concentrations and 3 perform a quantitative sediment hysteresis analysis to assess governing sediment pathway dynamics to subsurface tile drainage 2 methodology 2 1 study site and materials to meet the objectives of this study we selected a site from the usda ars soil drainage research unit edge of field monitoring network williams et al 2016a the study site 0 158 km2 was a tile drained field with a silty clay loam soil texture in wood county ohio u s a fig 1a tile drains were installed at a depth of 0 9 m 3 ft from the soil surface lateral spacing between parallel lines was 15 2 m 50 ft and the laterals 0 10 m 4 in were routed to a 0 3 m 12 in tile main the outlet of the tile main was equipped with a water level control wlc structure before flowing into a downstream ditch the study site was selected because 1 study site characteristics were typical of prevailing agricultural management practices soil texture soil nutrient conditions and runoff characteristics in the region williams et al 2016a 2 the data collection efforts complement an extensive historic database and study record conducted by the usda ars at the site including more than seven years of continuous precipitation flowrate and nutrient data with monitoring of both surface and subsurface pathways 3 annual tp minus drp tp drp loading a surrogate for pp loading averaged 0 58 kg ha and preferential flow constituted 48 of tile flow both of which are typical of tile drained fields in the region king et al 2015 williams et al 2016b nazari et al 2020 2021 4 the producer manages the site under conservation tillage practices which are now widely adopted across row cropping systems in the tile drained midwest djodjic et al 2002 cullum 2009 williams et al 2016a and 5 the presence of a water level control wlc structure provided a secure structure to house sensing equipment the typical crop rotation at the site was corn soybean wheat at the onset of our monitoring period october 1st 2018 the field contained soybeans that were harvested on 10 17 2018 the field remained fallow until the following october when wheat was planted on 10 11 2019 and remained for the duration of our research study the field was traditionally managed using conservation or minimal tillage practices during the study period no tillage operations were reported from october 1st 2018 to september 2nd 2019 but disc tillage was performed on september 2nd 2019 september 21st 2019 and october 11th 2019 a berm was installed at the edge of field to direct surface runoff to an h flume the tile drain outlet at the edge of field was equipped with a wlc structure historically the wlc flashboards were removed prior to planting and harvesting and closed after planting and harvesting however the flashboards from the control structure were removed during our monitoring period from september 2018 to the end of december 2019 to accommodate an ongoing study conducted by the usda ars sdru precipitation and discharge data collection was conducted by the usda ars using well accepted methods williams et al 2016a we used data from october 1st 2018 to december 30th 2019 for our analysis to measure rainfall duration intensity and depth tipping bucket rain gages were used an overland flow monitoring station consisted of a flume located at the edge of field that collected surface runoff from the contributing drainage area the flume was equipped with a bubbler meter which measures water depth and was used for calculating volumetric discharge using a calibrated stage discharge curve for calculation of subsurface discharge from the tile drainage network at the outlet of the drainage system herein referred to as subsurface discharge or qtile tile mains were equipped with a weir insert thel mar brevard an isco bubbler flow meter teledyne isco lincoln nebraska and isco 2150 area velocity sensor which measures velocity under submerged conditions flow measurements were reported at 30 minute intervals for tiles and 10 minute intervals for surface runoff the tile drain was equipped with a ysi exo3 water quality sonde to measure in situ turbidity and specific conductance sc at 15 minute intervals from october 1st 2018 to december 31st 2019 the sonde was located in the upstream chamber of the wlc structure see fig 1c the turbidity sensor is a non ratiometric nephelometric turbidimeter which uses a near infrared light source and detects scattering at 90 degrees of the incident beam xylem 2020 the conductivity temperature sensor uses four internal pure nickel electrodes to measure solution conductance two of the electrodes are current driven and two are used to measure the voltage drop xylem 2020 maintenance and calibration of the instrument and sensors were conducted approximately once per month based on recommendations of the manufacturer and consistent with other studies snyder et al 2018 the turbidity sensor was calibrated using a three point approach in which turbidity values of 0 deionized water 124 and 1010 fnu were used for conductivity a one point calibration was used with a calibration standard with conductivity value of 1000 µs cm calibrations were performed using korexo software both overland and subsurface discharge monitor sites included a teledyne isco 6712 portable sampler and accessories to collect water quality samples fig 1b overland flow samples were collected using a flow proportional methodology that is a 200 ml aliquot was collected for a site specific volumetric depth ten composited aliquots made up one sample periodic submergence of the tile main outlet led to false positive flow signals samples collected when there was no discharge as well as the decoupling of the area velocity sensor with the automated sampler i e post processing was required to estimate discharge under submerged conditions as a result a time composite approach was used to collect all subsurface drainage samples samples collected during the submerged period when there was no discharge were removed from analysis generally a 100 ml aliquot was collected every 6 h for 48 h and composited into a single sample bottle reflecting a 2 day composite sample additionally during events samples were collected every 15 min and composited hourly all water samples were analyzed for dissolved reactive p drp and total p tp concentrations for the entire monitoring period dissolved splits were vacuum filtered 0 45 µm generally within one day and were refrigerated at 4 c until analysis all samples were analyzed within 28 days for orthophosphate according to usepa method 365 1 usepa 1983 concentrations of tp were determined from unfiltered samples using the usgs method of patton and kryskalla 2003 the isco samples collected from march 1st 2019 to december 30th 2019 were subsampled and transported to the university of kentucky for measurements of total suspended solids tss before tss analysis we used a newly calibrated ysi exo3 sonde to measure both turbidity and specific conductance of the sample in the lab since the isco samples were composite samples the sample was then analyzed for tss concentration by vacuum filtration through glass microfiber filters and dried at 104ºc prior to weighing consistent with epa method 160 2 usepa 1983 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 sediment and particulate phosphorus concentration and loading estimates to estimate continuous sediment concentrations from turbidity measurements we developed a regression model for total suspended solids tss as a function of turbidity in total 188 samples were used to develop the regression a least squares linear regression was performed on log transformed tss and turbidity values consistent with previously published approaches rasmussen et al 2009 the calibrated curve was then used to estimate continuous sediment concentrations we calculated continuous estimates of sediment flux using measured flowrate and tss concentrations estimated from the tss turbidity calibration curve suspended sediment flux q ss in kg s was estimated as the product of sediment concentration and flowrate for a specified timeframe as follows 1 q ss t c tss t q t where c tss kg m 3 is the tss concentration at time t and q t m3 s 1 is subsurface discharge at time t we estimated sediment yields for days storm events seasons and annual timescales using the following numerical approximation of the integral of suspended sediment flux over a specified timeframe as follows 2 sy t 1 n qss t t da where sy kg ha is the suspended sediment yield for a given timeframe ranging from 1 to n number of timesteps t s is length of the timestep and da ha is the drainage area of the subsurface drainage network in total 31 events were analyzed throughout our monitoring period from october 2018 to december 2019 the events were selected based on the hydrologic response of the tile drainage system to precipitation the start of the event occurred at the beginning of precipitation for the associated event and the end of the event was delineated by the receding limb of the hydrograph when subsurface discharge returned to pre event levels surface and subsurface daily tp and drp loadings were calculated using the approach of williams et al 2015 briefly we determined the midpoint of all sample time steps for each bottle we then used linear interpolation between measured values at the midpoint to estimate the concentration for each interval when flow was measured loading was estimated as the product of interpolated concentrations and flow rate analogous to the method for sediment loading we calculated daily event seasonal and annual subsurface tp minus drp tp drp loading for the period that we performed high resolution data collection as a surrogate for pp loading 2 2 2 impact of flow pathway and water source connectivity on sediment loading hydrologic flow pathway and source connectivity dynamics for subsurface discharge was assessed using a previously published approach that coupled hydrograph recession analysis and specific conductance end member unmixing we point the reader to nazari et al 2021 for a full description of the hydrograph partitioning methodology briefly hydrograph recession analysis was used to partition flow pathways into quickflow and slowflow drainage reservoirs quickflow q quick represents the rapid flow pathway through subsurface soils via macropores and slowflow q slow reflects more tortuous pathways e g percolation through the soil matrix before entering the tile drainage network quickflow and slowflow reservoirs can receive both new water q new from precipitation and old water q old that resides in the soil matrix prior to the event we used specific conductance data and followed previously published approaches of sc end member mixing analysis sc emma to quantify new water and old water fractions smith et al 2018 nazari et al 2021 based on these results we applied the methodology described in nazari et al 2021 to calculate pathway connectivity hydrograph separations including quickflow of old q quick old and new q quick new water and slowflow of old q slow old and new q slow new water for each event the q quick old is postulated to represent matrix macropore exchange q quick new reflects preferential transport of event precipitation q slow old reflects pre event water that percolates to tile through diffuse or slowflow pathways and q slow new reflects event precipitation transported to tile through diffuse or slowflow pathways results for our first events from october 2018 september 2019 are presented in nazari et al 2021 additionally events from october 2019 december 2019 have been analyzed for the present study a summary of all compiled results is presented in supplemental table s1 to assess the relationship between pathway connectivity and tss concentrations we used a multiple linear regression mlr model we calculated daily flow contributions and divided them by total subsurface discharge to calculate daily flow fractions f we developed a mass balance equation in which estimates of daily flow weighted mean tss concentrations of subsurface discharge was the dependent variable tss tile and flow fractions f quick new f quick old f slow were independent variables correlation coefficients were calculated for all independent variable pairs and were found to be weakly correlated with all coefficients having absolute values 0 3 based on visual observations from all events we combined q slow old and q slow new since most of the sediment loading occurred during the quickflow portion of the hydrograph the unknown beta coefficients for the mlr reflect average tss concentrations for each flow fraction e g see nazari et al 2021 the mlr model was performed in rstudio software the f statistic was used to test the null hypothesis that individual coefficients were not equal to zero and the null hypothesis that the overall mlr model provided a superior fit to a mean trend we report p values for the overall model and coefficient values for p 0 05 p 0 001 and p 0 0001 2 2 3 tile sediment hysteresis analysis sediment hysteresis analysis was performed for both subsurface discharge and separated pathway connectivity hydrographs we used both qualitative hysteresis plots and quantitative hysteresis indices to evaluate shape and magnitude of hysteresis loops lloyd et al 2016a zuecco et al 2016 regarding qualitative hysteresis plots we first normalized flow and tss concentration values as follows 3a normalized q t q t q min q max q min 3b normalized c ts s t c ts s t c ts s min c ts s max c ts s min where q min and c tssmin are minimum discharge and concentration values during an event q max and c tssmax are maximum discharge and concentration values during a storm and t is the given timestep during an event normalized values were plotted with concentrations on the y axis and flowrates on the x axis see supplemental figs s1 s4 a quantitative hysteresis index hi lloyd et al 2016a was used to quantify strength and direction of hysteresis loops the hi for each of the flow components were calculated using the normalized flow and sediment concentration data the hi was calculated every 5 of the discharge and averaged for the event the index was estimated as follows 4 hi c ts s rl c ts s fl where c tssrl is the sediment concentration on the rising limb at a given flow percentile and c tssfl is the sediment concentration value at the equivalent point in discharge on the falling limb hysteresis strength is indicated by the magnitude of the hi index with values approaching 1 indicating stronger hysteretic behavior lloyd et al 2016a the sign of the index illustrates the direction of the loop with positive denoting clockwise and negative denoting anti clockwise 3 results 3 1 sediment and particulate p loadings findings from the total suspended solids tss vs turbidity regression analysis showed the reliability of turbidity as a surrogate measure for tss in subsurface drainage fig 2 results showed a strong correlation between tss concentration and turbidity with an r2 of 0 92 and a p value 0 001 fig 2 regression results spanned tss values ranging from 5 3 to 1163 8 mg l and turbidity from 2 9 to 875 3 fnu reflecting the range observed during our 15 month in situ monitoring period fig 3 while some uncertainty in the regression model existed particularly at low concentrations the impacts on overall sediment load estimation was minimal given that most of the sediment was transported at high concentration and flow conditions results of continuous sediment concentration and sediment yield analysis showed differences between tss concentrations and loadings at seasonal and event timescales fig 3 tables 1 and 2 total annual sediment yield for water year 2019 was 717 4 kg ha the maximum sediment loading occurred in spring when precipitation was greatest while the minimum sediment loading occurred in summer when subsurface discharge was an order of magnitude less than other seasons nevertheless maximum subsurface discharge occurred in winter the finding that sediment yields were greater in spring than winter reflects greater concentrations of suspended sediment during peak runoff periods in spring which is likely reflective of the greater precipitation intensities fig 3 the event tile sediment yield varied between events and had a weak positive correlation with event discharge r2 0 42 suggesting variability in sediment concentration dynamics during storm events both seasonally and between events table 2 results of particulate p pp loading showed similar seasonal and event based dynamics to sediment loading results total annual pp for water year 2019 was found to be 1 212 kg ha table 1 analogous to sediment loading the maximum pp loading occurred in spring and the minimum pp loading occurred in summer despite maximum subsurface discharge occurring in winter table 1 the event based relationship between tp drp and sediment loading indicated a positive relationship with significant correlation p 0 001 at α 0 05 and r2 0 86 these findings provide support that tp drp dynamics are strongly regulated by suspended sediment transport dynamics for the study site 3 2 impact of flow pathway and water connectivity on sediment concentrations results of the multiple linear regression analysis of daily flow weighted mean tss concentrations highlight the importance of quickflow of new water limited importance of slow flow and variable impact of the quick old pathway table 3 daily flow weighted mean tss concentrations were found to have a significant positive relationship with daily discharge p 0 001 r2 0 40 1 day antecedent rainfall p 0 04 r2 0 15 and precipitation intensity p 0 01 r2 0 24 multiple linear regression mlr analysis suggests that tss concentration prediction improved p 0 001 r2 0 73 when including quickflow of new water p 0 001 and slowflow p value 0 001 suggesting pathway connectivity dynamics integrate many of the confounding environmental gradients impacting tile sediment concentrations the coefficient for the matrix macropore exchange q quick old was not significant p 0 187 however the standard error for the coefficient 60 4 mg l was more than twice that of other pathways this finding suggests high variability of matrix macropore exchange on tile sediment concentrations the results of the model showed that q quick new had the greatest impact on concentrations with a beta coefficient equal to 336 5 mg l q slow had limited impact on sediment loads which is reflected by a beta coefficient of 29 6 mg l an order of magnitude less than q quick new 3 3 tile sediment hysteresis analysis the hysteresis analysis showed that magnitude and directions of hi values differed between subsurface discharge and the separated hydrograph components table 2 fig 4 supplemental figs s1 s4 for total subsurface discharge q tile hysteresis indices had an average hi value of 0 10 with most plots displaying anti clockwise loops supplemental fig s1 for q quick old hysteresis indices were negative for all events where q quick old was greater than zero i e excluding s18 and s22 with an average hi value of 0 40 and displayed strong anti clockwise hysteresis loops supplemental fig s2 conversely the q quick new hysteresis indices had an average hi value of 0 12 and included a mixture of weak clockwise and anti clockwise hysteresis loops in which 28 of the 31 events had hi values between 0 2 supplemental fig s3 for q slow hysteresis demonstrated clear clockwise hysteresis patterns for most events with an average hi value of 0 35 supplemental fig s4 a noteworthy shift in hysteresis values were observed following disc tillage and planting of the wheat cover crop in october 2019 supplemental table s1 table 2 fig 5 as compared with same period in 2018 when the field was fallow average hysteresis values increased from 0 09 0 45 and 0 04 n 6 to 0 004 0 17 and 0 23 n 4 for qtile qquick old and qquick new respectively qslow did not show markedly different hi values between the two periods 0 41 0 35 for the first three events following planting q quick old displayed weak to no hysteresis and q quick new had hi values 0 3 which had not been observed throughout the rest of the monitoring period for these three events hydrograph separation results showed most of the preferential flow was associated with q quick old which also contrasted the findings from the rest of the monitoring period supplemental table s1 further these events had lower sediment yields relative to what was observed during the remainder of the monitoring period table 2 4 discussion 4 1 subsurface sediment and pp loading estimates our results indicated that turbidity is a reliable surrogate for field scale suspended solids concentrations when estimating suspended sediment loadings from subsurface tile drained landscapes the power relationship between tss and turbidity had an r2 0 92 strong relationships between tss and turbidity have been reported in other previous watershed scale studies that estimate suspended solids concentrations downing et al 2006 line et al 2013 snyder et al 2018 sherriff et al 2018 pickering and ford 2021 however organic matter and sediment property variability impact regressions and many studies report lower r2 values than found in our study e g lewis 2003 line et al 2013 landers et al 2013 snyder et al 2018 in part this reflects the fact that field scale monitoring is reflective of relatively homogeneous zones of soil and landcover contrasting objectives of watershed scale application studies which focus on quantifying source fate and transport dynamics in large and heterogenous systems e g coelho et al 2012 molder et al 2015 sherriff et al 2018 our sediment yield estimates of 717 4 kg ha in water year 2019 table 1 were on the same order of magnitude of other low gradient subsurface tile drained fields where sediment concentrations were measured continuously at high frequencies coelho et al 2012 turunen et al 2017 continuous monitoring using turbidity sensors as surrogates for suspended solids provide an economically feasible alternative to tss measurements for long term monitoring programs and should be implemented in order to improve our understanding of subsurface sediment dynamics annual pp loads were strongly correlated with estimated sediment loadings at event to seasonal timescales and were reflective of pp loads across the tile drained midwest the relationship between pp and sediment loading was significant p 0 001 in all seasons although was slightly stronger during low flow conditions which may indicate changes in sources of sediment erosion during higher flow conditions nazari et al 2020 particulate p loads fell within typical values reported in the literature for fine textured tile drained landscapes e g eastman et al 2010 christianson et al 2016 nazari et al 2020 for example the annual pp loading varied from 1 48 kg ha year in a clayey site to 0 65 kg ha year in a loamy site in the same region in ohio nazari et al 2020 and from an average of 0 33 0 88 kg ha year in nearly 1300 north american tile drained sites reported in the manage measured annual nutrient loads from agricultural environments database christianson et al 2016 given the similarities in loading agricultural management practices soil type and land slope gradient of our study site to the broader tile drained midwestern us agroecosystems the findings of this study may be generalizable to tile sediment processes occurring at broader spatial scales although future studies should apply similar methodologies across prominent soil and management gradients 4 2 impact of flow pathway and water source connectivity on tile sediment transport results suggest that preferential flow of precipitation water with low specific conductance values reflecting low ionic concentrations i e low ionic strength is the primary contributor to sediment loadings at the study site findings from the mlr analysis highlighted that the quickflow pathway of new water had the highest flow weighted mean daily sediment concentrations throughout the period of record this finding was expected given studies have illustrated that new water has a low ionic strength which is more erosive than inflowing water with high ionic strength rousseau et al 2004 hysteresis results showed weak hysteresis for qquick new during the fallow water year 2019 with most values falling between 0 2 fig 4 fig 5 table 2 supplemental fig s3 the weak hysteresis index values observed with the new water flow fraction reflects near synchronous increases and decreases between q quick new and suspended solids concentrations suggesting the sediment source associated with this pathway is plentiful lloyd et al 2016b as a result we postulate this may reflect shear induced erosion of concentrated surface and subsurface pathways e g rills and macropore walls since shear stresses and transport capacities are well recognized to increase with increasing discharge results for the q quick old pathway suggest that the transport of matrix water through macropores has variable importance on tile sediment and pp loads given the high uncertainty in estimates for the mlr and hi analyses results from the mlr analysis for q quick old contrasted recent findings that showed matrix macropore exchange is an important predictor of drp since matrix macropore exchange may be initiated in near surface soils or the shallow root zone klaus et al 2013 williams et al 2016b ford et al 2018 nazari et al 2021 while translocation or seeping of particles from the soil matrix to macropores suffusion or illuviation is hypothesized as one of the sources of sediment transported in macropores wilson et al 2018 the role of matrix macropore exchange on this translocation remains unclear the high variability in this source may partially reflect the sensitivity of erosion and detachment processes under variable soil moisture conditions more experimental studies are needed to address hydraulic non equilibrium effects e g seepage forces on flow and particle detachment or particle illuviation wilson et al 2018 further the high variability in this pathway may also reflect the shift to near linear hysteresis observed for the events in fall 2019 which is further discussed in section 4 3 our results showed that the slow flow pathway had limited impact on sediment delivery to tile drainage large positive hi slow hysteresis values suggest that the peak of q slow significantly lagged behind the suspended solids peak fig 4 supplemental table s1 and suggests that slowflow has limited impact on tile sediment loadings as a result the discretization of slow and quick new hydrographs improved prediction of tss concentration as compared with simple q based regression analysis with concentrations of q slow an order of magnitude lower than q quick new this finding reflects the idea that slowflow pathways are important filters for sediment laden waters in this regard previous studies suggested that particle sieving and retention can occur in subsurface pathways jarvis et al 1999 turtola et al 2007 burkhardt et al 2008 van den bogaert et al 2016 the retention and sieving processes have not been extensively studied but the modelling study of turunen et al 2017 suggested that a large portion of eroded sediments may be retained in the field due to retention and sieving cumulatively these results suggest that management practices that target converting preferential transport of event water to diffuse pathways e g bypass recharge of groundwater may significantly reduce sediment and pp delivery at the edge of field 4 3 implications for management practices results from fall 2019 reflected a transition from a period with fallow conditions and no tillage operations to a period with disc tillage and cover crop growth during fall 2019 we found a decrease in tile sediment loading a shift in preferential flow prominence to old water as opposed to new water and a shift in hysteretic patterns we discuss potential factors controlling these shifts and the associated implications in the following paragraphs shifts in hysteretic patterns during fall 2019 following cover crop application likely reflects a shift in the governing mechanisms impacting sediment erosion and delivery to tile drains hysteresis index values of q quick new shifted from linear hysteresis patterns during the fallow period to strong clockwise hysteresis patterns during the period following disc tillage and cover crop planting clockwise loops are indicative of proximal sediment sources or exhaustion of sources on the rising limb of the event williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 at the field scale this clockwise hysteresis pattern may reflect dysconnectivity of subsurface drainage from easily eroded particles from surface soils nouwakpo et al 2010 wilson et al 2016 alternatively it could reflect absence of an easily eroded biocrust that develops between events on macropore walls jacobsen et al 1997 schelde et al 2002 majdalani et al 2007 michel et al 2010 van den bogaert et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 future modeling and tracer based studies are needed at the field scale to better inform sources of sediment i e surface vs subsurface and mechanisms of delivery to subsurface drains both cover crop application and tillage could have impacted the observed preferential flow and sediment dynamics during fall 2019 the ability of cover crops and crop residues to reduce soil erosion has been widely recognized faust et al 2018 hallama et al 2019 liu et al 2019 but its impact on sediment delivery to tile drainage and subsurface erosion dynamics has received limited attention griffith et al 2020 cover crops have been found to reduce soil erosion and transport of sediments because they can reduce surface sheet rill erosion and increase surface water infiltration sharpley et al 1991 kaspar et al 2001 griffith et al 2020 likewise cover crops aid in reducing or preventing formation of the crust layer on soil surfaces ramírez garcia et al 2012 wu et al 2020 gabriel et al 2021 relevant to our findings increased infiltration may have caused the shift to preferential flow dominated by old water and could have decreased the erodibility of surface erosion sources alternatively tillage practices have been found to substantially reduce maximum event water contributions to tile drains in this region immediately after tillage resulting in reduced connectivity of surface contaminants to tiles although the effect is diminished as macropores reestablish williams et al 2016b our results support these previous findings in that q quick new decreased for approximately 2 5 months before becoming the prominent preferential flow water source as well as the prominent sediment source during event s31 these findings highlight potential sensitivity of sediment loadings to surface management practices and are an important area for future work despite the adoption of conservation tillage practices at the study site subsurface tile loadings were high because of preferential flow of event water suggesting management practices should target reductions in q quick new conservation tillage and no till is recognized to reduce time to peak of macropore flow verbree et al 2010 williams et al 2016b resulting in less transit time for sediment retention and higher shear stresses in subsurface pathways based on our results in fall 2019 management practices should target reductions in q quick new to reduce tile sediment loadings for instance water absorbing polymers i e hydrogels enhance soil permeability and infiltration rate and increase water holding capacity narjary et al 2013 hosseini et al 2021 bairwa et al 2020 which may aid in reducing preferential flows of new water further practices such as controlled drainage may reduce preferential flows of new water although the impact of controlled drainage on flow pathway dynamics has not been robustly evaluated cooke and verma 2012 saadat et al 2018 shedekar et al 2020 further work should assess how best management practices in tile drained landscapes may be coupled with conservation tillage practices to reduce subsurface sediment loadings 5 conclusions we employed results from a recently developed flow pathway and source water connectivity framework to predict sediment concentrations in subsurface drainage and found that both sediment and particulate p is regulated by preferential transport of new water reductions in sediment loadings and fractions of preferential flow from new water combined with shifts in sediment hysteresis patterns following tillage and cover crop application suggest management practices focused on reducing q quick new could be an effective strategy for minimizing sediment delivery to tile drains in fine

9443,subsurface tile drainage is recognized as a significant source of sediment and particulate phosphorus pp in the midwestern u s however the role of subsurface flow pathway and source water connectivity dynamics on sediment transport is poorly understood the overarching objective of this study was to investigate sediment and pp loading dynamics for a midwestern subsurface tile drained agroecosystem and assess the governing flow pathway and water sources impacting subsurface sediment loads in this study we used a recently developed framework that couples event based hydrograph recession and specific conductance end member mixing analysis sc emma to assess governing drivers of sediment transport through tile we collected high frequency specific conductance turbidity and subsurface discharge data from an edge of field eof tile main located in northwestern ohio for 15 months multiple linear regression mlr analysis and hysteresis analysis were employed to evaluate the impact of pathway connectivity dynamics on flow weighted mean total suspended solids tss concentrations the mlr analysis showed that quickflow of new water q quick new had the highest flow weighted mean sediment concentrations and that concentrations associated with quickflow of old water i e matrix macropore exchange were variable analysis using the hysteresis index hi showed that hysteresis characteristics magnitude and direction for separated hydrographs using the pathway connectivity framework deviated from hi values of subsurface discharge q tile and highlighted the importance of q quick new through much of the monitoring period for events immediately following tillage and cover crop application in fall 2019 we found q quick old was the primary form of preferential flow peak sediment concentrations coincided with q quick old and event sediment loadings during these events decreased relative to the previous fall the findings suggest that reducing preferential transport of new water may be an effective strategy for reducing sediment and particulate p loadings at the edge of field keywords tile drainage hysteresis analysis phosphorus water quality subsurface 1 introduction quantifying sediment and particulate phosphorus pp transport dynamics is of increasing interest in subsurface tile drained landscapes given recent findings that pp fate plays an important role in eutrophic conditions of receiving waterbodies e g casillas ituarte et al 2020 the impact of hydrologic and sediment transport processes on pp loadings at the field scale in tile drained landscapes remains poorly understood jiang et al 2021 previous work has attributed fine sediments in tile drains to erosion from surface soils during storm events that are transported to tile drains via preferential flowpaths thus partially bypassing the filtration capacity of the soil matrix michaud and laverdière 2004 turunen et al 2017 collins et al 2019 nevertheless laboratory studies of preferential flow through undisturbed soil cores have indicated that subsurface flow ionic strength of water and matrix macropore interaction may also result in subsurface sediment erosion and transport hendricks 1993 jacobsen et al 1997 schelde et al 2002 rousseau et al 2004 wilson et al 2018 there is a need for sediment and pp research from tile drained agroecosystems to improve understanding of flow pathway and water source impacts on pp loadings from tiles christianson et al 2016 jiang et al 2021 subsurface flow pathways have been identified as significant drivers of sediment erosion and transport it is postulated that preferential flow paths play a significant role because macropores provide rapid connectivity from surface to tiles in contrast with micropore pathways in the soil matrix that are usually considered too small for conveyance of sediment particles turunen et al 2017 akay and fox 2007 frey et al 2016 the connectivity of surface waters to the subsurface via macropores provides a rapid pathway for detached surface particles to bypass soil filtration capacity and move from surface to tiles through turbulent conduits stone and wilson 2006 poirier et al 2012 grangeon et al 2021 sediments eroded from the subsurface are derived from particle detachment from macropore walls or from seeping from matrix to macropores warsta et al 2013 wilson et al 2018 highly turbulent flow in macropores can result in a positive feedback loop in which erosion of macropore walls enlarges macropore conduits creating greater volumes of flow and shear stresses and thus a subsequent increase in erosion kaplan et al 1993 wilson et al 2016 and wilson et al 2020 bernatek jakiel et al 2020 to better understand subsurface sediment erosion and transport processes within tile drained fields it is critical to study subsurface flow pathway dynamics source water properties have also been identified to play a key role in subsurface sediment erosion and transport macropore walls are envisioned to have chemical exchange interactions with water and can release or retain particles depending on source water chemical properties majdalani et al 2007 water sources with lower ionic strength are more erosive as compared to water with high ionic content because the lesser ionic strength results in greater osmotic potential which results in weaker links between soil particles thus increasing particle detachment by mechanical pressure miyazaki 1993 tessier et al 1999 rousseau et al 2004 it is also well established that preferential flows contain both low ionic strength event water and high ionic strength soil water klaus et al 2013 williams et al 2016b smith et al 2018 pluer et al 2020 nazari et al 2021 seepage of matrix water to preferential flow paths i e matrix macropore exchange can result in translocation of sediment from the soil matrix to preferential flowpaths wilson et al 2018 and therefore potentially impact sediment loadings to tile cumulatively these findings highlight that assessing sediment transport drivers to tile require hydrograph separation techniques that consider not only the flow pathway e g quick and slow flow paths but also water source e g rainfall event water vs pre event soil water continuous measurements of tile flowrates and electrical conductivity have enabled separation of both flow pathway and water source connectivity dynamics in subsurface drainage waters nazari et al 2021 hydrograph recession analysis has been successfully applied in subsurface drained landscapes for partitioning quick and

drain waters have been coupled with endmember unmixing models for partitioning event and pre event water sources during stormflows e g smith et al 2018 pluer et al 2020 these methodologies were recently coupled into a flow pathway connectivity framework that discretizes hydrographs into rapid transport of event water rapid transport of pre event water slow transport of event water and slow transport of pre event water nazari et al 2021 given the importance of both water source and flow pathways on erosion and transport processes coupling these hydrograph partitions with sediment measurements from tiles could provide new insights to governing processes controlling tile sediment loadings continuous in situ sensor measurements of turbidity have rarely been applied in tile drainage despite their widespread use as a reliable surrogate for measuring sediment concentration dynamics at high frequencies in many watershed scale applications turbidity sensors have become robust and economically feasible for use as a surrogate of suspended sediment concentrations in fluvial environments sherriff et al 2016 snyder et al 2018 pickering and ford 2021 continuous monitoring of turbidity has been used to assess sediment hysteresis dynamics which can provide insights into sediment peaks and source exhaustion sediment storage availability and mobilization pathways and lag time between discharge and peak sediment concentration williams 1989 duvert et al 2010 lloyd et al 2016a sherriff et al 2016 grangeon et al 2021 performing hysteresis analysis on separated hydrograph fractions has not been reported to our knowledge but may improve insights into tile sediment loading dynamics and prevailing flow pathways and water sources impacting sediment delivery the overarching objective of this study was to investigate sediment and pp loading dynamics for a midwestern subsurface tile drained agroecosystem and assess the governing flow pathway and water sources impacting subsurface sediment loads to meet this objective specific tasks of this study included 1 quantify sediment and pp concentration and loading dynamics in a subsurface tile drained field typical of fine textured midwestern agroecosystems 2 assess the impact of flow pathway and water source connectivity on sediment concentrations and 3 perform a quantitative sediment hysteresis analysis to assess governing sediment pathway dynamics to subsurface tile drainage 2 methodology 2 1 study site and materials to meet the objectives of this study we selected a site from the usda ars soil drainage research unit edge of field monitoring network williams et al 2016a the study site 0 158 km2 was a tile drained field with a silty clay loam soil texture in wood county ohio u s a fig 1a tile drains were installed at a depth of 0 9 m 3 ft from the soil surface lateral spacing between parallel lines was 15 2 m 50 ft and the laterals 0 10 m 4 in were routed to a 0 3 m 12 in tile main the outlet of the tile main was equipped with a water level control wlc structure before flowing into a downstream ditch the study site was selected because 1 study site characteristics were typical of prevailing agricultural management practices soil texture soil nutrient conditions and runoff characteristics in the region williams et al 2016a 2 the data collection efforts complement an extensive historic database and study record conducted by the usda ars at the site including more than seven years of continuous precipitation flowrate and nutrient data with monitoring of both surface and subsurface pathways 3 annual tp minus drp tp drp loading a surrogate for pp loading averaged 0 58 kg ha and preferential flow constituted 48 of tile flow both of which are typical of tile drained fields in the region king et al 2015 williams et al 2016b nazari et al 2020 2021 4 the producer manages the site under conservation tillage practices which are now widely adopted across row cropping systems in the tile drained midwest djodjic et al 2002 cullum 2009 williams et al 2016a and 5 the presence of a water level control wlc structure provided a secure structure to house sensing equipment the typical crop rotation at the site was corn soybean wheat at the onset of our monitoring period october 1st 2018 the field contained soybeans that were harvested on 10 17 2018 the field remained fallow until the following october when wheat was planted on 10 11 2019 and remained for the duration of our research study the field was traditionally managed using conservation or minimal tillage practices during the study period no tillage operations were reported from october 1st 2018 to september 2nd 2019 but disc tillage was performed on september 2nd 2019 september 21st 2019 and october 11th 2019 a berm was installed at the edge of field to direct surface runoff to an h flume the tile drain outlet at the edge of field was equipped with a wlc structure historically the wlc flashboards were removed prior to planting and harvesting and closed after planting and harvesting however the flashboards from the control structure were removed during our monitoring period from september 2018 to the end of december 2019 to accommodate an ongoing study conducted by the usda ars sdru precipitation and discharge data collection was conducted by the usda ars using well accepted methods williams et al 2016a we used data from october 1st 2018 to december 30th 2019 for our analysis to measure rainfall duration intensity and depth tipping bucket rain gages were used an overland flow monitoring station consisted of a flume located at the edge of field that collected surface runoff from the contributing drainage area the flume was equipped with a bubbler meter which measures water depth and was used for calculating volumetric discharge using a calibrated stage discharge curve for calculation of subsurface discharge from the tile drainage network at the outlet of the drainage system herein referred to as subsurface discharge or qtile tile mains were equipped with a weir insert thel mar brevard an isco bubbler flow meter teledyne isco lincoln nebraska and isco 2150 area velocity sensor which measures velocity under submerged conditions flow measurements were reported at 30 minute intervals for tiles and 10 minute intervals for surface runoff the tile drain was equipped with a ysi exo3 water quality sonde to measure in situ turbidity and specific conductance sc at 15 minute intervals from october 1st 2018 to december 31st 2019 the sonde was located in the upstream chamber of the wlc structure see fig 1c the turbidity sensor is a non ratiometric nephelometric turbidimeter which uses a near infrared light source and detects scattering at 90 degrees of the incident beam xylem 2020 the conductivity temperature sensor uses four internal pure nickel electrodes to measure solution conductance two of the electrodes are current driven and two are used to measure the voltage drop xylem 2020 maintenance and calibration of the instrument and sensors were conducted approximately once per month based on recommendations of the manufacturer and consistent with other studies snyder et al 2018 the turbidity sensor was calibrated using a three point approach in which turbidity values of 0 deionized water 124 and 1010 fnu were used for conductivity a one point calibration was used with a calibration standard with conductivity value of 1000 µs cm calibrations were performed using korexo software both overland and subsurface discharge monitor sites included a teledyne isco 6712 portable sampler and accessories to collect water quality samples fig 1b overland flow samples were collected using a flow proportional methodology that is a 200 ml aliquot was collected for a site specific volumetric depth ten composited aliquots made up one sample periodic submergence of the tile main outlet led to false positive flow signals samples collected when there was no discharge as well as the decoupling of the area velocity sensor with the automated sampler i e post processing was required to estimate discharge under submerged conditions as a result a time composite approach was used to collect all subsurface drainage samples samples collected during the submerged period when there was no discharge were removed from analysis generally a 100 ml aliquot was collected every 6 h for 48 h and composited into a single sample bottle reflecting a 2 day composite sample additionally during events samples were collected every 15 min and composited hourly all water samples were analyzed for dissolved reactive p drp and total p tp concentrations for the entire monitoring period dissolved splits were vacuum filtered 0 45 µm generally within one day and were refrigerated at 4 c until analysis all samples were analyzed within 28 days for orthophosphate according to usepa method 365 1 usepa 1983 concentrations of tp were determined from unfiltered samples using the usgs method of patton and kryskalla 2003 the isco samples collected from march 1st 2019 to december 30th 2019 were subsampled and transported to the university of kentucky for measurements of total suspended solids tss before tss analysis we used a newly calibrated ysi exo3 sonde to measure both turbidity and specific conductance of the sample in the lab since the isco samples were composite samples the sample was then analyzed for tss concentration by vacuum filtration through glass microfiber filters and dried at 104ºc prior to weighing consistent with epa method 160 2 usepa 1983 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 sediment and particulate phosphorus concentration and loading estimates to estimate continuous sediment concentrations from turbidity measurements we developed a regression model for total suspended solids tss as a function of turbidity in total 188 samples were used to develop the regression a least squares linear regression was performed on log transformed tss and turbidity values consistent with previously published approaches rasmussen et al 2009 the calibrated curve was then used to estimate continuous sediment concentrations we calculated continuous estimates of sediment flux using measured flowrate and tss concentrations estimated from the tss turbidity calibration curve suspended sediment flux q ss in kg s was estimated as the product of sediment concentration and flowrate for a specified timeframe as follows 1 q ss t c tss t q t where c tss kg m 3 is the tss concentration at time t and q t m3 s 1 is subsurface discharge at time t we estimated sediment yields for days storm events seasons and annual timescales using the following numerical approximation of the integral of suspended sediment flux over a specified timeframe as follows 2 sy t 1 n qss t t da where sy kg ha is the suspended sediment yield for a given timeframe ranging from 1 to n number of timesteps t s is length of the timestep and da ha is the drainage area of the subsurface drainage network in total 31 events were analyzed throughout our monitoring period from october 2018 to december 2019 the events were selected based on the hydrologic response of the tile drainage system to precipitation the start of the event occurred at the beginning of precipitation for the associated event and the end of the event was delineated by the receding limb of the hydrograph when subsurface discharge returned to pre event levels surface and subsurface daily tp and drp loadings were calculated using the approach of williams et al 2015 briefly we determined the midpoint of all sample time steps for each bottle we then used linear interpolation between measured values at the midpoint to estimate the concentration for each interval when flow was measured loading was estimated as the product of interpolated concentrations and flow rate analogous to the method for sediment loading we calculated daily event seasonal and annual subsurface tp minus drp tp drp loading for the period that we performed high resolution data collection as a surrogate for pp loading 2 2 2 impact of flow pathway and water source connectivity on sediment loading hydrologic flow pathway and source connectivity dynamics for subsurface discharge was assessed using a previously published approach that coupled hydrograph recession analysis and specific conductance end member unmixing we point the reader to nazari et al 2021 for a full description of the hydrograph partitioning methodology briefly hydrograph recession analysis was used to partition flow pathways into quickflow and slowflow drainage reservoirs quickflow q quick represents the rapid flow pathway through subsurface soils via macropores and slowflow q slow reflects more tortuous pathways e g percolation through the soil matrix before entering the tile drainage network quickflow and slowflow reservoirs can receive both new water q new from precipitation and old water q old that resides in the soil matrix prior to the event we used specific conductance data and followed previously published approaches of sc end member mixing analysis sc emma to quantify new water and old water fractions smith et al 2018 nazari et al 2021 based on these results we applied the methodology described in nazari et al 2021 to calculate pathway connectivity hydrograph separations including quickflow of old q quick old and new q quick new water and slowflow of old q slow old and new q slow new water for each event the q quick old is postulated to represent matrix macropore exchange q quick new reflects preferential transport of event precipitation q slow old reflects pre event water that percolates to tile through diffuse or slowflow pathways and q slow new reflects event precipitation transported to tile through diffuse or slowflow pathways results for our first events from october 2018 september 2019 are presented in nazari et al 2021 additionally events from october 2019 december 2019 have been analyzed for the present study a summary of all compiled results is presented in supplemental table s1 to assess the relationship between pathway connectivity and tss concentrations we used a multiple linear regression mlr model we calculated daily flow contributions and divided them by total subsurface discharge to calculate daily flow fractions f we developed a mass balance equation in which estimates of daily flow weighted mean tss concentrations of subsurface discharge was the dependent variable tss tile and flow fractions f quick new f quick old f slow were independent variables correlation coefficients were calculated for all independent variable pairs and were found to be weakly correlated with all coefficients having absolute values 0 3 based on visual observations from all events we combined q slow old and q slow new since most of the sediment loading occurred during the quickflow portion of the hydrograph the unknown beta coefficients for the mlr reflect average tss concentrations for each flow fraction e g see nazari et al 2021 the mlr model was performed in rstudio software the f statistic was used to test the null hypothesis that individual coefficients were not equal to zero and the null hypothesis that the overall mlr model provided a superior fit to a mean trend we report p values for the overall model and coefficient values for p 0 05 p 0 001 and p 0 0001 2 2 3 tile sediment hysteresis analysis sediment hysteresis analysis was performed for both subsurface discharge and separated pathway connectivity hydrographs we used both qualitative hysteresis plots and quantitative hysteresis indices to evaluate shape and magnitude of hysteresis loops lloyd et al 2016a zuecco et al 2016 regarding qualitative hysteresis plots we first normalized flow and tss concentration values as follows 3a normalized q t q t q min q max q min 3b normalized c ts s t c ts s t c ts s min c ts s max c ts s min where q min and c tssmin are minimum discharge and concentration values during an event q max and c tssmax are maximum discharge and concentration values during a storm and t is the given timestep during an event normalized values were plotted with concentrations on the y axis and flowrates on the x axis see supplemental figs s1 s4 a quantitative hysteresis index hi lloyd et al 2016a was used to quantify strength and direction of hysteresis loops the hi for each of the flow components were calculated using the normalized flow and sediment concentration data the hi was calculated every 5 of the discharge and averaged for the event the index was estimated as follows 4 hi c ts s rl c ts s fl where c tssrl is the sediment concentration on the rising limb at a given flow percentile and c tssfl is the sediment concentration value at the equivalent point in discharge on the falling limb hysteresis strength is indicated by the magnitude of the hi index with values approaching 1 indicating stronger hysteretic behavior lloyd et al 2016a the sign of the index illustrates the direction of the loop with positive denoting clockwise and negative denoting anti clockwise 3 results 3 1 sediment and particulate p loadings findings from the total suspended solids tss vs turbidity regression analysis showed the reliability of turbidity as a surrogate measure for tss in subsurface drainage fig 2 results showed a strong correlation between tss concentration and turbidity with an r2 of 0 92 and a p value 0 001 fig 2 regression results spanned tss values ranging from 5 3 to 1163 8 mg l and turbidity from 2 9 to 875 3 fnu reflecting the range observed during our 15 month in situ monitoring period fig 3 while some uncertainty in the regression model existed particularly at low concentrations the impacts on overall sediment load estimation was minimal given that most of the sediment was transported at high concentration and flow conditions results of continuous sediment concentration and sediment yield analysis showed differences between tss concentrations and loadings at seasonal and event timescales fig 3 tables 1 and 2 total annual sediment yield for water year 2019 was 717 4 kg ha the maximum sediment loading occurred in spring when precipitation was greatest while the minimum sediment loading occurred in summer when subsurface discharge was an order of magnitude less than other seasons nevertheless maximum subsurface discharge occurred in winter the finding that sediment yields were greater in spring than winter reflects greater concentrations of suspended sediment during peak runoff periods in spring which is likely reflective of the greater precipitation intensities fig 3 the event tile sediment yield varied between events and had a weak positive correlation with event discharge r2 0 42 suggesting variability in sediment concentration dynamics during storm events both seasonally and between events table 2 results of particulate p pp loading showed similar seasonal and event based dynamics to sediment loading results total annual pp for water year 2019 was found to be 1 212 kg ha table 1 analogous to sediment loading the maximum pp loading occurred in spring and the minimum pp loading occurred in summer despite maximum subsurface discharge occurring in winter table 1 the event based relationship between tp drp and sediment loading indicated a positive relationship with significant correlation p 0 001 at α 0 05 and r2 0 86 these findings provide support that tp drp dynamics are strongly regulated by suspended sediment transport dynamics for the study site 3 2 impact of flow pathway and water connectivity on sediment concentrations results of the multiple linear regression analysis of daily flow weighted mean tss concentrations highlight the importance of quickflow of new water limited importance of slow flow and variable impact of the quick old pathway table 3 daily flow weighted mean tss concentrations were found to have a significant positive relationship with daily discharge p 0 001 r2 0 40 1 day antecedent rainfall p 0 04 r2 0 15 and precipitation intensity p 0 01 r2 0 24 multiple linear regression mlr analysis suggests that tss concentration prediction improved p 0 001 r2 0 73 when including quickflow of new water p 0 001 and slowflow p value 0 001 suggesting pathway connectivity dynamics integrate many of the confounding environmental gradients impacting tile sediment concentrations the coefficient for the matrix macropore exchange q quick old was not significant p 0 187 however the standard error for the coefficient 60 4 mg l was more than twice that of other pathways this finding suggests high variability of matrix macropore exchange on tile sediment concentrations the results of the model showed that q quick new had the greatest impact on concentrations with a beta coefficient equal to 336 5 mg l q slow had limited impact on sediment loads which is reflected by a beta coefficient of 29 6 mg l an order of magnitude less than q quick new 3 3 tile sediment hysteresis analysis the hysteresis analysis showed that magnitude and directions of hi values differed between subsurface discharge and the separated hydrograph components table 2 fig 4 supplemental figs s1 s4 for total subsurface discharge q tile hysteresis indices had an average hi value of 0 10 with most plots displaying anti clockwise loops supplemental fig s1 for q quick old hysteresis indices were negative for all events where q quick old was greater than zero i e excluding s18 and s22 with an average hi value of 0 40 and displayed strong anti clockwise hysteresis loops supplemental fig s2 conversely the q quick new hysteresis indices had an average hi value of 0 12 and included a mixture of weak clockwise and anti clockwise hysteresis loops in which 28 of the 31 events had hi values between 0 2 supplemental fig s3 for q slow hysteresis demonstrated clear clockwise hysteresis patterns for most events with an average hi value of 0 35 supplemental fig s4 a noteworthy shift in hysteresis values were observed following disc tillage and planting of the wheat cover crop in october 2019 supplemental table s1 table 2 fig 5 as compared with same period in 2018 when the field was fallow average hysteresis values increased from 0 09 0 45 and 0 04 n 6 to 0 004 0 17 and 0 23 n 4 for qtile qquick old and qquick new respectively qslow did not show markedly different hi values between the two periods 0 41 0 35 for the first three events following planting q quick old displayed weak to no hysteresis and q quick new had hi values 0 3 which had not been observed throughout the rest of the monitoring period for these three events hydrograph separation results showed most of the preferential flow was associated with q quick old which also contrasted the findings from the rest of the monitoring period supplemental table s1 further these events had lower sediment yields relative to what was observed during the remainder of the monitoring period table 2 4 discussion 4 1 subsurface sediment and pp loading estimates our results indicated that turbidity is a reliable surrogate for field scale suspended solids concentrations when estimating suspended sediment loadings from subsurface tile drained landscapes the power relationship between tss and turbidity had an r2 0 92 strong relationships between tss and turbidity have been reported in other previous watershed scale studies that estimate suspended solids concentrations downing et al 2006 line et al 2013 snyder et al 2018 sherriff et al 2018 pickering and ford 2021 however organic matter and sediment property variability impact regressions and many studies report lower r2 values than found in our study e g lewis 2003 line et al 2013 landers et al 2013 snyder et al 2018 in part this reflects the fact that field scale monitoring is reflective of relatively homogeneous zones of soil and landcover contrasting objectives of watershed scale application studies which focus on quantifying source fate and transport dynamics in large and heterogenous systems e g coelho et al 2012 molder et al 2015 sherriff et al 2018 our sediment yield estimates of 717 4 kg ha in water year 2019 table 1 were on the same order of magnitude of other low gradient subsurface tile drained fields where sediment concentrations were measured continuously at high frequencies coelho et al 2012 turunen et al 2017 continuous monitoring using turbidity sensors as surrogates for suspended solids provide an economically feasible alternative to tss measurements for long term monitoring programs and should be implemented in order to improve our understanding of subsurface sediment dynamics annual pp loads were strongly correlated with estimated sediment loadings at event to seasonal timescales and were reflective of pp loads across the tile drained midwest the relationship between pp and sediment loading was significant p 0 001 in all seasons although was slightly stronger during low flow conditions which may indicate changes in sources of sediment erosion during higher flow conditions nazari et al 2020 particulate p loads fell within typical values reported in the literature for fine textured tile drained landscapes e g eastman et al 2010 christianson et al 2016 nazari et al 2020 for example the annual pp loading varied from 1 48 kg ha year in a clayey site to 0 65 kg ha year in a loamy site in the same region in ohio nazari et al 2020 and from an average of 0 33 0 88 kg ha year in nearly 1300 north american tile drained sites reported in the manage measured annual nutrient loads from agricultural environments database christianson et al 2016 given the similarities in loading agricultural management practices soil type and land slope gradient of our study site to the broader tile drained midwestern us agroecosystems the findings of this study may be generalizable to tile sediment processes occurring at broader spatial scales although future studies should apply similar methodologies across prominent soil and management gradients 4 2 impact of flow pathway and water source connectivity on tile sediment transport results suggest that preferential flow of precipitation water with low specific conductance values reflecting low ionic concentrations i e low ionic strength is the primary contributor to sediment loadings at the study site findings from the mlr analysis highlighted that the quickflow pathway of new water had the highest flow weighted mean daily sediment concentrations throughout the period of record this finding was expected given studies have illustrated that new water has a low ionic strength which is more erosive than inflowing water with high ionic strength rousseau et al 2004 hysteresis results showed weak hysteresis for qquick new during the fallow water year 2019 with most values falling between 0 2 fig 4 fig 5 table 2 supplemental fig s3 the weak hysteresis index values observed with the new water flow fraction reflects near synchronous increases and decreases between q quick new and suspended solids concentrations suggesting the sediment source associated with this pathway is plentiful lloyd et al 2016b as a result we postulate this may reflect shear induced erosion of concentrated surface and subsurface pathways e g rills and macropore walls since shear stresses and transport capacities are well recognized to increase with increasing discharge results for the q quick old pathway suggest that the transport of matrix water through macropores has variable importance on tile sediment and pp loads given the high uncertainty in estimates for the mlr and hi analyses results from the mlr analysis for q quick old contrasted recent findings that showed matrix macropore exchange is an important predictor of drp since matrix macropore exchange may be initiated in near surface soils or the shallow root zone klaus et al 2013 williams et al 2016b ford et al 2018 nazari et al 2021 while translocation or seeping of particles from the soil matrix to macropores suffusion or illuviation is hypothesized as one of the sources of sediment transported in macropores wilson et al 2018 the role of matrix macropore exchange on this translocation remains unclear the high variability in this source may partially reflect the sensitivity of erosion and detachment processes under variable soil moisture conditions more experimental studies are needed to address hydraulic non equilibrium effects e g seepage forces on flow and particle detachment or particle illuviation wilson et al 2018 further the high variability in this pathway may also reflect the shift to near linear hysteresis observed for the events in fall 2019 which is further discussed in section 4 3 our results showed that the slow flow pathway had limited impact on sediment delivery to tile drainage large positive hi slow hysteresis values suggest that the peak of q slow significantly lagged behind the suspended solids peak fig 4 supplemental table s1 and suggests that slowflow has limited impact on tile sediment loadings as a result the discretization of slow and quick new hydrographs improved prediction of tss concentration as compared with simple q based regression analysis with concentrations of q slow an order of magnitude lower than q quick new this finding reflects the idea that slowflow pathways are important filters for sediment laden waters in this regard previous studies suggested that particle sieving and retention can occur in subsurface pathways jarvis et al 1999 turtola et al 2007 burkhardt et al 2008 van den bogaert et al 2016 the retention and sieving processes have not been extensively studied but the modelling study of turunen et al 2017 suggested that a large portion of eroded sediments may be retained in the field due to retention and sieving cumulatively these results suggest that management practices that target converting preferential transport of event water to diffuse pathways e g bypass recharge of groundwater may significantly reduce sediment and pp delivery at the edge of field 4 3 implications for management practices results from fall 2019 reflected a transition from a period with fallow conditions and no tillage operations to a period with disc tillage and cover crop growth during fall 2019 we found a decrease in tile sediment loading a shift in preferential flow prominence to old water as opposed to new water and a shift in hysteretic patterns we discuss potential factors controlling these shifts and the associated implications in the following paragraphs shifts in hysteretic patterns during fall 2019 following cover crop application likely reflects a shift in the governing mechanisms impacting sediment erosion and delivery to tile drains hysteresis index values of q quick new shifted from linear hysteresis patterns during the fallow period to strong clockwise hysteresis patterns during the period following disc tillage and cover crop planting clockwise loops are indicative of proximal sediment sources or exhaustion of sources on the rising limb of the event williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 at the field scale this clockwise hysteresis pattern may reflect dysconnectivity of subsurface drainage from easily eroded particles from surface soils nouwakpo et al 2010 wilson et al 2016 alternatively it could reflect absence of an easily eroded biocrust that develops between events on macropore walls jacobsen et al 1997 schelde et al 2002 majdalani et al 2007 michel et al 2010 van den bogaert et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 future modeling and tracer based studies are needed at the field scale to better inform sources of sediment i e surface vs subsurface and mechanisms of delivery to subsurface drains both cover crop application and tillage could have impacted the observed preferential flow and sediment dynamics during fall 2019 the ability of cover crops and crop residues to reduce soil erosion has been widely recognized faust et al 2018 hallama et al 2019 liu et al 2019 but its impact on sediment delivery to tile drainage and subsurface erosion dynamics has received limited attention griffith et al 2020 cover crops have been found to reduce soil erosion and transport of sediments because they can reduce surface sheet rill erosion and increase surface water infiltration sharpley et al 1991 kaspar et al 2001 griffith et al 2020 likewise cover crops aid in reducing or preventing formation of the crust layer on soil surfaces ramírez garcia et al 2012 wu et al 2020 gabriel et al 2021 relevant to our findings increased infiltration may have caused the shift to preferential flow dominated by old water and could have decreased the erodibility of surface erosion sources alternatively tillage practices have been found to substantially reduce maximum event water contributions to tile drains in this region immediately after tillage resulting in reduced connectivity of surface contaminants to tiles although the effect is diminished as macropores reestablish williams et al 2016b our results support these previous findings in that q quick new decreased for approximately 2 5 months before becoming the prominent preferential flow water source as well as the prominent sediment source during event s31 these findings highlight potential sensitivity of sediment loadings to surface management practices and are an important area for future work despite the adoption of conservation tillage practices at the study site subsurface tile loadings were high because of preferential flow of event water suggesting management practices should target reductions in q quick new conservation tillage and no till is recognized to reduce time to peak of macropore flow verbree et al 2010 williams et al 2016b resulting in less transit time for sediment retention and higher shear stresses in subsurface pathways based on our results in fall 2019 management practices should target reductions in q quick new to reduce tile sediment loadings for instance water absorbing polymers i e hydrogels enhance soil permeability and infiltration rate and increase water holding capacity narjary et al 2013 hosseini et al 2021 bairwa et al 2020 which may aid in reducing preferential flows of new water further practices such as controlled drainage may reduce preferential flows of new water although the impact of controlled drainage on flow pathway dynamics has not been robustly evaluated cooke and verma 2012 saadat et al 2018 shedekar et al 2020 further work should assess how best management practices in tile drained landscapes may be coupled with conservation tillage practices to reduce subsurface sediment loadings 5 conclusions we employed results from a recently developed flow pathway and source water connectivity framework to predict sediment concentrations in subsurface drainage and found that both sediment and particulate p is regulated by preferential transport of new water reductions in sediment loadings and fractions of preferential flow from new water combined with shifts in sediment hysteresis patterns following tillage and cover crop application suggest management practices focused on reducing q quick new could be an effective strategy for minimizing sediment delivery to tile drains in fine textured soils our results highlight the capability and successful application of high resolution sensors in improving understanding of mechanisms governing sediment transport to tile declaration of

9444,due to the shortage of water for irrigation brewery wastewater is currently used as a source of irrigation for crops in developing countries including ethiopia however there is little information about the influence of brewery wastewater on soil properties crop nutrients and productivity in ethiopia thus this study was conducted to investigate the effect of brewery wastewater on soil physical and chemical characteristics agronomic traits and nutrients composition of lettuce crop wastewater and wastewater irrigated soil samples were collected for laboratory analysis the pot experiment was also conducted in completely randomized design crd with three replications using four treatments where 100 75 50 and 25 of the water demand was covered by brewery wastewater ww where one additional

above the permissible limit of the fao irrigation water quality standard the mean values of t ph tds no3 n ca 2 mg 2 na and magnesium hazard mh were below the permissible limit of the fao standard the pot experiment showed that 100 ww irrigated soils non significantly p 0 05 enhanced the lettuce traits of leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight by 12 22 and 24 over 100 cw irrigated soils

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater use for irrigation purposes is a common practice throughout the world especially in developing countries like ethiopia jiménez 2006 this practice is driven by several factors including easy availability of wastewater scarcity of fresh water resources irrigation water deficit and nutrient enrichment zhang and shen 2021 alayu and leta 2021 the scarcity of freshwater due to climate change is one of the most important challenges for crop production currently climate change is negatively influencing the availability and quality of water resource crop production and food security in the world fao 2012 denicola et al 2015 research report showed that two thirds of mankind in the world will face water shortage problems by 2025 while by 2050 world food production must rise by at least 50 to feed 9 billion people bruinsma 2011 alexandratos 2012 in order to tackle water scarcity 15 million m3 day of untreated wastewater is used globally for crop irrigation polluting the soil with heavy metals excess salts and pathogens ungureanu et al 2020 industries are discharging high amount of wastewater without or with little treatment in to nearby environments oljira et al 2018 almuktar et al 2018 and causing a significant ecological pollution problem alayu and yirgu 2018 wastewater contains a variety of

hg hashem and qi 2021 research report showed that the continuous application of wastewater for irrigation purpose raises the level of toxicity nwajei et al 2012 sauve et al 2000 reduce crop potential sarwar et al 2020 and phytotoxicity due to the content of heavy metal ions gerber et al 2017 charles et al 2011 wastewater has a useful content of nutrients and great potential to be used in irrigation agriculture due to it provides essential nutrients organic carbon organic matter and inorganic micronutrients to the soil and then in turn enhances crop productivity and quality wu et al 2010 libutti and gatta 2015 several studies showed that the importance of wastewater for enhancing irrigated crop productivity because of high concentration of nutrients in this water jang et al 2013 emongor et al 2008 hanjra et al 2012 however generally there are inconsistent research reports on the effect of wastewater irrigation on various crops which may be due to the variation in wastewater characteristics wastewater sources crop species crop sensitivity to a biotic stresses and the crop capacity to strive in a nutrient deficit growing conditions hashem and qi 2021 thus a series of field and pot experiments are required to investigate the characteristic and importance of wastewater irrigation for crop production in various industrial zones in ethiopia many industries have been established in the last decade shiferaw 2017 which will increase the volume of wastewater with high pollution load oljira et al 2018 almuktar et al 2018 to cite a case several industries such as habesha brewery dashen brewery and mineral water bottling factory blanket factory eagle glass factory and flour factory have been established in debreberhan town of ethiopia on top of this the town is selected to be an industrial town which indicates that the industrial development and its associated pollution risk will increase shortly most developing countries like ethiopia are unable to treat their brewery wastewater to the required level due to high costs almuktar et al 2018 habesha brewery is one of the industries in the town that releasing high amount of wastewater into the surrounding environment smallholder farmers are used this wastewater directly for cultivation of vegetable crops cultivation of vegetables using brewery wastewater irrigation is an important source of food nutrition and income for smallholder farmers for example vegetables partially consumed around the industrial zone of the town csa 2018 such as lettuce and potato is produced through wastewater irrigation however there is little information about the characteristics of brewery wastewater for irrigation purpose and its potential effect on soil properties and crop production in this specific industrial zone in particular and in the country in large indeed generating and understanding this information is very useful to design a strategy for sustainable utilization of brewery wastewater in this industrial zone and beyond thereby enhancing and maintaining soil fertility improving crop quality and productivity for current and future agriculture therefore the hypothesis of the study was that the soil basic properties content of heavy metals and lettuce crop growth and productivity and quality traits would be significantly affected by the application of brewery wastewater the objectives of this study were i to characterize the physical chemical properties and heavy metals contents of brewery wastewater for irrigation purpose as compared with the permissible limit of the fao quality standard ii to identify the changes of soil basic properties and heavy metals contents of brewery wastewater irrigation soil samples iii to investigate the effect of brewery wastewater irrigation on growth yield and yield related traits and nutrient composition of lettuce crop 2 material and method 2 1 description of the study area this study was conducted in the habesha brewery

unimodal rainfall pattern and received an annual rainfall of 968 mm 10 years data from 2008 to 2017 debreberhan meteorological station unpublished data the climate water balance of the study area which is precipitation versus reference evapo transpiration eto shown in fig 2 2 2 control water and brewery wastewater sampling methods and data collection two brewery wastewater samples at two sites were taken from march 2021 to june 2021 table 1 fig 3 site one was after the storage pond site two was at the end of the command area for comparison purpose fresh or raw water control was used in this study table 1 the sampling was taken three times throughout the respective time a liter of water sample was collected at each site in a plastic bottle which is thoroughly cleaned by distilled water and washed by its wastewater before taking the sample keraga 2019 the method of sample collection at each sampling point was done according to guidelines who 1989 for water quality assessment and standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater and the water laboratory manual apha 1998 the collected samples were stored at a temperature below 4 c in an icebox containing ice freezer packs before the laboratory for analysis physical chemical and heavy metals parameters were collected from brewery wastewater and control water table 2 mean values of the parameters in the control

were taken from brewery wastewater irrigated soil at the depth of 0 20 cm using an auger for comparison purpose adjacent soil samples which were not irrigated by brewery wastewater control were used in this study after carefully mixing the composite samples 500 g of sub samples was taken and put in a plastic bag and brought to debreberhan agriculture research center and horticop soil laboratory physical chemical soil properties were analyzed at debre birhan agricultural research center and horti cop plc soil laboratory according to the soil and plant analysis laboratory manual ryan et al 2001 the composite soil samples were prepared with air drying at room temperature ground using a pestle and a mortar and allow passing through a 2 mm sieve changwen et al 2007 working samples were

comparisons were done by duncan s multiple range tests at the 5 level gomez and gomez 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical chemical analysis of brewery wastewater and control water the mean temperature values for the control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 the highest mean value of temperature was observed in site one 220 c followed by site two 210 c while the lowest mean temperature was measured in control water 180 c table 4 this might be happened due to the supply of warm water from industrial processing plants it was known that the temperature of water samples taken from different places is might have different mean values based on the ambient temperature of the study area the temperature of water affects the usefulness of water for many purposes because of its influence on water chemistry the rate of chemical reactions generally increases at higher temperature davidson et al 2006 water with higher temperatures can dissolve more minerals from the surrounding rock and will therefore have a higher electrical conductivity the solubility of oxygen and other gases will decrease as temperature increases jacquemin et al 2006 this means that if water is too warm it will not hold enough oxygen for aquatic organisms to survive according to fao 1985 standard the mean temperature in all sample sites was in acceptable ranges table 4 and it is appropriate for irrigated crop production in the study area the mean ph values for the control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 extreme ph affects the bioavailability of certain nutrients in the irrigation faming system e g phosphate is precipitated at high ph and fixed with aluminum compounds at low ph jiménez 2006 the result showed that highest 8 37 ph was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 7 2 in control water showing that the ph of wastewater is generally alkaline a similar finding with this study by bhutiani et al 2016 indicated that the ph of wastewater is generally alkaline and this may associated with the presence of compounds such as carbonate bicarbonate or hydroxide in industrial processes can increase the alkalinity of wastewater the high level of alkalinity in water may be an indication of industrial pollution omer 2019 the acceptable ranges of ph are 6 5 8 4 for normal irrigation water fao 1985 the result showed that the ph value of brewery wastewater is in the acceptable range for irrigation water table 4 the mean electric conductivity ec values for the control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 the highest value of electrical conductivity ec was measured in site one 3 21 ds m followed by site two of brewery wastewater while the lowest ec value was recorded in control water 0 23ds m table 4 indicating that the ec value of brewery wastewater was higher than in control water this variation in ec might be due to excessive dissolved solids in brewery industry wastewater the conductivity of water is a more or less linear function of the concentration of dissolved ions if the conductivity of wastewater increases it indicates there is a source of dissolved ions in the industrial process therefore conductance can be used to detect pollution sources stoddard et al 1999 this result agrees with the finding of bhutiani et al 2016 who reported that the value of ec in the control water is lower than in brewery wastewater in the present study the values of ec in the wastewater are above the range of the standard limits of fao 3ds m these results indicate that wastewater from habesha brewery wastewater was considerably ionized and has a higher level of electrical conductivity due to excessive dissolved solids which restricts water to use for irrigation purposes table 4 the effect of salinity ec on the osmotic pressure in the soil is one of the most important water quality considerations because this influences the availability of water for plant consumption toze 2006 this can be treated by chemicals such as gypsum and mixed with normal water to reduce the amount of concentration in wastewater and these kinds of wastewater can be used for irrigation with highly tolerant vegetation the mean total dissolved solids tds values for the control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 tds is one of the most important agricultural water quality parameters used to estimate the suitability of water for irrigation deshpande and aher 2012 tds showed a highly significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater the highest 1450 33 mg l tds was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 133 mg l in control water table 4 indicating that the tds value was significantly increased from control water to brewery wastewater this is might be happening due to the high quantity of pollutants in brewery industry wastewater this result agreed with previous finding of bhutiani et al 2016 that has shown tds mean value was lower at control water than at wastewater tds had lower mean values for all sample sites than the acceptable limit value 2000 mg l set for irrigation purposes fao 1985 hence it is suitable for irrigated crop production purposes table 4 the mean total suspended solids tss concentration values for the control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 tss concentration is a measure of the number of materials suspended in water which includes a wide range of sizes of materials from silt and plankton to industrial wastes and sewage tss showed a significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater the highest 1147 00 mg l tss was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 57 mg l in control water this showed that the lowest value was found in control water as compared to brewery wastewater tss and similar finding reported by bhutiani et al 2016 the result showed that the tss concentration is more pronounced at the sites of brewery wastewater these sampling sites are located near the habesha brewery industry in which the brewery wastewater might contribute to a load of total suspended solids table 4 all the tss values at the sampling sites were above standards for effluent discharges to the irrigation purpose table 4 fao 1985 indicating that it is not suitable for irrigation purposes to grow crops the suspended solids in water systems reduce clarity and contribute to a decrease in photosynthesis act as binding sites for toxic substances and lead to increase water temperature through the absorption of sunlight fao 1985 research report showed that the application of treatments to the wastewater was significantly effective for the removal of tss up to 96 9 from wastewater wilson et al 2011 the mean biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod values for control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 bod is the amount of dissolved oxygen taken up by aerobic microorganisms to degrade oxidizable organic matter present in water measured throughout 5 d basha et al 2009 bod of wastewater is an important criterion for judging the suitability of wastewaters for irrigation the lower the bod value the better is the water quality and the higher the bod value the lower water quality for irrigation tomas et al 2017 the result showed that a significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater for bod table 4 the highest 97 00 mg l in site one and 91 33 mg l in site two bod was recorded in brewery wastewater which is above the acceptable limit of fao standard fao and lowest 0 5 mg l value was recorded in control water the higher the bod indicates higher pollutants due to presence of higher concentration of tss tds ts cod etc and heavy metals in wastewater singh et al 2012 therefore it could be concluded that the bod value of the wastewater is not appropriate for irrigation chemical oxygen demand cod is used as a measure of an equivalent amount of oxygen required to completely oxidize both biodegradable and non biodegradable organic and inorganic matter orhon and çokgör 1997 the highest 160 67 mg l cod value was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while lowest 33 6 mg l in the control water table 4 the value for cod was higher than the fao safe limit 60 mg l showing that the brewery wastewater is not appropriate for irrigation purposes the result also showed that a highly significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater for cod table 4 indicating that the wastewater may not be treated to the standard level similar to bod the higher the cod indicates higher pollutants in wastewater which might be happening due to the presence of a large number of solids released from brewery industry wastewater this affects the availability of oxygen to decompose organic matter and the shortage of oxygen supply for micro organisms in soil dhir et al 2018 research report suggested that application of treatments to the wastewater is significantly effective for the removal of bod and cod contents from wastewater wilson et al 2011 they also showed that a well designed sand filter had a maximum bod removal capacity up to 98 4 and it can be used in blended wastewater treatment applications the mean nitrate nitrogen no3 n and bicarbonate hco3 values for control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 the highest values 22 97 mg l and 111 6 mg l to 1554 89 mg l respectively no3 n and hco3 were recorded in brewery wastewaters while the lowest values 5 56 mg l and 111 6 mg l respectively in control waters table 4 the result of the laboratory analysis of no3 n from habehsa brewery wastewater was found below the limit set by fao standard fao 1985 indicating that the no3 n concentration from the brewery wastewater is appropriate for agricultural irrigation the high amount of nitrogen applied to soil for crops causes more vegetative growth and delays ripening resulting in poorly colored fruit delgado et al 2004 the concentration of hco3 from wastewater was above the recommended level of fao standard thus it is not suitable for irrigation purposes table 4 high concentration of bicarbonates hco3 in wastewater tends to precipitate calcium carbonate caco3 and magnesium carbonate mgco3 when the soil solution becomes concentrated through evapo transpiration due to increment of temperature this causes the higher value for sar and then increases the sodium hazard of the soil water shishaye 2017 the mean cat ions ca 2 mg 2 na and k values for control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 the results of the laboratory analysis of ca 2 mg 2 and na in brewery wastewater were found below the permissible limit set by fao indicating that their concentration is suitable for irrigation purpose however the value of k from the laboratory analysis is above the standard set by fao 1985 indicating that the concentration of k is not suitable for irrigation purposes research report showed that wastewater is rich in cat ions such as na k ca2 and mg2 rahman et al 2013 the mean sar ssp and mh values for control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 the lowest mean values were found in the control water while the higher mean values were found in brewery wastewater sites table 4 the results of the laboratory analysis of sar and ssp for brewery wastewater were found above the limit set by fao 15 meq l and 60 respectively the mean values of sar and ssp indicating that the use of brewery wastewater are not appropriate for irrigation purposes the highest 21 15 mh was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 22 18 in control this value is lower than the fao safe limits 50 indicating that it is appropriate for agricultural irrigation from the laboratory result value of ec and sar brewery wastewater was greater than 2 250ds m 1 salinity level which is categorized under the c4 salinity class and greater than 26 mmoles l 1sodicity level which is categorized under the s4 sod city class of irrigation water respectively table 5 therefore based on the classification of irrigation water u s s l 1954 the result showed that the wastewater from habesha brewery is classified as saline sodic in order to enhance the quality of brewery wastewater in general the habesha brewery industry should treat its wastewater to the standard level using appropriate methods and there should be continues monitoring of this wastewater 3 2 heavy metals analysis of control water and brewery wastewater the mean heavy metals values for control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 6 the contents of fe mn zn cu b pb cr co hg ni and mo were higher in brewery wastewater than control water the heavy metals such as cd mo and as were above the limit value set by fao 1985 which have an effect on human health through the food chain process however other heavy metals including fe mn cu b pb cr co hg and ni in brewery wastewater were found below the limit set by fao 1985 and the wastewater is appropriate for irrigation purposes 3 3 physical chemical analysis of brewery wastewater irrigated and control soil the highest 1 3 gm cm3 bulk density was recorded in control irrigates soils while the lowest 1 29 gm cm3 in wastewater water irrigated soil table 7 indicating that the bulk density of control water irrigated soil was higher than brewery wastewater irrigated soil samples and this may be associated with the increment of organic matter in irrigated by wastewater hemmat et al 2010 according to him there was a significant relationship between the application rate of the manures and the soil organic carbone the relationship with the soil bd was significantly negative the highest value 32 7 moisture content was recorded in brewery wastewater irrigated site one while the lowest 18 58 in the control irrigated soil sample table 7 this may be related to the presence of organic matter in wastewater from the brewery industry yao et al 2013 the mean organic matter om and organic carbon oc values for wastewater irrigated soil and control wastewater irrigated soil are presented in table 7 the highest values 4 9 and 2 9 respectively for om and oc were recorded in wastewater irrigated soils while the lowest values 3 11 and 1 8 respectively in control water irrigated soil table 7 research report showed that om was higher values in wastewater irrigated soil than control water irrigated soil charman and roper 2007 this result is supported by singh et al 2010 who reported that the nutrients and organic matter added by sewage irrigation may enhance the activities of soil microorganisms and also increment organic carbon oc level in soil with wastewater irrigation compared with non wastewater irrigation farms research report also indicated that there is an increase of 47 9 in oc content of topsoil 0 15 cm receiving industrial wastewater for irrigation as compared to control water irrigated soil bansal et al 1992 higher oc content increases organic matter in soil within turn increases the cat ion exchange capacity cec in soil ramos et al 2018 the mean ph and electrical conductivity ec values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 7 the level of ph ranged from 6 65 in control water irrigated soil to 6 8 in wastewater irrigated soil of site one the values in wastewater irrigated sites were slightly higher compared to the control irrigated site this slight ph change can be attributed to the release of exchangeable cat ions during the mineralization of organic matter woomer et al 1994 in addition a research report showed that the ph values increased from farmland irrigated by freshwater to wastewater irrigated land due to the increased exchangeable sodium ions in wastewater jahan et al 2019 the highest 0 7 ds m ec was recorded in wastewater irrigated soil in site one while the lowest 0 081ds m in control water irrigated soil this may be associated with the mobility of ions their valences and their actual and relative concentration feigin et al 2012 similar finding with this result by jahan et al 2019 showed that the value of ec due to the increase of concentration of the physicochemical in wastewater compared to freshwater the value of ec is increased due to high concentration of salts and soil salinity causes reduce soil hydraulic conductivity and soil dispersion muyen et al 2011 further study is required to quantify the brewery effect of soil salinity heavy metal content on irrigated farm the mean cat ions ca2 mg2 na and k values for wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 7 cat ions mean levels ranged from 1916 32 to 2921 4 mg kg for ca2 367 39 594 91 mg kg for mg2 35 54 2667 74 mg kg for na and 152 46 248 3 mg kg for k in different soil samples the highest and lowest values of ca2 mg2 na and k were found in wastewater irrigated soil site one and control water irrigated soil respectively indicating that the cat ions concentration level of irrigated land by wastewater is higher than control irrigated farmland this result was in agreement with the findings of jahan et al 2019 galavi et al 2010 kiziloglu et al 2008 who reported that irrigation with wastewater increased exchangeable cations na k ca2 mg2 in the soil compared to control water irrigated soil the mean nutrient and anions no3 n cl p and so4 2 values for wastewater irrigated soil and control irrigated soil are presented in table 7 nutrient and anions mean concentration ranged from 78 73 to 278 6 mg kg for no3 n 1 170 2 mg kg for cl 15 09 85 09 mg kg for p and 14 48 21 8 mg kg for so4 2 in soil samples the current result indicated that the number of nutrients and anions concentrations in wastewater irrigated soil was found higher than control water irrigated soil table 7 similar results were reported by jahan et al 2019 and khaskhoussy et al 2013 in general continuous application of wastewater to the soil with high amounts of cations nutrients and anions lead in certain crops may be sensitive to the presence of moderate to high concentrations of specific ions in the irrigation waters or soil solution simsek and gunduz 2007 the concentration affects the soil and crops to cite a case high chloride levels in water may cause poor growth and death to sensitive plants particularly if sprayed onto the leaves kaya et al 2007 the mean sar ssp and mh values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 7 the highest 63 68 meq kg sar was recorded in brewery wastewater irrigated soil site one while the lowest 1 05 meq kg in the control irrigated soil sample table 7 the values of sar increased from control water irrigated soil to wastewater irrigated soil research reports showed that the effect of wastewater irrigation on the chemical properties of soil increased the na content of the soil jahan et al 2019 moreover prolonged use of wastewater with a high sar value leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil a situation caused by excessive amounts of adsorbed sodium on soil colloids halliwell et al 2001 the highest values 41 47 and 16 92 respectively ssp and mh were recorded in brewery wastewater irrigated soil while the lowest 1 44 and 16 09 respectively in control water irrigated soil table 7 showing the values of ssp and mh were higher in brewery wastewater irrigated soil than control water irrigated soil continued use of wastewater with a high ssp value leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil soil structure deterioration and this affects soil infiltration rate and soil permeability alobaidy et al 2010 3 4 heavy metals analysis of brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control soil the mean heavy metals values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control irrigated soil are presented in table 8 heavy metal mean values for fe mn zn cu pb cd co and hg were 237 3 99 285 2 785 0 575 0 735 0 235 0 885 and 0 4 mg kg and the ranges were 184 16 248 09 mg kg 32 97 123 06 mg kg 2 06 3 06 mg kg 0 2 0 58 mg kg 0 6 0 74 mg kg 0 19 0 25 mg kg 0 83 0 93 mg kg and 0 31 0 41 mg kg respectively table 8 these values of heavy metals are below the maximum limit standard table 8 the result showed that the values of heavy metals were higher in brewery wastewater irrigated sites than in the control water irrigated soil table 8 this result is in agreement with previous findings of mahmood and malik 2014 gupta et al 2010 and sinha et al 2006 where the content of heavy metals increased in the wastewater irrigated soils as compared with control water irrigated soils according to qishlaqi et al 2008 continuous use of wastewater to the farm with high concentration of heavy potential impact on soil and crop yield the mean heavy metals ni and mo values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 8 the level of ni and mo in the soil sample obtained from different sites ranged from 0 59 to 1 52 mg kg and 0 36 0 44 mg kg which are below the permissible value of dutch standard 35 mg kg and 3 mg kg respectively table 8 research report shows that continued use of wastewater with a high amount of ni and mo have a potential to cause health problems khan et al 2017 the highest values of ni and mo were found in brewery wastewater irrigated soil while the lowest values were found in control irrigated soils table 8 in line with this mahmood and malik 2014 gupta et al 2010 and sinha et al 2006 reported that the ni and mo contents were increased in the wastewater irrigated soils as compared with control irrigated soils heavy metals accumulation in the soil harms the growth of crop species nwajei et al 2012 thus future study is important to quantify the change in heavy metal contents in wastewater irrigated soil around the industrial zone of the town 3 5 effect of brewery wastewater on lettuce growth and yield traits the effect of five different treatments on lettuce growth and yield related traits are presented in table 9 the result showed that 100 ww irrigated soil was non significantly p 0 05 enhanced the lettuce traits of leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight by 12 22 and 24 over 100 cw irrigated soil respectively the numerical increments of these measured traits may be associated with the presence of higher nutrients content in brewery wastewater than control water table 4 wastewater irrigation enriches soils with essential nutrients that improves soil fertility and enhance crop growth productivity and quality wu et al 2010 libutti and gatta 2015 the result also showed that there was a significant difference p 0 05 among treatments for plant height of lettuce table 9 the application of 100 ww resulted in the highest plant height 15 33 cm while the application of 100 cw of treatment resulted in the lowest plant height 11 33 cm in the lettuce crop research reported showed that plant growth was enhanced due to the application of wastewater irrigation libutti and gatta 2015 plant height is significantly increased by the concentration of wastewater used for irrigation compared with different wastewater concentration treatment applications parveen et al 2015 the leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaves weight were not significantly p 0 05 affected by brewery wastewater treatments table 9 the highest fresh leaf weight 318 33 g plant was recorded for the application of 100 ww brewery wastewater and while the lowest fresh leaf weight 250 g plant was obtained from the control water irrigation soil table 9 the higher value of leaf length and number of leaves were obtained from 100 ww treatment application while the lower values of these traits were recorded in 100 cw treatment application this could be related to the presence of a higher amount of nutrients in brewery wastewater irrigated soils compared to control water irrigated soil table 9 khan et al 2011 have been reported that the use of wastewater irrigation increases the growth of vegetables due to the enrichments of macro and micronutrients as well as organic matter in wastewater compare to freshwater irrigation land research report showed that leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight are significantly affected by the concentration of wastewater used for irrigation compared with different wastewater concentration treatment applications which are an increase from freshwater to 100 wastewater treatment application parveen et al 2015 3 6 effect of brewery wastewater on nutrient compositions of lettuce leaf the effect of five different treatments on the nutrients composition of lettuce is presented in table 10 the nutrients concentrations of ca2 mg2 k na fe mn zn and tn were highly significant p 0 05 influenced by brewery wastewater irrigation and cu was not significantly p 0 05 affected by brewery wastewater treatment application table 10 the highest and lowest levels of concentrations were found in 100 ww and freshwater application of irrigation water respectively indicating that the amount of ca2 mg2 k na fe mn zn and tn found in the lettuce samples were higher in brewery wastewater irrigated soils than in control irrigated soils and this may be associated with the presence of a high amount of nutrients in wastewater irrigated land khan et al 2011 similarly awgchew et al 2015 and zavadil 2009 reported that the concentrations of heavy metals found in the vegetable samples were higher in wastewater irrigated farm than control water irrigated farm research report showed that the application of wastewaters irrigation significantly increased the concentration of heavy metals in the edible parts of vegetables crop abdel sabour et al 2003 gupta et al 2012 arora et al 2008 and sinha et al 2006 khan et al 2011 further research is important to monitor the brewery effect of heavy metal content and nutrients composition on irrigated crop 4 conclusion the current study showed that there was a significant p 0 05 difference between the brewery wastewater and control water for most of physical chemical contents the analysis of physical chemical contents for brewery wastewater samples indicated that the values for ec tss bod cod hco3 k ssp and sar levels were above the permissible limit of the fao irrigation water quality standard indicating this brewery wastewater is not appropriate for irrigated crop production the mean values of t ph tds no3 n ca 2 mg 2 na and mh were below the permissible limit of the fao standard most heavy metals fe mn cu b pb cr co hg ni and mo in brewery wastewater samples were below the permissible limit except for cd and as the soil samples from the brewery wastewater irrigated soils were featured by higher physical chemical contents om oc ph ec no3 n cl ca2 mg2 na k p so42 sar ssp and mh and heavy metal contents fe mn zn cu pb cd as co hg ni and mo than control water irrigated soils the study showed that the brewery wastewater is classified as saline sodic therefore this wastewater should be treated to the standard level before use for irrigation the pot experiment showed that the applications of brewery wastewater irrigation were non significantly affected the growth and yield related traits of lettuce crop except plant height the 100 ww irrigation enhanced the lettuce traits of leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight by 12 22 and 24 respectively over 100 cw irrigated soils the brewery wastewater irrigations significantly p 0 05 enhanced nutrient compositions of lettuce leaf ca2 mg2 na k fe zn and mn the 50 ww 50 cw irrigation showed an interesting result on lettuce crop nutrient composition and productivity overall long term utilization of this wastewater for irrigation purpose may rise the levels of ec tss bod cod hco3 ssp sar and heavy metals in the small scale farm which will affect soil fertility crop productivity and quality for future agriculture therefore amelioration measures seem to be inevitable such as gypsum and there should be continuous monitoring and evaluation for the quality status of brewery wastewater before use for irrigation purposes future study is required to investigate and monitor the change on soil characteristic and nutrients of crops for designing a

9444,due to the shortage of water for irrigation brewery wastewater is currently used as a source of irrigation for crops in developing countries including ethiopia however there is little information about the influence of brewery wastewater on soil properties crop nutrients and productivity in ethiopia thus this study was conducted to investigate the effect of brewery wastewater on soil physical and chemical characteristics agronomic traits and nutrients composition of lettuce crop wastewater and wastewater irrigated soil samples were collected for laboratory analysis the pot experiment was also conducted in completely randomized design crd with three replications using four treatments where 100 75 50 and 25 of the water demand was covered by brewery wastewater ww where one additional treatment namely 100 control water cw was used the analysis of physical chemical contents for brewery wastewater samples indicated that the values for ec tss bod cod hco3 k ssp and sar levels were above the permissible limit of the fao irrigation water quality standard the mean values of t ph tds no3 n ca 2 mg 2 na and magnesium hazard mh were below the permissible limit of the fao standard the pot experiment showed that 100 ww irrigated soils non significantly p 0 05 enhanced the lettuce traits of leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight by 12 22 and 24 over 100 cw irrigated soils in addition 100 ww irrigation significantly p 0 05 enhanced the plant height and nutrient compositions ca2 mg2 na k fe zn mn and tn of lettuce leaf the study concludes that the brewery wastewater is saline sodic and it affects soil characteristics and lettuce crop therefore ameliorative measures such as gypsum seem to be inevitable and there should be continuous monitoring and evaluation for the

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater use for irrigation purposes is a common practice throughout the world especially in developing countries like ethiopia jiménez 2006 this practice is driven by several factors including easy availability of wastewater scarcity of fresh water resources irrigation water deficit and nutrient enrichment zhang and shen 2021 alayu and leta 2021 the scarcity of freshwater due to climate change is one of the most important challenges for crop production currently climate change is negatively influencing the availability and quality of water resource crop production and food security in the world fao 2012 denicola et al 2015 research report showed that two thirds of mankind in the world will face water shortage problems by 2025 while by 2050 world food production must rise by at least 50 to feed 9 billion people bruinsma 2011 alexandratos 2012 in order to tackle water scarcity 15 million m3 day of untreated wastewater is used globally for crop irrigation polluting the soil with heavy metals excess salts and pathogens ungureanu et al 2020 industries are discharging high amount of wastewater without or with little treatment in to nearby environments oljira et al 2018 almuktar et al 2018 and causing a significant ecological pollution problem alayu and yirgu 2018 wastewater contains a variety of

hg hashem and qi 2021 research report showed that the continuous application of wastewater for irrigation purpose raises the level of toxicity nwajei et al 2012 sauve et al 2000 reduce crop potential sarwar et al 2020 and phytotoxicity due to the content of heavy metal ions gerber et al 2017 charles et al 2011 wastewater has a useful content of nutrients and great potential to be used in irrigation agriculture due to it provides essential nutrients organic carbon organic matter and inorganic micronutrients to the soil and then in turn enhances crop productivity and quality wu et al 2010 libutti and gatta 2015 several studies showed that the importance of wastewater for enhancing irrigated crop productivity because of high concentration of nutrients in this water jang et al 2013 emongor et al 2008 hanjra et al 2012 however generally there are inconsistent research reports on the effect of wastewater irrigation on various crops which may be due to the variation in wastewater characteristics wastewater sources crop species crop sensitivity to a biotic stresses and the crop capacity to strive in a nutrient deficit growing conditions hashem and qi 2021 thus a series of field and pot experiments are required to investigate the characteristic and importance of wastewater irrigation for crop production in various industrial zones in ethiopia many industries have been established in the last decade shiferaw 2017 which will increase the volume of wastewater with high pollution load oljira et al 2018 almuktar et al 2018 to cite a case several industries such as habesha brewery dashen brewery and mineral water bottling factory blanket factory eagle glass factory and flour factory have been established in debreberhan town of ethiopia on top of this the town is selected to be an industrial town which indicates that the industrial development and its associated pollution risk will increase shortly most developing countries like ethiopia are unable to treat their brewery wastewater to the required level due to high costs almuktar et al 2018 habesha brewery is one of the industries in the town that releasing high amount of wastewater into the surrounding environment smallholder farmers are used this wastewater directly for cultivation of vegetable crops cultivation of vegetables using brewery wastewater irrigation is an important source of food nutrition and income for smallholder farmers for example vegetables partially consumed around the industrial zone of the town csa 2018 such as lettuce and potato is produced through wastewater irrigation however there is little information about the characteristics of brewery wastewater for irrigation purpose and its potential effect on soil properties and crop production in this specific industrial zone in particular and in the country in large indeed generating and understanding this information is very useful to design a strategy for sustainable utilization of brewery wastewater in this industrial zone and beyond thereby enhancing and maintaining soil fertility improving crop quality and productivity for current and future agriculture therefore the hypothesis of the study was that the soil basic properties content of heavy metals and lettuce crop growth and productivity and quality traits would be significantly affected by the application of brewery wastewater the objectives of this study were i to characterize the physical chemical properties and heavy metals contents of brewery wastewater for irrigation purpose as compared with the permissible limit of the fao quality standard ii to identify the changes of soil basic properties and heavy metals contents of brewery wastewater irrigation soil samples iii to investigate the effect of brewery wastewater irrigation on growth yield and yield related traits and nutrient composition of lettuce crop 2 material and method 2 1 description of the study area this study was conducted in the habesha brewery industry located in the amhara national regional state north shewa zone debreberhan city debreberhan city is found in the semen shewa zone of amhara region about 120 kilometers northeast of addis ababa on the paved highway to dessie geographically the town is located between 9039 9041 n 390 31 39032 e and at an altitude of 2751 2840 m above sea level the habesha brewery industry is located about 5 km southeast from the debreberhan to addis ababa the location map of the study area is shown in fig 1 debreberhan has the dega agro ecologic zone with the annual minimum and maximum temperature range from 3 41 to 8 730 c and 18 460 c 21 840 c respectively the annual average minimum and maximum air temperatures are 6 45 and 20 20 c respectively the area is characterized by a unimodal rainfall pattern and received an annual rainfall of 968 mm 10 years data from 2008 to 2017 debreberhan meteorological station unpublished data the climate water balance of the study area which is precipitation versus reference evapo transpiration eto shown in fig 2 2 2 control water and brewery wastewater sampling methods and data collection two brewery wastewater samples at two sites were taken from march 2021 to june 2021 table 1 fig 3 site one was after the storage pond site two was at the end of the command area for comparison purpose fresh or raw water control was used in this study table 1 the sampling was taken three times throughout the respective time a liter of water sample was collected at each site in a plastic bottle which is thoroughly cleaned by distilled water and washed by its wastewater before taking the sample keraga 2019 the method of sample collection at each sampling point was done according to guidelines who 1989 for water quality assessment and standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater and the water laboratory manual apha 1998 the collected samples were stored at a temperature below 4 c in an icebox containing ice freezer packs before the laboratory for analysis physical chemical and heavy metals parameters were collected from brewery wastewater and control water table 2 mean values of the parameters in the control water and the brewery wastewater was compared with the most recognized and irrigation water quality standards set by the food and agriculture organizations fao 1985 2004 table 2 the water temperature ph tds and ec were determined by portable ph ec tds 0c meters hi9813 6 the parameters including calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k phosphorus p sulfate s boron b iron fe manganese mn copper cu zinc zn molybdenum mo silicon si arsenic as lead pb nickel ni cobalt co chromium cr cadmium cd and mercury hg were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes parameter such as nitrate nitrogen no3 n bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl were analyzed using the es iso 7890 3 2001 iso 9963 2 and es iso 9297 2001 respectively the bod and cod were determined by apha 5210 b 5 day bod and apha 5220b open reflux method respectively apha 1998 2 3 brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control irrigated soil sampling methods and data collection the soil samples were taken from brewery wastewater irrigated soil at the depth of 0 20 cm using an auger for comparison purpose adjacent soil samples which were not irrigated by brewery wastewater control were used in this study after carefully mixing the composite samples 500 g of sub samples was taken and put in a plastic bag and brought to debreberhan agriculture research center and horticop soil laboratory physical chemical soil properties were analyzed at debre birhan agricultural research center and horti cop plc soil laboratory according to the soil and plant analysis laboratory manual ryan et al 2001 the composite soil samples were prepared with air drying at room temperature ground using a pestle and a mortar and allow passing through a 2 mm sieve changwen et al 2007 working samples were obtained from bulk sample and was analyzed to determine the soil physio chemical properties like soil organic matter organic carbon soil texture bulk density ph ec sodium magnesium calcium potassium copper iron manganese zinc cadmium phosphorus nitrate sulphate lead arsenic mercury nickel sodium adsorption ratio sar and soluble sodium percentage ssp to assesse the concentration status of the irrigated with brewery wastewatr and control water irrigatedsoils the soil texture was analyzed by using bouyoucous hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 the ph of the soil was measured using the ph water method by making soil to water suspension of 1 2 5 ratios and measured using a ph meter the soil organic carbon oc was determined by using the rapid titration method walkley and black 1934 and the organic matter om content was estimated by multiplying oc by 1 724 pribyl 2010 the parameters of calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k phosphorus p sulphate s boron b iron fe manganese mn copper cu zinc zn molybdenum mo silicon si arsenic as lead pb nickel ni cobalt co chromium cr cadmium cd and mercury hg analyzed by the method of mehlich 3 extractant mehlich 1978 in addition the soil parameter of nitrate nitrogen no3 n and chloride cl were determined by es iso 7890 3 2001 and es iso 9297 2001methods respectively sodium hazard is usually expressed in terms of sodium adsorption ratio sar and it can be calculated from the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium nishanthiny et al 2010 the sar is calculated by eq 2 1 2 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where na ca2 and mg2 are in meq

in meq l water with ssp greater than 60 may result in sodium accumulations that cause the breakdown of the soil s physical structure a magnesium hazard mh value for irrigation water was reported by szabolcs and darab 1964 and it is calculated using the eq 2 3 2 3 mh mg 2 mg 2 ca 2 100 if the value of mh is less than 50 then the water is safe and suitable for irrigation 2 4 experimental design

control water on lettuce crop was laid out using completely randomized design crd with three replications table 3 the rate of fertilizer for lettuce was applied 150 kg ha 1 urea the crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling over the growing season was determined using by cropwat 8 1 model the lettuce leaf samples were collected from the undamaged and matured edible parts of the crops from the pot experiment in the last week of june 2021 from each plant in addition agronomic measured traits for plant height leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight were collected from lettuce plant the leaf samples were cleaned with water and plenty of distilled water to remove the dust and waxy coating the leaf samples were air dried on a clean plastic tray at room temperature for a week in a dust free atmosphere and oven dried at 65 c for 72 h until received constant weight and ground in an electric stainless steel mill and sieved through a 1 mm sieve and stored in glass desiccators until analysis time mehmood et al 2017 for laboratory nutrient composition analysis of lettuce the laboratory data were collected for physical chemical and heavy metals including sodium magnesium calcium potassium sulfur phosphorus manganese iron copper and zinc 2 5 stastical analysis the descriptive statistics of physical chemical properties and heavy metal contents in control water and brewery wastewater and soil samples were analyzed using the r statistical software r core team 2018 mean values of the physical chemical properties and heavy metal contents in the control water and the brewery wastewater were compared with the most recognized and irrigation water quality standards set by the food and agriculture organizations fao 1985 2004 table 2 the assumption of normality was checked for lettuce agronomic traits and nutrients composition using the r statistical software r core team 2018 lettuce agronomic traits for leaf length plant height number of leaf fresh leaf weight and nutrient composition data for ca2 mg2 k na fe cu mn zn and tn were analyzed using the procedure for completely randomized design crd of sas software version 9 1 sas institute 2004 mean comparisons were done by duncan s multiple range tests at the 5 level gomez and gomez 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical chemical analysis of brewery wastewater and control water the mean temperature values for the control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 the highest mean value of temperature was observed in site one 220 c followed by site two 210 c while the lowest mean temperature was measured in control water 180 c table 4 this might be happened due to the supply of warm water from industrial processing plants it was known that the temperature of water samples taken from different places is might have different mean values based on the ambient temperature of the study area the temperature of water affects the usefulness of water for many purposes because of its influence on water chemistry the rate of chemical reactions generally increases at higher temperature davidson et al 2006 water with higher temperatures can dissolve more minerals from the surrounding rock and will therefore have a higher electrical conductivity the solubility of oxygen and other gases will decrease as temperature increases jacquemin et al 2006 this means that if water is too warm it will not hold enough oxygen for aquatic organisms to survive according to fao 1985 standard the mean temperature in all sample sites was in acceptable ranges table 4 and it is appropriate for irrigated crop production in the study area the mean ph values for the control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 extreme ph affects the bioavailability of certain nutrients in the irrigation faming system e g phosphate is precipitated at high ph and fixed with aluminum compounds at low ph jiménez 2006 the result showed that highest 8 37 ph was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 7 2 in control water showing that the ph of wastewater is generally alkaline a similar finding with this study by bhutiani et al 2016 indicated that the ph of wastewater is generally alkaline and this may associated with the presence of compounds such as carbonate bicarbonate or hydroxide in industrial processes can increase the alkalinity of wastewater the high level of alkalinity in water may be an indication of industrial pollution omer 2019 the acceptable ranges of ph are 6 5 8 4 for normal irrigation water fao 1985 the result showed that the ph value of brewery wastewater is in the acceptable range for irrigation water table 4 the mean electric conductivity ec values for the control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 the highest value of electrical conductivity ec was measured in site one 3 21 ds m followed by site two of brewery wastewater while the lowest ec value was recorded in control water 0 23ds m table 4 indicating that the ec value of brewery wastewater was higher than in control water this variation in ec might be due to excessive dissolved solids in brewery industry wastewater the conductivity of water is a more or less linear function of the concentration of dissolved ions if the conductivity of wastewater increases it indicates there is a source of dissolved ions in the industrial process therefore conductance can be used to detect pollution sources stoddard et al 1999 this result agrees with the finding of bhutiani et al 2016 who reported that the value of ec in the control water is lower than in brewery wastewater in the present study the values of ec in the wastewater are above the range of the standard limits of fao 3ds m these results indicate that wastewater from habesha brewery wastewater was considerably ionized and has a higher level of electrical conductivity due to excessive dissolved solids which restricts water to use for irrigation purposes table 4 the effect of salinity ec on the osmotic pressure in the soil is one of the most important water quality considerations because this influences the availability of water for plant consumption toze 2006 this can be treated by chemicals such as gypsum and mixed with normal water to reduce the amount of concentration in wastewater and these kinds of wastewater can be used for irrigation with highly tolerant vegetation the mean total dissolved solids tds values for the control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 tds is one of the most important agricultural water quality parameters used to estimate the suitability of water for irrigation deshpande and aher 2012 tds showed a highly significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater the highest 1450 33 mg l tds was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 133 mg l in control water table 4 indicating that the tds value was significantly increased from control water to brewery wastewater this is might be happening due to the high quantity of pollutants in brewery industry wastewater this result agreed with previous finding of bhutiani et al 2016 that has shown tds mean value was lower at control water than at wastewater tds had lower mean values for all sample sites than the acceptable limit value 2000 mg l set for irrigation purposes fao 1985 hence it is suitable for irrigated crop production purposes table 4 the mean total suspended solids tss concentration values for the control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 tss concentration is a measure of the number of materials suspended in water which includes a wide range of sizes of materials from silt and plankton to industrial wastes and sewage tss showed a significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater the highest 1147 00 mg l tss was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 57 mg l in control water this showed that the lowest value was found in control water as compared to brewery wastewater tss and similar finding reported by bhutiani et al 2016 the result showed that the tss concentration is more pronounced at the sites of brewery wastewater these sampling sites are located near the habesha brewery industry in which the brewery wastewater might contribute to a load of total suspended solids table 4 all the tss values at the sampling sites were above standards for effluent discharges to the irrigation purpose table 4 fao 1985 indicating that it is not suitable for irrigation purposes to grow crops the suspended solids in water systems reduce clarity and contribute to a decrease in photosynthesis act as binding sites for toxic substances and lead to increase water temperature through the absorption of sunlight fao 1985 research report showed that the application of treatments to the wastewater was significantly effective for the removal of tss up to 96 9 from wastewater wilson et al 2011 the mean biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod values for control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 bod is the amount of dissolved oxygen taken up by aerobic microorganisms to degrade oxidizable organic matter present in water measured throughout 5 d basha et al 2009 bod of wastewater is an important criterion for judging the suitability of wastewaters for irrigation the lower the bod value the better is the water quality and the higher the bod value the lower water quality for irrigation tomas et al 2017 the result showed that a significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater for bod table 4 the highest 97 00 mg l in site one and 91 33 mg l in site two bod was recorded in brewery wastewater which is above the acceptable limit of fao standard fao and lowest 0 5 mg l value was recorded in control water the higher the bod indicates higher pollutants due to presence of higher concentration of tss tds ts cod etc and heavy metals in wastewater singh et al 2012 therefore it could be concluded that the bod value of the wastewater is not appropriate for irrigation chemical oxygen demand cod is used as a measure of an equivalent amount of oxygen required to completely oxidize both biodegradable and non biodegradable organic and inorganic matter orhon and çokgör 1997 the highest 160 67 mg l cod value was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while lowest 33 6 mg l in the control water table 4 the value for cod was higher than the fao safe limit 60 mg l showing that the brewery wastewater is not appropriate for irrigation purposes the result also showed that a highly significant difference between control water and brewery wastewater for cod table 4 indicating that the wastewater may not be treated to the standard level similar to bod the higher the cod indicates higher pollutants in wastewater which might be happening due to the presence of a large number of solids released from brewery industry wastewater this affects the availability of oxygen to decompose organic matter and the shortage of oxygen supply for micro organisms in soil dhir et al 2018 research report suggested that application of treatments to the wastewater is significantly effective for the removal of bod and cod contents from wastewater wilson et al 2011 they also showed that a well designed sand filter had a maximum bod removal capacity up to 98 4 and it can be used in blended wastewater treatment applications the mean nitrate nitrogen no3 n and bicarbonate hco3 values for control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 the highest values 22 97 mg l and 111 6 mg l to 1554 89 mg l respectively no3 n and hco3 were recorded in brewery wastewaters while the lowest values 5 56 mg l and 111 6 mg l respectively in control waters table 4 the result of the laboratory analysis of no3 n from habehsa brewery wastewater was found below the limit set by fao standard fao 1985 indicating that the no3 n concentration from the brewery wastewater is appropriate for agricultural irrigation the high amount of nitrogen applied to soil for crops causes more vegetative growth and delays ripening resulting in poorly colored fruit delgado et al 2004 the concentration of hco3 from wastewater was above the recommended level of fao standard thus it is not suitable for irrigation purposes table 4 high concentration of bicarbonates hco3 in wastewater tends to precipitate calcium carbonate caco3 and magnesium carbonate mgco3 when the soil solution becomes concentrated through evapo transpiration due to increment of temperature this causes the higher value for sar and then increases the sodium hazard of the soil water shishaye 2017 the mean cat ions ca 2 mg 2 na and k values for control water and wastewater are presented in table 4 the results of the laboratory analysis of ca 2 mg 2 and na in brewery wastewater were found below the permissible limit set by fao indicating that their concentration is suitable for irrigation purpose however the value of k from the laboratory analysis is above the standard set by fao 1985 indicating that the concentration of k is not suitable for irrigation purposes research report showed that wastewater is rich in cat ions such as na k ca2 and mg2 rahman et al 2013 the mean sar ssp and mh values for control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 4 the lowest mean values were found in the control water while the higher mean values were found in brewery wastewater sites table 4 the results of the laboratory analysis of sar and ssp for brewery wastewater were found above the limit set by fao 15 meq l and 60 respectively the mean values of sar and ssp indicating that the use of brewery wastewater are not appropriate for irrigation purposes the highest 21 15 mh was recorded in site one of brewery wastewater while the lowest 22 18 in control this value is lower than the fao safe limits 50 indicating that it is appropriate for agricultural irrigation from the laboratory result value of ec and sar brewery wastewater was greater than 2 250ds m 1 salinity level which is categorized under the c4 salinity class and greater than 26 mmoles l 1sodicity level which is categorized under the s4 sod city class of irrigation water respectively table 5 therefore based on the classification of irrigation water u s s l 1954 the result showed that the wastewater from habesha brewery is classified as saline sodic in order to enhance the quality of brewery wastewater in general the habesha brewery industry should treat its wastewater to the standard level using appropriate methods and there should be continues monitoring of this wastewater 3 2 heavy metals analysis of control water and brewery wastewater the mean heavy metals values for control water and brewery wastewater are presented in table 6 the contents of fe mn zn cu b pb cr co hg ni and mo were higher in brewery wastewater than control water the heavy metals such as cd mo and as were above the limit value set by fao 1985 which have an effect on human health through the food chain process however other heavy metals including fe mn cu b pb cr co hg and ni in brewery wastewater were found below the limit set by fao 1985 and the wastewater is appropriate for irrigation purposes 3 3 physical chemical analysis of brewery wastewater irrigated and control soil the highest 1 3 gm cm3 bulk density was recorded in control irrigates soils while the lowest 1 29 gm cm3 in wastewater water irrigated soil table 7 indicating that the bulk density of control water irrigated soil was higher than brewery wastewater irrigated soil samples and this may be associated with the increment of organic matter in irrigated by wastewater hemmat et al 2010 according to him there was a significant relationship between the application rate of the manures and the soil organic carbone the relationship with the soil bd was significantly negative the highest value 32 7 moisture content was recorded in brewery wastewater irrigated site one while the lowest 18 58 in the control irrigated soil sample table 7 this may be related to the presence of organic matter in wastewater from the brewery industry yao et al 2013 the mean organic matter om and organic carbon oc values for wastewater irrigated soil and control wastewater irrigated soil are presented in table 7 the highest values 4 9 and 2 9 respectively for om and oc were recorded in wastewater irrigated soils while the lowest values 3 11 and 1 8 respectively in control water irrigated soil table 7 research report showed that om was higher values in wastewater irrigated soil than control water irrigated soil charman and roper 2007 this result is supported by singh et al 2010 who reported that the nutrients and organic matter added by sewage irrigation may enhance the activities of soil microorganisms and also increment organic carbon oc level in soil with wastewater irrigation compared with non wastewater irrigation farms research report also indicated that there is an increase of 47 9 in oc content of topsoil 0 15 cm receiving industrial wastewater for irrigation as compared to control water irrigated soil bansal et al 1992 higher oc content increases organic matter in soil within turn increases the cat ion exchange capacity cec in soil ramos et al 2018 the mean ph and electrical conductivity ec values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 7 the level of ph ranged from 6 65 in control water irrigated soil to 6 8 in wastewater irrigated soil of site one the values in wastewater irrigated sites were slightly higher compared to the control irrigated site this slight ph change can be attributed to the release of exchangeable cat ions during the mineralization of organic matter woomer et al 1994 in addition a research report showed that the ph values increased from farmland irrigated by freshwater to wastewater irrigated land due to the increased exchangeable sodium ions in wastewater jahan et al 2019 the highest 0 7 ds m ec was recorded in wastewater irrigated soil in site one while the lowest 0 081ds m in control water irrigated soil this may be associated with the mobility of ions their valences and their actual and relative concentration feigin et al 2012 similar finding with this result by jahan et al 2019 showed that the value of ec due to the increase of concentration of the physicochemical in wastewater compared to freshwater the value of ec is increased due to high concentration of salts and soil salinity causes reduce soil hydraulic conductivity and soil dispersion muyen et al 2011 further study is required to quantify the brewery effect of soil salinity heavy metal content on irrigated farm the mean cat ions ca2 mg2 na and k values for wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 7 cat ions mean levels ranged from 1916 32 to 2921 4 mg kg for ca2 367 39 594 91 mg kg for mg2 35 54 2667 74 mg kg for na and 152 46 248 3 mg kg for k in different soil samples the highest and lowest values of ca2 mg2 na and k were found in wastewater irrigated soil site one and control water irrigated soil respectively indicating that the cat ions concentration level of irrigated land by wastewater is higher than control irrigated farmland this result was in agreement with the findings of jahan et al 2019 galavi et al 2010 kiziloglu et al 2008 who reported that irrigation with wastewater increased exchangeable cations na k ca2 mg2 in the soil compared to control water irrigated soil the mean nutrient and anions no3 n cl p and so4 2 values for wastewater irrigated soil and control irrigated soil are presented in table 7 nutrient and anions mean concentration ranged from 78 73 to 278 6 mg kg for no3 n 1 170 2 mg kg for cl 15 09 85 09 mg kg for p and 14 48 21 8 mg kg for so4 2 in soil samples the current result indicated that the number of nutrients and anions concentrations in wastewater irrigated soil was found higher than control water irrigated soil table 7 similar results were reported by jahan et al 2019 and khaskhoussy et al 2013 in general continuous application of wastewater to the soil with high amounts of cations nutrients and anions lead in certain crops may be sensitive to the presence of moderate to high concentrations of specific ions in the irrigation waters or soil solution simsek and gunduz 2007 the concentration affects the soil and crops to cite a case high chloride levels in water may cause poor growth and death to sensitive plants particularly if sprayed onto the leaves kaya et al 2007 the mean sar ssp and mh values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 7 the highest 63 68 meq kg sar was recorded in brewery wastewater irrigated soil site one while the lowest 1 05 meq kg in the control irrigated soil sample table 7 the values of sar increased from control water irrigated soil to wastewater irrigated soil research reports showed that the effect of wastewater irrigation on the chemical properties of soil increased the na content of the soil jahan et al 2019 moreover prolonged use of wastewater with a high sar value leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil a situation caused by excessive amounts of adsorbed sodium on soil colloids halliwell et al 2001 the highest values 41 47 and 16 92 respectively ssp and mh were recorded in brewery wastewater irrigated soil while the lowest 1 44 and 16 09 respectively in control water irrigated soil table 7 showing the values of ssp and mh were higher in brewery wastewater irrigated soil than control water irrigated soil continued use of wastewater with a high ssp value leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil soil structure deterioration and this affects soil infiltration rate and soil permeability alobaidy et al 2010 3 4 heavy metals analysis of brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control soil the mean heavy metals values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control irrigated soil are presented in table 8 heavy metal mean values for fe mn zn cu pb cd co and hg were 237 3 99 285 2 785 0 575 0 735 0 235 0 885 and 0 4 mg kg and the ranges were 184 16 248 09 mg kg 32 97 123 06 mg kg 2 06 3 06 mg kg 0 2 0 58 mg kg 0 6 0 74 mg kg 0 19 0 25 mg kg 0 83 0 93 mg kg and 0 31 0 41 mg kg respectively table 8 these values of heavy metals are below the maximum limit standard table 8 the result showed that the values of heavy metals were higher in brewery wastewater irrigated sites than in the control water irrigated soil table 8 this result is in agreement with previous findings of mahmood and malik 2014 gupta et al 2010 and sinha et al 2006 where the content of heavy metals increased in the wastewater irrigated soils as compared with control water irrigated soils according to qishlaqi et al 2008 continuous use of wastewater to the farm with high concentration of heavy potential impact on soil and crop yield the mean heavy metals ni and mo values for brewery wastewater irrigated soil and control water irrigated soil are presented in table 8 the level of ni and mo in the soil sample obtained from different sites ranged from 0 59 to 1 52 mg kg and 0 36 0 44 mg kg which are below the permissible value of dutch standard 35 mg kg and 3 mg kg respectively table 8 research report shows that continued use of wastewater with a high amount of ni and mo have a potential to cause health problems khan et al 2017 the highest values of ni and mo were found in brewery wastewater irrigated soil while the lowest values were found in control irrigated soils table 8 in line with this mahmood and malik 2014 gupta et al 2010 and sinha et al 2006 reported that the ni and mo contents were increased in the wastewater irrigated soils as compared with control irrigated soils heavy metals accumulation in the soil harms the growth of crop species nwajei et al 2012 thus future study is important to quantify the change in heavy metal contents in wastewater irrigated soil around the industrial zone of the town 3 5 effect of brewery wastewater on lettuce growth and yield traits the effect of five different treatments on lettuce growth and yield related traits are presented in table 9 the result showed that 100 ww irrigated soil was non significantly p 0 05 enhanced the lettuce traits of leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight by 12 22 and 24 over 100 cw irrigated soil respectively the numerical increments of these measured traits may be associated with the presence of higher nutrients content in brewery wastewater than control water table 4 wastewater irrigation enriches soils with essential nutrients that improves soil fertility and enhance crop growth productivity and quality wu et al 2010 libutti and gatta 2015 the result also showed that there was a significant difference p 0 05 among treatments for plant height of lettuce table 9 the application of 100 ww resulted in the highest plant height 15 33 cm while the application of 100 cw of treatment resulted in the lowest plant height 11 33 cm in the lettuce crop research reported showed that plant growth was enhanced due to the application of wastewater irrigation libutti and gatta 2015 plant height is significantly increased by the concentration of wastewater used for irrigation compared with different wastewater concentration treatment applications parveen et al 2015 the leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaves weight were not significantly p 0 05 affected by brewery wastewater treatments table 9 the highest fresh leaf weight 318 33 g plant was recorded for the application of 100 ww brewery wastewater and while the lowest fresh leaf weight 250 g plant was obtained from the control water irrigation soil table 9 the higher value of leaf length and number of leaves were obtained from 100 ww treatment application while the lower values of these traits were recorded in 100 cw treatment application this could be related to the presence of a higher amount of nutrients in brewery wastewater irrigated soils compared to control water irrigated soil table 9 khan et al 2011 have been reported that the use of wastewater irrigation increases the growth of vegetables due to the enrichments of macro and micronutrients as well as organic matter in wastewater compare to freshwater irrigation land research report showed that leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight are significantly affected by the concentration of wastewater used for irrigation compared with different wastewater concentration treatment applications which are an increase from freshwater to 100 wastewater treatment application parveen et al 2015 3 6 effect of brewery wastewater on nutrient compositions of lettuce leaf the effect of five different treatments on the nutrients composition of lettuce is presented in table 10 the nutrients concentrations of ca2 mg2 k na fe mn zn and tn were highly significant p 0 05 influenced by brewery wastewater irrigation and cu was not significantly p 0 05 affected by brewery wastewater treatment application table 10 the highest and lowest levels of concentrations were found in 100 ww and freshwater application of irrigation water respectively indicating that the amount of ca2 mg2 k na fe mn zn and tn found in the lettuce samples were higher in brewery wastewater irrigated soils than in control irrigated soils and this may be associated with the presence of a high amount of nutrients in wastewater irrigated land khan et al 2011 similarly awgchew et al 2015 and zavadil 2009 reported that the concentrations of heavy metals found in the vegetable samples were higher in wastewater irrigated farm than control water irrigated farm research report showed that the application of wastewaters irrigation significantly increased the concentration of heavy metals in the edible parts of vegetables crop abdel sabour et al 2003 gupta et al 2012 arora et al 2008 and sinha et al 2006 khan et al 2011 further research is important to monitor the brewery effect of heavy metal content and nutrients composition on irrigated crop 4 conclusion the current study showed that there was a significant p 0 05 difference between the brewery wastewater and control water for most of physical chemical contents the analysis of physical chemical contents for brewery wastewater samples indicated that the values for ec tss bod cod hco3 k ssp and sar levels were above the permissible limit of the fao irrigation water quality standard indicating this brewery wastewater is not appropriate for irrigated crop production the mean values of t ph tds no3 n ca 2 mg 2 na and mh were below the permissible limit of the fao standard most heavy metals fe mn cu b pb cr co hg ni and mo in brewery wastewater samples were below the permissible limit except for cd and as the soil samples from the brewery wastewater irrigated soils were featured by higher physical chemical contents om oc ph ec no3 n cl ca2 mg2 na k p so42 sar ssp and mh and heavy metal contents fe mn zn cu pb cd as co hg ni and mo than control water irrigated soils the study showed that the brewery wastewater is classified as saline sodic therefore this wastewater should be treated to the standard level before use for irrigation the pot experiment showed that the applications of brewery wastewater irrigation were non significantly affected the growth and yield related traits of lettuce crop except plant height the 100 ww irrigation enhanced the lettuce traits of leaf length number of leaves and fresh leaf weight by 12 22 and 24 respectively over 100 cw irrigated soils the brewery wastewater irrigations significantly p 0 05 enhanced nutrient compositions of lettuce leaf ca2 mg2 na k fe zn and mn the 50 ww 50 cw irrigation showed an interesting result on lettuce crop nutrient composition and productivity overall long term utilization of this wastewater for irrigation purpose may rise the levels of ec tss bod cod hco3 ssp sar and heavy metals in the small scale farm which will affect soil fertility crop productivity and quality for future agriculture therefore amelioration measures seem to be inevitable such as gypsum and there should be continuous monitoring and evaluation for the quality status of brewery wastewater before use for irrigation purposes future study is required to investigate and monitor the change on soil characteristic and nutrients of crops for designing a
