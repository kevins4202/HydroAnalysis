21135,this paper describes a compact planar motion mechanism based captive ship model manoeuvring test system designed and developed at istanbul technical university itu the system designated as itu pmm is particularly designed to be light and simple to be installed on the existing towing carriage in a 160 m long towing tank the main components of the motion controller based system are two servo motors with high precision encoders a reduction gear with very low backlash for yaw motion precision linear motion ball screws a six component load cell for force and moment measurements and a data acquisition system itu pmm is primarily designed to perform standard captive manoeuvring tests including the static tests such as steady drift and oblique towing with rudder deflection and the dynamic tests such as pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift however since the servo motors are independently controlled non standard tests could also be carried out in order to calibrate and validate the system standard pmm tests were carried out with a simman 2008 benchmark case model dtmb 5415 representing high speed displacement vessel the measured forces and moment and the derived manoeuvring derivatives are compared with those obtained by major test facilities the sensitivity of the system is verified by an uncertainty analysis nomenclature b wl beam at water line c b block coefficient i

displacement volume 1 introduction determination of manoeuvring characteristics of ships continues to be a hot topic in marine hydrodynamics thus both the experimental and the computational tools are required to be improved to have a precise understanding of ship manoeuvres and a sensitive predictability of manoeuvring characteristics as the development of new experimental facilities for the validation of computational tools is vital as ever a new motion controller based captive manoeuvring test system working on the planar motion mechanism pmm principle has been recently designed developed and installed at istanbul technical university s itu ata nutku ship model testing laboratory this paper presents the general design features of this system designated as itu pmm as well as its measurement capability of forces and moments on scaled ship models steady and unsteady captive model tests are vital to estimate the manoeuvring derivatives which are used in mathematical models to simulate manoeuvres either in fast time or real time simulations these tests can be subdivided into oblique towing tests ott rotating arm ra tests or circular motion tests cmt planar motion mechanism pmm tests and computerised planar motion carriage cpmc tests ittc 2011 the oblique towing tests can be carried out in a conventional towing tank to estimate hydrodynamic derivatives related to the sway velocity only in the rotating arm or circular motion tests the model is restrained to a rotating arm and towed at constant tangential velocity so that its centre of gravity moves in a circular path with fixed values of turning radius angular velocity drift angle and or rudder angle rotating arms supplies rotary coefficients directly while static coefficients should be considered as an indirect procedure since the data must be extrapolated to infinite radius and static coefficients obtained by this method may differ from straight line tests the main advantage of rotating arm tests is that depending on the size of the rotating arm and the model large values of the rate of turn or curvature can be applied to obtain reliable estimates about nonlinear and cross coupling terms however the need for a large non dimensional radius of the turning circle requires large model basins or the use of small models only the steady terms in the equations of motion can be estimated by using the ra test data as one test produces results for one steady motion case only it takes many times to carry out for the whole motion range ittc 2011 large circular rotating arm facilities are costly to build and operate and only a limited number of such facilities are currently operational a major breakthrough was made in the late 1950 s with the introduction of pmm based manoeuvring test systems by gertler 1959 who introduced the name of planar motion mechanism pmm as it is used today the development of pmm based manoeuvring test systems through 1960 s and 1970 s has been summarized by grim et al 1976 the amplitude of the motions generated by the early pmm systems were too low to derive nonlinear coupled manoeuvring derivatives but as the size of ships increased the motion amplitude of the pmm systems also increased resulting in large amplitude pmm systems ittc 1972 ittc 1975 the next major breakthrough has been the development of computerised planar motion carriage cpmc test system which combined the features of the conventional pmm and rotating arm based test systems grim et al 1976 these systems enable the modelling of non harmonic large amplitude captive manoeuvres and also reduce the testing time and hence improve efficiency by enabling to continuously change the test parameters in a single run the pmm based manoeuvring test systems generally provide the simplest solution to the problem of estimating manoeuvring derivatives including inertia terms for real fast time simulations as they can be fitted in the carriage of a conventional towing tank and the model is towed with an oblique angle or forced to oscillate to produce pure sway pure yaw or yaw and drift motions a combination of steady and harmonic tests with a pmm based manoeuvring test system provides both velocity and acceleration dependent manoeuvring derivatives these tests are widely accepted to yield reliable estimates for linear manoeuvring derivatives however the predictions for nonlinear and cross coupling terms may not be as reliable as the linear terms due to the limitations on the rates of turn and curvature of motion trajectory most of the ship and offshore model test facilities and towing tanks around the world are now equipped with a pmm system based on diverse designs ittc facilities 2019 these systems are generally based on a mechanism consisting of a horizontal screw shaft driven by a servo controlled electric motor moving a small sub carriage block to produce the transverse displacement and another electric motor attached to the sub carriage block and aligned in the vertical direction for the yawing motion this configuration could be programmed to generate not only the harmonic motions but also the more complex motion patterns many facilities improve their pmm designs for special research needs such as investigating the influence of shallow water roll motion surface ice or waves on manoeuvring performance characteristics the use of novel captive test techniques such as hexapods as a replacement of traditional pmm systems has also been reported the details of these developments are summarized in international towing tank conferences ittc manoeuvring committee reports ittc 1996 2011 2017 ittc facilities 2019 the early benchmarking studies carried out by ittc manoeuvring committees to assess the quality of the pmm test results revealed the need for standard test procedures the 21st ittc manoeuvrability committee ittc 1996 formulated a recommended standard pmm test procedure which has been updated regularly ittc 2017 this procedure aims to provide quantitative guidelines leading to an optimal procedure irrespective of the mathematical model applied the range of kinematic conditions or the environmental parameters a major step in the verification and validation of computational ship manoeuvring simulation methods has been simman 2008 and simman 2014 workshops these workshops have provided captive pmm and cmt and free model manoeuvring test data from a large number of test facilities for a range of benchmark ship models the itu pmm presented here focuses on the development of a simple and compact but technologically advanced experimental system for the captive planar motion tests of surface ship models in addition to the simple and compact structure of the system motion controller based measurement system provides improved sensitivity which is shown by an uncertainty assessment carried out based on the test results of a dtmb5512 model itu pmm is considered as an element of a two component manoeuvring test facility complemented by a free running test system operative now at itu lake the following sections present the basic design considerations in detail and the test results are presented for the full set of manoeuvring experiments covering static drift pure sway pure yaw yaw and drift together with uncertainty analysis 2 design and development of itu pmm system 2 1 basic considerations the itu pmm was designed to be installed at ata nutku ship model testing laboratory towing tank with a length of 160 m width of 6 m and depth of 3 5 m maximum speed of the carriage is 6 m s and towing tests with ship models up to 5 m in length can be carried out depending on the froude number considering that both the naval and commercial vessels to be tested in the manoeuvring test system the basic design requirements for itu pmm was specified as 1 25 m sway amplitude 1 2 m s maximum sway velocity and 20 s maximum yaw rate as a compromise between these requirements and the tank dimensions the length of the models to be tested is limited to about 3 m accordingly the capacity and the sensitivity of the load cell is determined as the system is required to be able to perform static drift pure sway pure yaw yaw and drift motions it is necessary to introduce the motion trajectories enforced by pmm in an earth fixed or tank fixed coordinate system fig 1 pmm motions described in five quantities 1 carriage speed u c 2 sway motion amplitude y m a x 3 yaw motion amplitude ψ m a x 4 drift angle β and 5 pmm frequency ω standard static and dynamic pmm tests may be shown to be described by the following general equations of motion yoon 2009 1 y p m m y m a x s i n ω t 2 ψ ψ m a x c o s ω t β 3 u u c c o s ψ v p m m s i n ψ 4 u v p m m s i n ψ r v p m m c o s ψ u c s i n ψ 5

model and tank centerlines the terms with pmm indices are earth fixed coordinates where x axis is along the tank centreline y axis along the transverse direction to tank longitudinal axis and origin of the system is fixed at the measuring point of the loadcell identifying pmm parameter limits is carried out so as to be in accordance with ittc recommended procedures dynamic motion amplitudes are studied concerning the clearance between tank side walls and frequency limitations are determined by considering the number of cycles in the steady velocity region along the length of the tank for the benchmark study frequency ω values are selected to be in accordance with the participating institutions of simman 2014 initial estimates on the maximum force and moments to be measured were made by using the test results carried out at iowa institute of hydraulic research iihr with the dtmb 5512 model yoon 2009 a hydraulically driven system was previously considered but due to its high precision and well documented synchronization issues a motion controller system and servo drives are decided in order to power the system system components such as precision linear motion ball screws high precision reduction gears and servo drives are selected two servo motors are used to provide the sway and yaw motions one is dedicated to provide translation and the other rotation the motors are driven under closed loop control to provide the desired sinusoidal motions such as pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift motions however since the motors are independently controlled the pmm is also capable of providing non sinusoidal motions within the limitations of the mechanism in the static mode including steady drift and oblique towing with rudder deflection tests the model is simply held stationary relative to the moving flow at various angles of incidence meantime a decision had to be made whether the system would be mounted on an independent 4 wheel drive trailer or be installed to the main carriage considering the future requirements of manoeuvring research to include wave effects on the one hand and to refrain from the fact that the weight of the trailer causes substantial additional load on the carriage during the towing it is concluded that the system would be much more suitable to be assembled as a balcony type at the aft side of the carriage provided that the system should be compact thus designed pmm system has a width of 4 m in order to allow sway amplitude of 1 25 m it has a steel frame which assembled on the main carriage and on the upper and lower part of the frame linear 40 mm nsk rail is attached to guide the sway motion sway motion is imposed by a double side fixed 50 mm nsk ball screw which is driven by a synchronous servo motor with a nominal torque of 16nm and a nominal 3000 rpm due to the 1 5 reduction of linear ball screw use of a reduction gear found unnecessary for sway motion yaw table is built out of steel where the model was driven by a synchronous servo motor with a nominal torque of 12nm and a nominal 3000 rpm attached to a coronex reducer with a ratio of 1 119 model is attached to the pmm system with a pantograph which enables to work with models having different drafts and also allows the model free to pitch and heave motions while fixing for roll during the berthing phase of the carriage to the dock of the tank the yaw table and all its assembled parts such as loadcell strut pantograph etc can be elevated see fig 2 the drive system is designed in order to establish linkages among the servomotors via a control system using a motion controller so as to accomplish large amplitude motions in conjunction with each other fig 2 shows the pmm system as assembled to the main carriage and table 1 gives the main particulars of the system prior to the implementation of the design of itu pmm a smaller version was designed constructed and installed at the circulating water channel cwc pmm of a nutku ship model testing laboratory in order to test the viability of the main pmm system to be installed at the towing tank all the values of cwc pmm are fixed with a scale of 1 4 of the main full scale system fig 3 the tests carried out with cwc pmm indicated that the system designed is capable to meet all the requirements from the system and demonstrates very satisfactory sensitivity in the transient displacements shown by the encoders fig 4 a c show the prescribed motions in comparison to feedback from the encoders it must be noticed that the analytically defined and measured motions are overlapped and they show no visible discrepancy due to the precision of the system fig 4b d show the absolute error for lateral and angular positions during a pure yaw test fr 0 138 r0 0 05 respectively this represents motions biases due to motion controller and servo drive assemblies are confined within absolute error of 0 001 which gives a relative error of order of 10 3 in a variety of pmm systems harmonic sinusoidal motions are generated by sliding crank or so called scotch yoke mechanisms control systems for scotch yoke mechanisms are said to have easy and smooth operation capabilities but to have limited sway amplitudes and yaw magnitudes some newer pmms use servo motors and linear motion screws or rack pinion mechanisms to generate motions which are not only limited with harmonic sinusoidal pmm motions but also capable of generating arbitrary motions rack pinion mechanisms have almost no amplitude limit however may cause a loss in the precision of motions due to larger backlashes within gears on the other hand the maximum permissible length of a highly precise linear ball screw restrains the sway amplitude due to torsional vibration which limits the allowable mounting distance versus the axial load both of these systems use plc programmable logic controller for the generation of required manoeuvring trajectories pmm coordinates and for controlling the servo motors to drive the mechanism however the ability of plcs to generate interpolating servo motions is rather relatively coarse accordingly itu pmm employs a motion controller in order to generate servo motor coordinates and in turn to attain a higher precision interpolation of sinusoidal motions as compared to plc based control systems moreover using of a linear motion ball screw allows having up to 1 2 m s sway rate and 1 25 m sway amplitude with a precision advantage to rack pinion mechanisms in order to reach a high precision measurement quality and torque requirement for the yaw motion a coronex reducer with a 3 arcmin backlash gives an advantage over rack pinion type reduction gears 2 2 control system pmm motions generated by the use of simotion drive based motion control unit are applied to the system by servo motors controlled via sinamics motor control modules simotion unit is capable of generating very precise interpolating data for the accurate pmm motions and also other desired transient ship motions fig 5 shows the control diagram of itu pmm in itu pmm simotion generates signals for servo drives and close loop control the motion with the feedbacks collected from the motor encoders also simultaneously collect loadcell data and correlate with encoder positions thus prepares the pmm test outputs in order to set the experimental conditions to start the experiment and to save the data during the experiment a mobile hmi human machine interface is used for each standard manoeuvring experiment a specific display was generated in order to set the inputs this display allows user to see real time dynamic data during the experiment both numerically and graphically it allows user to start the motions and data collection independently a display also prepared for the computer on which the experimental data is saved behind the save data button on the experiment menu a script was written in order to generate the data file and name that file in relation with the type date and time of the of that specific experiment output file consists of time encoder data for motions position velocity and acceleration of sway yaw and carriage speed force and moment data from loadcell is in csv comma separated values format and can be opened by microsoft excel 2 3 load cells and data acquisition although the primary calculations showed that longitudinal fx and lateral fy forces over 500 n and yaw moment mz over 500nm is not expected for the planned pmm tests it is decided to order a multi component loadcell which also measure fz force and mx and my moments the capacity of itu pmm multi component loadcell fig 6 is as follows fx fy fz 500 n mx my mz 500nm within these assumptions for the loads a water resistant six component izumi sokki loadcell was designed and built loadcell has a 6 component izumi sokki da 18 k amplifier and a fx fy fz 250 n and mx my mz 250 nm calibration box is also included in order to check the calibration of the loadcell a calibration setup was designed and built setup allows the table to levelize locate and rotate the loadcell in desired position and implement the calibration weights in desired directions the calibration check of the loacell is performed for fx fy and fz forces by using this setup for the moment calibrations an arm of 1 m is used to implement the specific moment loadcell is connected to servo drive reduction gear with a strong arm below the loadcell a pantograph is designed and manufactured in order to fix the ship in roll but allow heave and pitch motions fig 6 this pantograph is manufacted precisely by using cnc out of aircraft grade 7075 aluminum alloy while the shafts are aisi 316 l grade stainless steel a laser liner is used to ensure that the model has no initial angle of attack when locating the pantograph in the midship position and connecting the model to pmm 3 measurement study 3 1 model in order to validate the itu pmm system with the existing simman experimental data standard pmm tests were performed with a 1 46 588 scale geosim of dtmb 5415 model designated as model dtmb 5512 full and model scale ship particulars of surface combatant are listed in table 2 a wooden model with an lpp 3 048 m was manufactured by 5 axis cnc milling machine at ata nutku ship model testing laboratory fig 7 the model has port and starboard keels and does not have other appendages such as rudders struts or shafts cylindrical studs are used as turbulence stimulators 3 2 measurement data filtering and non dimensionalisation for the demonstration of measurements and data filtering of the itu pmm system pure sway experiments at froude number 0 280 and drift angle of βmax 10 are selected and conducted with a sampling rate of 200 hz this case has been used by the participating facilities of simman conferences as an uncertainty case for pure sway experiments fig 8 a shows the measured raw and fft filtered lateral forces the fft filtering procedure is carried out by using the following formula 9 χ t χ 0 n 1 6 χ n c o s n ω t ϕ n fig 8 b shows the selection of a single period of the filtered force data in this graph x axis is non dimensionalized by the oscillation period the starting point of a period is manually determined from the experimental data at which the model is at the centerline of the tank the model is connected to loadcell via a pantograph which allows heave and pitch motions while surge and roll motions are restricted since the loadcell has moving parts and also some parts of the pantograph are carried by the loadcell the inertial force and moment of these components need to be subtracted from the raw measurements of forces and moment thus for each mode of the pmm motions air tests are carried out to estimate the inertial effect of the moving parts measured data during the air tests are filtered as it can be seen in fig 8 c and then reduced to a single period as it is given in fig 8 d and subtracted from the experimental data the source of the noise observed in fig 8 a and b is indeed a mechanical noise mostly coming from the mechanical disturbances of the carriage and of the system due to its low inertia in air test mode note that the same absolute level of noise is effective both in hydrodynamic and air tests where the order of the forces measured in air test is far less than the hydrodynamic test data which means that the noise is relatively higher in air test which naturally affects the sensitivity of the results and in turn detoriorates the symmetry the result of excluding inertial effects of the moving parts of the loadcell and the pantograph from the measurement data and non dimensionalizing according to data reduction equations given in ittc 2017 can be seen in fig 8 e as compared with the simman data although the lateral force in the graph appears to be slightly over predicted compared with the other institutions it is within the uncertainty limits which will be shown in section 3 5 3 3 tests static drift pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift 3 3 1 static drift tests static drift tests were conducted at three carriage speeds corresponding to froude numbers f n v g l of 0 138 0 280 and 0 410 which represent low medium and high speed conditions respectively for low and medium speed conditions drift angle values were varied between 200 whereas between 120 for the high speed condition limited by the capacity of load cell table 3 shows the static drift test parameters 10 v u c s i n β results obtained from the static drift tests are presented in a 3d form in fig 9 in which the dependency of force and moment on forward speed and the drift angle can be observed non dimensionalized data in comparison with other facilities are presented in fig 10 in fig 10 a itu pmm shows a good symmetry in x force measurements between positive and negative β values this has been verified by the results of uncertainty analysis related with asymmetry bias as presented in section 3 6 and thus no correction is required the good correlation between the measurements as shown in fig 10 b for the sway force and fig 10 c for the yaw moment may be attributed to the precise orientation of the model and stiffness of the system 3 3 2 pure sway pure sway tests were carried out at medium speed corresponding to fr 0 28 only and at three maximum drift angles 20 40 100 which correspond to the maximum sway non dimensional velocities v v m a x u c of 0 035 0 070 0 174 respectively table 4 shows the test parameters for pure sway tests fig 11 shows typical sway force measurements in

measurements as presented in section 3 5 see fig 19 and tables 12 13 3 4 manoeuvring derivatives the standard pmm tests consist of static drift and dynamic oscillation pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift tests in static drift test the model is towed with a constant forward velocity over a range of drift angles and for each drift angle x y forces and n moment are measured steady velocity derivatives x v v y v y v v v y v v n v n v v v and n v v depending on the mathematical manoeuvring model adopted can be determined by curve fitting the following polynomial functions to static drift

model is forced to harmonic sway motion while being towed with a constant forward velocity and the results of this test are mainly used to determine the sway acceleration derivatives y v and n v it is clear that the sway velocity derivatives can be also be determined from the pure sway test measurements however derivatives determined from the static drift data are preferred in general as the derivatives from dynamic test data are known as often frequency dependent bishop and parkinson 1970 as the dynamic motion frequency ω becomes large the quasi steady or the slow motion assumptions for the math models can fail and the hydrodynamic forces and moment during the pmm tests become dependent not only on the instantaneous motions but partly also on the previous motions known as the memory effect bishop and parkinson 1970 for a specific harmonic sway frequency ω the basic input is the maximum lateral speed v m a x the harmonics data are determined experimentally by measuring the forces and moment as time histories from pmm tests as 23 x y n f t and using a fourier integral equation as 24 x 0 y 0 n 0 1 t 0 t f t d t 25 x c n y c n n c n 2 t 0 t f t c o s n ω t d t 26 x s n y s n n s

obtained from pure yaw test measurements 3 5 uncertainty analysis present uncertainty analysis ua is based on the ittc recommended procedures 7 5 02 06 04 ittc 2017 and aimed at to reveal the sensitivity of the itu pmm in measuring x y and n forces and moment the procedure jointly developed by iihr yoon 2009 force simonsen 2004 and istituto nazionale per studi ed esperienze di architettura navale insean benedetti et al 2007 treats total uncertainty u as the root sum square of bias b and precision p limits thesis of yoon 2009 provides a more descriptive presentation of the procedures we present here the essentials of the procedure of which the details can be found in yoon 2009 and in ittc 2017 bias limit is given by the error propagation equation 43 b r 2 i b x i 2 θ x i 2 where r represents x y and n forces and moment as a function of 14 standard uncertainties for dynamic tests 44 x x l t x g y g m i z ρ u v r u v r f and 5 uncertainties for static tests 45 x x l t ρ u c f where f denotes measured values of f x f y and m z b x i 2 s are the elemental biases in x and θ x i 2 s are sensitivity coefficients obtained by 46 θ x i 2 r x i calculation of sensitivity coefficients is somehow tedious but straight forward as analytical definitions of sensitivity coefficients are already given and numerically checked in the present study considering tables a 12 a 13 and a 14 of ittc 2017 θ x i 2 may also be obtained by numerical differentiation as well moffat 1982 note that biases related with u v r u v r and f have their own error propagation equations as well as biases related with pmm velocity and accelerations the uncertainties associated with the manoeuvring derivatives are not presently studied firstly bias limit calculations for the basic standard uncertainties in force and moment reduction equations and for the variables used in defining pmm motions are given in tables 8 and 9 respectively the respective bias limits are considered according to the recommendations in ittc s procedures 7 5 02 06 04 and the descriptions given in yoon 2009 the biases for pmm motion variables take the advantage of the present motion controller employed in itu pmm as a consequence some of the biases for the pmm motions are relatively smaller and even not exist such as n and b s m m which have to be taken into account in the systems using scotch yoke intermediate calculations of elemental bias limits are given in table 10 it is understood from table 10 that it is a common trend in pmm elemental biases that significant contributions come from b u in x force and from b f in y force and n moment for static drift motion similarly b u contribution to total bias of x force and b f contribution to that of y force and n moment are dominant for dynamic tests bias related with i z becomes important in n moment particularly in pure yaw measurements precision limit is estimated by performing repeatability tests in accordance with ittc 2017 in measuring the forces and the moment in static drift pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift motions every test item is treated by multi sample tests of at least n 12 times and evaluated through the multi sample test equation 47 p r t s r n where t 2 0 can be taken to cover 95 percent confidence interval in the probability distribution of the measured data and s r is the standard deviation of the data from n repeated tests under the same conditions total number of 48 runs were made 4 modes of motion 12 runs at f r 0 28 and are used here for comparison the results of multiple test measurements as time histories of forces and moment due to dynamic pmm motions are given in fig 17 the error bounds for x force normally seem to be higher as compared to force y and moment n it is observed from fig 19 at least qualitatively that x time histories and y force in yaw and drift time histories are governed by higher order harmonics the rest may be said to be governed by the first order harmonics total uncertainty in the measured quantity r is given by the root sum square of bias and precision limits 48 u r b r 2 p r 2 accordingly total uncertainty results for itu pmm are given in table 11 for all the modes of the pmm motions at f r 0 28 as expected precision errors are far more less than bias errors the percentages of precision errors appear to be relatively higher in static drift tests and yaw and drift tests and particularly in all the x forces as confirmed by the results shown in fig 17 a there is a possibility of experiencing asymmetry particularly in the measurements of static drift tests between positive and negative β values utmost care was paid to reduce the causes of asymmetry bias such as heeling of the model as well as aligning the centreline of the model with that of the tank to have an idea about the magnitude of the asymmetry bias an error analysis was carried out for static drift tests by taking the average values of the measured quantities related with positive and negative values of β as described in yoon et al 2015 49 r m r r 2 defining d a s y m r r m and subsequently b a s y m 2 d a s y m 2 u r 2 the total uncertainty including asymmetry bias 50 u r a s y m 2 u r 2 b a s y m 2 asymmetry biases b a s y m in static drift tests are calculated for 10 degrees considering the results of repeatability tests table 12 gives the results of this analysis particularly the values of d a s y m as compared with the values of u r relatively smaller values of asymmetry biases which are not taken into account here in total uncertainty because of the fact that b a s y m 0 when d a s y m u r pinpoint to the precise calibration of the model the accurate alignment of the model is accomplished by the use of vertical laser liner in the present case ua comparisons are made with those of iihr force and insean as obtained from table 10 n order level of yoon et al 2015 in table 13 as the results in yoon et al 2015 are given only for static drift and pure yaw motions thus we include our results for the same mode of the motions one may conclude from the results that using larger models are important and effective in reducing uncertainty levels a conclusion drawn out of the fact that force and insean used models having lengths of 4 002 m m and 5 719 m respectively while both iihr and itu used 3 048 m models on the other hand uncertainty levels achieved by itu pmm show that the present design with its compact structure and motion controller based system is able to function properly to attain quite satisfactory results 4 concluding remarks design and development of a compact and lightweight manoeuvring test system based on planar motion mechanism and a motion controller system has been presented the main design goal has been to generate relatively large amplitude motions with high precision measurements with a simple and practical test system which is easy to install operate and maintain the design team initially evaluated various mounting alternatives and consequently it was concluded that the system would be much more efficient to be mounted on the existing towing carriage so that the system would be compact another assessment was made on the motion mechanism and a linear motion device with double servo drives was selected for compactness and the need for large motion amplitudes the components of the system such as precision ball screws reduction gear and encoders were selected to represent the state of the art in ship model testing technologies the motion controller was programmed to generate accurate motions synchronously collect the encoder and loadcell data and produce reliable output files itu pmm system takes advantage of the latest technology on the linear ball screw based motion mechanisms and motion controllers which enables the system to generate oscillatory motions with larger amplitudes and produce more accurate and reliable test data a significant technological advantage of itu pmm system is the use of precise yaw motion reduction gear with a backlash of 3 arc min 0 05 deg while the system is cost effective because of the compact size and simple mechanisms the test results are comparable in accuracy and reliability with those obtained by much larger and complicated pmm systems the validation of the test system has been carried out by using a common benchmark case based on a high speed displacement type ship model dtmb 5415 the measured forces and moments as well as the derived manoeuvring derivatives were compared with those obtained by force and iihr these comparisons have indicated that within the scale limitation of the model both the force and moment measurements and the derived manoeuvring derivatives correlate well uncertainty analysis is performed according to the standard recommended procedures of ittc 7 5 02 06 04 ittc 2017 the present analysis is focused on the determination of total uncertainty of the manoeuvring predictions obtained from the measurements of forces and moment bias limit calculations for the basic standard uncertainties in force and moment reduction equations and precision limit estimations by performing repeatability tests of at least 12 times for static drift pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift motions made it possible to arrive at the related total uncertainties asymmetry bias is found to be small enough even for the static drift test and therefore not included in the final uncertainty limits total uncertainties are compared with those of iihr force and insean and it is found that the present system developed functions quite satisfactorily in predicting manoeuvring characteristics by means of the measurement of the forces and moments a distinct feature of itu pmm is demonstrated by consistent character of bias and precision limits as seen in table 13 as it appears from the latest status of the prediction methods that among the tools theoretical computational experimental available the best combination appears to be captive model tests complemented by free running model tests whereas virtual captive tests cfd may be an additional component of the prediction procedure quadvlieg 2016 within this context from experimental point of view the captive model testing presented here should not be considered as a sole tool in predicting manoeuvring characteristics but as the integral part of the test

21135,this paper describes a compact planar motion mechanism based captive ship model manoeuvring test system designed and developed at istanbul technical university itu the system designated as itu pmm is particularly designed to be light and simple to be installed on the existing towing carriage in a 160 m long towing tank the main components of the motion controller based system are two servo motors with high precision encoders a reduction gear with very low backlash for yaw motion precision linear motion ball screws a six component load cell for force and moment measurements and a data acquisition system itu pmm is primarily designed to perform standard captive manoeuvring tests including the static tests such as steady drift and oblique towing with rudder deflection and the dynamic tests such as pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift however since the servo motors are independently controlled non standard tests could also be carried out in order to calibrate and validate the system standard pmm tests were carried out with a simman 2008 benchmark case model dtmb 5415 representing high speed displacement vessel the measured forces and moment and the derived manoeuvring derivatives are compared with those obtained by major test facilities the sensitivity of the system is verified by an uncertainty analysis nomenclature b wl beam at water line c b block coefficient i

displacement volume 1 introduction determination of manoeuvring characteristics of ships continues to be a hot topic in marine hydrodynamics thus both the experimental and the computational tools are required to be improved to have a precise understanding of ship manoeuvres and a sensitive predictability of manoeuvring characteristics as the development of new experimental facilities for the validation of computational tools is vital as ever a new motion controller based captive manoeuvring test system working on the planar motion mechanism pmm principle has been recently designed developed and installed at istanbul technical university s itu ata nutku ship model testing laboratory this paper presents the general design features of this system designated as itu pmm as well as its measurement capability of forces and moments on scaled ship models steady and unsteady captive model tests are vital to estimate the manoeuvring derivatives which are used in mathematical models to simulate manoeuvres either in fast time or real time simulations these tests can be subdivided into oblique towing tests ott rotating arm ra tests or circular motion tests cmt planar motion mechanism pmm tests and computerised planar motion carriage cpmc tests ittc 2011 the oblique towing tests can be carried out in a conventional towing tank to estimate hydrodynamic derivatives related to the sway velocity only in the rotating arm or circular motion tests the model is restrained to a rotating arm and towed at constant tangential velocity so that its centre of gravity moves in a circular path with fixed values of turning radius angular velocity drift angle and or rudder angle rotating arms supplies rotary coefficients directly while static coefficients should be considered as an indirect procedure since the data must be extrapolated to infinite radius and static coefficients obtained by this method may differ from straight line tests the main advantage of rotating arm tests is that depending on the size of the rotating arm and the model large values of the rate of turn or curvature can be applied to obtain reliable estimates about nonlinear and cross coupling terms however the need for a large non dimensional radius of the turning circle requires large model basins or the use of small models only the steady terms in the equations of motion can be estimated by using the ra test data as one test produces results for one steady motion case only it takes many times to carry out for the whole motion range ittc 2011 large circular rotating arm facilities are costly to build and operate and only a limited number of such facilities are currently operational a major breakthrough was made in the late 1950 s with the introduction of pmm based manoeuvring test systems by gertler 1959 who introduced the name of planar motion mechanism pmm as it is used today the development of pmm based manoeuvring test systems through 1960 s and 1970 s has been summarized by grim et al 1976 the amplitude of the motions generated by the early pmm systems were too low to derive nonlinear coupled manoeuvring derivatives but as the size of ships increased the motion amplitude of the pmm systems also increased resulting in large amplitude pmm systems ittc 1972 ittc 1975 the next major breakthrough has been the development of computerised planar motion carriage cpmc test system which combined the features of the conventional pmm and rotating arm based test systems grim et al 1976 these systems enable the modelling of non harmonic large amplitude captive manoeuvres and also reduce the testing time and hence improve efficiency by enabling to continuously change the test parameters in a single run the pmm based manoeuvring test systems generally provide the simplest solution to the problem of estimating manoeuvring derivatives including inertia terms for real fast time simulations as they can be fitted in the carriage of a conventional towing tank and the model is towed with an oblique angle or forced to oscillate to produce pure sway pure yaw or yaw and drift motions a combination of steady and harmonic tests with a pmm based manoeuvring test system provides both velocity and acceleration dependent manoeuvring derivatives these tests are widely accepted to yield reliable estimates for linear manoeuvring derivatives however the predictions for nonlinear and cross coupling terms may not be as reliable as the linear terms due to the limitations on the rates of turn and curvature of motion trajectory most of the ship and offshore model test facilities and towing tanks around the world are now equipped with a pmm system based on diverse designs ittc facilities 2019 these systems are generally based on a mechanism consisting of a horizontal screw shaft driven by a servo controlled electric motor moving a small sub carriage block to produce the transverse displacement and another electric motor attached to the sub carriage block and aligned in the vertical direction for the yawing motion this configuration could be programmed to generate not only the harmonic motions but also the more complex motion patterns many facilities improve their pmm designs for special research needs such as investigating the influence of shallow water roll motion surface ice or waves on manoeuvring performance characteristics the use of novel captive test techniques such as hexapods as a replacement of traditional pmm systems has also been reported the details of these developments are summarized in international towing tank conferences ittc manoeuvring committee reports ittc 1996 2011 2017 ittc facilities 2019 the early benchmarking studies carried out by ittc manoeuvring committees to assess the quality of the pmm test results revealed the need for standard test procedures the 21st ittc manoeuvrability committee ittc 1996 formulated a recommended standard pmm test procedure which has been updated regularly ittc 2017 this procedure aims to provide quantitative guidelines leading to an optimal procedure irrespective of the mathematical model applied the range of kinematic conditions or the environmental parameters a major step in the verification and validation of computational ship manoeuvring simulation methods has been simman 2008 and simman 2014 workshops these workshops have provided captive pmm and cmt and free model manoeuvring test data from a large number of test facilities for a range of benchmark ship models the itu pmm presented here focuses on the development of a simple and compact but technologically advanced experimental system for the captive planar motion tests of surface ship models in addition to the simple and compact structure of the system motion controller based measurement system provides improved sensitivity which is shown by an uncertainty assessment carried out based on the test results of a dtmb5512 model itu pmm is considered as an element of a two component manoeuvring test facility complemented by a free running test system operative now at itu lake the following sections present the basic design considerations in detail and the test results are presented for the full set of manoeuvring experiments covering static drift pure sway pure yaw yaw and drift together with uncertainty analysis 2 design and development of itu pmm system 2 1 basic considerations the itu pmm was designed to be installed at ata nutku ship model testing laboratory towing tank with a length of 160 m width of 6 m and depth of 3 5 m maximum speed of the carriage is 6 m s and towing tests with ship models up to 5 m in length can be carried out depending on the froude number considering that both the naval and commercial vessels to be tested in the manoeuvring test system the basic design requirements for itu pmm was specified as 1 25 m sway amplitude 1 2 m s maximum sway velocity and 20 s maximum yaw rate as a compromise between these requirements and the tank dimensions the length of the models to be tested is limited to about 3 m accordingly the capacity and the sensitivity of the load cell is determined as the system is required to be able to perform static drift pure sway pure yaw yaw and drift motions it is necessary to introduce the motion trajectories enforced by pmm in an earth fixed or tank fixed coordinate system fig 1 pmm motions described in five quantities 1 carriage speed u c 2 sway motion amplitude y m a x 3 yaw motion amplitude ψ m a x 4 drift angle β and 5 pmm frequency ω standard static and dynamic pmm tests may be shown to be described by the following general equations of motion yoon 2009 1 y p m m y m a x s i n ω t 2 ψ ψ m a x c o s ω t β 3 u u c c o s ψ v p m m s i n ψ 4 u v p m m s i n ψ r v p m m c o s ψ u c s i n ψ 5

model and tank centerlines the terms with pmm indices are earth fixed coordinates where x axis is along the tank centreline y axis along the transverse direction to tank longitudinal axis and origin of the system is fixed at the measuring point of the loadcell identifying pmm parameter limits is carried out so as to be in accordance with ittc recommended procedures dynamic motion amplitudes are studied concerning the clearance between tank side walls and frequency limitations are determined by considering the number of cycles in the steady velocity region along the length of the tank for the benchmark study frequency ω values are selected to be in accordance with the participating institutions of simman 2014 initial estimates on the maximum force and moments to be measured were made by using the test results carried out at iowa institute of hydraulic research iihr with the dtmb 5512 model yoon 2009 a hydraulically driven system was previously considered but due to its high precision and well documented synchronization issues a motion controller system and servo drives are decided in order to power the system system components such as precision linear motion ball screws high precision reduction gears and servo drives are selected two servo motors are used to provide the sway and yaw motions one is dedicated to provide translation and the other rotation the motors are driven under closed loop control to provide the desired sinusoidal motions such as pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift motions however since the motors are independently controlled the pmm is also capable of providing non sinusoidal motions within the limitations of the mechanism in the static mode including steady drift and oblique towing with rudder deflection tests the model is simply held stationary relative to the moving flow at various angles of incidence meantime a decision had to be made whether the system would be mounted on an independent 4 wheel drive trailer or be installed to the main carriage considering the future requirements of manoeuvring research to include wave effects on the one hand and to refrain from the fact that the weight of the trailer causes substantial additional load on the carriage during the towing it is concluded that the system would be much more suitable to be assembled as a balcony type at the aft side of the carriage provided that the system should be compact thus designed pmm system has a width of 4 m in order to allow sway amplitude of 1 25 m it has a steel frame which assembled on the main carriage and on the upper and lower part of the frame linear 40 mm nsk rail is attached to guide the sway motion sway motion is imposed by a double side fixed 50 mm nsk ball screw which is driven by a synchronous servo motor with a nominal torque of 16nm and a nominal 3000 rpm due to the 1 5 reduction of linear ball screw use of a reduction gear found unnecessary for sway motion yaw table is built out of steel where the model was driven by a synchronous servo motor with a nominal torque of 12nm and a nominal 3000 rpm attached to a coronex reducer with a ratio of 1 119 model is attached to the pmm system with a pantograph which enables to work with models having different drafts and also allows the model free to pitch and heave motions while fixing for roll during the berthing phase of the carriage to the dock of the tank the yaw table and all its assembled parts such as loadcell strut pantograph etc can be elevated see fig 2 the drive system is designed in order to establish linkages among the servomotors via a control system using a motion controller so as to accomplish large amplitude motions in conjunction with each other fig 2 shows the pmm system as assembled to the main carriage and table 1 gives the main particulars of the system prior to the implementation of the design of itu pmm a smaller version was designed constructed and installed at the circulating water channel cwc pmm of a nutku ship model testing laboratory in order to test the viability of the main pmm system to be installed at the towing tank all the values of cwc pmm are fixed with a scale of 1 4 of the main full scale system fig 3 the tests carried out with cwc pmm indicated that the system designed is capable to meet all the requirements from the system and demonstrates very satisfactory sensitivity in the transient displacements shown by the encoders fig 4 a c show the prescribed motions in comparison to feedback from the encoders it must be noticed that the analytically defined and measured motions are overlapped and they show no visible discrepancy due to the precision of the system fig 4b d show the absolute error for lateral and angular positions during a pure yaw test fr 0 138 r0 0 05 respectively this represents motions biases due to motion controller and servo drive assemblies are confined within absolute error of 0 001 which gives a relative error of order of 10 3 in a variety of pmm systems harmonic sinusoidal motions are generated by sliding crank or so called scotch yoke mechanisms control systems for scotch yoke mechanisms are said to have easy and smooth operation capabilities but to have limited sway amplitudes and yaw magnitudes some newer pmms use servo motors and linear motion screws or rack pinion mechanisms to generate motions which are not only limited with harmonic sinusoidal pmm motions but also capable of generating arbitrary motions rack pinion mechanisms have almost no amplitude limit however may cause a loss in the precision of motions due to larger backlashes within gears on the other hand the maximum permissible length of a highly precise linear ball screw restrains the sway amplitude due to torsional vibration which limits the allowable mounting distance versus the axial load both of these systems use plc programmable logic controller for the generation of required manoeuvring trajectories pmm coordinates and for controlling the servo motors to drive the mechanism however the ability of plcs to generate interpolating servo motions is rather relatively coarse accordingly itu pmm employs a motion controller in order to generate servo motor coordinates and in turn to attain a higher precision interpolation of sinusoidal motions as compared to plc based control systems moreover using of a linear motion ball screw allows having up to 1 2 m s sway rate and 1 25 m sway amplitude with a precision advantage to rack pinion mechanisms in order to reach a high precision measurement quality and torque requirement for the yaw motion a coronex reducer with a 3 arcmin backlash gives an advantage over rack pinion type reduction gears 2 2 control system pmm motions generated by the use of simotion drive based motion control unit are applied to the system by servo motors controlled via sinamics motor control modules simotion unit is capable of generating very precise interpolating data for the accurate pmm motions and also other desired transient ship motions fig 5 shows the control diagram of itu pmm in itu pmm simotion generates signals for servo drives and close loop control the motion with the feedbacks collected from the motor encoders also simultaneously collect loadcell data and correlate with encoder positions thus prepares the pmm test outputs in order to set the experimental conditions to start the experiment and to save the data during the experiment a mobile hmi human machine interface is used for each standard manoeuvring experiment a specific display was generated in order to set the inputs this display allows user to see real time dynamic data during the experiment both numerically and graphically it allows user to start the motions and data collection independently a display also prepared for the computer on which the experimental data is saved behind the save data button on the experiment menu a script was written in order to generate the data file and name that file in relation with the type date and time of the of that specific experiment output file consists of time encoder data for motions position velocity and acceleration of sway yaw and carriage speed force and moment data from loadcell is in csv comma separated values format and can be opened by microsoft excel 2 3 load cells and data acquisition although the primary calculations showed that longitudinal fx and lateral fy forces over 500 n and yaw moment mz over 500nm is not expected for the planned pmm tests it is decided to order a multi component loadcell which also measure fz force and mx and my moments the capacity of itu pmm multi component loadcell fig 6 is as follows fx fy fz 500 n mx my mz 500nm within these assumptions for the loads a water resistant six component izumi sokki loadcell was designed and built loadcell has a 6 component izumi sokki da 18 k amplifier and a fx fy fz 250 n and mx my mz 250 nm calibration box is also included in order to check the calibration of the loadcell a calibration setup was designed and built setup allows the table to levelize locate and rotate the loadcell in desired position and implement the calibration weights in desired directions the calibration check of the loacell is performed for fx fy and fz forces by using this setup for the moment calibrations an arm of 1 m is used to implement the specific moment loadcell is connected to servo drive reduction gear with a strong arm below the loadcell a pantograph is designed and manufactured in order to fix the ship in roll but allow heave and pitch motions fig 6 this pantograph is manufacted precisely by using cnc out of aircraft grade 7075 aluminum alloy while the shafts are aisi 316 l grade stainless steel a laser liner is used to ensure that the model has no initial angle of attack when locating the pantograph in the midship position and connecting the model to pmm 3 measurement study 3 1 model in order to validate the itu pmm system with the existing simman experimental data standard pmm tests were performed with a 1 46 588 scale geosim of dtmb 5415 model designated as model dtmb 5512 full and model scale ship particulars of surface combatant are listed in table 2 a wooden model with an lpp 3 048 m was manufactured by 5 axis cnc milling machine at ata nutku ship model testing laboratory fig 7 the model has port and starboard keels and does not have other appendages such as rudders struts or shafts cylindrical studs are used as turbulence stimulators 3 2 measurement data filtering and non dimensionalisation for the demonstration of measurements and data filtering of the itu pmm system pure sway experiments at froude number 0 280 and drift angle of βmax 10 are selected and conducted with a sampling rate of 200 hz this case has been used by the participating facilities of simman conferences as an uncertainty case for pure sway experiments fig 8 a shows the measured raw and fft filtered lateral forces the fft filtering procedure is carried out by using the following formula 9 χ t χ 0 n 1 6 χ n c o s n ω t ϕ n fig 8 b shows the selection of a single period of the filtered force data in this graph x axis is non dimensionalized by the oscillation period the starting point of a period is manually determined from the experimental data at which the model is at the centerline of the tank the model is connected to loadcell via a pantograph which allows heave and pitch motions while surge and roll motions are restricted since the loadcell has moving parts and also some parts of the pantograph are carried by the loadcell the inertial force and moment of these components need to be subtracted from the raw measurements of forces and moment thus for each mode of the pmm motions air tests are carried out to estimate the inertial effect of the moving parts measured data during the air tests are filtered as it can be seen in fig 8 c and then reduced to a single period as it is given in fig 8 d and subtracted from the experimental data the source of the noise observed in fig 8 a and b is indeed a mechanical noise mostly coming from the mechanical disturbances of the carriage and of the system due to its low inertia in air test mode note that the same absolute level of noise is effective both in hydrodynamic and air tests where the order of the forces measured in air test is far less than the hydrodynamic test data which means that the noise is relatively higher in air test which naturally affects the sensitivity of the results and in turn detoriorates the symmetry the result of excluding inertial effects of the moving parts of the loadcell and the pantograph from the measurement data and non dimensionalizing according to data reduction equations given in ittc 2017 can be seen in fig 8 e as compared with the simman data although the lateral force in the graph appears to be slightly over predicted compared with the other institutions it is within the uncertainty limits which will be shown in section 3 5 3 3 tests static drift pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift 3 3 1 static drift tests static drift tests were conducted at three carriage speeds corresponding to froude numbers f n v g l of 0 138 0 280 and 0 410 which represent low medium and high speed conditions respectively for low and medium speed conditions drift angle values were varied between 200 whereas between 120 for the high speed condition limited by the capacity of load cell table 3 shows the static drift test parameters 10 v u c s i n β results obtained from the static drift tests are presented in a 3d form in fig 9 in which the dependency of force and moment on forward speed and the drift angle can be observed non dimensionalized data in comparison with other facilities are presented in fig 10 in fig 10 a itu pmm shows a good symmetry in x force measurements between positive and negative β values this has been verified by the results of uncertainty analysis related with asymmetry bias as presented in section 3 6 and thus no correction is required the good correlation between the measurements as shown in fig 10 b for the sway force and fig 10 c for the yaw moment may be attributed to the precise orientation of the model and stiffness of the system 3 3 2 pure sway pure sway tests were carried out at medium speed corresponding to fr 0 28 only and at three maximum drift angles 20 40 100 which correspond to the maximum sway non dimensional velocities v v m a x u c of 0 035 0 070 0 174 respectively table 4 shows the test parameters for pure sway tests fig 11 shows typical sway force measurements in

model is forced to harmonic sway motion while being towed with a constant forward velocity and the results of this test are mainly used to determine the sway acceleration derivatives y v and n v it is clear that the sway velocity derivatives can be also be determined from the pure sway test measurements however derivatives determined from the static drift data are preferred in general as the derivatives from dynamic test data are known as often frequency dependent bishop and parkinson 1970 as the dynamic motion frequency ω becomes large the quasi steady or the slow motion assumptions for the math models can fail and the hydrodynamic forces and moment during the pmm tests become dependent not only on the instantaneous motions but partly also on the previous motions known as the memory effect bishop and parkinson 1970 for a specific harmonic sway frequency ω the basic input is the maximum lateral speed v m a x the harmonics data are determined experimentally by measuring the forces

sensitivity of the itu pmm in measuring x y and n forces and moment the procedure jointly developed by iihr yoon 2009 force simonsen 2004 and istituto nazionale per studi ed esperienze di architettura navale insean benedetti et al 2007 treats total uncertainty u as the root sum square of bias b and precision p limits thesis of yoon 2009 provides a more descriptive presentation of the procedures we present here the essentials of the procedure of which the details can be found in yoon 2009 and in ittc 2017 bias limit is given by the error propagation equation 43 b r 2 i b x i 2 θ x i 2 where r represents x y and n forces and moment as a function of 14 standard uncertainties for dynamic tests 44 x x l t x g y g m i z ρ u v r u v r f and 5 uncertainties for static tests 45 x x l t ρ u c f where f denotes measured values of f x f y and m z b x i 2 s are the elemental biases in x and θ x i 2 s are sensitivity coefficients obtained by 46 θ x i 2 r x i calculation of sensitivity coefficients is somehow tedious but straight forward as analytical definitions of sensitivity coefficients are already given and numerically checked in the present study considering tables a 12 a 13 and a 14 of ittc 2017 θ x i 2 may also be obtained by numerical differentiation as well moffat 1982 note that biases related with u v r u v r and f have their own error propagation equations as well as biases related with pmm velocity and accelerations the uncertainties associated with the manoeuvring derivatives are not presently studied firstly bias limit calculations for the basic standard uncertainties in force and moment reduction equations and for the variables used in defining pmm motions are given in tables 8 and 9 respectively the respective bias limits are considered according to the recommendations in ittc s procedures 7 5 02 06 04 and the descriptions given in yoon 2009 the biases for pmm motion variables take the advantage of the present motion controller employed in itu pmm as a consequence some of the biases for the pmm motions are relatively smaller and even not exist such as n and b s m m which have to be taken into account in the systems using scotch yoke intermediate calculations of elemental bias limits are given in table 10 it is understood from table 10 that it is a common trend in pmm elemental biases that significant contributions come from b u in x force and from b f in y force and n moment for static drift motion similarly b u contribution to total bias of x force and b f contribution to that of y force and n moment are dominant for dynamic tests bias related with i z becomes important in n moment particularly in pure yaw measurements precision limit is estimated by performing repeatability tests in accordance with ittc 2017 in measuring the forces and the moment in static drift pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift motions every test item is treated by multi sample tests of at least n 12 times and evaluated through the multi sample test equation 47 p r t s r n where t 2 0 can be taken to cover 95 percent confidence interval in the probability distribution of the measured data and s r is the standard deviation of the data from n repeated tests under the same conditions total number of 48 runs were made 4 modes of motion 12 runs at f r 0 28 and are used here for comparison the results of multiple test measurements as time histories of forces and moment due to dynamic pmm motions are given in fig 17 the error bounds for x force normally seem to be higher as compared to force y and moment n it is observed from fig 19 at least qualitatively that x time histories and y force in yaw and drift time histories are governed by higher order harmonics the rest may be said to be governed by the first order harmonics total uncertainty in the measured quantity r is given by the root sum square of bias and precision limits 48 u r b r 2 p r 2 accordingly total uncertainty results for itu pmm are given in table 11 for all the modes of the pmm motions at f r 0 28 as expected precision errors are far more less than bias errors the percentages of precision errors appear to be relatively higher in static drift tests and yaw and drift tests and particularly in all the x forces as confirmed by the results shown in fig 17 a there is a possibility of experiencing asymmetry particularly in the measurements of static drift tests between positive and negative β values utmost care was paid to reduce the causes of asymmetry bias such as heeling of the model as well as aligning the centreline of the model with that of the tank to have an idea about the magnitude of the asymmetry bias an error analysis was carried out for static drift tests by taking the average values of the measured quantities related with positive and negative values of β as described in yoon et al 2015 49 r m r r 2 defining d a s y m r r m and subsequently b a s y m 2 d a s y m 2 u r 2 the total uncertainty including asymmetry bias 50 u r a s y m 2 u r 2 b a s y m 2 asymmetry biases b a s y m in static drift tests are calculated for 10 degrees considering the results of repeatability tests table 12 gives the results of this analysis particularly the values of d a s y m as compared with the values of u r relatively smaller values of asymmetry biases which are not taken into account here in total uncertainty because of the fact that b a s y m 0 when d a s y m u r pinpoint to the precise calibration of the model the accurate alignment of the model is accomplished by the use of vertical laser liner in the present case ua comparisons are made with those of iihr force and insean as obtained from table 10 n order level of yoon et al 2015 in table 13 as the results in yoon et al 2015 are given only for static drift and pure yaw motions thus we include our results for the same mode of the motions one may conclude from the results that using larger models are important and effective in reducing uncertainty levels a conclusion drawn out of the fact that force and insean used models having lengths of 4 002 m m and 5 719 m respectively while both iihr and itu used 3 048 m models on the other hand uncertainty levels achieved by itu pmm show that the present design with its compact structure and motion controller based system is able to function properly to attain quite satisfactory results 4 concluding remarks design and development of a compact and lightweight manoeuvring test system based on planar motion mechanism and a motion controller system has been presented the main design goal has been to generate relatively large amplitude motions with high precision measurements with a simple and practical test system which is easy to install operate and maintain the design team initially evaluated various mounting alternatives and consequently it was concluded that the system would be much more efficient to be mounted on the existing towing carriage so that the system would be compact another assessment was made on the motion mechanism and a linear motion device with double servo drives was selected for compactness and the need for large motion amplitudes the components of the system such as precision ball screws reduction gear and encoders were selected to represent the state of the art in ship model testing technologies the motion controller was programmed to generate accurate motions synchronously collect the encoder and loadcell data and produce reliable output files itu pmm system takes advantage of the latest technology on the linear ball screw based motion mechanisms and motion controllers which enables the system to generate oscillatory motions with larger amplitudes and produce more accurate and reliable test data a significant technological advantage of itu pmm system is the use of precise yaw motion reduction gear with a backlash of 3 arc min 0 05 deg while the system is cost effective because of the compact size and simple mechanisms the test results are comparable in accuracy and reliability with those obtained by much larger and complicated pmm systems the validation of the test system has been carried out by using a common benchmark case based on a high speed displacement type ship model dtmb 5415 the measured forces and moments as well as the derived manoeuvring derivatives were compared with those obtained by force and iihr these comparisons have indicated that within the scale limitation of the model both the force and moment measurements and the derived manoeuvring derivatives correlate well uncertainty analysis is performed according to the standard recommended procedures of ittc 7 5 02 06 04 ittc 2017 the present analysis is focused on the determination of total uncertainty of the manoeuvring predictions obtained from the measurements of forces and moment bias limit calculations for the basic standard uncertainties in force and moment reduction equations and precision limit estimations by performing repeatability tests of at least 12 times for static drift pure sway pure yaw and yaw and drift motions made it possible to arrive at the related total uncertainties asymmetry bias is found to be small enough even for the static drift test and therefore not included in the final uncertainty limits total uncertainties are compared with those of iihr force and insean and it is found that the present system developed functions quite satisfactorily in predicting manoeuvring characteristics by means of the measurement of the forces and moments a distinct feature of itu pmm is demonstrated by consistent character of bias and precision limits as seen in table 13 as it appears from the latest status of the prediction methods that among the tools theoretical computational experimental available the best combination appears to be captive model tests complemented by free running model tests whereas virtual captive tests cfd may be an additional component of the prediction procedure quadvlieg 2016 within this context from experimental point of view the captive model testing presented here should not be considered as a sole tool in predicting manoeuvring characteristics but as the integral part of the test

21136,based on linear potential flow theory and the matching eigenfunction expansion method an analytical model is developed to investigate the hydrodynamics of two dimensional multi pontoon floating breakwaters that also work as oscillating buoy wave energy converters the pontoons are constrained to independent heave motion and the linear power take off damping is used to calculate the absorbed power the proposed model is verified using the principle of energy conservation performance of the system with different numbers of pontoons is studied and the results show that the wave attenuation performanceper the energy capture performance and the effective frequency bandwidth are superior in the multi pontoon system as compared to the single pontoon systems with the same volume bragg resonance dominates the wave energy extraction performance at certain frequencies which reduces the hydrodynamic efficiency conversely in the frequency region away from bragg resonance the hydrodynamic efficiency is enhanced due to the constructive hydrodynamic interactions of the multi body system keywords wave energy converters multi pontoon system floating breakwaters analytical model effective frequency bandwidth 1 introduction with the increasing environmental and energy crisis the society is gradually moving towards clean energy technologies due to the large reserves of untapped energy in ocean waves wave energy technology has received a lot of attention in recent decades many kinds of wave energy converters wecs have been invented and investigated thoroughly three of the main categories are oscillating buoys oscillating water columns and overtopping devices falnes 2007 however very few wec concepts have reached a technology readiness level high enough to motivate large scale installation with one of the main obstacles being high construction costs to tackle the problem of high construction costs integrated systems combining wave energy converters and breakwaters have been proposed the breakwater wec systems can be either bottom mounted or floating zhao et al 2019a 2019b mustapa et al 2017 zhao and ning 2018 for the fixed bottom mounted type zhao et al 2020 the common geometry of caisson breakwaters and certain wecs including land based owcs and overtopping devices paved the way to combining them many investigations have been conducted from the point view of hydrodynamic performance and energy capturing efficiency mendon et al 2018 malara et al 2017 vicinanza et al 2014 musa et al 2017 contestabile et al 2020 results show that the integration of the owc chambers can reduce the wave forces and the reflection coefficient of the original caisson breakwater thus improving the wave attenuation performance of the breakwater for the second category floating breakwater wec systems possess the advantage of flexibility and the installation poses a less severe impact on the marine environment contestabile et al 2020 many investigations of floating breakwater wec systems have been conducted to explore their mechanisms for wave attenuation and wave energy utilization mustapa et al 2017 including floating breakwater owc devices howe et al 2020 he et al 2019 john ashlin et al 2018 floating breakwater oscillating buoy devices zhao and ning 2018 etc here we focus on the floating breakwater oscillating buoy devices ning et al 2016 proposed a floating breakwater wec system and found by experimental methods that the satisfied capture width ratio and wave attenuation performance can be achieved simultaneously at a certain frequency range to improve the efficiency of the single pontoon type device through reduced viscosity dissipation chen et al 2019 recommended to modify the sharp edges of the rectangular buoy zhang et al 2020 used numerical methods to investigate a single pontoon type floating breakwater wec system with a triangular baffle bottom and showed that the baffle is beneficial both for the wave energy extraction and wave attenuation reabroy et al 2019 combined a floating breakwater and a wedge type wave energy converter compared to symmetrical devices the efficiency of the wedge type device was found to be larger due to the reflected waves from the floating breakwater the studies of zhang et al 2019 and zhao et al 2017a also proved similar conclusions the competitiveness of a floating breakwater wec system can be enhanced by broadening the frequency bandwidth where both wave energy extraction and breakwater wave attenuation performance are satisfactory garnaud and mei 2009 2010 gave the theoretical prediction on the performance of a single buoy device and multi pontoon devices under the premise that the volume of the two systems would be the same indicating the same capital costs garnaud and mei 2009 2010 they showed that the multi pontoon device exhibits a higher wave energy extraction efficiency both in 2 d and 3 d however they did not consider the draft ratio of each buoy or the case of irregular waves ning et al 2017 investigated the performance of a floating dual pontoon breakwater wec system where each buoy worked independently using an analytical method and comparisons to a single pontoon system with the same volume showed that the effective frequency bandwidth of the dual pontoon system was broader experimental verifications on the advantages of the dual pontoon system has been made by ning et al 2018 even though the wave energy extraction advantages of the multi pontoon system have been pointed out by garnaud and mei 2009 a thorough comparison for systems with different number of bodies has not been conducted in addition the effect of bragg reflection to the system has not been fully clarified inspired by the study of garnaud and mei 2009 and ning et al 2017 in this paper we study the performance of multi pontoon floating breakwater wec systems using an analytical method systems with different number of pontoons are compared and the effect of bragg reflection is analyzed both in regular and irregular waves the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the analytical equations governing the dynamics and performance are presented in section 3 the method is verified and the results are presented and discussed conclusions are given in section 4 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 floating breakwater wec system the multi pontoon floating breakwater wec system includes pontoons vertical piles and linear power take off pto systems as shown in fig 1 the pontoons are restricted to heave motion by the vertical pile and the dynamics actuates the individual pto systems the floating breakwater is installed on the vertical pile 2 2 analytical formulation as shown in fig 2 the individual widths of the n pontoons is denoted a n the drafts as d n and the distance between adjacent pontoons as d n in order to study the interaction between waves and the multi pontoon breakwater wec system a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system o xz is established with its origin located on the still water surface the z axis is vertical upward and the x axis points along the direction of the incident wave propagation the water depth is h the water density is ρ the angular frequency of the propagate wave is ω and the wave amplitude is a as indicated in fig 2 the fluid domain is divided into 2n 1 subdomains denoted ωn the subdomain ω1 is the area defined by x x 1 l h z 0 and the subdomain ω2n under the ith pontoon is the area defined by x i l x x i r h z d i i 1 2 n the subdomain ω2i 1 between the ith and i 1 th pontoons is the area x i r x x i 1 l h z 0 with i n the final subdomain ω2n 1 is the area after the structure x i r x h z 0 notably x i l denotes the coordinate of the left edge of the nth pontoon and x i r denotes the coordinate of the right edge of the ith pontoon linear potential flow theory is assumed i e viscosity and rotation are neglected the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and the waves are assumed to be non steep such that the first order linear approximation can be taken the fluid motion in the whole domain can be described by the velocity potential 1 φ x z t re φ x z e i ω t where t is the time re denotes the real part of a complex function and φ x z is a complex velocity potential that satisfies the laplace equation 2 2 φ x 2 2 φ z 2 0 the hydrodynamic problem is divided into diffraction problem involving incident potential and diffraction potential and radiation problem involving radiation potential caused by the forced motion of each body due to the linearity of the problem the velocity potential can be divided into three components as 3 φ φ i φ d i 1 n φ r i where φ i is the incident potential φ d is the diffraction potential and φ r n is the radiation potential due to the heave motion of the nth structure the velocity potential for the incident waves which are incident along the positive direction of x can be written as 4 φ i i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x where g is the acceleration of gravity and k is the wave number which satisfies the dispersion relation ω 2 g k tanh k h for the diffraction problem the governing equation is laplace equation see eq 2 and the boundary conditions on the free surface z 0 and all rigid boundaries are 5 φ d z ω 2 g φ d 0 z 0 x x 1 l or x i r x x i 1 l or x x n r i 1 n 1 φ d z 0 z h φ d z φ i z z d i x i l x x i r

be written as φr i iωa r i ϕ r i x z the boundary conditions of the radiation potential φr i can be written as follows 6 ϕ r i z ω 2 g ϕ r i 0 z 0 x x 1 l or x i r x x i 1 l or x x n r i 1 n 1 ϕ r i z

and radiation potentials in each subdomain can be obtained as in the paper by zheng and zhang 2016 we solve the system of equations analytically by separation of variables and eigenfunction expansion by separation of variables into orthogonal eigenfunctions and by keeping the pressure and velocity continuity at the intersection lines between the neighboring sub domains shown in fig 2 the unknown coefficients of the diffraction and radiation potentials can be obtained 2 3 hydrodynamic quantities after the diffraction potential has been identified the vertical excitation force f z i on the ith structure can be computed as an integral over the mean wetted surface s i of the structure 7 f z i i ω ρ s i φ i φ d n z d s the vertical excitation force can be non dimensionalized by the hydrostatic stiffness as f z i ρga i d i the added mass μ i j and radiation damping λ i j on the ith structure in the heave motion subject to a unit forced motion of the jth structure can be obtained as the real and imaginary part of the radiation potential integrated over the mean wetted surface 8 μ i j ρ s i re ϕ r j n z d s 9 λ i j ρ ω s i im ϕ r j n z d s with the hydrodynamical forces obtained then the equation of motion can be written as 10 ω 2 m μ i ω λ λ p t o k a r f z where m is the mass matrix of the bodies k is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix of the bodies proportional to the waterplane area of each body μ and λ are the added mass and radiation damping matrices of the structures λ pto is the pto damping matrix imposed on the structures and a r and f z denote heave motion vector and heave excitation force vector respectively by writing the matrices in equation 10 explicitly the equations of motion take the form 11 ω 2 m 1 m n μ 1 1 μ 1 n μ n 1 μ n n i ω λ 1 1 λ 1 n λ n 1 λ n n λ pto 1 1 λ pto n n k 1 k n a r 1 a r n f z 1 f z n note that the diagonal nonzero elements λ pto i i of the pto damping matrix represent the pto damping imposed on the nth pontoon in the present study λ pto i i equals to the optimal pto damping for an isolated single device which can be expressed as falnes 2002 12 λ pto i i k i ω ω m i μ i 2 λ i 2 where k i ρga i m i ρa i d i μ i and λ i represent the stiffness mass added mass and damping coefficient of the nth structure in the isolated case respectively the added mass μ i and radiation damping λ i can be calculated by solving the radiation problem of an isolated body i in isolated case which can be realized by neglecting the size of the other bodies in the present analytical model since the implementation of the optimal pto damping in isolated case for a device array may produce excellent wave energy extraction performance bellew et al 2009 we use the optimal pto damping in isolated case to examine the performance of the multi body system the heave response amplitude operator hrao i of the ith pontoon is calculated as the ratio between the heave response and the wave amplitude hrao i a r i a the power p i captured by the ith structure can be calculated as 13 p i 1 2 ω 2 λ pto i i a r i 2 and the total power absorbed p total is the sum of the absorbed power of the individual pontoons which can be calculated as p t o t a l i 1 n p i the power of the incident wave p incident in one wave period is expressed as 14 p incident 1 2 ρ g a 2 ω 2 k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h for the present wave energy system the hydrodynamic efficiency η i of the ith structure is defined as the ratio of wave power p i captured by the ith pontoon to incident wave power p incident η i p i p incident likewise the efficiency of the full system is obtained as η total p total p incident the performance of a breakwater can be evaluated by the reflection coefficients k r defined as the ratio of the incident waves that are being reflected and the transmission coefficients k t defined as the ratio of the incident waves that are transmitted past the breakwater structure they can be written as 15 k r φ d 1 i ω j 1 n a r j ϕ j 1 r φ i x 16 k t φ i φ d 2 n 1 i ω j 1 n a r j ϕ j 2 n 1 r φ i x respectively where φ d 1 and φ d 2 n 1 denote the diffraction potential at the weather side and lee side of the multi body system ϕ j 2 n 1 r denotes the radiation potential at the lee side of the multi body system abs denote the absolute value of a complex number 3 results and discussions 3 1 verification the principle of energy conservation says that within the context of potential flow theory the incident waves must be reflected transmitted or converted by the wec in other words that k r 2 k t 2 η total 1 must be satisfied at all times fig 3 shows the results of k r 2 k t 2 η total for a system of 6 pontoons with geometrical parameters of pontoon widths a i 0 1h drafts d i 0 125h and separation distances d i 0 2h the nonzero elements of the pto damping matrix are the diagonal entries λ pto i i it can be seen that the identity of k r 2 k t 2 η total 1 is satisfied for all values of the non dimensional wave number kh which serves as a verification of the present analytical model 3 2 parametric study a parametric study is conducted to investigate the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic performance of an integrated system to various wave and geometrical parameters such as different widths drafts and number of pontoons 3 2 1 effect of the pontoon number in this section the effect of the number of the pontoons on the performance is investigated the widths and the drafts of each pontoon for different systems are kept the same the symbol a n represents the width of the pontoons for the system consisting of n pontoons the draft of all pontoons is 0 125h and the spacing distance is 0 2h to maintain a constant volume the relationship of a 1 2a 2 3a 3 4a 4 5a 5 6a 6 0 6h is obtained again the pto damping applied to each pontoon is the optimal pto damping of a pontoon in isolation fig 4 a c shows the reflection coefficients k r transmission coefficient k t and total cwr as functions of the wave number for cases with different number of pontoons it can be seen that generally the reflection coefficient increases with increasing kh and obvious oscillations can be found during the increasing trend the oscillations for the reflection coefficient is due to the bragg resonance garnaud and mei 2010 specially the reflection coefficient for the multi pontoon system at bragg resonance is larger than that of the single pontoon system for the 2 d multiple floating bodies bragg resonance is trigged by the condition of s l 2 n n 1 2 3 where s and l denote the distance between two adjacent bodies and the incident wave length respectively ouyang et al 2015 physically the strong interference is triggered when the reflected waves caused by different bodies arrive at the weather side of the multi pontoon system at the same phase mei et al 2018 with increasing numbers of floating pontoon the first peak value of k r corresponding to s l 2 1 increases this agrees with the conclusions found by ding et al 2019 symbolically we mark the locations of the main bragg resonance as k c here we take the six pontoon system as an example as shown in fig 4 a c there are several oscillations at the frequency region beneath k c which we mark as k n n 1 2 3 4 and 5 sorting from high frequency to low frequency the half wave length is then obtained as l n 2 π k n for this system in addition to the adjacent distance s there are four other distances between any two bodies the five s n l n 2 values are found in table 1 the conditions of the first bragg resonance is s 1 l 1 2 0 47 which doesn t agree with the condition of s 1 l 1 2 1 mentioned before this is due to the fact that the exact condition shall be satisfied under the premise that the size of the pontoon is very small compared to the distance of two adjacent bodies for the present case the size of the pontoon is comparable to the separation distance hence the bragg resonance frequency is shifted in order to further explore the relationship between the position of first bragg resonance and the adjacent distance s five different s are selected for the six pontoon system and the shift rule of s n l n 2 value is discussed the five s n l n 2 values are found in table 2 the occurring condition of the bragg resonance has a obvious shift towards left with the decrease of the adjacent distance s and as the distance between two adjacent pontoons increases s n l n 2 is closer to 1 this phenomenon shows that the wavelength corresponding to the first bragg reflection becomes larger in the case with smaller adjacent distance as can be seen in fig 4 b the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing wave number for the multi pontoon system the number of bodies affect the transmission coefficient in particular the transmission coefficient is less for the multi body system than for a single body system which agrees with the findings in ref zheng and zhang 2016 that is to say a satisfactory breakwater performance with k t 0 5 is found over a larger frequency range for the multi pontoon system as compared to the single pontoon system for the single pontoon system a parabolic trend of the cwr with a single peak value of 50 can be found at the resonance frequency in fig 4 c whereas for the multi pontoon system two spikes and a valley value of the total cwr can be found the location of the valley corresponds to the bragg resonance peak of the reflection coefficient in fig 4 a which is in agreement with similar phenomenon identified in ref garnaud and mei 2009 2010 the location of the spikes and the valley value shift to the higher frequency region with the increasing number of pontoons interestingly the peak value increases and the valley value decreases with increasing pontoon number the maximum cwr of the six pontoon system is 81 3 which is larger than that of the single pontoon system besides at the high frequency region i e 5 kh 8 the efficiency of the multi pontoon system is clearly superior to the single pontoon system from fig 4 b c it can be found that the effective frequency bandwidth for increasing number of pontoons n 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 is 2 40 4 05 4 50 4 75 4 75 and 4 80 note that with increasing number of pontoons the effective frequency bandwidth increases and approaches an asymptotic value this is due to the fact that increasing number of pontoons will shift the bragg resonance which corresponds to a valley value of the cwr the decreasing valley value of the cwr results in narrower effective frequency bandwidth such as the cases for the five pontoon system and the six pontoon system as discussed above the effective frequency range is defined to satisfy k t 0 5 and η total 20 in addition one can examine the frequency range of the multi pontoon system that satisfies a cwr of η total 50 which is the maximum of the single pontoon system the frequency bandwidth satisfying this condition is 2 10 3 25 3 80 4 10 and 4 20 for increasing number of pontoons n 2 6 i e increasing the number of pontoons widens the frequency range over which the energy extraction is more than the maximum of the single pontoon system to further explore the wave energy extraction efficiency of the multi pontoon system we analyze the wave excitation force the cwr and the response amplitude operator hrao of each buoy as shown in fig 5 a c the behavior of the cwr and the heave response amplitude operator against the wave number kh are similar a valley value can be found at the fundamental bragg reflection frequency k c after which a spike can be found for both this second peak coincides with the peak of the single pontoon system due to the shadow effect the cwr of each buoy decreases with its location away from the front side of the structure the sharp valley values of the cwr and h rao at the fundamental frequency k c can be understood from the corresponding valley point of the wave excitation force seen in fig 5 c for frequencies k k c the excitation force of the front buoy gradually approaches the asymptotic curve of an isolated buoy whereas the wave forces on the rest of the buoys decreases to zero this is because that most of the wave energy is captured by the front pontoon while the wave passes through it and the wave energy transmitted to the latter pontoons is very small hence the existence of the rear pontoons has little effect on the wave force of the first pontoon correspondingly for high frequency waves k k c the cwr and hrao of the front buoy approaches the values of an isolated buoy whereas they reduce to zero for the remaining buoys for the frequency region below k c the wave excitation forces oscillate strongly with most values above those of an isolated buoy 3 2 2 effect of the different widths of pontoons in this section the effect of different widths of pontoons a n is investigated in order to keep the construction costs of the system constant the premise for the present investigation is that the total volume of the pontoons is kept constant garnaud and mei 2009 the three scenarios shown in table 3 are considered in this subsection the draft of each pontoon d n 0 125h and the distance between two pontoons d n 0 2h is kept constant the pto damping applied to each pontoon of the system is the optimal pto damping of the pontoon in isolation fig 6 a c shows the variation of the reflection coefficients k r transmission coefficient k t and total cwr corresponding to the three scenarios it can be seen that the reflection coefficient increases with the increase of kh there are several obvious oscillations during the increasing trend and oscillation positions of the three scenarios are relatively close to each other especially the reflection coefficient of scenario 3 with decreasing pontoon widths is larger than that of the other two scenarios in the frequency range of kh 5 interestingly an obvious drop in reflection coefficient was observed for the scenario 1 and 2 in fig 6 a however there was a slight drop observed for scenario 3 this is due to the fact that physically the greater width of the buoys in the front side for scenario 3 comparing to that for scenario 1 and 2 lead to the strong reflection in shorter waves hence the wave energy extraction efficiency is very small for scenario 3 in the higher frequency region comparatively the wave energy extraction efficiency for scenarios 1 and 2 is relatively higher than that for scenario 3 as a result a peak value in the higher frequency region for scenario 1 and 2 can be found while it is absent for scenario 3 based on the wave energy flux conservation rule the presence of the peak value of efficiency often accompanies the valley value in reflection coefficient the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing wave number for the six pontoon system the transmission coefficients of the scenarios 1 and 2 with equal or increasing pontoon widths are similar to each other and smaller than that of the scenario 3 in the whole calculated frequency range in other words the breakwater performance is better in the first two scenarios with increasing wave number the total cwr increases first and then decreases and there are two spikes and a valley the frequency ranges at which both the breakwater and the wave power extraction have a satisfying performance defined by the conditions k t 0 5 and η total 20 is denoted the effective frequency range from fig 6 b c it can be seen that the effective frequency bandwidths corresponding to scenario 1 2 and 3 are 4 85 4 85 and 2 30 in other words the configuration with equal pontoon widths and with smaller front pontoon and a bigger rear pontoon have wider effective bandwidth than the system with decreasing pontoon widths in addition the wave energy capture efficiency of the first two scenarios is obviously superior in the high frequency region i e 5 kh 8 3 2 3 effect of the different drafts of pontoons the effect of the different drafts d n of pontoons is investigated in this section similar to the previous section there are three scenarios see table 4 considered here the width of each pontoon a n 0 100h and the distance between two pontoons d n 0 2h are constant and the pto damping applied to each pontoon of the system is the optimal pto damping of the pontoon in isolation the influence of the different drafts of the pontoons on the reflection coefficient k r transmission coefficient k t and total cwr η total is shown in fig 7 a c it can be seen that the reflection coefficient increases with increasing wave number multiple obvious oscillations can be found during the increasing trend and the location of the oscillation spikes move to the high frequency region in the scenario with increasing drafts interestingly when the pontoons have equal drafts corresponding to scenario 1 the maximum value of the spike in the reflection coefficient is larger than in the other two scenarios the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing wave number and is almost the same for the three scenarios as kh 3 i e the transmission coefficient is less affected by the draft configuration of the pontoons under long waves in terms of the total cwr similar to fig 6 c two spikes and a valley value can be found and the location of the valley value is corresponding to the location of the spike of the k r it can be seen that the valley and the spikes are located at higher frequencies in scenario 2 of increasing drafts as compared to the other two scenarios from fig 7 b c it can be seen that the effective frequency bandwidth for scenarios 1 2 and 3 are 4 85 9 60 and 2 80 respectively overall the system with a small draft front pontoon and large draft rear pontoon performs better in terms of the effective frequency bandwidth and also has a higher wave energy capture efficiency in the high frequency region 3 3 hydrodynamic characteristics in irregular waves in this subsection the hydrodynamic performance of the multi pontoon system in irregular waves is investigated using the modified jonswap spectrum goda 1999 defined by the spectral density function s ω 17 s ω 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 18 σ 0 07 0 09 ω ω p ω ω p where ω p denotes the peak angular frequency h s represents the significant wave height γ 3 3 is the peak enhancement factor and σ is the peak shape coefficient the spectrum can be discretized into small frequency steps for which the wave amplitude a j of the jth wave component is given by 19 a j 2 s ω j δ ω j where ω j denotes the angular frequency of jth wave component using the analysis for the regular waves in the proceeding sections the power of the incident irregular waves can be obtained as a sum over all wave components 20 p irregular j 1 m 1 2 ρ g a j 2 ω j 2 k j 1 2 k j h sinh 2 k j h j 1 m ρ g s ω j δ ω j ω j 2 k j 1 2 k j h sinh 2 k j h where k j is the wave number of the jth wave component the power p j captured by the ith pontoon can be calculated as 21 p i irregular j 1 m ω j 2 λ pto ω m i i a r i j 2 s ω j ω j where a r i j is the heave response amplitude of the ith pontoon corresponding to the jth wave component and λ pto ω m i i is the optimal pto damping of the ith pontoon corresponding to the peak frequency ω m the total absorbed power is then obtained as the sum of the power of the individual pontoons the cwr η i irregular of the ith structure can be calculated as 22 η i irregular p i irregular p irregular and the total cwr η total irregular is obtained similarly as 23 η total irregular p total irregular p irregular the reflection coefficients k r irregular and transmission coefficients k t irregular in the irregular waves can be obtained from the coefficients of the different wave components as 24 k r irregular j 1 m k r j 2 s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j j 1 m s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j 25 k t irregular j 1 m k t j 2 s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j j 1 m s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j where k r j and k t j represent the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient corresponding to the representative wave number of the jth component wave fig 8 a c shows the results of the reflection coefficients k r irregular the transmission coefficient k t irregular and the cwr η total irregular in irregular waves for the single and multi pontoon systems the significant oscillations seen for all coefficients in regular waves are not visible in irregular waves and the effect of the bragg resonance becomes milder in irregular waves the reflection coefficient is slightly reduced with the increasing number of pontoons and the total cwr is improved significantly for the multi pontoon system similar to that in the regular waves the improvement becomes smaller with increasing number of pontoons from fig 8 c it can be seen that under the action of irregular waves the capture width ratio of the six pontoon system can be up to 63 8 which is an obvious improvement of the maximal cwr of 40 1 for the single pontoon system the effective frequency bandwidth where k t 0 5 and η total irregular 20 is satisfied for number of pontoons n 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 is 2 60 4 20 4 70 5 00 5 20 and 5 30 in fig 9 a c the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the total cwr of the six pontoon system are compared for regular waves and irregular waves due to the weighted average of the spectral density function see eq 26 30 31 the bragg resonance becomes milder in irregular waves the significant oscillations in the reflection coefficient and cwr are not seen in irregular waves only one peak value for the cwr is observed in irregular waves the effective frequency bandwidth and maximum total cwr for different cases in regular waves and irregular waves are shown in table 5 the maximum cwr in irregular waves is less than that in regular waves due to the absence of the valley value that appearance in regular waves the effective frequency bandwidth is a continuous and wider interval in irregular waves 4 discussion in this paper we investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a multi pontoon breakwater wec system the results show that the wave power extraction performance is improved as the number of bodies increases and under the condition that the total volume of the multiple bodies is fixed increasing the number of bodies improves the effective frequency bandwidth of the floating breakwater wec system as for this multi body system the classical phenomenon of bragg resonance is important to the performance of the system the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system is mitigated significantly while the bragg resonance i e strong reflection phenomenon is trigged in realistic irregular waves however the influence of the bragg resonance is suppressed the analysis in this paper is based on linear potential flow theory which neglects fluid viscosity for the present multi body system the narrow gaps between the structures may cause energy loss due the viscosity ning et al 2015 gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2017b lu et al 2011 li 2020 especially for the condition of gap resonance comparing with the potential flow environment the fluid viscosity lead to the suppression of the wave elevation in the gap between to close bodies thus the analysis based on linear potential flow in this paper theory may overestimate the efficiency and the body motion of the wec system lu et al 2011 but the fluid viscosity may not modify the frequencies corresponding to the peak value of efficiency it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the fluid viscosity and gap resonance on the hydrodynamic performance of the multi pontoon system it is worthy to note that more pto dampers have to be implemented for a system with more bodies also the required spacing and width lead to the larger sea area to be occupied the required pto dampers and the occupied sea area influence the cost of the wave energy system to some extent the two aspects of cost and efficiency have to be balanced while designing such a system 5 conclusions using an analytical method in this study the performance of a breakwater wave energy systems has been investigated the system consists of a floating breakwater integrated with single or multi pontoon structures with independent power take off systems the total volume of the structure which can be taken as a crude estimation of the capital costs is kept constant in all systems the capture width ratio reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient have been analyzed and the conclusions are as follows 1 the wave attenuation performance wave energy extraction efficiency and the effective frequency bandwidth of the multi pontoon system is superior to that of a single pontoon system as the number of pontoons becomes large the performance indicators converge to an asymptotic value and increasing the number of pontoons further will not improve the total performance 2 constructive hydrodynamic interference which leads to enhanced wave energy extraction efficiency can be found at the low wave frequencies with the exception of the bragg reflection frequency 3 the geometrical properties of the individual pontoons affect the total performance of system in regular waves the efficiency of the multi pontoon system can be improved by adjusting the draft and the natural frequency range of each buoy 4 bragg resonance can reduce the efficiency of the multi pontoon system due to the weighted average of the spectral density function this negative

21136,based on linear potential flow theory and the matching eigenfunction expansion method an analytical model is developed to investigate the hydrodynamics of two dimensional multi pontoon floating breakwaters that also work as oscillating buoy wave energy converters the pontoons are constrained to independent heave motion and the linear power take off damping is used to calculate the absorbed power the proposed model is verified using the principle of energy conservation performance of the system with different numbers of pontoons is studied and the results show that the wave attenuation performanceper the energy capture performance and the effective frequency bandwidth are superior in the multi pontoon system as compared to the single pontoon systems with the same volume bragg resonance dominates the wave energy extraction performance at certain frequencies which reduces the hydrodynamic efficiency conversely in the frequency region away from bragg resonance the hydrodynamic efficiency is enhanced due to the constructive hydrodynamic interactions of the multi body system keywords wave energy converters multi pontoon system floating breakwaters analytical model effective frequency bandwidth 1 introduction with the increasing environmental and energy crisis the society is gradually moving towards clean energy technologies due to the large reserves of untapped energy in ocean waves wave energy technology has received a lot of attention in recent decades many kinds of wave energy converters wecs have been invented and investigated thoroughly three of the main categories are oscillating buoys oscillating water columns and overtopping devices falnes 2007 however very few wec concepts have reached a technology readiness level high enough to motivate large scale installation with one of the main obstacles being high construction costs to tackle the problem of high construction costs integrated systems combining wave energy converters and breakwaters have been proposed the breakwater wec systems can be either bottom mounted or floating zhao et al 2019a 2019b mustapa et al 2017 zhao and ning 2018 for the fixed bottom mounted type zhao et al 2020 the common geometry of caisson breakwaters and certain wecs including land based owcs and overtopping devices paved the way to combining them many investigations have been conducted from the point view of hydrodynamic performance and energy capturing efficiency mendon et al 2018 malara et al 2017 vicinanza et al 2014 musa et al 2017 contestabile et al 2020 results show that the integration of the owc chambers can reduce the wave forces and the reflection coefficient of the original caisson breakwater thus improving the wave attenuation performance of the breakwater for the second category floating breakwater wec systems possess the advantage of flexibility and the installation poses a less severe impact on the marine environment contestabile et al 2020 many investigations of floating breakwater wec systems have been conducted to explore their mechanisms for wave attenuation and wave energy utilization mustapa et al 2017 including floating breakwater owc devices howe et al 2020 he et al 2019 john ashlin et al 2018 floating breakwater oscillating buoy devices zhao and ning 2018 etc here we focus on the floating breakwater oscillating buoy devices ning et al 2016 proposed a floating breakwater wec system and found by experimental methods that the satisfied capture width ratio and wave attenuation performance can be achieved simultaneously at a certain frequency range to improve the efficiency of the single pontoon type device through reduced viscosity dissipation chen et al 2019 recommended to modify the sharp edges of the rectangular buoy zhang et al 2020 used numerical methods to investigate a single pontoon type floating breakwater wec system with a triangular baffle bottom and showed that the baffle is beneficial both for the wave energy extraction and wave attenuation reabroy et al 2019 combined a floating breakwater and a wedge type wave energy converter compared to symmetrical devices the efficiency of the wedge type device was found to be larger due to the reflected waves from the floating breakwater the studies of zhang et al 2019 and zhao et al 2017a also proved similar conclusions the competitiveness of a floating breakwater wec system can be enhanced by broadening the frequency bandwidth where both wave energy extraction and breakwater wave attenuation performance are satisfactory garnaud and mei 2009 2010 gave the theoretical prediction on the performance of a single buoy device and multi pontoon devices under the premise that the volume of the two systems would be the same indicating the same capital costs garnaud and mei 2009 2010 they showed that the multi pontoon device exhibits a higher wave energy extraction efficiency both in 2 d and 3 d however they did not consider the draft ratio of each buoy or the case of irregular waves ning et al 2017 investigated the performance of a floating dual pontoon breakwater wec system where each buoy worked independently using an analytical method and comparisons to a single pontoon system with the same volume showed that the effective frequency bandwidth of the dual pontoon system was broader experimental verifications on the advantages of the dual pontoon system has been made by ning et al 2018 even though the wave energy extraction advantages of the multi pontoon system have been pointed out by garnaud and mei 2009 a thorough comparison for systems with different number of bodies has not been conducted in addition the effect of bragg reflection to the system has not been fully clarified inspired by the study of garnaud and mei 2009 and ning et al 2017 in this paper we study the performance of multi pontoon floating breakwater wec systems using an analytical method systems with different number of pontoons are compared and the effect of bragg reflection is analyzed both in regular and irregular waves the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the analytical equations governing the dynamics and performance are presented in section 3 the method is verified and the results are presented and discussed conclusions are given in section 4 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 floating breakwater wec system the multi pontoon floating breakwater wec system includes pontoons vertical piles and linear power take off pto systems as shown in fig 1 the pontoons are restricted to heave motion by the vertical pile and the dynamics actuates the individual pto systems the floating breakwater is installed on the vertical pile 2 2 analytical formulation as shown in fig 2 the individual widths of the n pontoons is denoted a n the drafts as d n and the distance between adjacent pontoons as d n in order to study the interaction between waves and the multi pontoon breakwater wec system a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system o xz is established with its origin located on the still water surface the z axis is vertical upward and the x axis points along the direction of the incident wave propagation the water depth is h the water density is ρ the angular frequency of the propagate wave is ω and the wave amplitude is a as indicated in fig 2 the fluid domain is divided into 2n 1 subdomains denoted ωn the subdomain ω1 is the area defined by x x 1 l h z 0 and the subdomain ω2n under the ith pontoon is the area defined by x i l x x i r h z d i i 1 2 n the subdomain ω2i 1 between the ith and i 1 th pontoons is the area x i r x x i 1 l h z 0 with i n the final subdomain ω2n 1 is the area after the structure x i r x h z 0 notably x i l denotes the coordinate of the left edge of the nth pontoon and x i r denotes the coordinate of the right edge of the ith pontoon linear potential flow theory is assumed i e viscosity and rotation are neglected the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and the waves are assumed to be non steep such that the first order linear approximation can be taken the fluid motion in the whole domain can be described by the velocity potential 1 φ x z t re φ x z e i ω t where t is the time re denotes the real part of a complex function and φ x z is a complex velocity potential that satisfies the laplace equation 2 2 φ x 2 2 φ z 2 0 the hydrodynamic problem is divided into diffraction problem involving incident potential and diffraction potential and radiation problem involving radiation potential caused by the forced motion of each body due to the linearity of the problem the velocity potential can be divided into three components as 3 φ φ i φ d i 1 n φ r i where φ i is the incident potential φ d is the diffraction potential and φ r n is the radiation potential due to the heave motion of the nth structure the velocity potential for the incident waves which are incident along the positive direction of x can be written as 4 φ i i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x where g is the acceleration of gravity and k is the wave number which satisfies the dispersion relation ω 2 g k tanh k h for the diffraction problem the governing equation is laplace equation see eq 2 and the boundary conditions on the free surface z 0 and all rigid boundaries are 5 φ d z ω 2 g φ d 0 z 0 x x 1 l or x i r x x i 1 l or x x n r i 1 n 1 φ d z 0 z h φ d z φ i z z d i x i l x x i r

be written as φr i iωa r i ϕ r i x z the boundary conditions of the radiation potential φr i can be written as follows 6 ϕ r i z ω 2 g ϕ r i 0 z 0 x x 1 l or x i r x x i 1 l or x x n r i 1 n 1 ϕ r i z

and radiation potentials in each subdomain can be obtained as in the paper by zheng and zhang 2016 we solve the system of equations analytically by separation of variables and eigenfunction expansion by separation of variables into orthogonal eigenfunctions and by keeping the pressure and velocity continuity at the intersection lines between the neighboring sub domains shown in fig 2 the unknown coefficients of the diffraction and radiation potentials can be obtained 2 3 hydrodynamic quantities after the diffraction potential has been identified the vertical excitation force f z i on the ith structure can be computed as an integral over the mean wetted surface s i of the structure 7 f z i i ω ρ s i φ i φ d n z d s the vertical excitation force can be non dimensionalized by the hydrostatic stiffness as f z i ρga i d i the added mass μ i j and radiation damping λ i j on the ith structure in the heave motion subject to a unit forced motion of the jth structure can be obtained as the real and imaginary part of the radiation potential integrated over the mean wetted surface 8 μ i j ρ s i re ϕ r j n z d s 9 λ i j ρ ω s i im ϕ r j n z d s with the hydrodynamical forces obtained then the equation of motion can be written as 10 ω 2 m μ i ω λ λ p t o k a r f z where m is the mass matrix of the bodies k is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix of the bodies proportional to the waterplane area of each body μ and λ are the added mass and radiation damping matrices of the structures λ pto is the pto damping matrix imposed on the structures and a r and f z denote heave motion vector and heave excitation force vector respectively by writing the matrices in equation 10 explicitly the equations of motion take the form 11 ω 2 m 1 m n μ 1 1 μ 1 n μ n 1 μ n n i ω λ 1 1 λ 1 n λ n 1 λ n n λ pto 1 1 λ pto n n k 1 k n a r 1 a r n f z 1 f z n note that the diagonal nonzero elements λ pto i i of the pto damping matrix represent the pto damping imposed on the nth pontoon in the present study λ pto i i equals to the optimal pto damping for an isolated single device which can be expressed as falnes 2002 12 λ pto i i k i ω ω m i μ i 2 λ i 2 where k i ρga i m i ρa i d i μ i and λ i represent the stiffness mass added mass and damping coefficient of the nth structure in the isolated case respectively the added mass μ i and radiation damping λ i can be calculated by solving the radiation problem of an isolated body i in isolated case which can be realized by neglecting the size of the other bodies in the present analytical model since the implementation of the optimal pto damping in isolated case for a device array may produce excellent wave energy extraction performance bellew et al 2009 we use the optimal pto damping in isolated case to examine the performance of the multi body system the heave response amplitude operator hrao i of the ith pontoon is calculated as the ratio between the heave response and the wave amplitude hrao i a r i a the power p i captured by the ith structure can be calculated as 13 p i 1 2 ω 2 λ pto i i a r i 2 and the total power absorbed p total is the sum of the absorbed power of the individual pontoons which can be calculated as p t o t a l i 1 n p i the power of the incident wave p incident in one wave period is expressed as 14 p incident 1 2 ρ g a 2 ω 2 k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h for the present wave energy system the hydrodynamic efficiency η i of the ith structure is defined as the ratio of wave power p i captured by the ith pontoon to incident wave power p incident η i p i p incident likewise the efficiency of the full system is obtained as η total p total p incident the performance of a breakwater can be evaluated by the reflection coefficients k r defined as the ratio of the incident waves that are being reflected and the transmission coefficients k t defined as the ratio of the incident waves that are transmitted past the breakwater structure they can be written as 15 k r φ d 1 i ω j 1 n a r j ϕ j 1 r φ i x 16 k t φ i φ d 2 n 1 i ω j 1 n a r j ϕ j 2 n 1 r φ i x respectively where φ d 1 and φ d 2 n 1 denote the diffraction potential at the weather side and lee side of the multi body system ϕ j 2 n 1 r denotes the radiation potential at the lee side of the multi body system abs denote the absolute value of a complex number 3 results and discussions 3 1 verification the principle of energy conservation says that within the context of potential flow theory the incident waves must be reflected transmitted or converted by the wec in other words that k r 2 k t 2 η total 1 must be satisfied at all times fig 3 shows the results of k r 2 k t 2 η total for a system of 6 pontoons with geometrical parameters of pontoon widths a i 0 1h drafts d i 0 125h and separation distances d i 0 2h the nonzero elements of the pto damping matrix are the diagonal entries λ pto i i it can be seen that the identity of k r 2 k t 2 η total 1 is satisfied for all values of the non dimensional wave number kh which serves as a verification of the present analytical model 3 2 parametric study a parametric study is conducted to investigate the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic performance of an integrated system to various wave and geometrical parameters such as different widths drafts and number of pontoons 3 2 1 effect of the pontoon number in this section the effect of the number of the pontoons on the performance is investigated the widths and the drafts of each pontoon for different systems are kept the same the symbol a n represents the width of the pontoons for the system consisting of n pontoons the draft of all pontoons is 0 125h and the spacing distance is 0 2h to maintain a constant volume the relationship of a 1 2a 2 3a 3 4a 4 5a 5 6a 6 0 6h is obtained again the pto damping applied to each pontoon is the optimal pto damping of a pontoon in isolation fig 4 a c shows the reflection coefficients k r transmission coefficient k t and total cwr as functions of the wave number for cases with different number of pontoons it can be seen that generally the reflection coefficient increases with increasing kh and obvious oscillations can be found during the increasing trend the oscillations for the reflection coefficient is due to the bragg resonance garnaud and mei 2010 specially the reflection coefficient for the multi pontoon system at bragg resonance is larger than that of the single pontoon system for the 2 d multiple floating bodies bragg resonance is trigged by the condition of s l 2 n n 1 2 3 where s and l denote the distance between two adjacent bodies and the incident wave length respectively ouyang et al 2015 physically the strong interference is triggered when the reflected waves caused by different bodies arrive at the weather side of the multi pontoon system at the same phase mei et al 2018 with increasing numbers of floating pontoon the first peak value of k r corresponding to s l 2 1 increases this agrees with the conclusions found by ding et al 2019 symbolically we mark the locations of the main bragg resonance as k c here we take the six pontoon system as an example as shown in fig 4 a c there are several oscillations at the frequency region beneath k c which we mark as k n n 1 2 3 4 and 5 sorting from high frequency to low frequency the half wave length is then obtained as l n 2 π k n for this system in addition to the adjacent distance s there are four other distances between any two bodies the five s n l n 2 values are found in table 1 the conditions of the first bragg resonance is s 1 l 1 2 0 47 which doesn t agree with the condition of s 1 l 1 2 1 mentioned before this is due to the fact that the exact condition shall be satisfied under the premise that the size of the pontoon is very small compared to the distance of two adjacent bodies for the present case the size of the pontoon is comparable to the separation distance hence the bragg resonance frequency is shifted in order to further explore the relationship between the position of first bragg resonance and the adjacent distance s five different s are selected for the six pontoon system and the shift rule of s n l n 2 value is discussed the five s n l n 2 values are found in table 2 the occurring condition of the bragg resonance has a obvious shift towards left with the decrease of the adjacent distance s and as the distance between two adjacent pontoons increases s n l n 2 is closer to 1 this phenomenon shows that the wavelength corresponding to the first bragg reflection becomes larger in the case with smaller adjacent distance as can be seen in fig 4 b the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing wave number for the multi pontoon system the number of bodies affect the transmission coefficient in particular the transmission coefficient is less for the multi body system than for a single body system which agrees with the findings in ref zheng and zhang 2016 that is to say a satisfactory breakwater performance with k t 0 5 is found over a larger frequency range for the multi pontoon system as compared to the single pontoon system for the single pontoon system a parabolic trend of the cwr with a single peak value of 50 can be found at the resonance frequency in fig 4 c whereas for the multi pontoon system two spikes and a valley value of the total cwr can be found the location of the valley corresponds to the bragg resonance peak of the reflection coefficient in fig 4 a which is in agreement with similar phenomenon identified in ref garnaud and mei 2009 2010 the location of the spikes and the valley value shift to the higher frequency region with the increasing number of pontoons interestingly the peak value increases and the valley value decreases with increasing pontoon number the maximum cwr of the six pontoon system is 81 3 which is larger than that of the single pontoon system besides at the high frequency region i e 5 kh 8 the efficiency of the multi pontoon system is clearly superior to the single pontoon system from fig 4 b c it can be found that the effective frequency bandwidth for increasing number of pontoons n 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 is 2 40 4 05 4 50 4 75 4 75 and 4 80 note that with increasing number of pontoons the effective frequency bandwidth increases and approaches an asymptotic value this is due to the fact that increasing number of pontoons will shift the bragg resonance which corresponds to a valley value of the cwr the decreasing valley value of the cwr results in narrower effective frequency bandwidth such as the cases for the five pontoon system and the six pontoon system as discussed above the effective frequency range is defined to satisfy k t 0 5 and η total 20 in addition one can examine the frequency range of the multi pontoon system that satisfies a cwr of η total 50 which is the maximum of the single pontoon system the frequency bandwidth satisfying this condition is 2 10 3 25 3 80 4 10 and 4 20 for increasing number of pontoons n 2 6 i e increasing the number of pontoons widens the frequency range over which the energy extraction is more than the maximum of the single pontoon system to further explore the wave energy extraction efficiency of the multi pontoon system we analyze the wave excitation force the cwr and the response amplitude operator hrao of each buoy as shown in fig 5 a c the behavior of the cwr and the heave response amplitude operator against the wave number kh are similar a valley value can be found at the fundamental bragg reflection frequency k c after which a spike can be found for both this second peak coincides with the peak of the single pontoon system due to the shadow effect the cwr of each buoy decreases with its location away from the front side of the structure the sharp valley values of the cwr and h rao at the fundamental frequency k c can be understood from the corresponding valley point of the wave excitation force seen in fig 5 c for frequencies k k c the excitation force of the front buoy gradually approaches the asymptotic curve of an isolated buoy whereas the wave forces on the rest of the buoys decreases to zero this is because that most of the wave energy is captured by the front pontoon while the wave passes through it and the wave energy transmitted to the latter pontoons is very small hence the existence of the rear pontoons has little effect on the wave force of the first pontoon correspondingly for high frequency waves k k c the cwr and hrao of the front buoy approaches the values of an isolated buoy whereas they reduce to zero for the remaining buoys for the frequency region below k c the wave excitation forces oscillate strongly with most values above those of an isolated buoy 3 2 2 effect of the different widths of pontoons in this section the effect of different widths of pontoons a n is investigated in order to keep the construction costs of the system constant the premise for the present investigation is that the total volume of the pontoons is kept constant garnaud and mei 2009 the three scenarios shown in table 3 are considered in this subsection the draft of each pontoon d n 0 125h and the distance between two pontoons d n 0 2h is kept constant the pto damping applied to each pontoon of the system is the optimal pto damping of the pontoon in isolation fig 6 a c shows the variation of the reflection coefficients k r transmission coefficient k t and total cwr corresponding to the three scenarios it can be seen that the reflection coefficient increases with the increase of kh there are several obvious oscillations during the increasing trend and oscillation positions of the three scenarios are relatively close to each other especially the reflection coefficient of scenario 3 with decreasing pontoon widths is larger than that of the other two scenarios in the frequency range of kh 5 interestingly an obvious drop in reflection coefficient was observed for the scenario 1 and 2 in fig 6 a however there was a slight drop observed for scenario 3 this is due to the fact that physically the greater width of the buoys in the front side for scenario 3 comparing to that for scenario 1 and 2 lead to the strong reflection in shorter waves hence the wave energy extraction efficiency is very small for scenario 3 in the higher frequency region comparatively the wave energy extraction efficiency for scenarios 1 and 2 is relatively higher than that for scenario 3 as a result a peak value in the higher frequency region for scenario 1 and 2 can be found while it is absent for scenario 3 based on the wave energy flux conservation rule the presence of the peak value of efficiency often accompanies the valley value in reflection coefficient the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing wave number for the six pontoon system the transmission coefficients of the scenarios 1 and 2 with equal or increasing pontoon widths are similar to each other and smaller than that of the scenario 3 in the whole calculated frequency range in other words the breakwater performance is better in the first two scenarios with increasing wave number the total cwr increases first and then decreases and there are two spikes and a valley the frequency ranges at which both the breakwater and the wave power extraction have a satisfying performance defined by the conditions k t 0 5 and η total 20 is denoted the effective frequency range from fig 6 b c it can be seen that the effective frequency bandwidths corresponding to scenario 1 2 and 3 are 4 85 4 85 and 2 30 in other words the configuration with equal pontoon widths and with smaller front pontoon and a bigger rear pontoon have wider effective bandwidth than the system with decreasing pontoon widths in addition the wave energy capture efficiency of the first two scenarios is obviously superior in the high frequency region i e 5 kh 8 3 2 3 effect of the different drafts of pontoons the effect of the different drafts d n of pontoons is investigated in this section similar to the previous section there are three scenarios see table 4 considered here the width of each pontoon a n 0 100h and the distance between two pontoons d n 0 2h are constant and the pto damping applied to each pontoon of the system is the optimal pto damping of the pontoon in isolation the influence of the different drafts of the pontoons on the reflection coefficient k r transmission coefficient k t and total cwr η total is shown in fig 7 a c it can be seen that the reflection coefficient increases with increasing wave number multiple obvious oscillations can be found during the increasing trend and the location of the oscillation spikes move to the high frequency region in the scenario with increasing drafts interestingly when the pontoons have equal drafts corresponding to scenario 1 the maximum value of the spike in the reflection coefficient is larger than in the other two scenarios the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing wave number and is almost the same for the three scenarios as kh 3 i e the transmission coefficient is less affected by the draft configuration of the pontoons under long waves in terms of the total cwr similar to fig 6 c two spikes and a valley value can be found and the location of the valley value is corresponding to the location of the spike of the k r it can be seen that the valley and the spikes are located at higher frequencies in scenario 2 of increasing drafts as compared to the other two scenarios from fig 7 b c it can be seen that the effective frequency bandwidth for scenarios 1 2 and 3 are 4 85 9 60 and 2 80 respectively overall the system with a small draft front pontoon and large draft rear pontoon performs better in terms of the effective frequency bandwidth and also has a higher wave energy capture efficiency in the high frequency region 3 3 hydrodynamic characteristics in irregular waves in this subsection the hydrodynamic performance of the multi pontoon system in irregular waves is investigated using the modified jonswap spectrum goda 1999 defined by the spectral density function s ω 17 s ω 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 18 σ 0 07 0 09 ω ω p ω ω p where ω p denotes the peak angular frequency h s represents the significant wave height γ 3 3 is the peak enhancement factor and σ is the peak shape coefficient the spectrum can be discretized into small frequency steps for which the wave amplitude a j of the jth wave component is given by 19 a j 2 s ω j δ ω j where ω j denotes the angular frequency of jth wave component using the analysis for the regular waves in the proceeding sections the power of the incident irregular waves can be obtained as a sum over all wave components 20 p irregular j 1 m 1 2 ρ g a j 2 ω j 2 k j 1 2 k j h sinh 2 k j h j 1 m ρ g s ω j δ ω j ω j 2 k j 1 2 k j h sinh 2 k j h where k j is the wave number of the jth wave component the power p j captured by the ith pontoon can be calculated as 21 p i irregular j 1 m ω j 2 λ pto ω m i i a r i j 2 s ω j ω j where a r i j is the heave response amplitude of the ith pontoon corresponding to the jth wave component and λ pto ω m i i is the optimal pto damping of the ith pontoon corresponding to the peak frequency ω m the total absorbed power is then obtained as the sum of the power of the individual pontoons the cwr η i irregular of the ith structure can be calculated as 22 η i irregular p i irregular p irregular and the total cwr η total irregular is obtained similarly as 23 η total irregular p total irregular p irregular the reflection coefficients k r irregular and transmission coefficients k t irregular in the irregular waves can be obtained from the coefficients of the different wave components as 24 k r irregular j 1 m k r j 2 s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j j 1 m s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j 25 k t irregular j 1 m k t j 2 s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j j 1 m s ω ˆ ω ˆ j δ ω j where k r j and k t j represent the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient corresponding to the representative wave number of the jth component wave fig 8 a c shows the results of the reflection coefficients k r irregular the transmission coefficient k t irregular and the cwr η total irregular in irregular waves for the single and multi pontoon systems the significant oscillations seen for all coefficients in regular waves are not visible in irregular waves and the effect of the bragg resonance becomes milder in irregular waves the reflection coefficient is slightly reduced with the increasing number of pontoons and the total cwr is improved significantly for the multi pontoon system similar to that in the regular waves the improvement becomes smaller with increasing number of pontoons from fig 8 c it can be seen that under the action of irregular waves the capture width ratio of the six pontoon system can be up to 63 8 which is an obvious improvement of the maximal cwr of 40 1 for the single pontoon system the effective frequency bandwidth where k t 0 5 and η total irregular 20 is satisfied for number of pontoons n 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 is 2 60 4 20 4 70 5 00 5 20 and 5 30 in fig 9 a c the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the total cwr of the six pontoon system are compared for regular waves and irregular waves due to the weighted average of the spectral density function see eq 26 30 31 the bragg resonance becomes milder in irregular waves the significant oscillations in the reflection coefficient and cwr are not seen in irregular waves only one peak value for the cwr is observed in irregular waves the effective frequency bandwidth and maximum total cwr for different cases in regular waves and irregular waves are shown in table 5 the maximum cwr in irregular waves is less than that in regular waves due to the absence of the valley value that appearance in regular waves the effective frequency bandwidth is a continuous and wider interval in irregular waves 4 discussion in this paper we investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a multi pontoon breakwater wec system the results show that the wave power extraction performance is improved as the number of bodies increases and under the condition that the total volume of the multiple bodies is fixed increasing the number of bodies improves the effective frequency bandwidth of the floating breakwater wec system as for this multi body system the classical phenomenon of bragg resonance is important to the performance of the system the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system is mitigated significantly while the bragg resonance i e strong reflection phenomenon is trigged in realistic irregular waves however the influence of the bragg resonance is suppressed the analysis in this paper is based on linear potential flow theory which neglects fluid viscosity for the present multi body system the narrow gaps between the structures may cause energy loss due the viscosity ning et al 2015 gao et al 2019 zhao et al 2017b lu et al 2011 li 2020 especially for the condition of gap resonance comparing with the potential flow environment the fluid viscosity lead to the suppression of the wave elevation in the gap between to close bodies thus the analysis based on linear potential flow in this paper theory may overestimate the efficiency and the body motion of the wec system lu et al 2011 but the fluid viscosity may not modify the frequencies corresponding to the peak value of efficiency it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the fluid viscosity and gap resonance on the hydrodynamic performance of the multi pontoon system it is worthy to note that more pto dampers have to be implemented for a system with more bodies also the required spacing and width lead to the larger sea area to be occupied the required pto dampers and the occupied sea area influence the cost of the wave energy system to some extent the two aspects of cost and efficiency have to be balanced while designing such a system 5 conclusions using an analytical method in this study the performance of a breakwater wave energy systems has been investigated the system consists of a floating breakwater integrated with single or multi pontoon structures with independent power take off systems the total volume of the structure which can be taken as a crude estimation of the capital costs is kept constant in all systems the capture width ratio reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient have been analyzed and the conclusions are as follows 1 the wave attenuation performance wave energy extraction efficiency and the effective frequency bandwidth of the multi pontoon system is superior to that of a single pontoon system as the number of pontoons becomes large the performance indicators converge to an asymptotic value and increasing the number of pontoons further will not improve the total performance 2 constructive hydrodynamic interference which leads to enhanced wave energy extraction efficiency can be found at the low wave frequencies with the exception of the bragg reflection frequency 3 the geometrical properties of the individual pontoons affect the total performance of system in regular waves the efficiency of the multi pontoon system can be improved by adjusting the draft and the natural frequency range of each buoy 4 bragg resonance can reduce the efficiency of the multi pontoon system due to the weighted average of the spectral density function this negative

21137,numerical simulations of stiffened panels under in plane compressive load are conducted to investigate the influence of experimental conditions on the structural strength and collapse characteristics the initial geometrical imperfections of the stiffened panels have been measured before the test and are adopted in the numerical analysis the material properties of the steel in the finite element analysis are determined by tension tests using the finite element method various configurations including the actual experimental boundary conditions and assumed ideal conditions are considered in the numerical simulations to identify the influence of laboratory conditions the ultimate strength structural modulus and collapse behaviour of the stiffened panels in the tests and numerical simulations are compared the results of the analysis suggest that the translational and rotational degrees of freedom at the end edges of the specimen should be constrained to force the

the collapse strength of deck and bottom stiffened panels under longitudinal in plane compression little 1976 1980 proposed a theoretical approach for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel subjected to uniaxial load using elastic buckling strength theory moolani and dowling 1977 and frieze et al 1977 have developed an equation for designing plate elements subjected to compressive loads considering initial defects fujikubo et al 2005 developed several expressions to assess the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels under longitudinal and lateral loads karvinen and pegg 2006 also proposed a simplified method of stiffened panels collapse using nonlinear failure analysis a theoretical formulation was also developed for the assessment of the collapse strength of a plate with attached stiffener with various arrangements under in plane loading by brubak et al 2007 the nonlinear finite element method is also recommended in the iacs csr requirements 2014 to assess the collapse strength of stiffened panels and ship hull girders ghavami and khedmati 2006 conducted a series finite element fe analyses for the assessment of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with one span or two spans which were compared with experimental programs tanaka and endo 1988 ghavami 1994 paik 2007 adopted experimental results to valid the numerical modelling that simulate the collapse strength of ship structures subjected to in plane longitudinal load considering various configurations of geometrical dimensions and material gordo and guedes soares 2008 2011 and 2012 performed a series in plane collapse tests and numerical simulations of stiffened panels subjected to longitudinal in plane loads xu and guedes soares 2012a three full spans or 1 2 1 1 2 spans model can account for the interaction of the neighbouring members to reduce the eccentricity of the load and the influence of boundary condition at the end edges of stiffened panel in the experiments mathewson and vinner 1962 horne and narayanan 1976 faulkner 1977 and then could provide more reliable results xu and guedes soares 2011 2012b the fe model with 1 2 1 1 2 spans were also adopted by song et al 2019 to conduct dimensional and similarity analyses for stiffened panels with various buckling modes for calibrating the conclusions in these numerical analyses several tests xu and guedes soares 2012c 2013a and corresponding nonlinear finite element method simulations xu and guedes soares 2012d 2013b have been conducted for the stiffened panels with 1 2 1 1 2 spans tanaka et al 2015 proposed an analysis method of the ultimate hull girder strength under combined bending and torsion which was verified by comparing with the results of experiments and fem analysis garbatov et al 2015 performed a hull girder ultimate strength verification according to the class society rules based on experimental results for three box girders and the dimensional theory kim et al 2018 reviewed existing empirical formulations that predict the ultimate limit state uls of a stiffened panel under longitudinal compression the results assessed by various formulations and fe analysis are compared to understand the ultimate compressive strength behaviour of the stiffened panels the test program is a good method to verify the accuracy of the results of theoretical methods but the models geometry and boundary configurations should be set up appropriately for the experimental program to obtain reliable results including the ultimate strength the collapse mode and the structural modulus the numerical simulation can give more details about the collapse and failure mechanism of the structure which may identify the problems that lead to experimental uncertainty which may occur during the test procedure the stiffened panels with 1 2 1 1 2 spans have been used in the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2012c 2013b from which it was found that the outer half span provide larger rotational stiffness than the actual situation and thus would overestimate the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels hence three full spans models were adopted in the experiment of xu and guedes soares 2020 but another problem has occurred during those tests the outer spans of the specimen collapsed first which may not give reasonable collapse modes of the stiffened panels and this phenomenon did not occur in the earlier tests with 1 2 1 1 2 spans xu and guedes soares 2013b therefore numerical simulations are conducted here for the stiffened panels with three full spans from the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2020 considering various boundary conditions including the actual experimental configurations and assuming ideal conditions this paper aims to determine if it would be possible to design a more reliable test program that would be less sensitive to the experimental uncertainties of the laboratory conditions associated with boundary conditions and loading 2 description of the geometrical models and supporting system in the test considering the costs and the laboratory conditions it would be difficult to carry out experiments of ship hull girders with realistic dimensions however according to the similarity analyses of stiffened panels considering various collapse modes it is possible to establish the relationship between the full and small scale models song et al 2019 the test results with small scale models could be used to validate the numerical models the dimensions of the models considered here are the same as the members adopted in the tests of box girders by gordo and guedes soares 2004 2009 2014 2015 which are based on typical members from an actual type of ship s hull structure gordo and guedes soares 1993 master curves with the average stress strain relation will be used to further investigate the ultimate strength of the hull girder the 1 2 1 1 2 spans model including two half spans and one full span is shown in fig 1 a which has been used in the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2012c 2013b it was found that the outer half span provide larger rotational stiffness than the actual situation and thus would overestimate the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels hence three full spans models are adopted in the present paper as shown in fig 1 b c the geometrical dimensions are given in table 1 where l and s are the length and width of the plate and b is transverse length of the whole panel the stiffeners are 30 8 mm flat steel bars and the frames are l shaped steel with 60 40 6 mm and the plate thickness is 4 mm plates with two and 4 bar stiffeners are used to account for the influence of the effective width plate slenderness and column slenderness are the main governing variables for the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panel which are given as follows 1 plate slenderness β s t σ y d e 2 column slenderness λ l e π r σ y d e 3 radius of gyration r i a the effective width of the plate is expressed as follows faulkner 1975 4 φ p 2 β 1 β 2 where the plate effective width directly depends on the dimensions and material characteristics of the structural element in eq 2 l e is the buckling length of the stiffeners and it is determined by the boundary conditions on both ends of stiffened panel while l is the spacing between transverse frames when the stiffener is simply supported or fixed on both ends l e is equal to l or 0 6 l iacs 2014 respectively since the former one is closer to the reality l e is taken as l here the meaning of the test speicmens designation are as follows fb2a flat bar fb2a length of stiffener 2 200 mm 3 300 mm 4 400 mm fb2a a two stiffeners b four stiffeners fig 2 shows the experimental set up of the stiffened panels under longitudinal compressive load which is generated by a hydraulic press with 300 ton loading capacity xu and guedes soares 2020 the stiffened panels are placed on a steel v groove to constrain the longitudinal and lateral movement of the specimens see fig 2 d which means the specimens were constrained in the positive x direction only not the negative x direction this setting of the boundary condition allows the stiffener to rotate around the end edges of plate the longitudinal compressive load was provided by a hydraulic press with 300 t which is a device using a hydraulic cylinder to generate the compressive force the displacement time histories were simultaneously recorded during loading two steel bars are used to support the transverse frames which are allowed to move in the longitudinal direction but have no out plane displacement as in fig 2 c the longitudinal edges b1b4 and a1a4 in fig 1 of the stiffened panels are not constrained and are totally free to move out of plane and to rotate a displacement transducer is installed on t1 to record the lateral displacement in the middle of the plate more detail about the set up and the procedure of the experiment are provided in xu and guedes soares 2020 3 numerical simulation 3 1 fe model and mesh the numerical simulation is conducted in fe code package ansys fig 3 shows the mesh and support setup of the tested stiffened panel the element sizes on plate are 8 mm and 10 mm in longitudinal and transverse directions and the number of elements on the height of the stiffener s web is four for considering the material strain hardening properties a piecewise linear stress strain curve with multi linear isotropic hardening miso is adopted to model the relationship of true stress and true strain in fig 4 a the setup of the tension test is shown in fig 4 b and the average length and width of the test specimens are 208 10 mm and 105 78 mm respectively the shell element 181 with eight nodes in the fe program ansys are used for both stiffeners and plates the yield stress young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 483 mp 200000 mpa and 0 3 respectively 3 2 configuration of boundary conditions in the fe analysis appropriately prescribing the configuration of the boundary condition in the numerical and experimental analyses is important due to its significant effect on the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels xu and guedes soares 2012a depending on the simplifications made in the numerical studies different levels of accuracy can be achieved hence four configurations in the numerical simulations are considered to investigate the influence of boundary conditions on the collapse behaviour of the stiffened panels including the experimental setup and the assumed ideal conditions fig 1 gives the geometry and loading of the stiffened panels in the fe analysis the detailed descriptions about the boundary conditions in the fe analysis are given below 3 2 1 bc1 restrained boundary condition on the transverse edges the two end edges on the stiffened panel were restrained in the longitudinal direction by the steel beds in the test see fig 2 the longitudinal displacement u x and the transverse displacement u z are constrained on the top edges of the plate a1b1 and of the stiffeners e1f1 at c1 c2 c3 c4 see fig 1 the longitudinal displacement c dx is imposed on the top edge of the plate a4b4 and the stiffeners e4f4 at d1 d2 d3 d4 the configurations of the boundary conditions are given by top edges of the plate a1b1 and of the stiffeners e1f1 at c1 c2 c3 c4 u x 0 u z 0 θ x θ y 0 top edges of the plate a4b4 and of the stiffeners e4f4 at d1 d2 d3 d4 u x c dx u z 0 θ x θ y 0 a2 b2 a3 and b3 on the top point of the frames f2 and f3 u z 0 3 2 2 bc2 using rigid surface to simulate the steel block of hydraulic machine in the tests the constraints on the end loading edges of the stiffened panels actually are not clamped boundary condition in the test hence the contact element pairs shown in fig 3 b are used to simulate the interrelationship between the steel block of the hydraulic machine and the loaded edges which were placed in v grooves shown in fig 2 d so there was no movement on the end edges in the lateral direction in the test similarly the relationship between end edge of the specimen and the steel block is set as rough contact in the fe analysis so there is no sliding but it allows contact element pairs to separate each other the contact surface is assumed as rigid to save calculation time since the stiffness of steel block is much larger than that of the stiffened panels the rigid surface at a4b4 in fig 1 is applied the longitudinal displacement c dx and then the stiffened panel s edge is forced to move with the contact element pair the lateral displacements u z of the frames top edges f2 and f3 at a2 b2 a3 and b3 in fig 1 are constrained the configuration of the boundary conditions is given by end edges of the plate a1b1 a4b4 and of the stiffeners e1f1 e4f4 contact with the rigid surfaces control node of the rigid surface contacted with a1b1 edge is constrained with displacement and rotation dofs degree of freedom control node of the rigid contact surface contacted with a4b4 edge u x c dx the other dofs are constrained f2 and f3 at a2 b2 a3 and b3 on the frames u z 0 3 2 3 bc3 using rigid surface to simulate the steel block of the hydraulic machine and the support on the frames in the tests the bc3 configuration is similar to the bc2 but some critical differences should be noticed as for common features the end loading edges of the stiffened panels are simulated by rigid contact surfaces furthermore the stiffened panel s edge is also compelled to move longitudinally by the contact element pair to reproduce the loading process on the other hand it is different that there are eight rigid surfaces to simulate the u shaped bars in fig 3 c and d the gap distance fig 2 c between the rigid surfaces and frames is set as the value measured in the tests the node surface contact elements between the nodes on the frames and the rigid surfaces imitate the interaction within those contact element pairs because the lateral stiffness of the steel bars is much larger than that of the stiffened panel the latter one is not considered in the fe model the configuration of the boundary conditions is given by end edges of the plate a1b1 a4b4 and of the stiffeners e1f1 e4f4 contact with the rigid surface control node of the rigid contact surface contacted with a1b1 edge is constrained with displacement and rotation dofs control node of the rigid contact surface contacted with a4b4 edge u x c dx the other dofs are constrained f2 and f3 at a2 b2 a3 and b3 on the frames contact with eight rigid surfaces respectively whose control nodes are constrained in all degree of freedom 3 2 4 bc4 periodic boundary condition in the longitudinal direction the basic advantage of this type of boundary condition is the possibility to consider either symmetric or anti symmetric buckling mode of a rectangular plate either symmetric or anti symmetric deflection mode of stiffeners in adjacent span and the interaction between adjacent spans of bays xu et al 2013c the periodic boundary conditions is not intended to give the prediction of the collapse behaviour of the test results under specific boundary conditions which is recognized as a standardized model for a continuous stiffened panel under the assumption of periodic nature of structural configuration and boundary condition the configuration of periodic boundary condition is given by a2b2 a3b3 u z 0 θ x 0 a1b1 u x 0 θ z 0 coupling for the other five dofs a4b4 u x c dx θ z 0 coupling for the other dofs e2f2 e3f3 u y uniform movement θ x 0 e1f1 on the stiffeners at c1 c2 for the narrow panels and c1 c4 for the wide panels including flange u x u x c dx coupling for the other five dofs between two end edges e4f4 on the stiffeners at d1 d2 for the narrow panels and at d1 d4 for the wide panels including flange coupling for six dofs between two end edges c dx is the imposed uniform movement 3 3 geometrical deflection the geometrical deflection of the specimens caused by the fabrication procedure which has been measured by a displacement transducer before the test xu and guedes soares 2020 is shown in fig 5 the displacements are applied on the nodes of the fe model by using the ansys program design language apdl 4 collapse strength assessment by simplified method the load carrying capacity and collapse behaviour of the stiffened panels are affected significantly by several main parameters including plate slenderness column slenderness type of stiffeners and external loads the overall collapse of the grillage and the yielding of the entire panel were not observed due to the support of the transverse frames in the experiment which is generally prevented at the design stage by using a strong frame the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels considering three collapse modes are assessed by the formulae in the iacs csr requirements iacs 2014 which are the formulations proposed by gordo and guedes soares 1993 and are given by buckling of local plate 5 σ a c

various buckling modes are assessed for every given shortening in eqns 5 6 and 9 in which the minimum value is defined as the average stress of stiffened panels the calculation program has been developed by matlab based on experimental results paik and thayamballi 1997 adopted the least square method to develop an empirical formulation to assess the ultimate strength of steel stiffened panel subjected to in plane compression which is given as follows 10 σ u σ yseq 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 1 λ 2 where z 0 is the distance between outer surface of the plate and the neutral axis of the stiffener and σ y s e q is the equivalent yield stress of stiffened panel they are given by 11 z 0 0 5 s t p 2 h w t w t p 0 5 h w b f t f t p h w 0 5 t f s t p h w t w b f t f 12

derived a simplified expression for assessing the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel subjected longitudinal compression which is expressed by 13 σ u σ yseq 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 f o r λ 2 and take β 1 0 if β 1 0 based on a numerical database for various stiffener types xu et al 2013 also adopted the least square method to develop a regression formulae for predicting the ultimate strength of steel stiffened panels in which the coefficients are different considering the influence of the type of stiffener to improve the accuracy of the prediction results more coefficients and higher order are used in the approximate expression the assessment formula for stiffened panel with flat bar is given as follows 14 σ u σ yseq 1 1 11 4 91 λ 0 49 β 0 77 λ β 10 07 λ 2 0 11 β 2 0 14 λ 2 β 2 7 09 λ 3 0

λ 0 260 β 0 250 λ 2 0 078 λ β 0 0295 β 2 5 analysis of the results 5 1 comparison of ultimate strength the experimental support setup significantly influences the failure mode and the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels the numerical results with various boundary conditions are discussed by comparing with experimental results in the bc1 configuration the displacement of the stiffened panel s edges are constrained in three directions the lateral edges of the stiffened panels are fitted on a v groove in the tests hence the connections between the steel blocks of the hydraulic machine and the loading edge of the stiffened panels are modelled by contact elements for bc2 and bc3 to consider the uncertainty caused by the lateral support system in the tests as shown in fig 2 two rigid surfaces are adopted for the bc3 configuration to consider the measured gaps distance between the frames and u shaped bar for comparison the periodical boundary condition is also adopted on the edges a1b1 a4b4 e1f1 and e4f4 in the longitudinal direction in bc4 which is recognized as a standard model for continuous stiffened panels the influence of various boundary conditions on the collapse behaviours of the stiffened panels are investigated by comparing with the results in the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2020 and assessed by design equations in iacs csr requirement iacs 2014 the load cases are given as follows 1 case 1 experimental results in xu and guedes soares 2020 2 case 2 calculations according to the design equations implemented in the iacs csr requirements iacs 2014 3 case 3 fe bc1 fe analysis with bc1 configuration restrained boundary condition 4 case 4 fe bc2 fe analysis with bc2 configuration using rigid contact surface to simulate the steel block of the hydraulic machine of the tests 5 case 5 fe bc3 fe analysis with bc3 configuration using rigid contact surface to simulate the steel block of the hydraulic machine and the support on the frames of the tests the measurement gap distance between the u shape and steel bar on the frames is included in the fe model 6 case 6 fe bc4 fe analysis with periodical boundary condition bc4 fig 5 plots the strength and end shortening relationships of the test specimen fb2a during the initial stage of the loading process the reaction load is still very small during the large imposed displacement in the test which derives from the rearrangement of the boundary until the specimen has been fully supported by the hydraulic machine which is not included in the following analysis the average stress is defined as the ratio of the reaction force to the whole sectional area of stiffened panel the shortening is defined as the longitudinal displacement of end edge divided by length of stiffened panel a residual stress relief technique is applied in the test by applying a small amplitude cyclic loading shown in fig 5 where the residual plastic strain is very small besides the present study aims to find out a reasonable configuration of the boundary conditions that can both reproduce the operating conditions of the panel in ship structures and be realized test in laboratory although the welding residual stresses are not account for in the numerical simulations figs 6 8 shows the average stress average strain curves in the experiment the iacs requirement iacs 2014 and the numerical simulations with various configurations of boundary conditions the stiffened panels represent a cut out from ship hull structures whose longitudinal edges are expected to be restrained symmetrically this kind of boundary condition is difficult to be realized in laboratory hence wide panels are also used in the tests to reduce the effect of the lack of effectiveness of the edge conditions fig 8 shows the average strength and end shortening relationships of the wide specimens with four stiffeners the average initial structural moduli are all close to 200 gpa for both stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners in the fe analysis with bc1 and bc4 configurations and are respectively 92 gpa and 102 gpa in the tests this phenomenon is the reason why the stiffened panels with four stiffeners are similar with those having two stiffeners for the same conditions the average stress of wide panels is generally larger than that of the narrow ones since the unsupported lateral edges of the specimen having large percentage of cross section area is less effective which is less influenced by the effectiveness at the lateral plate edges hence larger geometric dimensions of the test model are recommended for the experiment fig 9 and table 2 show the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels in the tests the iacs csr requirement and the numerical simulations with different configurations of boundary conditions those strength values are denoted as σ u test σ u csr σ u bc1 σ u bc2 σ u bc3 and σ u bc4 for case 1 to case 6 in order the initial structural modulus is defined as the slope of the average stress strain curve of the stiffened panels in the beginning from table 2 the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels assessed by the iacs csr requirement are larger than that in the experiment and numerical simulations the average initial structural modulus and the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels in the tests are close to that of the bc2 and bc3 configurations but are smaller than the values predicted by the iacs csr requirement and the fe analyses with bc1 and bc4 configurations the initial stiffness and ultimate strength in the fe analyses with bc1 and bc4 configurations are similar to that in the iacs csr requirement this shows that the collapse strength of the stiffened panels is sensitive to the boundary conditions the explanation for their differences is given in the following sections 5 2 investigation of the influence of the boundary conditions it was found that the periodical boundary condition is an appropriate boundary condition to approximate the bending process of stiffened panels and to consider the influence of adjacent members xu et al 2013c however this kind of boundary condition is difficult to realize in the experiments in the design of the test setup the stiffened panels with three full spans used in the test are intended to account for the influence of the outer spans on the central span in the early stage of loading it can be seen that the numerical results with bc1 restrained boundary condition and bc4 periodical boundary condition are similar hence bc1 configuration with restrained boundary condition at the end edges is adopted in the simulation as well since it is possible to be realized in the test program the setup of the boundary condition in the test is originally to simulate bc1 however the ultimate strength initial structural modulus and deformation are very different between the numerical simulation with bc1 and the tests it can be observed that the stiffener rotated around the plate in the test as shown in fig 10 the rotation of the stiffener around end edges of the plate was not expected before test however in the fe analysis with bc1 configuration the displacement dofs at the loaded edges of the plate and the stiffeners are constrained during the whole loading process and there is no rotation at the end of stiffener between specimen and the loading support members in fig 11 the bc1 with restrained boundary conditions assumes no gap in the contact between specimen and the loading support members which gives higher rotation stiffness and strength than that in the real test cases the bc1 configuration is a kind of perfect model with less uncertainty in the boundary condition except for geometrical imperfections it seems that the support system in the fe analysis with bc1 restrained boundary is different from the setup of boundary condition in the tests from the comparison of displacements between them it is necessary to investigate if the absence of the rotation degree of freedom at the end of stiffener would cause the underestimation of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels it is very clear that when simulating some experimental program of testing models the same conditions should be established in the numerical models hence bc2 configuration using rigid contact surface is used to simulate the connection between the end edges of the stiffened panels and steel block of the hydraulic machine which actually happened in the tests meaning that the specimens were constrained in the positive x direction only not the negative x direction the edges of the plate and stiffeners move together with the rigid surface in the beginning and then the top of the stiffener separates from the rigid surface at f1 and f4 as the load increases which allows the outer spans to rotate around the end edges of the plate and then the gap is observed in fig 12 this deformation is similar to that in the tests the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with bc2 is significantly smaller than that with bc1 for slender stiffened panels which is still larger than that in the test it can be seen that the specimens with three full spans deform as three waves for bc2 in fig 12 and the out plane deformations and the rotation at the load edge also appear in the tests as shown in fig 10 the contact elements pairs in bc2 provide the loading edges with support forces which do not exist in bc1 the differences between the results of the tests and the fe analysis with bc1 and bc2 configurations are because of the rotations at the loading edges which result in the reduction of the average stress and smaller increase in the average overall strain and the initial structural modulus fig 13 shows the lateral displacement curves of the plate on t1 in fig 2 which indicates the lateral movement directions in the central spans of the test specimens take the panel fb3a as an example the residual lateral displacement on t1 is 1 3 mm after the load was totally discharged in the first cycle which should be the gap distance between the frame and the u bar in fig 2 since the material on the plate and stiffeners were both still elastic at this moment there exists installation gaps between the u guide bar and the support steel bar for supporting the frame in the tests due to the fabrication errors see fig 2 c which are difficult to be completely eliminated and can be considered as the experimental uncertainty hence the connections between u guide and steel supporting bar are simulated by two rigid surfaces fig 3 d for bc3 which is also adopted to investigate the influence of the supporting of frame on the collapse deformation the outer span buckles first instead of the central span in the simulation with bc3 fig 14 which is similar to that in the test fig 10 the ultimate strength between the tests and numerical simulations with bc3 are very close fig 9 as the gap exists the lateral constraint for the frames that cause the out plane deformation in fig 10 b cannot be provided at the earlier stage of loading the only difference between the bc2 and bc3 configurations is the lateral support method on the frame the pressure distribution on the loading edge of the stiffened panel and the contact surface the ultimate strength and the initial structural modulus of the stiffened panel in the fe analysis with bc3 are more similar to that in the test than the bc1 configuration the ultimate strength in the fe analysis with bc3 configuration and in the tests are slightly smaller than that with bc2 because of the lateral support on the frames also greatly influences the collapse behaviour and strength of the stiffened panel which determines the buckling length of stiffeners l e that should be equal to l frame spacing in eq 2 for the test however if there is no lateral support on the frame l e should then be equal to 3l namely the column slenderness of the stiffened panels are different for various support conditions on the frame moreover this difference between the tests and the fe analysis with bc1 for stocky specimens are larger than that for slender ones because the gaps between the guide bar and stiffened panels could increase the out plane deformations and then would reduce the load carrying capacity the out plane displacement for the stocky stiffened panels is smaller than that for the slender ones and then the influence of boundary conditions is smaller the out of plane deformations caused by fabrication errors reduce the load carrying capability of the stiffened panels the average value of the ratio of ultimate strength for bc2 to bc3 is 6 5 but this difference between bc1 and bc2 is 12 this means that the condition of rotations degree at the loading edges of stiffener is also an important influential factor especially for slender specimens the ultimate strength and collapse shape of the stiffened panels in the fe analysis with bc3 are close to that in the tests when the effect of the gap between the frame and the u shaped bar and the rotations at the loading edges are both considered the influence of boundary conditions on the collapse mode and ultimate strength is significant in the actual situation the adjacent member could provide the rotation constraint for the stiffener however in the test the absence of rotation at the end of stiffener would cause larger lateral deformation of the outer span and the outer span collapse before the central one which was not expected before the test this reason might cause that the boundary condition in the tests underestimate the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panel this means that the constraint of rotation degree at the end edge significantly influences the collapse behaviour hence the tests in the laboratory should be improved to better simulate the working situation of ship structures it is suggested that the rotation degree should be constrained in the tests by welding or using a bolt connection to ensure the central span collapse first instead outer span moreover because the rotational resistance of the frame for the central span is much larger than the supporting force for the outer span five of six stiffened panels collapse in the outer spans in the tests as shown in fig 10 instead of the central span the difference of the results in the fe analysis with bc1 and bc4 configurations and the iacs csr requirement are smaller than that of numerical simulations with bc2 and bc3 and tests the setup of boundary conditions in the tests would underestimate the ultimate strength for the decks or bottom of ship structures the periodical boundary condition is assumed in zhang and khan 2009 the difference is minor for stocky panels but it is obvious for the slender ones the local out plane deformation could decrease the overall shortening of the model and results in the reduction in average stress and smaller increase in average overall strain and the structural modulus hence enhanced rotation constraint for the outer spans is required to make sure the central span collapse first for obtaining the expected initial structural modulus and collapse strength although the deformations after collapse in the fe analysis with bc4 configuration fig 15 are different from those of the bc1 configuration fig 11 their ultimate strength and initial structural modulus are still very close their stress distributions at collapse are very similar as well fig 16 the collapse strength calculated by the formula in iacs csr requirements are larger than that in the simulation with restrained bc1 and periodical boundary conditions bc4 because the formula considers multiple uncertainties of external load material and fabrication guedes soares 1988 1997a b the stress distributions at collapse strength for bc3 configuration are different from those for the bc1 and bc4 configurations which illustrates that the boundary conditions significantly affect the buckling shape of specimens as well 5 3 discussion there exist various uncertainties in the test program including in the supports fabrication errors and geometric dimension of the test specimens and the connection method between the support structure and specimens moreover the tests may fail sometimes generating an unexpected failure mode if the experimental setup is not appropriate hence it is good to use more test specimens and to adopt a statistical method to analyse the experimental results instead of giving the maximum error hence the experimental results in xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and 2020 are used in the comparative analysis fig 17 shows the comparisons of the results in the tests by xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and 2020 and the simplified methods proposed by different researchers it can be seen that the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with three full spans in the test of xu and guedes soares 2020 are significantly smaller than those of the other tests and simplified methods from the previous analyses between the tests for three full spans model and numerical simulations with various boundary conditions the constraint for the end loading edges is deficiency in the tests of xu and guedes soares 2020 the rotation degree at the end edges of the stiffened panels should have been constrained to prevent the outer spans to collapse first see fig 18 the stiffened panel with the periodic boundary condition could give a logical modelling to collapse behaviour for continuous stiffened panels xu et al 2013 which is considered as verification reference herein the ultimate strength and initial structural modulus of the stiffened panels with bc1 and bc4 configurations are very close this means that the bc1 configuration with restrain on the end edge of stiffened panels could give reasonable initial stiffness and ultimate strength which also could be applied in the test program the constraints on the end edges of the testing specimen are critical as revealed by the comparison with the numerical simulations when the three full spans model is adopted in the test the bc1 configuration is recommended to model bc1 in the tests the rotation degrees of freedoms at the end edges on the plate and stiffeners should be constrained on the support structures by welding or by bolt connection to ensure the central span collapse first instead outer spans the results assessed by the formula in iacs csr requirements are larger than that of the other simplified methods and the experimental results however since the number of testing sample is limited the verification of this conclusion needs to be further studied by using statistical method from more specimens that should include various collapse modes the ultimate strength assessed by simplified formulae from xu et al 2018 zhang and khan 2009 and anyfantis 2020 are close and are all larger than those in the tests their difference is around 8 5 however the results assessed by paik s method are closer to the test data the experimental results have scatter especially for the three full spans model but are still acceptable from the view point of statistics considering the uncertainty of laboratory conditions since the simplified methods were developed from other experimental results and numerical data from full scale models this means that experimental results and conclusions from tests of the small scaled model to some degree should be still usefully for the study of full scaled prototypes 6 conclusions four configurations of boundary condition are adopted in the fe analysis to study the effect of the support setup in the experimental program on the collapse behaviour of the stiffened panels under compressive load the conclusions are as follows 1 for three full spans in the test the deficient constraint on the rotation degrees of freedom would cause the outer spans to collapse first and then might underestimate the load carrying capacity and initial structural modulus of the stiffened panels it is suggested to use welding or bolt connections to the supporting base to prevent the stiffener to rotate around the end edges of plate 2 the lateral support on the frame is also very important since it can influence the buckling length of the stiffener that relates with the collapse strength of stiffened panel the gaps between u bar and the frame should be as small as possible to reduce the influence of unexpected out plane deformation 3 by comparing with the periodical boundary condition bc4 the boundary condition configuration bc1 with restrain on the end edge of stiffened panels could give reasonable initial stiffness and ultimate strength which could also be applied in the test program 4 the results assessed by the formula in iacs csr requirements are generally larger than that in the tests and the other simplified method which should be noticed and might be further studied in the future credit authorship contribution statement

the collapse strength of deck and bottom stiffened panels under longitudinal in plane compression little 1976 1980 proposed a theoretical approach for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel subjected to uniaxial load using elastic buckling strength theory moolani and dowling 1977 and frieze et al 1977 have developed an equation for designing plate elements subjected to compressive loads considering initial defects fujikubo et al 2005 developed several expressions to assess the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels under longitudinal and lateral loads karvinen and pegg 2006 also proposed a simplified method of stiffened panels collapse using nonlinear failure analysis a theoretical formulation was also developed for the assessment of the collapse strength of a plate with attached stiffener with various arrangements under in plane loading by brubak et al 2007 the nonlinear finite element method is also recommended in the iacs csr requirements 2014 to assess the collapse strength of stiffened panels and ship hull girders ghavami and khedmati 2006 conducted a series finite element fe analyses for the assessment of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with one span or two spans which were compared with experimental programs tanaka and endo 1988 ghavami 1994 paik 2007 adopted experimental results to valid the numerical modelling that simulate the collapse strength of ship structures subjected to in plane longitudinal load considering various configurations of geometrical dimensions and material gordo and guedes soares 2008 2011 and 2012 performed a series in plane collapse tests and numerical simulations of stiffened panels subjected to longitudinal in plane loads xu and guedes soares 2012a three full spans or 1 2 1 1 2 spans model can account for the interaction of the neighbouring members to reduce the eccentricity of the load and the influence of boundary condition at the end edges of stiffened panel in the experiments mathewson and vinner 1962 horne and narayanan 1976 faulkner 1977 and then could provide more reliable results xu and guedes soares 2011 2012b the fe model with 1 2 1 1 2 spans were also adopted by song et al 2019 to conduct dimensional and similarity analyses for stiffened panels with various buckling modes for calibrating the conclusions in these numerical analyses several tests xu and guedes soares 2012c 2013a and corresponding nonlinear finite element method simulations xu and guedes soares 2012d 2013b have been conducted for the stiffened panels with 1 2 1 1 2 spans tanaka et al 2015 proposed an analysis method of the ultimate hull girder strength under combined bending and torsion which was verified by comparing with the results of experiments and fem analysis garbatov et al 2015 performed a hull girder ultimate strength verification according to the class society rules based on experimental results for three box girders and the dimensional theory kim et al 2018 reviewed existing empirical formulations that predict the ultimate limit state uls of a stiffened panel under longitudinal compression the results assessed by various formulations and fe analysis are compared to understand the ultimate compressive strength behaviour of the stiffened panels the test program is a good method to verify the accuracy of the results of theoretical methods but the models geometry and boundary configurations should be set up appropriately for the experimental program to obtain reliable results including the ultimate strength the collapse mode and the structural modulus the numerical simulation can give more details about the collapse and failure mechanism of the structure which may identify the problems that lead to experimental uncertainty which may occur during the test procedure the stiffened panels with 1 2 1 1 2 spans have been used in the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2012c 2013b from which it was found that the outer half span provide larger rotational stiffness than the actual situation and thus would overestimate the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels hence three full spans models were adopted in the experiment of xu and guedes soares 2020 but another problem has occurred during those tests the outer spans of the specimen collapsed first which may not give reasonable collapse modes of the stiffened panels and this phenomenon did not occur in the earlier tests with 1 2 1 1 2 spans xu and guedes soares 2013b therefore numerical simulations are conducted here for the stiffened panels with three full spans from the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2020 considering various boundary conditions including the actual experimental configurations and assuming ideal conditions this paper aims to determine if it would be possible to design a more reliable test program that would be less sensitive to the experimental uncertainties of the laboratory conditions associated with boundary conditions and loading 2 description of the geometrical models and supporting system in the test considering the costs and the laboratory conditions it would be difficult to carry out experiments of ship hull girders with realistic dimensions however according to the similarity analyses of stiffened panels considering various collapse modes it is possible to establish the relationship between the full and small scale models song et al 2019 the test results with small scale models could be used to validate the numerical models the dimensions of the models considered here are the same as the members adopted in the tests of box girders by gordo and guedes soares 2004 2009 2014 2015 which are based on typical members from an actual type of ship s hull structure gordo and guedes soares 1993 master curves with the average stress strain relation will be used to further investigate the ultimate strength of the hull girder the 1 2 1 1 2 spans model including two half spans and one full span is shown in fig 1 a which has been used in the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2012c 2013b it was found that the outer half span provide larger rotational stiffness than the actual situation and thus would overestimate the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels hence three full spans models are adopted in the present paper as shown in fig 1 b c the geometrical dimensions are given in table 1 where l and s are the length and width of the plate and b is transverse length of the whole panel the stiffeners are 30 8 mm flat steel bars and the frames are l shaped steel with 60 40 6 mm and the plate thickness is 4 mm plates with two and 4 bar stiffeners are used to account for the influence of the effective width plate slenderness and column slenderness are the main governing variables for the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panel which are given as follows 1 plate slenderness β s t σ y d e 2 column slenderness λ l e π r σ y d e 3 radius of gyration r i a the effective width of the plate is expressed as follows faulkner 1975 4 φ p 2 β 1 β 2 where the plate effective width directly depends on the dimensions and material characteristics of the structural element in eq 2 l e is the buckling length of the stiffeners and it is determined by the boundary conditions on both ends of stiffened panel while l is the spacing between transverse frames when the stiffener is simply supported or fixed on both ends l e is equal to l or 0 6 l iacs 2014 respectively since the former one is closer to the reality l e is taken as l here the meaning of the test speicmens designation are as follows fb2a flat bar fb2a length of stiffener 2 200 mm 3 300 mm 4 400 mm fb2a a two stiffeners b four stiffeners fig 2 shows the experimental set up of the stiffened panels under longitudinal compressive load which is generated by a hydraulic press with 300 ton loading capacity xu and guedes soares 2020 the stiffened panels are placed on a steel v groove to constrain the longitudinal and lateral movement of the specimens see fig 2 d which means the specimens were constrained in the positive x direction only not the negative x direction this setting of the boundary condition allows the stiffener to rotate around the end edges of plate the longitudinal compressive load was provided by a hydraulic press with 300 t which is a device using a hydraulic cylinder to generate the compressive force the displacement time histories were simultaneously recorded during loading two steel bars are used to support the transverse frames which are allowed to move in the longitudinal direction but have no out plane displacement as in fig 2 c the longitudinal edges b1b4 and a1a4 in fig 1 of the stiffened panels are not constrained and are totally free to move out of plane and to rotate a displacement transducer is installed on t1 to record the lateral displacement in the middle of the plate more detail about the set up and the procedure of the experiment are provided in xu and guedes soares 2020 3 numerical simulation 3 1 fe model and mesh the numerical simulation is conducted in fe code package ansys fig 3 shows the mesh and support setup of the tested stiffened panel the element sizes on plate are 8 mm and 10 mm in longitudinal and transverse directions and the number of elements on the height of the stiffener s web is four for considering the material strain hardening properties a piecewise linear stress strain curve with multi linear isotropic hardening miso is adopted to model the relationship of true stress and true strain in fig 4 a the setup of the tension test is shown in fig 4 b and the average length and width of the test specimens are 208 10 mm and 105 78 mm respectively the shell element 181 with eight nodes in the fe program ansys are used for both stiffeners and plates the yield stress young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 483 mp 200000 mpa and 0 3 respectively 3 2 configuration of boundary conditions in the fe analysis appropriately prescribing the configuration of the boundary condition in the numerical and experimental analyses is important due to its significant effect on the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels xu and guedes soares 2012a depending on the simplifications made in the numerical studies different levels of accuracy can be achieved hence four configurations in the numerical simulations are considered to investigate the influence of boundary conditions on the collapse behaviour of the stiffened panels including the experimental setup and the assumed ideal conditions fig 1 gives the geometry and loading of the stiffened panels in the fe analysis the detailed descriptions about the boundary conditions in the fe analysis are given below 3 2 1 bc1 restrained boundary condition on the transverse edges the two end edges on the stiffened panel were restrained in the longitudinal direction by the steel beds in the test see fig 2 the longitudinal displacement u x and the transverse displacement u z are constrained on the top edges of the plate a1b1 and of the stiffeners e1f1 at c1 c2 c3 c4 see fig 1 the longitudinal displacement c dx is imposed on the top edge of the plate a4b4 and the stiffeners e4f4 at d1 d2 d3 d4 the configurations of the boundary conditions are given by top edges of the plate a1b1 and of the stiffeners e1f1 at c1 c2 c3 c4 u x 0 u z 0 θ x θ y 0 top edges of the plate a4b4 and of the stiffeners e4f4 at d1 d2 d3 d4 u x c dx u z 0 θ x θ y 0 a2 b2 a3 and b3 on the top point of the frames f2 and f3 u z 0 3 2 2 bc2 using rigid surface to simulate the steel block of hydraulic machine in the tests the constraints on the end loading edges of the stiffened panels actually are not clamped boundary condition in the test hence the contact element pairs shown in fig 3 b are used to simulate the interrelationship between the steel block of the hydraulic machine and the loaded edges which were placed in v grooves shown in fig 2 d so there was no movement on the end edges in the lateral direction in the test similarly the relationship between end edge of the specimen and the steel block is set as rough contact in the fe analysis so there is no sliding but it allows contact element pairs to separate each other the contact surface is assumed as rigid to save calculation time since the stiffness of steel block is much larger than that of the stiffened panels the rigid surface at a4b4 in fig 1 is applied the longitudinal displacement c dx and then the stiffened panel s edge is forced to move with the contact element pair the lateral displacements u z of the frames top edges f2 and f3 at a2 b2 a3 and b3 in fig 1 are constrained the configuration of the boundary conditions is given by end edges of the plate a1b1 a4b4 and of the stiffeners e1f1 e4f4 contact with the rigid surfaces control node of the rigid surface contacted with a1b1 edge is constrained with displacement and rotation dofs degree of freedom control node of the rigid contact surface contacted with a4b4 edge u x c dx the other dofs are constrained f2 and f3 at a2 b2 a3 and b3 on the frames u z 0 3 2 3 bc3 using rigid surface to simulate the steel block of the hydraulic machine and the support on the frames in the tests the bc3 configuration is similar to the bc2 but some critical differences should be noticed as for common features the end loading edges of the stiffened panels are simulated by rigid contact surfaces furthermore the stiffened panel s edge is also compelled to move longitudinally by the contact element pair to reproduce the loading process on the other hand it is different that there are eight rigid surfaces to simulate the u shaped bars in fig 3 c and d the gap distance fig 2 c between the rigid surfaces and frames is set as the value measured in the tests the node surface contact elements between the nodes on the frames and the rigid surfaces imitate the interaction within those contact element pairs because the lateral stiffness of the steel bars is much larger than that of the stiffened panel the latter one is not considered in the fe model the configuration of the boundary conditions is given by end edges of the plate a1b1 a4b4 and of the stiffeners e1f1 e4f4 contact with the rigid surface control node of the rigid contact surface contacted with a1b1 edge is constrained with displacement and rotation dofs control node of the rigid contact surface contacted with a4b4 edge u x c dx the other dofs are constrained f2 and f3 at a2 b2 a3 and b3 on the frames contact with eight rigid surfaces respectively whose control nodes are constrained in all degree of freedom 3 2 4 bc4 periodic boundary condition in the longitudinal direction the basic advantage of this type of boundary condition is the possibility to consider either symmetric or anti symmetric buckling mode of a rectangular plate either symmetric or anti symmetric deflection mode of stiffeners in adjacent span and the interaction between adjacent spans of bays xu et al 2013c the periodic boundary conditions is not intended to give the prediction of the collapse behaviour of the test results under specific boundary conditions which is recognized as a standardized model for a continuous stiffened panel under the assumption of periodic nature of structural configuration and boundary condition the configuration of periodic boundary condition is given by a2b2 a3b3 u z 0 θ x 0 a1b1 u x 0 θ z 0 coupling for the other five dofs a4b4 u x c dx θ z 0 coupling for the other dofs e2f2 e3f3 u y uniform movement θ x 0 e1f1 on the stiffeners at c1 c2 for the narrow panels and c1 c4 for the wide panels including flange u x u x c dx coupling for the other five dofs between two end edges e4f4 on the stiffeners at d1 d2 for the narrow panels and at d1 d4 for the wide panels including flange coupling for six dofs between two end edges c dx is the imposed uniform movement 3 3 geometrical deflection the geometrical deflection of the specimens caused by the fabrication procedure which has been measured by a displacement transducer before the test xu and guedes soares 2020 is shown in fig 5 the displacements are applied on the nodes of the fe model by using the ansys program design language apdl 4 collapse strength assessment by simplified method the load carrying capacity and collapse behaviour of the stiffened panels are affected significantly by several main parameters including plate slenderness column slenderness type of stiffeners and external loads the overall collapse of the grillage and the yielding of the entire panel were not observed due to the support of the transverse frames in the experiment which is generally prevented at the design stage by using a strong frame the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels considering three collapse modes are assessed by the formulae in the iacs csr requirements iacs 2014 which are the formulations proposed by gordo and guedes soares 1993 and are given by buckling of local plate 5 σ a c

various buckling modes are assessed for every given shortening in eqns 5 6 and 9 in which the minimum value is defined as the average stress of stiffened panels the calculation program has been developed by matlab based on experimental results paik and thayamballi 1997 adopted the least square method to develop an empirical formulation to assess the ultimate strength of steel stiffened panel subjected to in plane compression which is given as follows 10 σ u σ yseq 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 1 λ 2 where z 0 is the distance between outer surface of the plate and the neutral axis of the stiffener and σ y s e q is the equivalent yield stress of stiffened panel they are given by 11 z 0 0 5 s t p 2 h w t w t p 0 5 h w b f t f t p h w 0 5 t f s t p h w t w b f t f 12

derived a simplified expression for assessing the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel subjected longitudinal compression which is expressed by 13 σ u σ yseq 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 f o r λ 2 and take β 1 0 if β 1 0 based on a numerical database for various stiffener types xu et al 2013 also adopted the least square method to develop a regression formulae for predicting the ultimate strength of steel stiffened panels in which the coefficients are different considering the influence of the type of stiffener to improve the accuracy of the prediction results more coefficients and higher order are used in the approximate expression the assessment formula for stiffened panel with flat bar is given as follows 14 σ u σ yseq 1 1 11 4 91 λ 0 49 β 0 77 λ β 10 07 λ 2 0 11 β 2 0 14 λ 2 β 2 7 09 λ 3 0

λ 0 260 β 0 250 λ 2 0 078 λ β 0 0295 β 2 5 analysis of the results 5 1 comparison of ultimate strength the experimental support setup significantly influences the failure mode and the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels the numerical results with various boundary conditions are discussed by comparing with experimental results in the bc1 configuration the displacement of the stiffened panel s edges are constrained in three directions the lateral edges of the stiffened panels are fitted on a v groove in the tests hence the connections between the steel blocks of the hydraulic machine and the loading edge of the stiffened panels are modelled by contact elements for bc2 and bc3 to consider the uncertainty caused by the lateral support system in the tests as shown in fig 2 two rigid surfaces are adopted for the bc3 configuration to consider the measured gaps distance between the frames and u shaped bar for comparison the periodical boundary condition is also adopted on the edges a1b1 a4b4 e1f1 and e4f4 in the longitudinal direction in bc4 which is recognized as a standard model for continuous stiffened panels the influence of various boundary conditions on the collapse behaviours of the stiffened panels are investigated by comparing with the results in the experiments of xu and guedes soares 2020 and assessed by design equations in iacs csr requirement iacs 2014 the load cases are given as follows 1 case 1 experimental results in xu and guedes soares 2020 2 case 2 calculations according to the design equations implemented in the iacs csr requirements iacs 2014 3 case 3 fe bc1 fe analysis with bc1 configuration restrained boundary condition 4 case 4 fe bc2 fe analysis with bc2 configuration using rigid contact surface to simulate the steel block of the hydraulic machine of the tests 5 case 5 fe bc3 fe analysis with bc3 configuration using rigid contact surface to simulate the steel block of the hydraulic machine and the support on the frames of the tests the measurement gap distance between the u shape and steel bar on the frames is included in the fe model 6 case 6 fe bc4 fe analysis with periodical boundary condition bc4 fig 5 plots the strength and end shortening relationships of the test specimen fb2a during the initial stage of the loading process the reaction load is still very small during the large imposed displacement in the test which derives from the rearrangement of the boundary until the specimen has been fully supported by the hydraulic machine which is not included in the following analysis the average stress is defined as the ratio of the reaction force to the whole sectional area of stiffened panel the shortening is defined as the longitudinal displacement of end edge divided by length of stiffened panel a residual stress relief technique is applied in the test by applying a small amplitude cyclic loading shown in fig 5 where the residual plastic strain is very small besides the present study aims to find out a reasonable configuration of the boundary conditions that can both reproduce the operating conditions of the panel in ship structures and be realized test in laboratory although the welding residual stresses are not account for in the numerical simulations figs 6 8 shows the average stress average strain curves in the experiment the iacs requirement iacs 2014 and the numerical simulations with various configurations of boundary conditions the stiffened panels represent a cut out from ship hull structures whose longitudinal edges are expected to be restrained symmetrically this kind of boundary condition is difficult to be realized in laboratory hence wide panels are also used in the tests to reduce the effect of the lack of effectiveness of the edge conditions fig 8 shows the average strength and end shortening relationships of the wide specimens with four stiffeners the average initial structural moduli are all close to 200 gpa for both stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners in the fe analysis with bc1 and bc4 configurations and are respectively 92 gpa and 102 gpa in the tests this phenomenon is the reason why the stiffened panels with four stiffeners are similar with those having two stiffeners for the same conditions the average stress of wide panels is generally larger than that of the narrow ones since the unsupported lateral edges of the specimen having large percentage of cross section area is less effective which is less influenced by the effectiveness at the lateral plate edges hence larger geometric dimensions of the test model are recommended for the experiment fig 9 and table 2 show the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels in the tests the iacs csr requirement and the numerical simulations with different configurations of boundary conditions those strength values are denoted as σ u test σ u csr σ u bc1 σ u bc2 σ u bc3 and σ u bc4 for case 1 to case 6 in order the initial structural modulus is defined as the slope of the average stress strain curve of the stiffened panels in the beginning from table 2 the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels assessed by the iacs csr requirement are larger than that in the experiment and numerical simulations the average initial structural modulus and the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels in the tests are close to that of the bc2 and bc3 configurations but are smaller than the values predicted by the iacs csr requirement and the fe analyses with bc1 and bc4 configurations the initial stiffness and ultimate strength in the fe analyses with bc1 and bc4 configurations are similar to that in the iacs csr requirement this shows that the collapse strength of the stiffened panels is sensitive to the boundary conditions the explanation for their differences is given in the following sections 5 2 investigation of the influence of the boundary conditions it was found that the periodical boundary condition is an appropriate boundary condition to approximate the bending process of stiffened panels and to consider the influence of adjacent members xu et al 2013c however this kind of boundary condition is difficult to realize in the experiments in the design of the test setup the stiffened panels with three full spans used in the test are intended to account for the influence of the outer spans on the central span in the early stage of loading it can be seen that the numerical results with bc1 restrained boundary condition and bc4 periodical boundary condition are similar hence bc1 configuration with restrained boundary condition at the end edges is adopted in the simulation as well since it is possible to be realized in the test program the setup of the boundary condition in the test is originally to simulate bc1 however the ultimate strength initial structural modulus and deformation are very different between the numerical simulation with bc1 and the tests it can be observed that the stiffener rotated around the plate in the test as shown in fig 10 the rotation of the stiffener around end edges of the plate was not expected before test however in the fe analysis with bc1 configuration the displacement dofs at the loaded edges of the plate and the stiffeners are constrained during the whole loading process and there is no rotation at the end of stiffener between specimen and the loading support members in fig 11 the bc1 with restrained boundary conditions assumes no gap in the contact between specimen and the loading support members which gives higher rotation stiffness and strength than that in the real test cases the bc1 configuration is a kind of perfect model with less uncertainty in the boundary condition except for geometrical imperfections it seems that the support system in the fe analysis with bc1 restrained boundary is different from the setup of boundary condition in the tests from the comparison of displacements between them it is necessary to investigate if the absence of the rotation degree of freedom at the end of stiffener would cause the underestimation of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels it is very clear that when simulating some experimental program of testing models the same conditions should be established in the numerical models hence bc2 configuration using rigid contact surface is used to simulate the connection between the end edges of the stiffened panels and steel block of the hydraulic machine which actually happened in the tests meaning that the specimens were constrained in the positive x direction only not the negative x direction the edges of the plate and stiffeners move together with the rigid surface in the beginning and then the top of the stiffener separates from the rigid surface at f1 and f4 as the load increases which allows the outer spans to rotate around the end edges of the plate and then the gap is observed in fig 12 this deformation is similar to that in the tests the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with bc2 is significantly smaller than that with bc1 for slender stiffened panels which is still larger than that in the test it can be seen that the specimens with three full spans deform as three waves for bc2 in fig 12 and the out plane deformations and the rotation at the load edge also appear in the tests as shown in fig 10 the contact elements pairs in bc2 provide the loading edges with support forces which do not exist in bc1 the differences between the results of the tests and the fe analysis with bc1 and bc2 configurations are because of the rotations at the loading edges which result in the reduction of the average stress and smaller increase in the average overall strain and the initial structural modulus fig 13 shows the lateral displacement curves of the plate on t1 in fig 2 which indicates the lateral movement directions in the central spans of the test specimens take the panel fb3a as an example the residual lateral displacement on t1 is 1 3 mm after the load was totally discharged in the first cycle which should be the gap distance between the frame and the u bar in fig 2 since the material on the plate and stiffeners were both still elastic at this moment there exists installation gaps between the u guide bar and the support steel bar for supporting the frame in the tests due to the fabrication errors see fig 2 c which are difficult to be completely eliminated and can be considered as the experimental uncertainty hence the connections between u guide and steel supporting bar are simulated by two rigid surfaces fig 3 d for bc3 which is also adopted to investigate the influence of the supporting of frame on the collapse deformation the outer span buckles first instead of the central span in the simulation with bc3 fig 14 which is similar to that in the test fig 10 the ultimate strength between the tests and numerical simulations with bc3 are very close fig 9 as the gap exists the lateral constraint for the frames that cause the out plane deformation in fig 10 b cannot be provided at the earlier stage of loading the only difference between the bc2 and bc3 configurations is the lateral support method on the frame the pressure distribution on the loading edge of the stiffened panel and the contact surface the ultimate strength and the initial structural modulus of the stiffened panel in the fe analysis with bc3 are more similar to that in the test than the bc1 configuration the ultimate strength in the fe analysis with bc3 configuration and in the tests are slightly smaller than that with bc2 because of the lateral support on the frames also greatly influences the collapse behaviour and strength of the stiffened panel which determines the buckling length of stiffeners l e that should be equal to l frame spacing in eq 2 for the test however if there is no lateral support on the frame l e should then be equal to 3l namely the column slenderness of the stiffened panels are different for various support conditions on the frame moreover this difference between the tests and the fe analysis with bc1 for stocky specimens are larger than that for slender ones because the gaps between the guide bar and stiffened panels could increase the out plane deformations and then would reduce the load carrying capacity the out plane displacement for the stocky stiffened panels is smaller than that for the slender ones and then the influence of boundary conditions is smaller the out of plane deformations caused by fabrication errors reduce the load carrying capability of the stiffened panels the average value of the ratio of ultimate strength for bc2 to bc3 is 6 5 but this difference between bc1 and bc2 is 12 this means that the condition of rotations degree at the loading edges of stiffener is also an important influential factor especially for slender specimens the ultimate strength and collapse shape of the stiffened panels in the fe analysis with bc3 are close to that in the tests when the effect of the gap between the frame and the u shaped bar and the rotations at the loading edges are both considered the influence of boundary conditions on the collapse mode and ultimate strength is significant in the actual situation the adjacent member could provide the rotation constraint for the stiffener however in the test the absence of rotation at the end of stiffener would cause larger lateral deformation of the outer span and the outer span collapse before the central one which was not expected before the test this reason might cause that the boundary condition in the tests underestimate the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panel this means that the constraint of rotation degree at the end edge significantly influences the collapse behaviour hence the tests in the laboratory should be improved to better simulate the working situation of ship structures it is suggested that the rotation degree should be constrained in the tests by welding or using a bolt connection to ensure the central span collapse first instead outer span moreover because the rotational resistance of the frame for the central span is much larger than the supporting force for the outer span five of six stiffened panels collapse in the outer spans in the tests as shown in fig 10 instead of the central span the difference of the results in the fe analysis with bc1 and bc4 configurations and the iacs csr requirement are smaller than that of numerical simulations with bc2 and bc3 and tests the setup of boundary conditions in the tests would underestimate the ultimate strength for the decks or bottom of ship structures the periodical boundary condition is assumed in zhang and khan 2009 the difference is minor for stocky panels but it is obvious for the slender ones the local out plane deformation could decrease the overall shortening of the model and results in the reduction in average stress and smaller increase in average overall strain and the structural modulus hence enhanced rotation constraint for the outer spans is required to make sure the central span collapse first for obtaining the expected initial structural modulus and collapse strength although the deformations after collapse in the fe analysis with bc4 configuration fig 15 are different from those of the bc1 configuration fig 11 their ultimate strength and initial structural modulus are still very close their stress distributions at collapse are very similar as well fig 16 the collapse strength calculated by the formula in iacs csr requirements are larger than that in the simulation with restrained bc1 and periodical boundary conditions bc4 because the formula considers multiple uncertainties of external load material and fabrication guedes soares 1988 1997a b the stress distributions at collapse strength for bc3 configuration are different from those for the bc1 and bc4 configurations which illustrates that the boundary conditions significantly affect the buckling shape of specimens as well 5 3 discussion there exist various uncertainties in the test program including in the supports fabrication errors and geometric dimension of the test specimens and the connection method between the support structure and specimens moreover the tests may fail sometimes generating an unexpected failure mode if the experimental setup is not appropriate hence it is good to use more test specimens and to adopt a statistical method to analyse the experimental results instead of giving the maximum error hence the experimental results in xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and 2020 are used in the comparative analysis fig 17 shows the comparisons of the results in the tests by xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and 2020 and the simplified methods proposed by different researchers it can be seen that the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with three full spans in the test of xu and guedes soares 2020 are significantly smaller than those of the other tests and simplified methods from the previous analyses between the tests for three full spans model and numerical simulations with various boundary conditions the constraint for the end loading edges is deficiency in the tests of xu and guedes soares 2020 the rotation degree at the end edges of the stiffened panels should have been constrained to prevent the outer spans to collapse first see fig 18 the stiffened panel with the periodic boundary condition could give a logical modelling to collapse behaviour for continuous stiffened panels xu et al 2013 which is considered as verification reference herein the ultimate strength and initial structural modulus of the stiffened panels with bc1 and bc4 configurations are very close this means that the bc1 configuration with restrain on the end edge of stiffened panels could give reasonable initial stiffness and ultimate strength which also could be applied in the test program the constraints on the end edges of the testing specimen are critical as revealed by the comparison with the numerical simulations when the three full spans model is adopted in the test the bc1 configuration is recommended to model bc1 in the tests the rotation degrees of freedoms at the end edges on the plate and stiffeners should be constrained on the support structures by welding or by bolt connection to ensure the central span collapse first instead outer spans the results assessed by the formula in iacs csr requirements are larger than that of the other simplified methods and the experimental results however since the number of testing sample is limited the verification of this conclusion needs to be further studied by using statistical method from more specimens that should include various collapse modes the ultimate strength assessed by simplified formulae from xu et al 2018 zhang and khan 2009 and anyfantis 2020 are close and are all larger than those in the tests their difference is around 8 5 however the results assessed by paik s method are closer to the test data the experimental results have scatter especially for the three full spans model but are still acceptable from the view point of statistics considering the uncertainty of laboratory conditions since the simplified methods were developed from other experimental results and numerical data from full scale models this means that experimental results and conclusions from tests of the small scaled model to some degree should be still usefully for the study of full scaled prototypes 6 conclusions four configurations of boundary condition are adopted in the fe analysis to study the effect of the support setup in the experimental program on the collapse behaviour of the stiffened panels under compressive load the conclusions are as follows 1 for three full spans in the test the deficient constraint on the rotation degrees of freedom would cause the outer spans to collapse first and then might underestimate the load carrying capacity and initial structural modulus of the stiffened panels it is suggested to use welding or bolt connections to the supporting base to prevent the stiffener to rotate around the end edges of plate 2 the lateral support on the frame is also very important since it can influence the buckling length of the stiffener that relates with the collapse strength of stiffened panel the gaps between u bar and the frame should be as small as possible to reduce the influence of unexpected out plane deformation 3 by comparing with the periodical boundary condition bc4 the boundary condition configuration bc1 with restrain on the end edge of stiffened panels could give reasonable initial stiffness and ultimate strength which could also be applied in the test program 4 the results assessed by the formula in iacs csr requirements are generally larger than that in the tests and the other simplified method which should be noticed and might be further studied in the future credit authorship contribution statement

21138,despite intensive research efforts the accurate modelling and prediction of bridge pier scour is an outstanding challenge due to the complexities arising from the detailed interactions between granular and fluid mechanics in the riverbed pier scour predictions based on empirical formulas are used in conventional bridge design codes which fail to realistically account for these interactions and thus fail to facilitate pier design optimization a critical step towards optimal pier design is an improved physical understanding of detailed mechanisms of the scour process and the development of appropriate modelling techniques to resolve these mechanisms in engineering applications in this study a combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd and discrete element modelling dem is used to improve physical understanding of the scour process including detailed interactions between river hydrodynamics transport of suspended particles and granular mechanics of the riverbed as cfd dem models of turbulent hydrodynamics coupled with densely packed granular assemblies are computationally expensive it is currently not feasible to accurately model scour in macroscopic engineering applications to address this problem we propose a novel upscaling methodology based on highly resolved microscale simulations that significantly reduces the computational overhead facilitating macroscopic prediction of scour under live bed conditions predictions of scour initiation rate and extent from these microscale simulations have been validated against previously published experimental data results indicate that the microscale model is reasonably capable of predicting the scour initiation as well as the equilibrium scour depth this upscaling model provides a viable

collision velocity 1 introduction scouring around the base of bridge pier can lead to the loss of soil support and ultimately the collapse of the bridge structure without prior warning according to available statistics scouring is the most common reason of bridge failure and contributes to more than 60 of bridge failures in the usa l deng and cai 2009 lagasse and richardson 2001 and over 50 of the damage found after recent flood events in australia owen and powers 2014 a survey of road authorities in new zealand showed that more than 70 of annual expenses on scour related bridge damages is related to bridge repairs rather than preventative maintenance or bridge replacement melville and coleman 2000 current methods for scour estimation in almost all bridge design codes involve empirical equations which frequently overpredict the scour depth queensland department of transport and main roads 2013 comparative studies on available empirical design equations showed that these equations predict significantly different values for scour depth under the same flow and sediment conditions sheppard et al 2013 zevenbergen 2010 moreover while these empirical equations are used to estimate the rate of scour these equations cannot account for other qualitative parameters such as the shape of the scour hole and the impact of suspended sediment particles due to inherent limitations of conventional empirical models numerical modelling has attracted attention during past decades which enables an in depth understanding of the mechanisms of bridge pier scour gazi and afzal 2020 x liu and garcía 2008 olsen and kjellesvig 1998 richardson and panchang 1998 roulund et al 2005 sumer 2007 the interest in numerical modelling of pier scour is ever increasing due to the advancement in computing technology including large scale computational resources and sophisticated software tools early attempts regarding numerical estimation of scour around bridge piers involved the development of cfd computational fluid dynamics models for investigation of the time averaged hydrodynamic flow structures around bridge piers without estimation of scour g deng and piquet 1992 subsequent hydrodynamic studies baranya et al 2012 li et al 2017 olsen and melaaen 1993 richardson and panchang 1998 salaheldin et al 2004 tseng et al 2000 have continued to improve resolution of the turbulent flow structure around the pier where horseshoe and wake vortices have been identified as the coherent flow structures which are most responsible for initiation of pier scour recently a mesh updating technique has been implemented in cfd based models to ensure that the interface between flow and sediment bed is updated in each time step and to avoid the assumption on the pattern of the flow field boundary xiong et al 2016 in addition to cfd only models other numerical models which studied the estimation of the scour rate and extent along with the flow field calculation have been proposed the first study to numerically estimate scour in conjunction with the flow field calculation was by olsen and melaaen olsen and melaaen 1993 in that study the fluid shear stress at the top of the sediment bed was calculated from navier stokes simulations of turbulent flow via a k ε turbulence model this bed fluid shear stress was then used to estimate the sediment bed load concentration in the numerical cells closest to the bed the bed elevation change was determined from conservation of sediment mass and the cfd mesh was then updated based on the new bed elevation that is a two phase euler lagrange model in which evolution of the sediment concentration has been evaluated under a lagrangian framework however this approach is limited in that a semi empirical parameterization engelund and fredsøe 1976 is required to estimate the bed load transport rate involving simple assumptions like flow steadiness which are not applicable in a flooded river in addition to euler lagrange models eulerian two phase models have also been developed in which the sediment transport is simulated by including the flow sediment interaction in the flow governing equations cheng and hsu 2014 xiong et al 2016 in eulerian two phase models the flow and sediment are both treated as fluid phases with different viscosities and the volume fraction of each phase is calculated as part of the multiphase calculation as this two phase model treats the particulate phase as a fluid phase with a nominal viscosity this model fails to capture the granular particle interactions in both the fluid bulk and the sediment bed although eulerian two phase models are shown to have some advantages over conventional semi empirical models such continuum models do not resolve the discrete granular nature of the sediment particles that is dominated by both the collisions and frictional forces between particles which are central to prediction of scour as such continuum models for the particulate phase are not capable of properly resolving the granular mechanics of the riverbed and hence cannot reliably predict the scouring process to properly resolve these particle particle interactions that are critical to the prediction of bridge pier scour discrete element modelling dem with cfd methods are coupled in this study to understand the mechanisms that govern scour of sediments a two way coupled cfd dem model is used to account for both particle particle and particle fluid interactions in the system this numerical modelling technique directly resolves the strong coupling between the river hydrodynamics suspended particles in the open channel flow and the granular mechanics of the riverbed itself such coupled cfd dem models have previously been applied to a wide range of gas solid and liquid solid flow applications including fluidized beds d liu bu and chen 2013 conical sand piling in water zhao and shan 2013 seepage induced erosion xiao and wang 2020 and solid liquid mixing systems garg et al 2012 wu et al 2018 also the cfd dem methodology has been used to study sediment transport problems such as near shore sheet flow sediment transport calantoni et al 2004 drake and calantoni 2001 sediment transport around subsea pipelines zhang et al 2015 and sediment transport in open channel flow kidanemariam and uhlmann 2017 to resolve the interactions between flow and sediment particles however there are some challenges involved in the application of cfd dem methodology for sediment transport problems the sediment transport occurs in a thin boundary layer necessitating a fine cfd mesh to resolve the viscous boundary layer at the same time the dem method requires the particle size to be everywhere smaller than the cfd mesh size in order to facilitate of mapping the discrete phase properties into eulerian phase mesh and to avoid numerical instabilities hence simulation of large particles becomes a challenge which requires a robust algorithm to satisfy both limitations in addition the number of particles involved in sediment transport applications can be in the order of 106 which is larger than the number of particles involved in other applications of cfd dem model sun and xiao 2016 despite significant research efforts regarding cfd dem modelling of sediment transport applications studies on local scour around bridge piers using cfd dem model are still quite limited li et al li and tao 2018 have undertaken the first cfd dem modelling of bridge pier scour under clear water conditions i e where the inflowing fluid in the model is devoid of suspended particles this clear water condition is quite rare under typical river flow conditions in contrast most scour events involve so called live bed conditions where the inflowing water carries a significant load of suspended sediment particles these suspended particles play an important role in the initiation rate and extent of pier scour and so must be accounted for in numerical modelling of bridge pier scour in this paper a novel upscaling methodology is proposed to facilitate prediction of scour in macroscopic applications this methodology involves employ of a coupled cfd dem model to study the microscale mechanism of scour under live bed conditions over a range of flow rates the results of these simulations for a given sediment type then facilitates population of probabilistic model for particle scour based upon local flow conditions and the impact of suspended particles this scour model can then be employed in macroscopic cfd models for scour that only require tracking of suspended particles rather than dem of the sediment bed the source of the major of the computational overhead for coupled cfd dem models thus this upscaling methodology represents a viable technique to predict macroscopic scour using only modest computational resources the microscale model involves simulation of a bed of sediment particles under live bed conditions with periodic lateral boundary conditions over a range of applied flow rates this model explores the microscale mechanisms of scour within the sediment bed under live bed conditions facilitating the development of a probabilistic phenomenological model for scour that is based on these observations microscale simulations are then used to populate this model and describe how this model can be used to model rate and extent of scour rate as a function of local flow conditions and particle impacts in macroscopic cfd simulations the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the coupled cfd dem model and coupling algorithm including discussion of the computational overhead of this approach section 3 describes the upscaling methodology to circumvent these overheads and outlines the microscale model and scour function that forms the basis of this methodology subsequently the coupling algorithm and the microscale model are described in section 4 the results obtained from the microscale model are validated against experimental data reported in literature and the detailed scour mechanism is uncovered in section 5 these insights are used to develop a probabilistic scour model which is subsequently populated from the microscale simulations and application to macroscopic simulations is discussed conclusions and outstanding research challenges are discussed in section 6 2 model formulation the cfd dem framework is based upon continuum eulerian and discrete lagrangian models for the fluid and particle phases respectively this methodology facilitates modelling of the interactions between these two phases via an exchange of interparticle forces that are computed from independent cfd and dem solvers in this section a brief description of the individual cfd and dem solvers is provided before describing the coupling algorithm that is used to quantify the interactions 2 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd model scour of sediment beds is governed by a combination of turbulent flow coupled with discrete particles in open channels above the sediment bed and porous media flow in the hyporheic zone through the sediment bed itself the turbulent sediment laden flow is resolved via a modified navier stokes equation incorporating the effect of discrete particles the modified equation to resolve the multiphase flow with discrete particles is shown below including a mass balance equation 1a and a momentum conservation equation 1b li and tao 2018 1a α f ρ f t α f ρ f u f 0 1b α f ρ f u f t α f ρ f u f u f α f p α f σ f α f ρ f g f p where u f is the flow velocity α f is the fluid volume fraction incorporating the volume taken by particles ρ f is the fluid density p is the flow pressure intensity σ f is the local fluid shear stress and f p represents the interaction force between fluid and particle phases that comprises of viscous drag buoyancy lift and added mass forces these forces are described in detail in section 2 1 1 to resolve the sediment laden hydrodynamics the finite volume cfd package fluent 17 is employed in the current study this solver employs a structured computational mesh with 2nd order spatial and 1st order temporal discretization the simple algorithm is used in order to minimize rhie chow errors associated with the enforcement of incompressible flow fluent manual 2005 the selection of an appropriate turbulence closure model to be implemented in rans equation is an important modelling consideration there are different turbulence models used to model the unsteady fluctuating component of the flow including the standard shear stress transport stress transport sst k ω k ε and reynolds stress models each turbulence model employs a specific near wall treatment method to account for the transition profile near the wall and to resolve the rapid variation of flow variables over this boundary layer low reynolds number turbulence models such as sst k ω aim to resolve the entire turbulent boundary layer and thus require a high resolution boundary mesh with dimensionless wall distance y 1 to ensure that near wall regions are resolved accurately this requirement can impose a significant computational overhead and can adversely impact solver convergence conversely wall function turbulence models such as k ε use semi empirical expressions which require a significantly lower mesh resolution y 11 however these models can slightly over estimate the fluid velocity near the bed salaheldin et al 2004 the reynolds stress turbulence model accounts for the effect of rapid changing flows by solving transport equations for turbulence parameters together with an equation for the dissipation rate this significantly increases computational overhead and for less complex flow regimes such as those around bridge piers does not yield predictions which are superior to simpler models such as sst k ε and k ω models in this study sst k ω turbulence model was selected over the sst k ε model as it provides superior resolution of the turbulent boundary layer which is critical to scour prediction the sst k ω model originated from the wilcox k ω model wilcox 1998 resolves the reynolds stresses via two equations for k kinetic energy and ω energy dissipation rates in a multiphase flow ansys 2013 although there exist dedicated turbulence models for particle laden flows such as one way and two way coupled k ε models for particle eddy interactions these models are still very much in the developmental stages and presently there is not yet a widely accepted set of turbulence closures for solid liquid multiphase flows ebrahimi and crapper 2017 li and tao 2018 s wang et al 2019 as these closures develop further extension of the cfd dem model used in this study to incorporate such effects would be an interesting development but such models are beyond the scope of this study 2 1 1 hydrodynamic forces on particles the flows computed in both the open river and through the sediment bed impart forces on sediment particles including viscous drag lift and virtual mass forces as shown in fig 1 the viscous drag force f d acts in the opposite direction to the relative velocity between the sediment particle and surrounding fluid and is highly dependent on the shape of the particle the drag force is computed as 2 f d 18 μ f c d r e p ρ p d p 2 24 u f u p where u f is the fluid velocity u p is particle velocity c d is the drag coefficient ρ p the particle density d p the particle diameter μ f molecular viscosity of the fluid and r e p the particle reynolds number the drag coefficient for smooth spherical particles is 3 c d a 1 a 2 r e p a 3 re p 2 where a 1 and a 2 are dimensionless constants that apply over several ranges of reynolds numbers morsi and alexander 1972 for non spherical particles haider and levenspiel haider and levenspiel 1989 developed the following drag coefficient 4 c d 24 re sph 1 b 1 re sph b 2 b 3 re sph b 4 re sph where b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are constants which are functions of particle shape factor and re sph which is the particle reynolds number for a spherical particle having the same volume lift forces f l act perpendicular to the direction of flow and originate from asymmetry in the shear stress distribution over the surface of the particle as 5 f l c l ρ f a p u f u p u f where c l is the lift coefficient ρ f is the fluid density and a p is the projected area of the particle surface in most cases the lift force is insignificant as compared to the drag force except in cases where the two phases separate quickly the buoyancy force f b due to the difference between the solid particle density ρ p and the fluid density ρ f is f b α p ρ p ρ f g where α p is the particle volume fraction and g is the gravitational acceleration vector the virtual mass or added mass force f v m is the inertia added to the fluid phase due to acceleration of the small volume of fluid surrounding accelerating particles the virtual mass force is given as 6 f v m ρ f v p 2 d u f d t d u p d t where d d t is the material derivative for the fluid phase and d d t is the material derivative for the particle phase typically the added mass force is significant only in cases where the secondary phase density is much smaller than the primary phase density eg two phase model of bubble columns in this study the viscous drag buoyancy virtual mass and the lift forces are incorporated in the cfd dem model these hydrodynamic forces are incorporated in the interphase momentum transfer term f p in equation 1 b defined as 7 f p f d f b f l f v m which represents the interaction force between the flow and particle phases all these hydrodynamic forces are calculated in each cfd mesh cell and transferred to the dem solver to be mapped onto discrete particles 2 2 discrete element method dem approach the discrete element method dem is a well established lagrangian modelling technique that was originally developed by cundall and strack 1979 to simulate the mechanics of granular assemblies this is a newtonian method that evolves the position and orientation of discrete granular elements such as sediment particles based on applied forces and torques that arise from the surrounding fluid hydrodynamic forces neighbouring particles contact forces and externally applied force fields such gravitational brownian electrostatic and magnetic forces as 8 d m p u p d t f p f n f t here f p f n f t respectively are the interphase hydrodynamic and normal and tangential contact forces and m p is the particle mass newton s second law of motion is encoded via equation 8 for the linear and angular velocity of each particle from which the particle position and orientation is updated in the following subsection the contact models used to compute force transmission between particles in the dem mode are described 2 2 1 contact models the contact model defines how normal and tangential frictional forces are transmitted between particles when they come into contact the simplest normal contact model is the hertzian contact model which involves a linear elastic model for the normal force f n as a linear function of the normal displacement δ n overlap of particles and the frictional force f t is then proportional to the normal force fig 2 as 9a f n k n δ n 9b f t μ f n where μ is the columb friction coefficient and k n is particle stiffness which is given as 10 k n 4 β e r e f f r e f f r i j r i r j where β is a scaling parameter r i and r j are the respective particles radii r e f f is the effective radius and e is the young s modulus nosewicz et al 2017 rojek et al 2012 these linear elastic models are relatively simple and efficient to predict the particle behaviour in granular flows however they require precise determination of the linear model parameters which is often difficult to achieve in practice for accurate prediction of contact behaviour in systems with dynamic evolution of forces and displacements such as sediment transport systems a more sophisticated approach involving nonlinear models is required di renzo and di maio 2004 in this study a non linear hertz mindlin contact model is employed that involves a nonlinear relationship between normal force and normal displacement as 11 f n 4 3 e e f f r e f f δ n 3 2 1 e e f f 1 ϑ i 2 e i 1 ϑ j 2 e j where e i and e j are the young s moduli and ϑ i and ϑ j are the poisson s ratios of particles i and j respectively this model ensures an accurate prediction of contact dynamics between sediment particles and thus the accurate prediction of scour dynamics 2 3 coupling algorithm the coupling algorithm lies at the heart of the coupled cfd dem method and allows the two way exchange of interparticle forces between the fluid cfd and solid dem solvers physically coupling the sediment and fluid phases two commercial software packages were employed ansys fluent 17 and edem 2018 2 as cfd and dem solvers respectively which are then linked via a coupling interface the coupling interface implements an explicit time integration method to facilitate two way coupling between fluid and particle phases via the exchange of the interphase forces between the cfd and dem solvers 2 4 limitations of coupled cfd dem models coupled cfd dem models are able to fully resolve the mechanisms of scour as the particle particle dynamics are fully resolved and coupled with the river hydrodynamics in this model however the application of cfd dem to scour prediction has been limited due to the excessive computational overhead nabi et al 2013 this computational overhead quickly becomes prohibitive for the large number of particles typically 105 or greater required for a full scale simulation of pier scour in which the length scale of the characteristic pier diameter of the order of meters is much larger than that of the sediment particle diameter of the order of 100 μm in addition the fine spatial mesh required to resolve the turbulent boundary layer around the pier enforces a highly restrictive computational timestep due to the courant freidricks levy cfl condition also the fine meshing around the pier poses a restriction linked to the major limitation of cfd dem model the smallest cell volume of the cfd mesh is required to be larger than the volume of the biggest solid particle so that each solid particle could be mapped within one fluid cell moreover simulation of the scour process involves resolution of two different time scales for turbulent flows the hydrodynamics evolve with respect to the eddy turnover time t e typically of the order of 10 3s while the particle dynamics evolve with respect to the particle collision time t p which is at least 10 3 times smaller than t e in addition pier scour evolves toward the equilibrium state on the order of hours thus requiring a prohibitive number of timesteps to simulate the scour process towards the equilibrium state even with large scale computing resources state of the art numerical models have only modelled the full scour process for a few minutes xiong et al 2016 this computational overhead is a current roadblock to fully resolved numerical modelling of scour in macroscopic engineering applications such as pier scour 3 a novel upscaling methodology for scour prediction as fully resolved computations of coupled cfd dem for scour modelling is unfeasible in many applications an upscaling methodology is essential for prediction of scour under particular regimes of particle mechanics and hydrodynamics sediment scour is a process that involves multiple length and time scales and so spans a wide range of dynamical regimes that vary significantly with application although it is not possible to develop a well conditioned upscaling model that spans all of these regimes it is possible to develop such a methodology that is valid over a limited set of regimes relevant to scour 3 1 upscaling framework and approach the upscaling methodology is based upon the concept of performing detailed cfd dem simulations of scour in homogeneous turbulent flow in an unbounded microscopic domain and then using these simulation results in an upscaled cfd model to predict macroscopic scour upscaling is performed via a scour function where the local rate of scour in the macroscopic cfd model is computed from the local fluid and particle variables this scour function is populated by the microscale cfd dem simulations which model the rate of scour as a function of the above local variables under the assumptions outlined below this scour function is specific to a particular sediment assembly in that sediments with different particle size shape or density distributions possess unique scour functions and so must be re calculated when a new sediment assembly is under consideration the basic upscaling philosophy is that the microscale cfd dem model that populates the scour function is significantly faster and more feasible to compute than a fully coupled macroscopic cfd dem model and the macroscopic cfd model is also significantly faster to compute using this scour function as the dem solver nor the coupling algorithm is required the microscale simulations comprise of modelling a particle laden turbulent flow over an unbounded sediment bed where the number of suspended particles is varied to mimic a range of flow scenarios from clear water particle free to live bed particle laden conditions these simulations are performed in a domain that is spatially periodic in the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the mean flow direction and of sufficient dimensions length l and width w which are many multiples of the characteristic sediment particle diameter d p and flow correlation length scale l f i e l l f 1 l d p 1 w l f 1 w d p 1 such that sufficient flow structure and number of sediment particles are captured in the simulation similarly the fluid and sediment regions must be of sufficient depth h f and h s respectively with h f d p h f h s that the sediment behaviour and flow conditions at the sediment bed are independent of both depths the flow is subjected to a free slip condition at the top of the fluid domain and a no slip condition at the bottom of the fluid domain under these conditions the periodic domain acts as an infinite domain in the lateral directions and the vertical dimensions do not impact the scour process hence the simulation is akin to flow of an infinite depth fluid above a sediment bed of infinite depth under these conditions the flow structure is akin to wall bound turbulence and the far field flow approaches that of homogeneous unbounded turbulence this flow is completely characterised by three dimensionless numbers the relative size of the characteristic sediment particle size to the flow correlation length scale d p l f and the reynolds re and froude fr numbers for a given sediment these parameters only vary in the microscale simulation with the mean flow velocity v which is characterised by the reynolds number as the only other independent variable in these simulations is the concentration of sedimentary particles suspended in the flow ranging from live bed to clear water conditions it is necessary to perform a series of meso scale simulations of scour across a range of reynolds numbers and solids concentrations similarly the dynamics of particles suspended in the flow are governed by the above parameters only and so are unique for a given sediment type suspended solids concentration and reynolds number this study further assumes that the scour of particles embedded in the sediment is governed by the competition between buoyancy viscous frictional and inertial forces such that particles are held in the bed by a combination of buoyant forces and frictional forces from neighbouring particles whilst viscous stresses from the fluid phase and inertial forces imparted from particles impacting the sediment layer act to fluidise particles out of the sediment layer this proposed mechanism assumes that the lift drag and added mass forces on a static particle at the top of the sediment bed are negligible which is justified by the fact that such particles are nearly stationary the computational results in section 4 suggest impact from suspended particles with the sediment bed is a major driver for particle fluidisation hence a scour model is proposed in this study whereby the rate of scour is controlled by the local fluid shear stress and momentum transfer from particle impacts under the assumption assumes that the frictional and buoyancy forces binding sediment particles to the bed are invariant with the flow although the buoyancy forces are constant the inter particle friction in the sediment bed can be recognised to fluctuate with the local fluid pressure field however as these fluctuations are statistically stationary for the meso scale simulation at fixed reynolds number it is valid to quantify a fixed mean scour rate for these flows conversely the impact of a suspended particle with the sediment bed imparts significant kinetic energy to particles in the bed and the dissipation of this energy and redirection of impact momentum is governed by the particle s coefficient of restitution potentially to raising the energy of particles at the top of the bed above the threshold required for fluidisation based on these arguments the local mean scour rate at the top of the sediment bed is quantified in terms of the kinetic energy of particle impacting the sediment bed thus the threshold for scour and the mean local rate of scour beyond this threshold is hypothesized to be a function of the local shear rate and kinetic energy both magnitude and rate imparted to the sediment bed population of the scour function proceeds through the simulation of the meso scale model over long times such that sufficient statistics can be obtained to build up reliable probabilistic models for the scour function application of the scour model to macroscopic cfd simulations then proceeds by running a cfd simulation of the navier stokes equations with suspended particles included to resolve particle collisions with the sediment bed but without resolution of the particle mechanics in the dense sediment bed in this manner dem modelling and coupling to the cfd solver is avoided in the macroscopic simulation and the dynamics of suspended particles are solved via conventional cfd techniques including particle particle interactions and two way coupled particle fluid interactions the sediment bed is modelled as an evolving solid boundary of the computational domain and particle collisions with this boundary are recorded over time and impacting particles are removed from the simulation the local scour rate is then computed from the scour function as a function of particle collision kinetic energy and fluid shear stress and the total scour computed as an integral of this rate over time as scour proceeds new particles are introduced into the simulation local to the scouring region at a rate given by a mass balance with the scour rate allowing particles that have scoured to potentially propagate further scour events downstream when the change in local scour depth of the bed anywhere in the domain exceeds a prescribed threshold the simulation is paused and the boundary corresponding to the sediment bed is updated to the new profile given by the new scour depth the computational domain is then re meshed and the simulation proceeds and this process may be repeated until equilibrium is reached when the local flux of impacting and scoured particles is in balance as dem simulation of the sediment bed comprises the vast majority of the computational overhead in macroscopic cfd dem simulations of scour this approach significantly reduces both the memory and processing requirements of these simulations although this upscaling methodology as described is limited to fluid dynamics involving wall bound homogeneous turbulence the range of applicability of this approach is still very broad in principle if the assumptions regarding the scour mechanism i e that the scour rate is proportional to the local fluid shear stress and kinetic energy of particle impacts hold in the presence of coherent flow structures such as horseshoe vortices around piers then this model can be validly applied to these flow structures however this extension and the underlying assumptions require significant testing for validation and future deployment 4 microscale modelling of scour microscale model adopted in this study consists of a cubic quiescent fluid domain of length 3 cm fig 3 that is half filled with negatively buoyant sediment particles that are allowed to settle to equilibrium this domain is periodic in the lateral directions transverse to the vertical direction with gravity pointing downward such that the model mimics a sediment bed of infinite extent in the lateral directions under the assumptions that the characteristic eddy size and particle size is small enough to render effects of the periodic domain to be negligible scour is then initiated by applying a fixed pressure gradient to the fluid phase in the streamwise direction resulting in fluid flow and possible particle scour the results of this model shall be validated against the experimental study of lyn 1987 which was previously used to validate a two phase model for sand transport in sheet flow regime amoudry et al 2008 the initial particle assembly is generated in edem 2018 2 with streamwise and spanwise periodic boundaries by employing of a random packing algorithm under the condition of dry granular mechanics where hydrodynamic forces are disregarded the sediment particles have similar properties to the sand sample used in the experiment of lyn 1987 the sediment domain is packed with 2237 spherical particles with eight different sizes ranging from 0 1 mm to 0 38 mm resulting in a particle size distribution psd shown in table 1 with a median grain diameter of 0 24 mm and gradation of 1 18 mimicking the values from the experimental study of lyn 1987 although present in the experimental study particle sizes smaller than 0 1 mm were not included in the simulation due to the computational limitations involved with modelling very fine particles other properties of the simulated sand particles have been derived from literature the shear modulus and the friction angle of a well graded loose sand sample have been reported to be 30 80 mpa and 33 respectively carter and bentley 1991 orbzud and truty 2010 these values correspond to a young s modulus of 54 mpa and the coefficient of friction of 0 65 coefficient of friction tan angle of friction the restitution coefficient which defines the rate of energy transfer during a collision event is chosen as the average 0 45 of the restitution coefficients for fine 0 428 medium 0 453 and coarse 0 455 sand grains d wang wang et al 2008 for the flow model periodic conditions were assigned to the spanwise and streamwise directions and the adopted flow depth is the same depth used in the experiment free slip zero shear and the slip wall zero velocity conditions are respectively assigned to the top and bottom boundaries of the flow domain under the assumption that the fluid free surface within the experimental flume is far enough from the sediment bed not to influence the sediment dynamics a range of pressure gradients 100 200 400 pa m is used to drive the flow which generate to depth averaged flow velocities 0 57 0 82 1 07 m s at equilibrium which are all in the turbulent regime with reynolds numbers 2 3e4 3 3e4 4 3e4 the realizable sst k ω turbulence model is employed as it is best suited to the flow regime and domain and the viscous drag model for spherical particles is used based on previous studies zhao and shan 2013 the timestep in the cfd solver is chosen to be at least 10 3 times greater than dem solver timestep to allow resolution of particle collisions within the dem solver the relevant parameters for this model are summarized in table 2 the simulation proceeds until equilibrium is reached at which point the sediment distribution and turbulence structure become statistically stationary this is ensured by monitoring volumetric flow rate bed elevation and bed load within the flow domain until they approach stationarity this microscale model captures the dynamics of both the experimental flume and an infinite sediment bed under the assumption of small variations in the flow and particle statistical properties the continual reinjection of particles over the periodic boundaries corresponds to the so called live bed scour regime in which the flowing water carries suspended sediment particles 4 1 model validation validation of the microscale cfd dem model is performed by comparing the model predictions of the vertical particle concentration profile under equilibrium conditions against the experimental measurements of lyn 1987 the sediment transport regime in the numerical model has also been verified on a sediment transport regime diagram amoudry et al 2008 4 1 1 sediment transport regime prior to perform validation of suspended particle concentration the sediment transport regime in the numerical model is verified to ensure this matches experimental conditions for the purpose of this verification a sediment transport regime diagram fig 5 is constructed using experimental data from the literature amoudry et al 2008 and the well known shields curve that indicates the conditions under which scour of sedimentary particles is initiated shields 1936 and is expressed as a relationship between the critical shield parameter τ c that indicates the onset of scour and the particle reynolds number r e p 12a τ c σ f s 1 ρ f g d p σ f μ f d u z d y 12b r e p d p s 1 g d p υ f where σ f is the local fluid shear stress s is the specific gravity of sediment and u z is the fluid velocity along the direction of the flow the sediment transport regime diagram also identifies regions above the shield curve as two separate zones suspension and no suspension zones török et al 2019 in order to identify the sediment transport regime in the numerical model shields parameter is first computed by identifying the onset of scour in the sediment bed scour onset occurs when the hydrodynamic forces on a particle exceed the buoyancy and contact forces holding a particle in sediment bed a condition termed the threshold of movement this threshold is determined by differentiating continual small amplitude distortions translations and rotations of particles due to evolving contact forces in the sediment bed from large scale motions that are characteristic of scour as such several researchers have tried to derive relationships between the flow condition sediment properties and the threshold of movement some works define the threshold of movement as a condition associated with the bed shear stress below which there is no sediment flux paintal 1971 shields 1936 while others tried to provide more complete explanation of the threshold of movement and proposed a measure to quantify the particle motion kramer 1935 vanoni 1964 the concept of a critical fluid velocity at which scour is initiated has also received some attention some researchers goncharov 1964 define this velocity as the lowest average flow velocity at which individual particles detach from the bed while others proposed a condition based upon the local velocity at the particle level carstens et al 1964 however these studies do not clearly define how particle detachment is defined meaning that the threshold of movement is ill defined and so is a topic of ongoing research buffington and montgomery 1997 dey 2014 a novel method is proposed in this study to identify the threshold of movement in terms of the time averaged translational velocity of particles in the sediment bed to differentiate large scale particle motion from high velocity vibrations in the particle bed particle velocities over several timesteps were averaged the probability density function pdf of this mean particle velocity under turbulent flow conditions r e f 44 067 is plotted in fig 4 indicating the presence of two distinct mean particle populations that correspond to scouring upper and stationary lower particles these two populations are separated by the characteristic velocity vc 0 009 m s which is interpreted as a critical velocity associated with the onset of scour following the identification of this critical velocity critical shields stress via equation 12 a b of particles is determined in the simulation as they reach this velocity and the results are plotted in fig 5 as shown the shields parameter calculated from the simulation data sits above the shield curve meaning that the scour is initiated in this simulation which is in agreement with the experimental data in addition the simulation results correspond to the suspension and no suspension sediment transported shown by the dashed and solid lines in fig 5 4 1 2 suspended particle concentration it is also possible to compare the predicted vertical suspended particle concentration distribution between the microscale cfd dem model and the experimental measurements of lyn 1987 one complication with comparing the computed mean particle concentration with the experimental data lyn 1987 is that this study does not provide the means to determine where the top of the sediment bed lies under quiescent conditions making it difficult to identify a reference height for the experimental and numerical sediment profiles to address this problem the reference level in experiment is derived from the experimental concentration profile data shown in fig 7 and the level associated with the highest concentration which approximately locates at 50 is identified as the reference level of the experiment y0 2 3 mm the numerical particle concentration above this reference level is shown in fig 6 and the experimental and numerical equilibrium particle concentration profiles are compared in fig 7 a reasonable agreement can be observed between the experimental and numerical particle concentration profiles aside from the low concentration part of the profile for y d 30 which is attributed to the very fine particles d p 0 10 mm that are not included in the simulation the experimental and numerical equilibrium velocity profiles are shown in fig 8 which shows excellent agreement between the experiments and numerical simulations providing further validation of the microscale simulations these results demonstrate that the microscale cfd dem model is capable of predicting the scour dynamics to a reasonable level accuracy this model validation provides a suitable level of confidence to use these simulation results to verify the proposed scour mechanisms proposed in section 3 4 1 3 mechanics of scour the mechanisms that govern the scour process are uncovered by examination of the rate of particle collisions with time for each different imposed flow rate fig 9 and the distribution of particle velocities throughout the bed fig 10 fig 9 shows that for all imposed flow rates ranging from 0 57 to 1 07 m s the number of particle collisions increases exponentially with time to a peak value before decaying to a finite value that is less than this peak which corresponds to equilibrium conditions with increasing flow velocity the rate of exponential growth increases along with the height of the peak collision rate while the time required to reach the peak value decreases the initial exponential growth of the collision rate suggests the scour process under live bed conditions is autocatalytic in nature in that when suspended particles impact the sediment bed they tend to cause more particles to scour and become suspended leading to more collisions and further scour this process continues until the number of stationary particles at the top of the bed is too small to support further exponential growth corresponding to the peak in the collision rate the suspended particles then relax towards the equilibrium state which corresponds to a fluidized layer where the flux of particles continually sedimenting onto the top of the bed is balanced by particles that become fluidized due to these particle impacts this mechanism is supported by the particle velocity distributions shown in fig 10 which clearly shows the development of a fluidized equilibrium layer from an initially narrow layer of suspended particles these results clearly demonstrate that particle impacts play a governing role in both initiating and sustaining the scour process previous studies have also shown that the fluid shear stress also plays an important role in controlling scours hence we propose a leading order model to quantify the scour process whereby to leading order the rate of scour is dependent upon the local fluid shear stress and kinetic energy of particle impacts in the following section further illustrations are provided on how this model may be populated by the microscopic simulation data 5 probabilistic scour function the insights gained in the previous section regarding the mechanics of the scour process were used in this section to develop a probabilistic scour function that serves as the basis for the upscaling methodology this function is based on the hypothesis that the local scour rate s m s at the top of the sediment bed is a function of both the local fluid shear stress σ f pa and kinetic energy e k j imparted by particle impacts the basis for this model is justified by fig 11 which shows the evolution of the z coordinate blue for various particles at the top of the sediment bed over time along with the kinetic energy of particle impacts red with the reference particle scour events are denoted by a scour indicator function green which is one of the particles undergoing scour and zero otherwise these plots show that at early times there are few particle collisions as no particles have scoured yet but small scour events occur due to fluid shear alone with increasing time more particle collisions occur due to increasing suspension of particles and these impacts are highly correlated with scour of the reference particles hence the probability of scour is strongly controlled by the fluid shear stress and the kinetic energy imparted by impacting particles at later times n 1000 the number of suspended particles and particle collisions reach a critical state where the entire top layer of the sediment bed becomes fluidized leading to an equilibrium state under these stationary conditions particles are continually deposited on the top of the sediment bed and being resuspended by particle impacts and these mechanisms are in equilibrium these events for the three different applied pressure gradients 100 200 400 pa m500 are then used to determine the probability p s of a scour event occurring as function of the local fluid shear stress and impacting kinetic energy e k as there exist approximately 1000 timesteps prior to fluidisation and there are approximately 80 particles in the top layer of the sediment then across the 3 simulations for each pressure gradient there are 240 000 observations to populate this model the resultant probability distribution p s σ f e k is shown below indicating that as expected the probability of scour increases monotonically with fluid shear stress and kinetic energy of particle impacts for vanishing shear stress and particle collision velocity the probability of scour occurring is zero but at large shear stresses and or collision velocities the probability of scour occurring approaches unity fig 12 this scour probability can then be converted into a scour rate by considering that a scour event occurs over the timestep δ t of the dem simulation and a particle of diameter d p is removed hence the scour rate is then 13 s σ f e k d p δ t p s σ f e k this scour rate can then be employed in macroscopic cfd models with particle tracking as described in section 3 leading to predictions of scour that do not require explicit dem modelling 6 conclusion in this study a microscale coupled cfd dem model is developed to study the mechanism of scour under live bed conditions the cfd dem model is computationally demanding due to the large number of particles and the two very different timescales of cfd and dem models the microscale model with periodic boundary conditions assigned to the inlet outlet boundaries to reproduce an infinite bed of sediment particles has been developed in this study to address the limitations of the coupled cfd dem models and to enable an in depthunderstanding of the interactive behaviour of sediment particles and flowing water in scour process the devised approach has reduced the dimensions of the simulation domain and the number of particles assisting to curtail the computational expenses periodic boundaries also enable replicating live bed regime by including suspended particles carried by the flowing water in numerical simulation the numerical model has been validated against a few experimental data and is shown to be capable of predicting the sediment transport regime as well as the extent of scour the developed microscale cfd dem model can be upscaled in a cfd only model which is less computationally expensive the upscaling allows for simulation of local scour around bridge piers with significant reduction in computational expenses the microscale model would be used to populate a scour rate function for different flow regimes and sediment conditions given the development and population of an appropriate scour rate function from the microscale model this scour rate function can then be employed in the macroscopic cfd simulation with one way particle tracking to predict local scour around bridge pier solely from the flow conditions and particle dynamics kinetic energy through this approach the many body interactions of particles within the sediment bed which account for the bulk of computational overhead are not directly resolved in the macroscopic model but are rather incorporated by the scour rate function which is conditioned by the microscale model thus the developed model is largely beneficial to resolve the ongoing challenge of simulating the complex mechanisms around localised scour in bridge piers data

21138,despite intensive research efforts the accurate modelling and prediction of bridge pier scour is an outstanding challenge due to the complexities arising from the detailed interactions between granular and fluid mechanics in the riverbed pier scour predictions based on empirical formulas are used in conventional bridge design codes which fail to realistically account for these interactions and thus fail to facilitate pier design optimization a critical step towards optimal pier design is an improved physical understanding of detailed mechanisms of the scour process and the development of appropriate modelling techniques to resolve these mechanisms in engineering applications in this study a combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd and discrete element modelling dem is used to improve physical understanding of the scour process including detailed interactions between river hydrodynamics transport of suspended particles and granular mechanics of the riverbed as cfd dem models of turbulent hydrodynamics coupled with densely packed granular assemblies are computationally expensive it is currently not feasible to accurately model scour in macroscopic engineering applications to address this problem we propose a novel upscaling methodology based on highly resolved microscale simulations that significantly reduces the computational overhead facilitating macroscopic prediction of scour under live bed conditions predictions of scour initiation rate and extent from these microscale simulations have been validated against previously published experimental data results indicate that the microscale model is reasonably capable of predicting the scour initiation as well as the equilibrium scour depth this upscaling model provides a viable

collision velocity 1 introduction scouring around the base of bridge pier can lead to the loss of soil support and ultimately the collapse of the bridge structure without prior warning according to available statistics scouring is the most common reason of bridge failure and contributes to more than 60 of bridge failures in the usa l deng and cai 2009 lagasse and richardson 2001 and over 50 of the damage found after recent flood events in australia owen and powers 2014 a survey of road authorities in new zealand showed that more than 70 of annual expenses on scour related bridge damages is related to bridge repairs rather than preventative maintenance or bridge replacement melville and coleman 2000 current methods for scour estimation in almost all bridge design codes involve empirical equations which frequently overpredict the scour depth queensland department of transport and main roads 2013 comparative studies on available empirical design equations showed that these equations predict significantly different values for scour depth under the same flow and sediment conditions sheppard et al 2013 zevenbergen 2010 moreover while these empirical equations are used to estimate the rate of scour these equations cannot account for other qualitative parameters such as the shape of the scour hole and the impact of suspended sediment particles due to inherent limitations of conventional empirical models numerical modelling has attracted attention during past decades which enables an in depth understanding of the mechanisms of bridge pier scour gazi and afzal 2020 x liu and garcía 2008 olsen and kjellesvig 1998 richardson and panchang 1998 roulund et al 2005 sumer 2007 the interest in numerical modelling of pier scour is ever increasing due to the advancement in computing technology including large scale computational resources and sophisticated software tools early attempts regarding numerical estimation of scour around bridge piers involved the development of cfd computational fluid dynamics models for investigation of the time averaged hydrodynamic flow structures around bridge piers without estimation of scour g deng and piquet 1992 subsequent hydrodynamic studies baranya et al 2012 li et al 2017 olsen and melaaen 1993 richardson and panchang 1998 salaheldin et al 2004 tseng et al 2000 have continued to improve resolution of the turbulent flow structure around the pier where horseshoe and wake vortices have been identified as the coherent flow structures which are most responsible for initiation of pier scour recently a mesh updating technique has been implemented in cfd based models to ensure that the interface between flow and sediment bed is updated in each time step and to avoid the assumption on the pattern of the flow field boundary xiong et al 2016 in addition to cfd only models other numerical models which studied the estimation of the scour rate and extent along with the flow field calculation have been proposed the first study to numerically estimate scour in conjunction with the flow field calculation was by olsen and melaaen olsen and melaaen 1993 in that study the fluid shear stress at the top of the sediment bed was calculated from navier stokes simulations of turbulent flow via a k ε turbulence model this bed fluid shear stress was then used to estimate the sediment bed load concentration in the numerical cells closest to the bed the bed elevation change was determined from conservation of sediment mass and the cfd mesh was then updated based on the new bed elevation that is a two phase euler lagrange model in which evolution of the sediment concentration has been evaluated under a lagrangian framework however this approach is limited in that a semi empirical parameterization engelund and fredsøe 1976 is required to estimate the bed load transport rate involving simple assumptions like flow steadiness which are not applicable in a flooded river in addition to euler lagrange models eulerian two phase models have also been developed in which the sediment transport is simulated by including the flow sediment interaction in the flow governing equations cheng and hsu 2014 xiong et al 2016 in eulerian two phase models the flow and sediment are both treated as fluid phases with different viscosities and the volume fraction of each phase is calculated as part of the multiphase calculation as this two phase model treats the particulate phase as a fluid phase with a nominal viscosity this model fails to capture the granular particle interactions in both the fluid bulk and the sediment bed although eulerian two phase models are shown to have some advantages over conventional semi empirical models such continuum models do not resolve the discrete granular nature of the sediment particles that is dominated by both the collisions and frictional forces between particles which are central to prediction of scour as such continuum models for the particulate phase are not capable of properly resolving the granular mechanics of the riverbed and hence cannot reliably predict the scouring process to properly resolve these particle particle interactions that are critical to the prediction of bridge pier scour discrete element modelling dem with cfd methods are coupled in this study to understand the mechanisms that govern scour of sediments a two way coupled cfd dem model is used to account for both particle particle and particle fluid interactions in the system this numerical modelling technique directly resolves the strong coupling between the river hydrodynamics suspended particles in the open channel flow and the granular mechanics of the riverbed itself such coupled cfd dem models have previously been applied to a wide range of gas solid and liquid solid flow applications including fluidized beds d liu bu and chen 2013 conical sand piling in water zhao and shan 2013 seepage induced erosion xiao and wang 2020 and solid liquid mixing systems garg et al 2012 wu et al 2018 also the cfd dem methodology has been used to study sediment transport problems such as near shore sheet flow sediment transport calantoni et al 2004 drake and calantoni 2001 sediment transport around subsea pipelines zhang et al 2015 and sediment transport in open channel flow kidanemariam and uhlmann 2017 to resolve the interactions between flow and sediment particles however there are some challenges involved in the application of cfd dem methodology for sediment transport problems the sediment transport occurs in a thin boundary layer necessitating a fine cfd mesh to resolve the viscous boundary layer at the same time the dem method requires the particle size to be everywhere smaller than the cfd mesh size in order to facilitate of mapping the discrete phase properties into eulerian phase mesh and to avoid numerical instabilities hence simulation of large particles becomes a challenge which requires a robust algorithm to satisfy both limitations in addition the number of particles involved in sediment transport applications can be in the order of 106 which is larger than the number of particles involved in other applications of cfd dem model sun and xiao 2016 despite significant research efforts regarding cfd dem modelling of sediment transport applications studies on local scour around bridge piers using cfd dem model are still quite limited li et al li and tao 2018 have undertaken the first cfd dem modelling of bridge pier scour under clear water conditions i e where the inflowing fluid in the model is devoid of suspended particles this clear water condition is quite rare under typical river flow conditions in contrast most scour events involve so called live bed conditions where the inflowing water carries a significant load of suspended sediment particles these suspended particles play an important role in the initiation rate and extent of pier scour and so must be accounted for in numerical modelling of bridge pier scour in this paper a novel upscaling methodology is proposed to facilitate prediction of scour in macroscopic applications this methodology involves employ of a coupled cfd dem model to study the microscale mechanism of scour under live bed conditions over a range of flow rates the results of these simulations for a given sediment type then facilitates population of probabilistic model for particle scour based upon local flow conditions and the impact of suspended particles this scour model can then be employed in macroscopic cfd models for scour that only require tracking of suspended particles rather than dem of the sediment bed the source of the major of the computational overhead for coupled cfd dem models thus this upscaling methodology represents a viable technique to predict macroscopic scour using only modest computational resources the microscale model involves simulation of a bed of sediment particles under live bed conditions with periodic lateral boundary conditions over a range of applied flow rates this model explores the microscale mechanisms of scour within the sediment bed under live bed conditions facilitating the development of a probabilistic phenomenological model for scour that is based on these observations microscale simulations are then used to populate this model and describe how this model can be used to model rate and extent of scour rate as a function of local flow conditions and particle impacts in macroscopic cfd simulations the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the coupled cfd dem model and coupling algorithm including discussion of the computational overhead of this approach section 3 describes the upscaling methodology to circumvent these overheads and outlines the microscale model and scour function that forms the basis of this methodology subsequently the coupling algorithm and the microscale model are described in section 4 the results obtained from the microscale model are validated against experimental data reported in literature and the detailed scour mechanism is uncovered in section 5 these insights are used to develop a probabilistic scour model which is subsequently populated from the microscale simulations and application to macroscopic simulations is discussed conclusions and outstanding research challenges are discussed in section 6 2 model formulation the cfd dem framework is based upon continuum eulerian and discrete lagrangian models for the fluid and particle phases respectively this methodology facilitates modelling of the interactions between these two phases via an exchange of interparticle forces that are computed from independent cfd and dem solvers in this section a brief description of the individual cfd and dem solvers is provided before describing the coupling algorithm that is used to quantify the interactions 2 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd model scour of sediment beds is governed by a combination of turbulent flow coupled with discrete particles in open channels above the sediment bed and porous media flow in the hyporheic zone through the sediment bed itself the turbulent sediment laden flow is resolved via a modified navier stokes equation incorporating the effect of discrete particles the modified equation to resolve the multiphase flow with discrete particles is shown below including a mass balance equation 1a and a momentum conservation equation 1b li and tao 2018 1a α f ρ f t α f ρ f u f 0 1b α f ρ f u f t α f ρ f u f u f α f p α f σ f α f ρ f g f p where u f is the flow velocity α f is the fluid volume fraction incorporating the volume taken by particles ρ f is the fluid density p is the flow pressure intensity σ f is the local fluid shear stress and f p represents the interaction force between fluid and particle phases that comprises of viscous drag buoyancy lift and added mass forces these forces are described in detail in section 2 1 1 to resolve the sediment laden hydrodynamics the finite volume cfd package fluent 17 is employed in the current study this solver employs a structured computational mesh with 2nd order spatial and 1st order temporal discretization the simple algorithm is used in order to minimize rhie chow errors associated with the enforcement of incompressible flow fluent manual 2005 the selection of an appropriate turbulence closure model to be implemented in rans equation is an important modelling consideration there are different turbulence models used to model the unsteady fluctuating component of the flow including the standard shear stress transport stress transport sst k ω k ε and reynolds stress models each turbulence model employs a specific near wall treatment method to account for the transition profile near the wall and to resolve the rapid variation of flow variables over this boundary layer low reynolds number turbulence models such as sst k ω aim to resolve the entire turbulent boundary layer and thus require a high resolution boundary mesh with dimensionless wall distance y 1 to ensure that near wall regions are resolved accurately this requirement can impose a significant computational overhead and can adversely impact solver convergence conversely wall function turbulence models such as k ε use semi empirical expressions which require a significantly lower mesh resolution y 11 however these models can slightly over estimate the fluid velocity near the bed salaheldin et al 2004 the reynolds stress turbulence model accounts for the effect of rapid changing flows by solving transport equations for turbulence parameters together with an equation for the dissipation rate this significantly increases computational overhead and for less complex flow regimes such as those around bridge piers does not yield predictions which are superior to simpler models such as sst k ε and k ω models in this study sst k ω turbulence model was selected over the sst k ε model as it provides superior resolution of the turbulent boundary layer which is critical to scour prediction the sst k ω model originated from the wilcox k ω model wilcox 1998 resolves the reynolds stresses via two equations for k kinetic energy and ω energy dissipation rates in a multiphase flow ansys 2013 although there exist dedicated turbulence models for particle laden flows such as one way and two way coupled k ε models for particle eddy interactions these models are still very much in the developmental stages and presently there is not yet a widely accepted set of turbulence closures for solid liquid multiphase flows ebrahimi and crapper 2017 li and tao 2018 s wang et al 2019 as these closures develop further extension of the cfd dem model used in this study to incorporate such effects would be an interesting development but such models are beyond the scope of this study 2 1 1 hydrodynamic forces on particles the flows computed in both the open river and through the sediment bed impart forces on sediment particles including viscous drag lift and virtual mass forces as shown in fig 1 the viscous drag force f d acts in the opposite direction to the relative velocity between the sediment particle and surrounding fluid and is highly dependent on the shape of the particle the drag force is computed as 2 f d 18 μ f c d r e p ρ p d p 2 24 u f u p where u f is the fluid velocity u p is particle velocity c d is the drag coefficient ρ p the particle density d p the particle diameter μ f molecular viscosity of the fluid and r e p the particle reynolds number the drag coefficient for smooth spherical particles is 3 c d a 1 a 2 r e p a 3 re p 2 where a 1 and a 2 are dimensionless constants that apply over several ranges of reynolds numbers morsi and alexander 1972 for non spherical particles haider and levenspiel haider and levenspiel 1989 developed the following drag coefficient 4 c d 24 re sph 1 b 1 re sph b 2 b 3 re sph b 4 re sph where b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are constants which are functions of particle shape factor and re sph which is the particle reynolds number for a spherical particle having the same volume lift forces f l act perpendicular to the direction of flow and originate from asymmetry in the shear stress distribution over the surface of the particle as 5 f l c l ρ f a p u f u p u f where c l is the lift coefficient ρ f is the fluid density and a p is the projected area of the particle surface in most cases the lift force is insignificant as compared to the drag force except in cases where the two phases separate quickly the buoyancy force f b due to the difference between the solid particle density ρ p and the fluid density ρ f is f b α p ρ p ρ f g where α p is the particle volume fraction and g is the gravitational acceleration vector the virtual mass or added mass force f v m is the inertia added to the fluid phase due to acceleration of the small volume of fluid surrounding accelerating particles the virtual mass force is given as 6 f v m ρ f v p 2 d u f d t d u p d t where d d t is the material derivative for the fluid phase and d d t is the material derivative for the particle phase typically the added mass force is significant only in cases where the secondary phase density is much smaller than the primary phase density eg two phase model of bubble columns in this study the viscous drag buoyancy virtual mass and the lift forces are incorporated in the cfd dem model these hydrodynamic forces are incorporated in the interphase momentum transfer term f p in equation 1 b defined as 7 f p f d f b f l f v m which represents the interaction force between the flow and particle phases all these hydrodynamic forces are calculated in each cfd mesh cell and transferred to the dem solver to be mapped onto discrete particles 2 2 discrete element method dem approach the discrete element method dem is a well established lagrangian modelling technique that was originally developed by cundall and strack 1979 to simulate the mechanics of granular assemblies this is a newtonian method that evolves the position and orientation of discrete granular elements such as sediment particles based on applied forces and torques that arise from the surrounding fluid hydrodynamic forces neighbouring particles contact forces and externally applied force fields such gravitational brownian electrostatic and magnetic forces as 8 d m p u p d t f p f n f t here f p f n f t respectively are the interphase hydrodynamic and normal and tangential contact forces and m p is the particle mass newton s second law of motion is encoded via equation 8 for the linear and angular velocity of each particle from which the particle position and orientation is updated in the following subsection the contact models used to compute force transmission between particles in the dem mode are described 2 2 1 contact models the contact model defines how normal and tangential frictional forces are transmitted between particles when they come into contact the simplest normal contact model is the hertzian contact model which involves a linear elastic model for the normal force f n as a linear function of the normal displacement δ n overlap of particles and the frictional force f t is then proportional to the normal force fig 2 as 9a f n k n δ n 9b f t μ f n where μ is the columb friction coefficient and k n is particle stiffness which is given as 10 k n 4 β e r e f f r e f f r i j r i r j where β is a scaling parameter r i and r j are the respective particles radii r e f f is the effective radius and e is the young s modulus nosewicz et al 2017 rojek et al 2012 these linear elastic models are relatively simple and efficient to predict the particle behaviour in granular flows however they require precise determination of the linear model parameters which is often difficult to achieve in practice for accurate prediction of contact behaviour in systems with dynamic evolution of forces and displacements such as sediment transport systems a more sophisticated approach involving nonlinear models is required di renzo and di maio 2004 in this study a non linear hertz mindlin contact model is employed that involves a nonlinear relationship between normal force and normal displacement as 11 f n 4 3 e e f f r e f f δ n 3 2 1 e e f f 1 ϑ i 2 e i 1 ϑ j 2 e j where e i and e j are the young s moduli and ϑ i and ϑ j are the poisson s ratios of particles i and j respectively this model ensures an accurate prediction of contact dynamics between sediment particles and thus the accurate prediction of scour dynamics 2 3 coupling algorithm the coupling algorithm lies at the heart of the coupled cfd dem method and allows the two way exchange of interparticle forces between the fluid cfd and solid dem solvers physically coupling the sediment and fluid phases two commercial software packages were employed ansys fluent 17 and edem 2018 2 as cfd and dem solvers respectively which are then linked via a coupling interface the coupling interface implements an explicit time integration method to facilitate two way coupling between fluid and particle phases via the exchange of the interphase forces between the cfd and dem solvers 2 4 limitations of coupled cfd dem models coupled cfd dem models are able to fully resolve the mechanisms of scour as the particle particle dynamics are fully resolved and coupled with the river hydrodynamics in this model however the application of cfd dem to scour prediction has been limited due to the excessive computational overhead nabi et al 2013 this computational overhead quickly becomes prohibitive for the large number of particles typically 105 or greater required for a full scale simulation of pier scour in which the length scale of the characteristic pier diameter of the order of meters is much larger than that of the sediment particle diameter of the order of 100 μm in addition the fine spatial mesh required to resolve the turbulent boundary layer around the pier enforces a highly restrictive computational timestep due to the courant freidricks levy cfl condition also the fine meshing around the pier poses a restriction linked to the major limitation of cfd dem model the smallest cell volume of the cfd mesh is required to be larger than the volume of the biggest solid particle so that each solid particle could be mapped within one fluid cell moreover simulation of the scour process involves resolution of two different time scales for turbulent flows the hydrodynamics evolve with respect to the eddy turnover time t e typically of the order of 10 3s while the particle dynamics evolve with respect to the particle collision time t p which is at least 10 3 times smaller than t e in addition pier scour evolves toward the equilibrium state on the order of hours thus requiring a prohibitive number of timesteps to simulate the scour process towards the equilibrium state even with large scale computing resources state of the art numerical models have only modelled the full scour process for a few minutes xiong et al 2016 this computational overhead is a current roadblock to fully resolved numerical modelling of scour in macroscopic engineering applications such as pier scour 3 a novel upscaling methodology for scour prediction as fully resolved computations of coupled cfd dem for scour modelling is unfeasible in many applications an upscaling methodology is essential for prediction of scour under particular regimes of particle mechanics and hydrodynamics sediment scour is a process that involves multiple length and time scales and so spans a wide range of dynamical regimes that vary significantly with application although it is not possible to develop a well conditioned upscaling model that spans all of these regimes it is possible to develop such a methodology that is valid over a limited set of regimes relevant to scour 3 1 upscaling framework and approach the upscaling methodology is based upon the concept of performing detailed cfd dem simulations of scour in homogeneous turbulent flow in an unbounded microscopic domain and then using these simulation results in an upscaled cfd model to predict macroscopic scour upscaling is performed via a scour function where the local rate of scour in the macroscopic cfd model is computed from the local fluid and particle variables this scour function is populated by the microscale cfd dem simulations which model the rate of scour as a function of the above local variables under the assumptions outlined below this scour function is specific to a particular sediment assembly in that sediments with different particle size shape or density distributions possess unique scour functions and so must be re calculated when a new sediment assembly is under consideration the basic upscaling philosophy is that the microscale cfd dem model that populates the scour function is significantly faster and more feasible to compute than a fully coupled macroscopic cfd dem model and the macroscopic cfd model is also significantly faster to compute using this scour function as the dem solver nor the coupling algorithm is required the microscale simulations comprise of modelling a particle laden turbulent flow over an unbounded sediment bed where the number of suspended particles is varied to mimic a range of flow scenarios from clear water particle free to live bed particle laden conditions these simulations are performed in a domain that is spatially periodic in the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the mean flow direction and of sufficient dimensions length l and width w which are many multiples of the characteristic sediment particle diameter d p and flow correlation length scale l f i e l l f 1 l d p 1 w l f 1 w d p 1 such that sufficient flow structure and number of sediment particles are captured in the simulation similarly the fluid and sediment regions must be of sufficient depth h f and h s respectively with h f d p h f h s that the sediment behaviour and flow conditions at the sediment bed are independent of both depths the flow is subjected to a free slip condition at the top of the fluid domain and a no slip condition at the bottom of the fluid domain under these conditions the periodic domain acts as an infinite domain in the lateral directions and the vertical dimensions do not impact the scour process hence the simulation is akin to flow of an infinite depth fluid above a sediment bed of infinite depth under these conditions the flow structure is akin to wall bound turbulence and the far field flow approaches that of homogeneous unbounded turbulence this flow is completely characterised by three dimensionless numbers the relative size of the characteristic sediment particle size to the flow correlation length scale d p l f and the reynolds re and froude fr numbers for a given sediment these parameters only vary in the microscale simulation with the mean flow velocity v which is characterised by the reynolds number as the only other independent variable in these simulations is the concentration of sedimentary particles suspended in the flow ranging from live bed to clear water conditions it is necessary to perform a series of meso scale simulations of scour across a range of reynolds numbers and solids concentrations similarly the dynamics of particles suspended in the flow are governed by the above parameters only and so are unique for a given sediment type suspended solids concentration and reynolds number this study further assumes that the scour of particles embedded in the sediment is governed by the competition between buoyancy viscous frictional and inertial forces such that particles are held in the bed by a combination of buoyant forces and frictional forces from neighbouring particles whilst viscous stresses from the fluid phase and inertial forces imparted from particles impacting the sediment layer act to fluidise particles out of the sediment layer this proposed mechanism assumes that the lift drag and added mass forces on a static particle at the top of the sediment bed are negligible which is justified by the fact that such particles are nearly stationary the computational results in section 4 suggest impact from suspended particles with the sediment bed is a major driver for particle fluidisation hence a scour model is proposed in this study whereby the rate of scour is controlled by the local fluid shear stress and momentum transfer from particle impacts under the assumption assumes that the frictional and buoyancy forces binding sediment particles to the bed are invariant with the flow although the buoyancy forces are constant the inter particle friction in the sediment bed can be recognised to fluctuate with the local fluid pressure field however as these fluctuations are statistically stationary for the meso scale simulation at fixed reynolds number it is valid to quantify a fixed mean scour rate for these flows conversely the impact of a suspended particle with the sediment bed imparts significant kinetic energy to particles in the bed and the dissipation of this energy and redirection of impact momentum is governed by the particle s coefficient of restitution potentially to raising the energy of particles at the top of the bed above the threshold required for fluidisation based on these arguments the local mean scour rate at the top of the sediment bed is quantified in terms of the kinetic energy of particle impacting the sediment bed thus the threshold for scour and the mean local rate of scour beyond this threshold is hypothesized to be a function of the local shear rate and kinetic energy both magnitude and rate imparted to the sediment bed population of the scour function proceeds through the simulation of the meso scale model over long times such that sufficient statistics can be obtained to build up reliable probabilistic models for the scour function application of the scour model to macroscopic cfd simulations then proceeds by running a cfd simulation of the navier stokes equations with suspended particles included to resolve particle collisions with the sediment bed but without resolution of the particle mechanics in the dense sediment bed in this manner dem modelling and coupling to the cfd solver is avoided in the macroscopic simulation and the dynamics of suspended particles are solved via conventional cfd techniques including particle particle interactions and two way coupled particle fluid interactions the sediment bed is modelled as an evolving solid boundary of the computational domain and particle collisions with this boundary are recorded over time and impacting particles are removed from the simulation the local scour rate is then computed from the scour function as a function of particle collision kinetic energy and fluid shear stress and the total scour computed as an integral of this rate over time as scour proceeds new particles are introduced into the simulation local to the scouring region at a rate given by a mass balance with the scour rate allowing particles that have scoured to potentially propagate further scour events downstream when the change in local scour depth of the bed anywhere in the domain exceeds a prescribed threshold the simulation is paused and the boundary corresponding to the sediment bed is updated to the new profile given by the new scour depth the computational domain is then re meshed and the simulation proceeds and this process may be repeated until equilibrium is reached when the local flux of impacting and scoured particles is in balance as dem simulation of the sediment bed comprises the vast majority of the computational overhead in macroscopic cfd dem simulations of scour this approach significantly reduces both the memory and processing requirements of these simulations although this upscaling methodology as described is limited to fluid dynamics involving wall bound homogeneous turbulence the range of applicability of this approach is still very broad in principle if the assumptions regarding the scour mechanism i e that the scour rate is proportional to the local fluid shear stress and kinetic energy of particle impacts hold in the presence of coherent flow structures such as horseshoe vortices around piers then this model can be validly applied to these flow structures however this extension and the underlying assumptions require significant testing for validation and future deployment 4 microscale modelling of scour microscale model adopted in this study consists of a cubic quiescent fluid domain of length 3 cm fig 3 that is half filled with negatively buoyant sediment particles that are allowed to settle to equilibrium this domain is periodic in the lateral directions transverse to the vertical direction with gravity pointing downward such that the model mimics a sediment bed of infinite extent in the lateral directions under the assumptions that the characteristic eddy size and particle size is small enough to render effects of the periodic domain to be negligible scour is then initiated by applying a fixed pressure gradient to the fluid phase in the streamwise direction resulting in fluid flow and possible particle scour the results of this model shall be validated against the experimental study of lyn 1987 which was previously used to validate a two phase model for sand transport in sheet flow regime amoudry et al 2008 the initial particle assembly is generated in edem 2018 2 with streamwise and spanwise periodic boundaries by employing of a random packing algorithm under the condition of dry granular mechanics where hydrodynamic forces are disregarded the sediment particles have similar properties to the sand sample used in the experiment of lyn 1987 the sediment domain is packed with 2237 spherical particles with eight different sizes ranging from 0 1 mm to 0 38 mm resulting in a particle size distribution psd shown in table 1 with a median grain diameter of 0 24 mm and gradation of 1 18 mimicking the values from the experimental study of lyn 1987 although present in the experimental study particle sizes smaller than 0 1 mm were not included in the simulation due to the computational limitations involved with modelling very fine particles other properties of the simulated sand particles have been derived from literature the shear modulus and the friction angle of a well graded loose sand sample have been reported to be 30 80 mpa and 33 respectively carter and bentley 1991 orbzud and truty 2010 these values correspond to a young s modulus of 54 mpa and the coefficient of friction of 0 65 coefficient of friction tan angle of friction the restitution coefficient which defines the rate of energy transfer during a collision event is chosen as the average 0 45 of the restitution coefficients for fine 0 428 medium 0 453 and coarse 0 455 sand grains d wang wang et al 2008 for the flow model periodic conditions were assigned to the spanwise and streamwise directions and the adopted flow depth is the same depth used in the experiment free slip zero shear and the slip wall zero velocity conditions are respectively assigned to the top and bottom boundaries of the flow domain under the assumption that the fluid free surface within the experimental flume is far enough from the sediment bed not to influence the sediment dynamics a range of pressure gradients 100 200 400 pa m is used to drive the flow which generate to depth averaged flow velocities 0 57 0 82 1 07 m s at equilibrium which are all in the turbulent regime with reynolds numbers 2 3e4 3 3e4 4 3e4 the realizable sst k ω turbulence model is employed as it is best suited to the flow regime and domain and the viscous drag model for spherical particles is used based on previous studies zhao and shan 2013 the timestep in the cfd solver is chosen to be at least 10 3 times greater than dem solver timestep to allow resolution of particle collisions within the dem solver the relevant parameters for this model are summarized in table 2 the simulation proceeds until equilibrium is reached at which point the sediment distribution and turbulence structure become statistically stationary this is ensured by monitoring volumetric flow rate bed elevation and bed load within the flow domain until they approach stationarity this microscale model captures the dynamics of both the experimental flume and an infinite sediment bed under the assumption of small variations in the flow and particle statistical properties the continual reinjection of particles over the periodic boundaries corresponds to the so called live bed scour regime in which the flowing water carries suspended sediment particles 4 1 model validation validation of the microscale cfd dem model is performed by comparing the model predictions of the vertical particle concentration profile under equilibrium conditions against the experimental measurements of lyn 1987 the sediment transport regime in the numerical model has also been verified on a sediment transport regime diagram amoudry et al 2008 4 1 1 sediment transport regime prior to perform validation of suspended particle concentration the sediment transport regime in the numerical model is verified to ensure this matches experimental conditions for the purpose of this verification a sediment transport regime diagram fig 5 is constructed using experimental data from the literature amoudry et al 2008 and the well known shields curve that indicates the conditions under which scour of sedimentary particles is initiated shields 1936 and is expressed as a relationship between the critical shield parameter τ c that indicates the onset of scour and the particle reynolds number r e p 12a τ c σ f s 1 ρ f g d p σ f μ f d u z d y 12b r e p d p s 1 g d p υ f where σ f is the local fluid shear stress s is the specific gravity of sediment and u z is the fluid velocity along the direction of the flow the sediment transport regime diagram also identifies regions above the shield curve as two separate zones suspension and no suspension zones török et al 2019 in order to identify the sediment transport regime in the numerical model shields parameter is first computed by identifying the onset of scour in the sediment bed scour onset occurs when the hydrodynamic forces on a particle exceed the buoyancy and contact forces holding a particle in sediment bed a condition termed the threshold of movement this threshold is determined by differentiating continual small amplitude distortions translations and rotations of particles due to evolving contact forces in the sediment bed from large scale motions that are characteristic of scour as such several researchers have tried to derive relationships between the flow condition sediment properties and the threshold of movement some works define the threshold of movement as a condition associated with the bed shear stress below which there is no sediment flux paintal 1971 shields 1936 while others tried to provide more complete explanation of the threshold of movement and proposed a measure to quantify the particle motion kramer 1935 vanoni 1964 the concept of a critical fluid velocity at which scour is initiated has also received some attention some researchers goncharov 1964 define this velocity as the lowest average flow velocity at which individual particles detach from the bed while others proposed a condition based upon the local velocity at the particle level carstens et al 1964 however these studies do not clearly define how particle detachment is defined meaning that the threshold of movement is ill defined and so is a topic of ongoing research buffington and montgomery 1997 dey 2014 a novel method is proposed in this study to identify the threshold of movement in terms of the time averaged translational velocity of particles in the sediment bed to differentiate large scale particle motion from high velocity vibrations in the particle bed particle velocities over several timesteps were averaged the probability density function pdf of this mean particle velocity under turbulent flow conditions r e f 44 067 is plotted in fig 4 indicating the presence of two distinct mean particle populations that correspond to scouring upper and stationary lower particles these two populations are separated by the characteristic velocity vc 0 009 m s which is interpreted as a critical velocity associated with the onset of scour following the identification of this critical velocity critical shields stress via equation 12 a b of particles is determined in the simulation as they reach this velocity and the results are plotted in fig 5 as shown the shields parameter calculated from the simulation data sits above the shield curve meaning that the scour is initiated in this simulation which is in agreement with the experimental data in addition the simulation results correspond to the suspension and no suspension sediment transported shown by the dashed and solid lines in fig 5 4 1 2 suspended particle concentration it is also possible to compare the predicted vertical suspended particle concentration distribution between the microscale cfd dem model and the experimental measurements of lyn 1987 one complication with comparing the computed mean particle concentration with the experimental data lyn 1987 is that this study does not provide the means to determine where the top of the sediment bed lies under quiescent conditions making it difficult to identify a reference height for the experimental and numerical sediment profiles to address this problem the reference level in experiment is derived from the experimental concentration profile data shown in fig 7 and the level associated with the highest concentration which approximately locates at 50 is identified as the reference level of the experiment y0 2 3 mm the numerical particle concentration above this reference level is shown in fig 6 and the experimental and numerical equilibrium particle concentration profiles are compared in fig 7 a reasonable agreement can be observed between the experimental and numerical particle concentration profiles aside from the low concentration part of the profile for y d 30 which is attributed to the very fine particles d p 0 10 mm that are not included in the simulation the experimental and numerical equilibrium velocity profiles are shown in fig 8 which shows excellent agreement between the experiments and numerical simulations providing further validation of the microscale simulations these results demonstrate that the microscale cfd dem model is capable of predicting the scour dynamics to a reasonable level accuracy this model validation provides a suitable level of confidence to use these simulation results to verify the proposed scour mechanisms proposed in section 3 4 1 3 mechanics of scour the mechanisms that govern the scour process are uncovered by examination of the rate of particle collisions with time for each different imposed flow rate fig 9 and the distribution of particle velocities throughout the bed fig 10 fig 9 shows that for all imposed flow rates ranging from 0 57 to 1 07 m s the number of particle collisions increases exponentially with time to a peak value before decaying to a finite value that is less than this peak which corresponds to equilibrium conditions with increasing flow velocity the rate of exponential growth increases along with the height of the peak collision rate while the time required to reach the peak value decreases the initial exponential growth of the collision rate suggests the scour process under live bed conditions is autocatalytic in nature in that when suspended particles impact the sediment bed they tend to cause more particles to scour and become suspended leading to more collisions and further scour this process continues until the number of stationary particles at the top of the bed is too small to support further exponential growth corresponding to the peak in the collision rate the suspended particles then relax towards the equilibrium state which corresponds to a fluidized layer where the flux of particles continually sedimenting onto the top of the bed is balanced by particles that become fluidized due to these particle impacts this mechanism is supported by the particle velocity distributions shown in fig 10 which clearly shows the development of a fluidized equilibrium layer from an initially narrow layer of suspended particles these results clearly demonstrate that particle impacts play a governing role in both initiating and sustaining the scour process previous studies have also shown that the fluid shear stress also plays an important role in controlling scours hence we propose a leading order model to quantify the scour process whereby to leading order the rate of scour is dependent upon the local fluid shear stress and kinetic energy of particle impacts in the following section further illustrations are provided on how this model may be populated by the microscopic simulation data 5 probabilistic scour function the insights gained in the previous section regarding the mechanics of the scour process were used in this section to develop a probabilistic scour function that serves as the basis for the upscaling methodology this function is based on the hypothesis that the local scour rate s m s at the top of the sediment bed is a function of both the local fluid shear stress σ f pa and kinetic energy e k j imparted by particle impacts the basis for this model is justified by fig 11 which shows the evolution of the z coordinate blue for various particles at the top of the sediment bed over time along with the kinetic energy of particle impacts red with the reference particle scour events are denoted by a scour indicator function green which is one of the particles undergoing scour and zero otherwise these plots show that at early times there are few particle collisions as no particles have scoured yet but small scour events occur due to fluid shear alone with increasing time more particle collisions occur due to increasing suspension of particles and these impacts are highly correlated with scour of the reference particles hence the probability of scour is strongly controlled by the fluid shear stress and the kinetic energy imparted by impacting particles at later times n 1000 the number of suspended particles and particle collisions reach a critical state where the entire top layer of the sediment bed becomes fluidized leading to an equilibrium state under these stationary conditions particles are continually deposited on the top of the sediment bed and being resuspended by particle impacts and these mechanisms are in equilibrium these events for the three different applied pressure gradients 100 200 400 pa m500 are then used to determine the probability p s of a scour event occurring as function of the local fluid shear stress and impacting kinetic energy e k as there exist approximately 1000 timesteps prior to fluidisation and there are approximately 80 particles in the top layer of the sediment then across the 3 simulations for each pressure gradient there are 240 000 observations to populate this model the resultant probability distribution p s σ f e k is shown below indicating that as expected the probability of scour increases monotonically with fluid shear stress and kinetic energy of particle impacts for vanishing shear stress and particle collision velocity the probability of scour occurring is zero but at large shear stresses and or collision velocities the probability of scour occurring approaches unity fig 12 this scour probability can then be converted into a scour rate by considering that a scour event occurs over the timestep δ t of the dem simulation and a particle of diameter d p is removed hence the scour rate is then 13 s σ f e k d p δ t p s σ f e k this scour rate can then be employed in macroscopic cfd models with particle tracking as described in section 3 leading to predictions of scour that do not require explicit dem modelling 6 conclusion in this study a microscale coupled cfd dem model is developed to study the mechanism of scour under live bed conditions the cfd dem model is computationally demanding due to the large number of particles and the two very different timescales of cfd and dem models the microscale model with periodic boundary conditions assigned to the inlet outlet boundaries to reproduce an infinite bed of sediment particles has been developed in this study to address the limitations of the coupled cfd dem models and to enable an in depthunderstanding of the interactive behaviour of sediment particles and flowing water in scour process the devised approach has reduced the dimensions of the simulation domain and the number of particles assisting to curtail the computational expenses periodic boundaries also enable replicating live bed regime by including suspended particles carried by the flowing water in numerical simulation the numerical model has been validated against a few experimental data and is shown to be capable of predicting the sediment transport regime as well as the extent of scour the developed microscale cfd dem model can be upscaled in a cfd only model which is less computationally expensive the upscaling allows for simulation of local scour around bridge piers with significant reduction in computational expenses the microscale model would be used to populate a scour rate function for different flow regimes and sediment conditions given the development and population of an appropriate scour rate function from the microscale model this scour rate function can then be employed in the macroscopic cfd simulation with one way particle tracking to predict local scour around bridge pier solely from the flow conditions and particle dynamics kinetic energy through this approach the many body interactions of particles within the sediment bed which account for the bulk of computational overhead are not directly resolved in the macroscopic model but are rather incorporated by the scour rate function which is conditioned by the microscale model thus the developed model is largely beneficial to resolve the ongoing challenge of simulating the complex mechanisms around localised scour in bridge piers data

21139,the goal of this investigation is to study the effect of air injection on the wake development as a widely commercial product airfoil cfj0025 131 196 is selected and the profiles for velocity deficit wake profiles for different attack angles and profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase are found for the air jet velocity the values of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 are examined while angles of attack are adjusted to 0 6 and 14 the main flow speed is 10 m s 1 it is found that when the dimensionless distance from the trailing edge goes up the velocity deficit has a downward trend furthermore the higher jet velocity is the smoother the velocity deficit profile becomes in addition in a constant dimensionless distance increasing the angle of attack results in growing the amplitude of the dimensionless velocity profile the results also reveal that the location at which the velocity starts to increase moves down by the increase in the air jet velocity having a broad knowledge about the wake development of an airfoil will help to know its performance better and find more suitable ways to enhance its performance keywords air injection aerodynamics angle of attack experiments on airfoil velocity profile wake development 1 introduction technology is being developed to fulfill a variety of demands human beings have in the various aspects sohani and sayyaadi 2020a hoseinzadeh et al 13405 sohani and sayyaadi 2020b sohani et al 2021 sohani et al 2020a and as two major parts the need for travel and generating more electricity are absorbing a huge attention with a rapid pace ajmi et al 2020 meriem et al 2020 kostas et al 2020 siddiqui et al 2020 airfoils were created by inspiring from nature naderi and torabi 2017 naderi et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and have occupied a significant role in both mentioned industries molina et al 2020 goetten et al 2217 sun et al 2020 therefore knowing and improving their performance is very important and several researchers have carried out different investigations for these purposes although numerical modeling provides valuable information from the system performance ghasemi et al 2020 hoseinzadeh et al 2019a 2019b hoseinzadeh and heyns 2020 like other fields of knowledge the most accurate condition is obtained when the results of experiments are analyzed sohani and sayyaadi 2020c sohani et al 2020b 2020c ghalambaz et al 2019 and considering this point a number of studies have tried to conduct experiments to investigate the performance of airfoils during the recent years lefebvre and jones 2019 conducted experiments to find the behavior of an airfoil under the condition of having the wake of a circular type of cylinder gardner and richter 2020 also employed an experimental approach to investigate the impacts of sidewall connection for an airfoil in two static and dynamic conditions in another study lou et al 2020 used both experimental and numerical methods to determine the performance of an airfoil after a rotary cylinder in that study the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca 4418 airfoil was chosen while a flow control strategy was proposed at the end moreover kiefer et al 2019 studied different conditions for pitching motion by doing several experiments they determined the dynamic stall impacts under circumstances in which the reynolds number was high bartl et al performed various investigations in the references bartl et al 2018 bartl et al 2019 and bartl et al 2020 to uncover the effect of wake on some operating parameters of wind turbines including tip vortex interaction using experimental approach an airfoil was considered by shimomura et al 2020 and by employing deep reinforcement learning a closed loop flow control system was presented additionally liu et al 2020 employed experiments in the unsteady condition to determine the impacts of ice roughness on the performance of an airfoil of a wind turbine for oscillating airfoil that absorbs energy siala et al 2020 took advantage of experiments and found the impacts of inertia induced flexibility of surface on the operation of the system llorente and ragni 2020 also determined serration impacts on the operational parameters of an airfoil that works as a wind turbine blade xue et al 2019 took advantage of combining reynolds averaged navier stokes rans computational fluid dynamics cfd the modal method to obtain the structural deformations and inverse distance weighted idw approach for modeling a wing under different conditions including a number of deflection angles moreover a numerical study was carried out by wu et al 2019 with the goal of decreasing the turbulent drag in an airfoil in that study analysis systems ansys fluent software program was used for modeling and evaluating the performance additionally ghalandari et al 2019 employed differential quadrature method dqm to estimate the flutter speed of an airfoil salih et al 2019 also modeled the flow in the fluid structure interaction the authors developed the model for thin objects furthermore in the study of ramezanizadeh et al 2019 the thermal performance of a thermosyphon in which nanofluid was employed was investigated ni glycerol water was the used nanofluid while both the experimental and numerical results were provided akbarian et al 2018 employed cfd to simulate the performance of a dual fueled diesel engine the investigation was done under constant speed conditions whilst experiments were also used for providing better insight in order to fill the gap of the previously done studies bahrami et al 2019 investigated the average velocity profiles at different locations for a commercial airfoil by the experiments and then hoseinzadeh et al 2020 found the impacts of the angle of attack α on the performance criteria of that airfoil using the same equipped wind tunnel as a continuation of the two previously indicated studies the current investigation is carried out the focus of the present manuscript is active flow control on airfoils through air injection in the near wall region the same airfoil i e airfoil cfj0025 131 196 is selected and wake effect is studied in details for that by taking different values of jet velocity and angle of attack into account the values of 0 6 and 14 for the angle of attack as well as the jet air velocities of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 are examined different related criteria such as profiles for velocity deficit wake profiles for different attack angles and profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase are considered and studied the experimental results reported here provide more in depth insight into flow phenomena which could be of interest to experts in the aerodynamics of airfoils and wings therefore the novel contributions of this work are experimental study of active flow control of the cfj airfoil through air injection in the near wall region investigating the wake development comprehensively for three angles of attack and at five stations studying different performance criteria of the cfj airfoil as one of the promising types of airfoil to have a better performance by considering a variety of effective parameters including profiles for velocity deficit wake and turbulence intensity at different conditions in this study the investigated airfoil and the experimental setup to obtain the experimental data are the same as the previous studies of the research team bahrami et al 2019 hoseinzadeh et al 2020 however the studied parameters are entirely different than those studies moreover in bahrami et al 2019 hoseinzadeh et al 2020 measurement devices were located at different places than this study among a variety of approaches experimental analysis is selected the reason is in comparison to other methods such as numerical modeling using experiments has the great potential of observing the performance in reality without any simplifications taking advantage of other methods like numerical modeling will lead to some errors in the values of the reported parameters in addition the experimental analysis has the big advantage that it gives a tangible feeling from the investigated system it is worth mentioning that introducing the location of the maximum velocity deficit was done as a part of investigating the profiles of wake at different conditions and studying the wake profile at different conditions for an airfoil will help to find its performance better and improve it it has the potential of overcoming the today s challenges about finding efficient flow control ways for an airfoil to achieve a higher performance by giving details about the wake profiles as well as turbulence intensity and so on the following structure is chosen for this paper initially as observed the introduction is presented then the investigated airfoil is introduced and the details of the experimental study are given in section 2 next the results including the profiles for velocity deficit wake profiles for different attack angles and profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase are proposed in section 3 and section 4 is the conclusion part 2 the investigated air foil and details of the experimental study as mentioned before one airfoil was selected and measuring data was done for that it was the airfoil cfj0025 131 196 cfj stands for co flow jet based on the information provided in zha and gao 2006 zha and paxton 2208 the studied airfoil has the following advantages compared to other alternatives offering a better performance when lift increases having a lower drag and consequently high values of lift to drag coefficients especially at the angles of attacks near zero providing the opportunity of increasing the angle of attack to higher values which means a broader operating range giving a good performance at both high and low speed conditions it is worth mentioning that other airfoils such as naca 0012 national renewable energy laboratory nrel s809 and so on could be also studied however because of the mentioned reasons cfj0025 131 196 is chosen changing the airfoil will lead to changing the values of drag and lift coefficients as well as velocity profiles as it is shown in the schematic of fig 1 it has a novel design that gives it the chance of having a better injection and suction with a higher level of uniformity the investigated airfoil has the injection and suction slot heights of 0 65 and 1 96 of the chord respectively moreover the airfoil has been designed in a way that the suction surface has a descending translation of the portion of the original suction surface between the suction and injection slot the injection slot is also located in 7 11 the chord from the leading edge while the place of the suction slot is 83 18 of the chord from the leading edge furthermore in order to provide a condition in which the jet and main flow are tangential the slot faces have a normal position to the suction surface zha and gao 2006 as another important point it is worth mentioning that this paper only focuses on the injection effect moreover a wind tunnel which is employed to record the experimental data is depicted in fig 2 as seen a blower with the motor capacity of 7 kw is employed to provide the main flow as observed in fig 2 the flow direction is from left to right moreover it is worth mentioning that the difference among the three conditions for the jet velocity comes from different possible operational modes for the blown air stream in one condition the partial pressure is 636 pa and in another one it is 1672 pa they are corresponding to the air jet velocity values of 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 respectively another condition is the jet off mode in which as the name suggests air jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 as mentioned the experiments were done for these three jet velocities to find the impact of air jet velocity on the performance parameters of the investigated airfoil three angles of attack α are also examined they are 0 6 and 14 the experiments are done for three conditions of air jet velocity which are 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 the reason is as mentioned in bahrami et al 2019 the injection pipe was designed in a way that the blown air could have three modes each of which leads to having one condition for air jet velocity for one condition the partial pressure is 636 and for another one it is 1672 pa which leads to having the values of 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 for air jet velocity respectively another condition is off mode in which the air jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 by conducting the experiments for these three values a wide range for air jet velocity is covered which is taken into account as the advantage of carrying out the experiments at those values in addition it should be noted that one of the goals of this study is to investigate the impact of air jet velocity on the velocity profile and other related performance criteria therefore although having other values will lead to having different conditions for velocity profiles and other investigated parameters by having these three values the variation trend and consequently the mentioned goal could be found moreover the experiments are performed for angles of attack of 0 6 and 14 similar to the air jet velocity the reason for having different values for the angle of attack is to study the impact of changing that on the results in an almost wide range therefore these three values i e 0 6 and 14 were selected as the investigated values of angle of attack in the experiments here like velocity although other alternatives for the angle of attack could be chosen only the values of studied parameters such as the minimum velocity or drag coefficient will change and the reported trend with changes in the angle of attack will be the same additionally recording the experimental data are done for five stations which are the values of 0 067 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 for x c the advantage of having such five stations is that it gave enough details about changing the velocity profiles and other investigated performance criteria like the two previously discussed parameters i e air jet velocity and angle of attack for this case although other values could be used for instance the values of 0 14 0 27 0 42 0 61 and 0 89 which were considered in bahrami et al 2019 only the values of studied parameters such as the minimum velocity or drag coefficient will change and the reported trend with changes in x c will be the same 3 results and discussion 3 1 the profiles for velocity deficit as illustrated in fig 3 the wake induced by an airfoil produces considerable changes in the velocity field of the air region a part of the kinetic energy of the air flow is absorbed by the airfoil which leads to a velocity deficit in the downstream as the wake lam and chen 2014 velocity deficit is defined based on eq 1 gou 2020 1 v d u u where u and u are introduced in fig 3 the dimensionless velocity deficit is obtained by dividing v d by shear friction velocity u gou 2020 2 v d v d u u u u in which gou 2020 3 u τ ρ 1 2 in eq 3 τ and ρ represent shear stress and density respectively as an important point it should be noted that the equations found in hah and lakshminarayana 1982 were employed to obtain the required parameters like shear stress in the wake region using the chord length the distance from the trailing edge becomes dimensionless and then for three conditions for jet velocity the profiles for velocity deficit are obtained as fig 4 shows the three investigated conditions for jet velocity are the values of 0 0 jet off 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 u is also the velocity of the main flow which is 10 m s 1 here fig 4 shows that by increase in the dimensionless distance from the trailing edge the velocity deficit has a downward trend moreover in a constant dimensionless distance from the trailing edge the more velocity the jet has the lower velocity deficit happens as another point should be mentioned based on fig 4 increasing the jet velocity leads to having a smoother velocity deficit profile moreover by considering the depicted logarithmic scale for dimensionless length i e x c the decrement slope values of 0 143 0 138 and 0 134 are observed for the velocity levels of 0 0 jet off 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 respectively 3 2 the wake profiles for different attack angles in order to obtain the wake profiles experiments are done for three attack angles which are 0 5 and 14 for each angle of attack α data recording is done by changing the jet velocity from 0 0 to 20 4 and 20 4 33 3 m s 1 as an important point it should be noted that the velocity profiles were measured in the center of the span 3 2 1 angle of attack of 0 the experimental data are obtained in five conditions for x c they are the values of 0 067 1 150 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 and the results are reported in fig 5 fig 5 reveals that for α of 0 the value of the minimum velocity goes up by increase in x c for instance for the jet off condition u u is 0 14 for x c of 1 150 it reaches 0 49 0 70 0 80 and 0 85 when x c are 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 respectively additionally based on fig 5 it is concluded that in case the jet is off i e it has the velocity of 0 0 m s 1 the lowest amplitude for the velocity profile is observed as seen the velocity profile has the lowest value at the wake center increasing the jet velocity makes the amplitude higher on average but there is not a huge difference between the jet velocity values of 20 4 33 3 m s 1 3 2 2 the angle of attack of 6 fig 6 reports the results for the angle of attack of 6 this figure demonstrates that the same fashion as the angle of attack of 0 is observed for the angle of attack of 6 however in this case in general a lower amplitude is seen for a constant value of x c compared to 0 when the jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 it is because of the fact that by increasing the angle of attack the pressure drop goes up which leads to a lower kinetic energy and consequently velocity on average for the fluid similarly for two other jet velocities i e 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 the location of the minimum u u shifts to lower values of y when x c varies from 1 150 to 0 1 and 0 2 and for higher magnitudes of x c i e more than 0 5 u u is almost 1 for all the y values in addition the location of the minimum velocity moves to a lower place when the angle of attack increases fig 6 confirms this point 3 2 3 angle of attack of 14 in fig 7 the profiles for wake when the angle of attack is 14 are depicted the first point which can be mentioned based on this figure is that the amplitudes have an upward trend compared to the angle of attack of 6 moreover in this case a lower average u u compared to the angle of attack of 6 is observed in a constant x c 3 3 the turbulence intensity for different attack angles like wake profile here the turbulence intensity for the three angles of attack of 0 6 and 14 are given and discussed 3 3 1 angle of attack of 0 the turbulence intensity profiles for different values of x c are shown in fig 8 goal of fig 8 is to find the impact of x c on the turbulence intensity fig 8 shows that in general by increasing x c the place at which u u starts to have a different value than zero shifts to a higher values of y c for instance in case jet velocity is 33 3 m s 1 the place is 0 05 0 08 and 0 10 for x c of 0 07 0 50 and 1 respectively additionally for lower values of x c u u has a faster increase rate when it goes up from zero and in general the higher jet velocity is the more growth rate u u has moreover when the jet velocity goes up the turbulence intensity gets higher as observed in fig 8 as another point the difference among the peak values of u u decreases by increase in x c in case x c is 1 150 values of the maximum u u are 0 04 0 13 and 0 21 for air jet velocities of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 respectively for x c of 0 2 the corresponding values reach 0 14 0 10 and 0 11 having the jet velocities of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 leads to u u 0 13 0 15 and 0 16 as well 3 3 2 angle of attack of 6 the illustrated profiles of fig 9 demonstrate that by increasing the angle of attack the stream becomes more turbulent and as a result the shape of profiles get sharper in general for the lower values of x c i e the places near the injection slot the highest peak u u value is seen for the jet velocity of 33 3 m s 1 however by increasing x c the jet off mode has the highest peak u u 3 3 3 angle of attack of 14 as plotting the profiles of turbulence intensity in fig 10 shows increasing the angle of attack from 6 to 14 leads to some considerable changes especially in higher values of x c one of the such changes is that the difference between the peak u u for jet velocity of 33 3 m s 1 and that of for 20 4 m s 1 becomes more moreover the place at which u u starts to increase from zero shifts to much higher values of y c for example considering the jet off condition the place for x c of 0 5 and 1 are 0 08 and 0 12 of y c when the angle of attack is 6 in case the jet is off they reach 0 25 and 0 22 of y c when the angle of attack is 14 respectively 3 4 the profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase for providing a wider insight the profiles for changes in the place where the velocity starts to go up are given in fig 11 a to fig 11c it should be noted that knowing the place where the velocity starts to increase could give the information about development of the wake region having correct information about the wake region and development of that is important in the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil as discussed in this paper and other references if one of the figures i e one α is considered it is seen that there is the same variation trend for all the three investigated jet velocities the location is at the highest place when the jet is off i e jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 and it goes lower and lower by increasing the jet velocity moreover the recorded results presented in fig 11a c show that the majority of such places are for negative values of yd 4 conclusions the experimental tests were done for a commercially developed airfoil and the wake effect was investigated for that by considering different performance criteria for this airfoil which is cfj0025 131 196 velocity values of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 as well as the angles of attack of 0 6 and 14 were considered and the experimental data was recorded after that the profiles for velocity deficit wake profiles for different attack angles and profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase were determined and discussed thoroughly the most important found results are listed below there is a reverse relationship between the dimensionless distance from the trailing edge and velocity deficit a smoother velocity deficit profile is achieved when the jet velocity becomes higher the amplitude of the dimensionless velocity profile has a downward trend with increasing in the dimensionless distance for higher values of the jet velocity the location at which the velocity

airfoil family i e cfj0025 131 196 was studied the evaluation was done for the range of 0 14 for angle of attack and range of 0 0 32 2 m s 1 for the air jet velocity moreover as the suggestions for future works the following topics can be considered conducting the study for more family of airfoils e g naca and comparing the results with the current study performing the experiments for more cfj

21139,the goal of this investigation is to study the effect of air injection on the wake development as a widely commercial product airfoil cfj0025 131 196 is selected and the profiles for velocity deficit wake profiles for different attack angles and profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase are found for the air jet velocity the values of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 are examined while angles of attack are adjusted to 0 6 and 14 the main flow speed is 10 m s 1 it is found that when the dimensionless distance from the trailing edge goes up the velocity deficit has a downward trend furthermore the higher jet velocity is the smoother the velocity deficit profile becomes in addition in a constant dimensionless distance increasing the angle of attack results in growing the amplitude of the dimensionless velocity profile the results also reveal that the location at which the velocity starts to increase moves down by the increase in the air jet velocity having a broad knowledge about the wake development of an airfoil will help to know its performance better and find more suitable ways to enhance its performance keywords air injection aerodynamics angle of attack experiments on airfoil velocity profile wake development 1 introduction technology is being developed to fulfill a variety of demands human beings have in the various aspects sohani and sayyaadi 2020a hoseinzadeh et al 13405 sohani and sayyaadi 2020b sohani et al 2021 sohani et al 2020a and as two major parts the need for travel and generating more electricity are absorbing a huge attention with a rapid pace ajmi et al 2020 meriem et al 2020 kostas et al 2020 siddiqui et al 2020 airfoils were created by inspiring from nature naderi and torabi 2017 naderi et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and have occupied a significant role in both mentioned industries molina et al 2020 goetten et al 2217 sun et al 2020 therefore knowing and improving their performance is very important and several researchers have carried out different investigations for these purposes although numerical modeling provides valuable information from the system performance ghasemi et al 2020 hoseinzadeh et al 2019a 2019b hoseinzadeh and heyns 2020 like other fields of knowledge the most accurate condition is obtained when the results of experiments are analyzed sohani and sayyaadi 2020c sohani et al 2020b 2020c ghalambaz et al 2019 and considering this point a number of studies have tried to conduct experiments to investigate the performance of airfoils during the recent years lefebvre and jones 2019 conducted experiments to find the behavior of an airfoil under the condition of having the wake of a circular type of cylinder gardner and richter 2020 also employed an experimental approach to investigate the impacts of sidewall connection for an airfoil in two static and dynamic conditions in another study lou et al 2020 used both experimental and numerical methods to determine the performance of an airfoil after a rotary cylinder in that study the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca 4418 airfoil was chosen while a flow control strategy was proposed at the end moreover kiefer et al 2019 studied different conditions for pitching motion by doing several experiments they determined the dynamic stall impacts under circumstances in which the reynolds number was high bartl et al performed various investigations in the references bartl et al 2018 bartl et al 2019 and bartl et al 2020 to uncover the effect of wake on some operating parameters of wind turbines including tip vortex interaction using experimental approach an airfoil was considered by shimomura et al 2020 and by employing deep reinforcement learning a closed loop flow control system was presented additionally liu et al 2020 employed experiments in the unsteady condition to determine the impacts of ice roughness on the performance of an airfoil of a wind turbine for oscillating airfoil that absorbs energy siala et al 2020 took advantage of experiments and found the impacts of inertia induced flexibility of surface on the operation of the system llorente and ragni 2020 also determined serration impacts on the operational parameters of an airfoil that works as a wind turbine blade xue et al 2019 took advantage of combining reynolds averaged navier stokes rans computational fluid dynamics cfd the modal method to obtain the structural deformations and inverse distance weighted idw approach for modeling a wing under different conditions including a number of deflection angles moreover a numerical study was carried out by wu et al 2019 with the goal of decreasing the turbulent drag in an airfoil in that study analysis systems ansys fluent software program was used for modeling and evaluating the performance additionally ghalandari et al 2019 employed differential quadrature method dqm to estimate the flutter speed of an airfoil salih et al 2019 also modeled the flow in the fluid structure interaction the authors developed the model for thin objects furthermore in the study of ramezanizadeh et al 2019 the thermal performance of a thermosyphon in which nanofluid was employed was investigated ni glycerol water was the used nanofluid while both the experimental and numerical results were provided akbarian et al 2018 employed cfd to simulate the performance of a dual fueled diesel engine the investigation was done under constant speed conditions whilst experiments were also used for providing better insight in order to fill the gap of the previously done studies bahrami et al 2019 investigated the average velocity profiles at different locations for a commercial airfoil by the experiments and then hoseinzadeh et al 2020 found the impacts of the angle of attack α on the performance criteria of that airfoil using the same equipped wind tunnel as a continuation of the two previously indicated studies the current investigation is carried out the focus of the present manuscript is active flow control on airfoils through air injection in the near wall region the same airfoil i e airfoil cfj0025 131 196 is selected and wake effect is studied in details for that by taking different values of jet velocity and angle of attack into account the values of 0 6 and 14 for the angle of attack as well as the jet air velocities of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 are examined different related criteria such as profiles for velocity deficit wake profiles for different attack angles and profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase are considered and studied the experimental results reported here provide more in depth insight into flow phenomena which could be of interest to experts in the aerodynamics of airfoils and wings therefore the novel contributions of this work are experimental study of active flow control of the cfj airfoil through air injection in the near wall region investigating the wake development comprehensively for three angles of attack and at five stations studying different performance criteria of the cfj airfoil as one of the promising types of airfoil to have a better performance by considering a variety of effective parameters including profiles for velocity deficit wake and turbulence intensity at different conditions in this study the investigated airfoil and the experimental setup to obtain the experimental data are the same as the previous studies of the research team bahrami et al 2019 hoseinzadeh et al 2020 however the studied parameters are entirely different than those studies moreover in bahrami et al 2019 hoseinzadeh et al 2020 measurement devices were located at different places than this study among a variety of approaches experimental analysis is selected the reason is in comparison to other methods such as numerical modeling using experiments has the great potential of observing the performance in reality without any simplifications taking advantage of other methods like numerical modeling will lead to some errors in the values of the reported parameters in addition the experimental analysis has the big advantage that it gives a tangible feeling from the investigated system it is worth mentioning that introducing the location of the maximum velocity deficit was done as a part of investigating the profiles of wake at different conditions and studying the wake profile at different conditions for an airfoil will help to find its performance better and improve it it has the potential of overcoming the today s challenges about finding efficient flow control ways for an airfoil to achieve a higher performance by giving details about the wake profiles as well as turbulence intensity and so on the following structure is chosen for this paper initially as observed the introduction is presented then the investigated airfoil is introduced and the details of the experimental study are given in section 2 next the results including the profiles for velocity deficit wake profiles for different attack angles and profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase are proposed in section 3 and section 4 is the conclusion part 2 the investigated air foil and details of the experimental study as mentioned before one airfoil was selected and measuring data was done for that it was the airfoil cfj0025 131 196 cfj stands for co flow jet based on the information provided in zha and gao 2006 zha and paxton 2208 the studied airfoil has the following advantages compared to other alternatives offering a better performance when lift increases having a lower drag and consequently high values of lift to drag coefficients especially at the angles of attacks near zero providing the opportunity of increasing the angle of attack to higher values which means a broader operating range giving a good performance at both high and low speed conditions it is worth mentioning that other airfoils such as naca 0012 national renewable energy laboratory nrel s809 and so on could be also studied however because of the mentioned reasons cfj0025 131 196 is chosen changing the airfoil will lead to changing the values of drag and lift coefficients as well as velocity profiles as it is shown in the schematic of fig 1 it has a novel design that gives it the chance of having a better injection and suction with a higher level of uniformity the investigated airfoil has the injection and suction slot heights of 0 65 and 1 96 of the chord respectively moreover the airfoil has been designed in a way that the suction surface has a descending translation of the portion of the original suction surface between the suction and injection slot the injection slot is also located in 7 11 the chord from the leading edge while the place of the suction slot is 83 18 of the chord from the leading edge furthermore in order to provide a condition in which the jet and main flow are tangential the slot faces have a normal position to the suction surface zha and gao 2006 as another important point it is worth mentioning that this paper only focuses on the injection effect moreover a wind tunnel which is employed to record the experimental data is depicted in fig 2 as seen a blower with the motor capacity of 7 kw is employed to provide the main flow as observed in fig 2 the flow direction is from left to right moreover it is worth mentioning that the difference among the three conditions for the jet velocity comes from different possible operational modes for the blown air stream in one condition the partial pressure is 636 pa and in another one it is 1672 pa they are corresponding to the air jet velocity values of 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 respectively another condition is the jet off mode in which as the name suggests air jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 as mentioned the experiments were done for these three jet velocities to find the impact of air jet velocity on the performance parameters of the investigated airfoil three angles of attack α are also examined they are 0 6 and 14 the experiments are done for three conditions of air jet velocity which are 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 the reason is as mentioned in bahrami et al 2019 the injection pipe was designed in a way that the blown air could have three modes each of which leads to having one condition for air jet velocity for one condition the partial pressure is 636 and for another one it is 1672 pa which leads to having the values of 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 for air jet velocity respectively another condition is off mode in which the air jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 by conducting the experiments for these three values a wide range for air jet velocity is covered which is taken into account as the advantage of carrying out the experiments at those values in addition it should be noted that one of the goals of this study is to investigate the impact of air jet velocity on the velocity profile and other related performance criteria therefore although having other values will lead to having different conditions for velocity profiles and other investigated parameters by having these three values the variation trend and consequently the mentioned goal could be found moreover the experiments are performed for angles of attack of 0 6 and 14 similar to the air jet velocity the reason for having different values for the angle of attack is to study the impact of changing that on the results in an almost wide range therefore these three values i e 0 6 and 14 were selected as the investigated values of angle of attack in the experiments here like velocity although other alternatives for the angle of attack could be chosen only the values of studied parameters such as the minimum velocity or drag coefficient will change and the reported trend with changes in the angle of attack will be the same additionally recording the experimental data are done for five stations which are the values of 0 067 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 for x c the advantage of having such five stations is that it gave enough details about changing the velocity profiles and other investigated performance criteria like the two previously discussed parameters i e air jet velocity and angle of attack for this case although other values could be used for instance the values of 0 14 0 27 0 42 0 61 and 0 89 which were considered in bahrami et al 2019 only the values of studied parameters such as the minimum velocity or drag coefficient will change and the reported trend with changes in x c will be the same 3 results and discussion 3 1 the profiles for velocity deficit as illustrated in fig 3 the wake induced by an airfoil produces considerable changes in the velocity field of the air region a part of the kinetic energy of the air flow is absorbed by the airfoil which leads to a velocity deficit in the downstream as the wake lam and chen 2014 velocity deficit is defined based on eq 1 gou 2020 1 v d u u where u and u are introduced in fig 3 the dimensionless velocity deficit is obtained by dividing v d by shear friction velocity u gou 2020 2 v d v d u u u u in which gou 2020 3 u τ ρ 1 2 in eq 3 τ and ρ represent shear stress and density respectively as an important point it should be noted that the equations found in hah and lakshminarayana 1982 were employed to obtain the required parameters like shear stress in the wake region using the chord length the distance from the trailing edge becomes dimensionless and then for three conditions for jet velocity the profiles for velocity deficit are obtained as fig 4 shows the three investigated conditions for jet velocity are the values of 0 0 jet off 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 u is also the velocity of the main flow which is 10 m s 1 here fig 4 shows that by increase in the dimensionless distance from the trailing edge the velocity deficit has a downward trend moreover in a constant dimensionless distance from the trailing edge the more velocity the jet has the lower velocity deficit happens as another point should be mentioned based on fig 4 increasing the jet velocity leads to having a smoother velocity deficit profile moreover by considering the depicted logarithmic scale for dimensionless length i e x c the decrement slope values of 0 143 0 138 and 0 134 are observed for the velocity levels of 0 0 jet off 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 respectively 3 2 the wake profiles for different attack angles in order to obtain the wake profiles experiments are done for three attack angles which are 0 5 and 14 for each angle of attack α data recording is done by changing the jet velocity from 0 0 to 20 4 and 20 4 33 3 m s 1 as an important point it should be noted that the velocity profiles were measured in the center of the span 3 2 1 angle of attack of 0 the experimental data are obtained in five conditions for x c they are the values of 0 067 1 150 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 and the results are reported in fig 5 fig 5 reveals that for α of 0 the value of the minimum velocity goes up by increase in x c for instance for the jet off condition u u is 0 14 for x c of 1 150 it reaches 0 49 0 70 0 80 and 0 85 when x c are 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 respectively additionally based on fig 5 it is concluded that in case the jet is off i e it has the velocity of 0 0 m s 1 the lowest amplitude for the velocity profile is observed as seen the velocity profile has the lowest value at the wake center increasing the jet velocity makes the amplitude higher on average but there is not a huge difference between the jet velocity values of 20 4 33 3 m s 1 3 2 2 the angle of attack of 6 fig 6 reports the results for the angle of attack of 6 this figure demonstrates that the same fashion as the angle of attack of 0 is observed for the angle of attack of 6 however in this case in general a lower amplitude is seen for a constant value of x c compared to 0 when the jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 it is because of the fact that by increasing the angle of attack the pressure drop goes up which leads to a lower kinetic energy and consequently velocity on average for the fluid similarly for two other jet velocities i e 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 the location of the minimum u u shifts to lower values of y when x c varies from 1 150 to 0 1 and 0 2 and for higher magnitudes of x c i e more than 0 5 u u is almost 1 for all the y values in addition the location of the minimum velocity moves to a lower place when the angle of attack increases fig 6 confirms this point 3 2 3 angle of attack of 14 in fig 7 the profiles for wake when the angle of attack is 14 are depicted the first point which can be mentioned based on this figure is that the amplitudes have an upward trend compared to the angle of attack of 6 moreover in this case a lower average u u compared to the angle of attack of 6 is observed in a constant x c 3 3 the turbulence intensity for different attack angles like wake profile here the turbulence intensity for the three angles of attack of 0 6 and 14 are given and discussed 3 3 1 angle of attack of 0 the turbulence intensity profiles for different values of x c are shown in fig 8 goal of fig 8 is to find the impact of x c on the turbulence intensity fig 8 shows that in general by increasing x c the place at which u u starts to have a different value than zero shifts to a higher values of y c for instance in case jet velocity is 33 3 m s 1 the place is 0 05 0 08 and 0 10 for x c of 0 07 0 50 and 1 respectively additionally for lower values of x c u u has a faster increase rate when it goes up from zero and in general the higher jet velocity is the more growth rate u u has moreover when the jet velocity goes up the turbulence intensity gets higher as observed in fig 8 as another point the difference among the peak values of u u decreases by increase in x c in case x c is 1 150 values of the maximum u u are 0 04 0 13 and 0 21 for air jet velocities of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 respectively for x c of 0 2 the corresponding values reach 0 14 0 10 and 0 11 having the jet velocities of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 leads to u u 0 13 0 15 and 0 16 as well 3 3 2 angle of attack of 6 the illustrated profiles of fig 9 demonstrate that by increasing the angle of attack the stream becomes more turbulent and as a result the shape of profiles get sharper in general for the lower values of x c i e the places near the injection slot the highest peak u u value is seen for the jet velocity of 33 3 m s 1 however by increasing x c the jet off mode has the highest peak u u 3 3 3 angle of attack of 14 as plotting the profiles of turbulence intensity in fig 10 shows increasing the angle of attack from 6 to 14 leads to some considerable changes especially in higher values of x c one of the such changes is that the difference between the peak u u for jet velocity of 33 3 m s 1 and that of for 20 4 m s 1 becomes more moreover the place at which u u starts to increase from zero shifts to much higher values of y c for example considering the jet off condition the place for x c of 0 5 and 1 are 0 08 and 0 12 of y c when the angle of attack is 6 in case the jet is off they reach 0 25 and 0 22 of y c when the angle of attack is 14 respectively 3 4 the profiles for change in the place where the velocity starts to increase for providing a wider insight the profiles for changes in the place where the velocity starts to go up are given in fig 11 a to fig 11c it should be noted that knowing the place where the velocity starts to increase could give the information about development of the wake region having correct information about the wake region and development of that is important in the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil as discussed in this paper and other references if one of the figures i e one α is considered it is seen that there is the same variation trend for all the three investigated jet velocities the location is at the highest place when the jet is off i e jet velocity is 0 0 m s 1 and it goes lower and lower by increasing the jet velocity moreover the recorded results presented in fig 11a c show that the majority of such places are for negative values of yd 4 conclusions the experimental tests were done for a commercially developed airfoil and the wake effect was investigated for that by considering different performance criteria for this airfoil which is cfj0025 131 196 velocity values of 0 0 20 4 and 33 3 m s 1 as well as the angles of attack of 0 6 and 14 were considered and the experimental data was recorded after that the profiles for velocity deficit wake
