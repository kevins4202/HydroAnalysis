21590,based on the basic principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics the temperature and pressure model of natural gas hydrate hydraulic lifting pipeline the hydrate decomposition mass transfer model and the mathematical model of pipeline multiphase flow are established the relationship between the back pressure of the pipeline outlet the decomposition surface and the depth of the seawater was analyzed on this basis the numerical simulation and experimental verification of natural gas hydrate pipeline transmission were carried out the effects of pipe diameter inlet velocity and solid phase parameters on the three phase flow of natural gas hydrate pipelines were analyzed the result shows that with the outlet pressure increasing the position at which the hydrate begins to decompose moves up and the decomposition rate slows down as the depth of mining increases the rate of hydrate decomposition slows and the position at which decomposition begins to move up in deep sea mining below 1500 m the increase of mining depth has little effect on the decomposition rate of hydrate and the decomposition starting position is always near 510 m in sea depth the pipe pressure loss gradient decreases as the pipe diameter increases after the pipe diameter is larger than 300 mm the pressure loss gradient decreases slowly and the pressure loss gradient drops sharply at 450 mm and eventually stabilizes after 500 mm when the inlet velocity of the pipe is low the fluid flow in the pipe is unstable and reflow occurs the pipe pressure loss gradient first decreases and then increases as the fluid flow rate increases and there is an optimal flow rate value that minimizes the pressure loss gradient keywords gas hydrate pipeline transmission solid liquid gas three phase flow numerical simulation pressure loss gradient natural gas hydrate also known as combustible ice which is considered to be the most ideal alternative energy source for the 21st century makogon et al 2007 currently the most promising method for commercial exploitation of submarine gas hydrates is the cutter suction mining method uchida et al 2006 hai liang et al 2018 hailiang et al 2019 makogon 2010 the cutter suction mining method is a kind of solid state mining method which is aimed at a digenetic hydrate deposit with a bare sea surface or a shallow cover layer the schematic diagram of the mining system is shown in fig 1 the specific working process of the mining system is as follows milkov 2000 submarine mining vehicles rely on the front cutter head to break up the hydrate deposits and pipette them into the auxiliary pump under the action of the auxiliary pump the granular hydrate is sent to the hose drawn by the buoyancy ball and then the particles enter the main slurry pump the high power main slurry pump draws hydrates into vertical pipes of several kilometers when it is lifted through the pipeline the tube flow pressure is lowered and the temperature is raised after reaching the critical surface the hydrate begins to decompose part of the methane to make the fluid into a solid liquid gas three phase flow after flowing through the bend at the exit it flows into the surface hydrate separator the decomposition of hydrates makes solid liquid two phase flow transportation into solid liquid gas three phase flow transportation which is very likely to cause a blowout accident safe mining and pipeline transportation are important issues in gas hydrate mining the study of gas hydrate decomposition sites and three phase flow in hydraulic lifting pipelines is critical for safe mining 7 8 wu chuanzhi and zhao zhenwei wu et al 2016 zhao and shang 2010 studied various heating methods and their advantages on the seabed and transmission pipelines during hydrate mining mitra majundar mitra majumdar et al 1997 used a multi fluid model numerical simulation to verify the three phase flow structure in a vertical pipe padial padial et al 2000 and other numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic behavior of solid liquid gas three phase flow in a riser bubble column based on the volume control method kassab kassab et al 2007 established a gasification performance prediction model for gas hydrate under three phase flow the model has higher prediction accuracy for gas liquid two phase flow and lower accuracy for three phase flow prediction kato kato et al 2008 and so on modeled the hydraulically enhanced natural gas hydrate mixed fluid and analyzed the system characteristics under different lifting distances and pipe diameters however the study did not consider the effects of bubble distribution and gas phase interaction li et al 2015 used the euler model and cfd pbm computational fluid dynamics population balance model abbreviated as cfd pbm model to simulate the three phase flow of natural gas hydrate in the hydraulic lifting pipeline under the larger gas phase volume fraction the results show that the flow distribution calculated using the cfd pbm model is more uniform and closer to the experimental value felippa c a felippa and chung 1981 analyzed the three phase flow field of natural gas hydrates pipeline under gravity sea

hydrate solid particles in vertical pipelines dzyuba a v dzyuba and zektser 2013a and other methods were used to analyze the distribution of the concentration of each phase of the solid liquid gas three phase flow of natural gas hydrate in vertical pipelines under different transport pipe diameters although these research results are lacking in accuracy and adaptability they have promoted the development of natural gas hydraulic lifting three phase flow research in summary the researchers have done a lot of work on the research of natural gas hydrate mining and pipeline transportation and have a deep understanding and understanding of the hydrate decomposition problem in the basic pipeline however the research on the position and influence law of the three phase flow decomposition surface of the hydrate pipeline is not sufficient the research on the solid liquid gas three phase flow of the pipeline transmission system is not comprehensive and the interface of the sea surface hydrate is not studied in depth the author of this article has designed the overall design of the cutter suction mining system by analyzing the lift of the pump it is concluded that the single stage large lift slurry pump can lift the seabed hydrate particles to the sea surface at one time xu et al 2016 2017 2018 the crushing capacity of the sea bottom reamer the cutter suction flow field and the cavitation performance of the multi stage slurry pump were studied the range of the solid phase particles particle size and solid phase volume fraction at the inlet of the pipeline was obtained zeng

temperature tube flow pressure phase equilibrium pressure and pipeline transmission pressure loss gradient under different seawater depths was analyzed based on the calculation method provided by computational fluid dynamics the flow characteristics of gas hydrate three phase flow pipelines are studied by pipe diameter inlet velocity and solid phase parameters and experimental verification is carried out the flow field characteristics of the three phase flow decomposition surface of the pipeline and the flow field in the pipeline are obtained which provides a theoretical basis for the system design of gas hydrate three phase flow pipeline transmission 1 analysis of the decomposition surface of natural gas hydrate pipeline 1 1 basic assumptions according to the actual mining conditions of natural gas hydrates in the theoretical analysis the following assumptions are made on the calculation conditions 1 the heat transfer coefficient of the pipe at different positions is constant and the cutting heat transfer of the reamer is not considered 2 after the crushing the natural gas deposit particles are uniform spherulites and the solid liquid two phases are incompressible steady flow 3 the gas obeys the redlich kwong equation of state referred to as the r k equation redlich and kwong 1949 1 2 mathematical model 1 2 1 seawater temperature model when the water in the pipeline increases the natural gas hydrate the temperature of the mixed fluid at the inlet is the same as the seabed temperature and changes with the heat transfer during the upward transfer the seawater is divided into a mixed layer a thermo cline and a constant temperature layer and the temperature decreases as the depth of the seawater increases alari et al 2016 the mixing layer has a depth of 20 200 m and the temperature in this layer changes uniformly the temperature change of the next layer of thermocline is more obvious and the temperature of the seawater in the lowermost constant temperature layer decreases more smoothly with little change at depths below 2000 m seawater remains at a low temperature throughout the year li et al 2018 the temperature distribution of

the natural convection heat transfer coefficient is 200 w m k the strong convection heat transfer coefficient is 5000 w m k the friction coefficient of the pipe is 0 01 the compression factor for methane is 0 261 the gas constant is 8 314 j mol k the pipe has an inner diameter of 300 mm and an outer diameter of 350 mm the flow rate of the fluid in the pipe is determined by the displacement the displacement of the pump is 340 m3 h the intrinsic decomposition rate of natural gas hydrate is 1 24 105 mol m2 s mpa the reaction activation energy is 7 83 10 4 j mol the diffusion coefficient of methane is 1 5 10 9 m2 s the density of seawater is 1025 kg m3 the hydrate particles have a density of 930 kg m3 which accounts for 30 of the sediment the sea surface temperature is 295 k the combustible ice exposed on the seabed is mainly found in the deep sea below 1000 m and the depth of seawater is 1000 4000 m for research at the beginning of the calculation it is assumed that all the inside of the pipeline is seawater fig 2 shows the calculation flow chart the particle size after particle breakage directly affects whether it can be completely decomposed in the lifting pipe the smaller the diameter of the particles the greater the likelihood of complete decomposition try to select the particle size of 0 2 mm 0 4 mm 1 mm 2 mm for analysis at the outlet of the pipeline in order to make the mining safe and controllable a back pressure device is added initial attempts were made to select outlet back pressures of 2 mpa 1 mpa 0 mpa 1 mpa and 2 mpa for analysis 1 4 result analysis 1 4 1 influence of outlet pressure on flow field in pipeline at the exit of the natural gas hydrate mining pipeline there are gas collection devices hydrate decomposition devices etc for well control safety pressure is often applied at the outlet of the pipeline ie outlet back pressure zhao et al 2015 the influence of outlet back pressure on the flow field in the pipeline was analyzed when the outlet back pressure was 2 mpa 1 mpa 0 mpa 1 mpa and 2 mpa fig 3 shows the relationship between the seawater temperature tw the tube flow temperature t and the water depth h under different outlet back pressures in fig 3 the subscript 2 1 0 1 and 2 of t represent the back pressure value respectively it can be seen from the analysis results shown in fig 3 that the higher the pressure the higher the temperature this is because the tube flow temperature is mainly related to the heat generation caused by frictional heat generation hydrate phase change heat and temperature difference between the inside and outside of the pipeline the greater the pressure the larger the friction coefficient the more frictional heat generation the smaller the convection coefficient the greater the heat conduction and the higher the tube flow temperature as shown in fig 3 the curves are approximately coincident which indicates that the tube flow temperature changes less under different back pressure conditions fig 4 shows the relationship between the tube flow pressure p the phase equilibrium pressure p eq and the water depth h under different outlet back pressures it can be seen from fig 4 that the intersection point of the phase equilibrium pressure and the tube flow pressure decreases as the back pressure decreases indicating that the hydrate decomposition surface accelerates to sink as the back pressure decreases when the phase equilibrium pressure is lowered the decomposition surface rises this indicates that the outlet back pressure has a great influence on the decomposition position of the hydrate therefore the outlet back pressure is also an important parameter for regulating the decomposition position of the hydrate in the pipeline and ensuring the safe and controllable gas hydrate transmission fig 5 shows the relationship between the single gas hydrate particle decomposition surface ds depth surface and the amount of substance n and the water depth h under different back pressures it can be seen from fig 5 that the greater the back pressure of the pipe outlet the closer the hydrate decomposition surface is to the sea surface under the influence of positive pressure on the outlet the gas hydrate particles are not completely decomposed and the larger the positive pressure the more the residual amount the slower the decomposition rate under the influence of the outlet negative pressure the hydrate particles have completely decomposed before reaching the sea surface and the larger the absolute value of the negative pressure the faster the decomposition speed 1 4 2 influence of mineral depth on pipeline flow field natural gas hydrate mining vehicles can move freely on the seabed to accommodate the depth of the deposit and analyze deposits with depths of 4000 m 3000 m 2000 m and 1000 m fig 6 shows the relationship between seawater temperature t w tube flow temperature t and water depth h at different depths of mineral deposits it can be seen from fig 6 that at a depth of 2000 m or more the temperature difference between the seawater and the tube flow is large the heat transfer efficiency is higher and the temperature of the inlet water of the tube inlet is higher than the temperature raised from the deeper to the same depth below 2000 m the depth of the deposit increases and the friction inside the pipe increases while mining but the impact is small below 2000m the temperature lines of each tube flow almost coincide and the deeper the depth the higher the degree of coincidence which indicates that the increase in mining depth in the depth of the ocean has little effect on the tube flow temperature fig 7 shows the relationship between tube flow pressure p phase equilibrium pressure p eq and water depth h at different depths of mineral deposits it can be seen from fig 7 that as the depth of the deposit increases the intersection of the pressure lines rises as the depth of the mineral deposit deepens the distance between the phase equilibrium pressure curve and the tube flow pressure curve moves up indicating that the hydrate decomposition position rises slowly below 1500 m sea water depth the increase in mining depth has little effect on the rate of hydrate decomposition and the decomposition start position is always at a depth of 510 m 2 numerical simulation of three phase flow in natural gas hydrate vertical pipeline based on the calculation method provided by computational fluid dynamics the fluent software is used to simulate the three phase flow of the bubble compression section pipeline study the influence of the pipe diameter inlet flow rate and solid phase concentration of the transmission system on the flow field 2 1 basic assumptions according to the actual working conditions of the deep sea mining system operation combined with the principle of hydraulic transmission taking into account the limitations of numerical calculation and the feasibility of regular analysis the following assumptions are made 1 the solid phase and the liquid phase are continuous incompressible fluids the gas phase obeys the r k equation of state 2 the main phase is seawater the secondary phase is hydrate deposit particles and the third phase is methane both the solid phase particles and the gas phase bubbles are spherical 2 2 model and meshing in the numerical simulation for the solid liquid gas three phase flow of the compression section the liquid phase volume fraction is high the three phases are full of the flow field and the interaction between the phases is continuous and the euler eulerian model is selected the model considers the interactions between different phases and each of them is solved separately which satisfies the independent conservation equation zhong et al 2016 stabile et al 2017 the continuity equation for each phase is 22 ρ q t ρ q u q i x i 0 where ρ is the density kg m3 q is the phase code g is the gas phase l is the liquid

mass force of fluid micelles n m3 c v is the volume fraction and u d is the slip speed m s because the research object is a vertical pipeline three phase flow with a small amount of bubbles the structure is simple and there is no obvious swirl in the flow field so a standard turbulence model with a wide range of applications is selected 24 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ i α k k x j g k ρ ε 25 ρ ε

compressible turbulent pulsation expansion on total dissipation rate α k is the reciprocal of the effective prandtl number of the kinetic energy and α ε is the reciprocal of the effective prandtl number of the turbulent dissipation rate before the numerical simulation of the flow field the watershed needs to be meshed common grids have structured grids and unstructured grids the adjacent elements of the internal nodes of the structured grid are the same and the speed quality and precision of the generated grid are higher which is closer to the actual model wiesenberger et al 2018 the vertical cross section o type division of the vertical pipe was carried out by using the icem integrated computer engineering and manufacturing code software and the boundary layer was encrypted using the exponential rule and the mesh quality inspection was performed fig 8 shows the pipe model and cross section meshing the cross section was enlarged by 20 times 2 3 model validation 2 3 1 experimental program the experimental system adopts the deep sea mining experimental system of china national key laboratory of deep sea mineral resources development and utilization with a vertical height of 30 m and a pipe diameter of 200 mm the system can simulate the submarine ore hydraulic transmission of 5000 m deep by applying back pressure at the outlet end the working principle diagram of the experimental platform is shown in fig 9 since submarine gas hydrates and synthetic natural gas hydrates are relatively difficult to obtain in order to simplify the experiment the nodule particles with a density of 1679 kg m3 are used to simulate the solid phase in the natural gas hydrate and the gas is injected into the pipeline by artificial gas addition during the experiment the volume fraction of the bubbles in the pipe was controlled by adjusting the throttle valve on the pump injection device the diameter of the bubble in the pipe is controlled by adjusting the back pressure of the pipe outlet to control the gas phase volume fraction and diameter within a certain range the lift pump is a two stage slurry pump that controls the flow of the pump by adjusting the speed of the slurry pump to control the flow rate in order to achieve gas addition a gas source inlet is installed at the junction of the elbow and the vertical pipe on the working platform and the airflow moves vertically upward along the pipe axis 2 3 2 experimental procedure first add the tuberculosis pellets given in the experiment to the silo and fill the tank with water then start the two stage slurry pump to pump the clean water from the water bag into the riser after the outlet water at the outlet of the pipeline is stable adjust the inverter to stabilize it at the required flow rate start the feeder and control the volume fraction of the solid phase particles at the bottom of the riser by adjusting the speed of the feeder after the flow field is stabilized the air pump is turned on and the flow rate is adjusted to a certain speed to introduce gas into the middle of the pipe the parameters are adjusted to the required conditions by observing the instrument data of the experimental system experimental data under different control variables is obtained by changing different parameters 2 3 3 analysis of experimental results change the back pressure of the pipe outlet and measure the pressure loss of 5 m above and below the glass pipe of the experimental system for each experiment the experimental values and simulation results of different tube flow velocity solid phase volume fraction particle size and gas phase volume fraction are shown in tables 1 3 it can be seen from the above experimental results that the experimental and simulation laws are consistent and the relative error is small all within 10 this proves that the calculation model and simulation method used in this paper are feasible 3 numerical simulation results analysis 3 1 influence of pipe diameter on flow field the pipe diameter is different the distribution of each phase in the pipeline the flow velocity of each phase etc will be affected and the pipeline pressure loss will also be affected refer to the current large medium and small models of the cutter suction dredger the diameter of the small dredger is about 250 mm the diameter of the medium dredger is about 300 mm and the diameter of the large dredger is about 500 mm liu 2009 the pipe diameter of each phase of the pipeline is compared and analyzed by selecting the pipe diameter of 100 700 m pipe length flow rate solid phase and gas phase parameters are shown in table 4 the effect of pipe diameter on the volume fraction of each phase was analyzed at 100 mm 300 mm 500 mm and 700 mm fig 10 shows the cloud distribution of the volume fraction of each phase when the pipe diameters are different it can be clearly seen from fig 10 that the proportion of the liquid phase seawater at the wall of the pipe is the largest forming a clear water ring as can be seen from fig 10 the proportion of the fresh water ring decreases as the diameter of the pipe increases the concentration gradient also decreased significantly with increasing tube diameter from 41 93 52 to 22 86 74 that is to say as the diameter of the pipe increases the liquid phase distribution is more uniform the process of homogenization is also the process of gradually decreasing the volume fraction gradient this is because the larger the pipe diameter the larger the curvature the smaller the boundary layer overlap region and the smaller the influence range so the smaller the proportion of the water ring the weaker the influence of the boundary layer and the smaller the numerical gradient of the volume fraction the pipe diameter increased from 100 mm to 700 mm and the solid phase concentration gradient decreased from 22 34 12 to 11 27 16 when the pipe diameter is increased to 300 mm the solid phase homogenization is basically completed and the uniformization area is over 90 in addition the manner in which the solid phase is homogenized is not consistent with the liquid phase the liquid phase diffuses from the high concentration zone of the pipe wall to the center of the pipe and the solid phase is the highest concentration from the middle and diffuses radially toward the pipe wall in the process of homogenizing the two phases of solid and liquid it can be clearly seen that in the 300 mm pipe diameter a ring like agglomeration occurs in the gas phase at a pipe diameter of 100 mm the gas phase distribution in the middle of the pipe has a high volume fraction and a low volume fraction at the pipe wall when the pipe diameter increases to about 300 mm the gas phase volume fraction is no longer the highest in the middle but a concentration collapse zone appears in the middle and the gas ring with the highest gas phase volume fraction is formed around the collapse zone inside the liquid ring after more than 300 mm the gas ring disappears and the gas phase is gradually unstable fig 11 shows the variation of pressure loss gradient with pipe diameter under different operating parameters flow rate particle size solid phase volume fraction bubble average diameter gas phase volume fraction it can be seen from the calculation results shown in fig 11 that the influence of velocity on the pressure loss gradient is smaller than the influence of the gas solid two phases volume fraction on the pressure loss gradient when the pipe diameter is between 100 mm and 300 mm the smaller the pipe diameter the greater the gradient of pipe pressure loss this is because the main flow area of the pipe center is small the wall effect is obvious and the frictional resistance loss between the pipe wall and each phase accounts for a large proportion resulting in a large pressure loss gradient with the diameter of the pipe increasing the contact area of the fluid per unit volume with the pipe decreases the friction area between the phases of the fluid and the pipe wall decreases the collision probability decreases and the pressure loss gradient decreases when the pipe diameter is between 300 mm and 450 mm the pressure loss gradient tends to be gentle this is because the solid liquid two phase influence is large at this time and the solid liquid two phase flow plays a leading role at this time the frictional resistance loss of the pipe wall and the collision loss with the particles account for the total pressure loss ratio and the solid liquid two phases in the mixed fluid reach a relative equilibrium state and the pressure loss gradient is at a relatively low value when the pipe diameter is larger than 450 mm the pressure loss gradient begins to drop sharply and reaches a steady state again after 500 mm this is because the drag reduction effect of the gas phase in the mixed fluid is optimal the pipe diameter is matched with the optimal pressure loss gradient of the three phase flow in the pipe and the total pressure loss of the fluid is minimized from this it can be judged that after the pipe diameter is larger than 500 mm the influence of the increase of the pipe diameter on the gradient of the pipe flow pressure loss is negligible combined with the variation of the volume fraction of each phase it can be seen that the moment when the total pressure loss of the fluid reaches relatively stable is the time when the liquid ring appears and the gas ring disappears therefore the appearance and disappearance of the liquid ring and the gas ring can be initially judged and the state of the pipeline pressure loss can be predicted 3 2 influence of inlet velocity on flow field when the fluid is transported vertically upwards the fluid flow rate is generally greater than three times the particle settling velocity goyal 2010 calculated by the settlement velocity calculation formula u t π g d s ρ s ρ l 6 φ ρ l the velocity should be greater than 1 01 m s 1 42 m s 1 74 m s when transporting 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm diameter particles the pipe diameter is 500 mm by changing the inlet flow rate of the pipe the remaining parameters are as shown in table 5 and the flow patterns of the various phases in the pipe are analyzed fig 12 is a volume fraction distribution diagram of each phase of the pipe outlet when the fluid inlet velocity is 1 m s 2 m s 4 m s and 6 m s respectively it can be seen from fig 12 that the distribution of the phases in the pipeline is confusing when the speed is too small this is because the speed is too small and the power is insufficient under the combined action of gravity pressure gradient force radial force etc the liquid phase is large and small when the force is applied and the resultant force swings to the left and right resulting in acceleration and speed also being large and small the particles are affected by the liquid phase and the motion path deviates from the center of the pipe and the reflow phenomenon is obvious part of the liquid phase is close to the tube wall and part of the solid phase is close to the tube wall showing flow instability as the flow rate increases the liquid phase forms a water ring at the tube wall the solid phase is evenly distributed in the clean water ring and the gas phase forms a ring like aggregate around the solid phase this is because as the speed increases the resultant force of the pressure gradient force and buoyancy begins to be greater than gravity and the upward force dominates at the same time the role of the radial force in the gas phase is relatively obvious forming a gas ring at this point both the liquid ring and the gas ring are present achieving a relatively good state of drag reduction before the speed increases to 4 m s the water ring begins to expand inward and the gas ring disappears at this time the gas solid two phases are evenly distributed in the center of the pipe as the flow rate continues to increase the solid phase distribution becomes chaotic and the water ring continues to expand inward this is because the upward lift is far greater than the force of gravity resistance etc and as the reynolds number increases the solid liquid two phases are greatly affected by the turbulence resulting in uneven distribution of the solid liquid two phases fig 13 shows the variation of the pressure loss gradient with the fluid flow rate at different inlet velocities it can be seen from the analysis results of fig 13 that the influence of the solid phase particles on the pressure loss is greater than the influence of the fluid flow rate and the average diameter of the bubbles is 5 mm which has a certain drag reducing effect the pressure drop gradient of the pipeline decreases first and then increases with the increase of the fluid flow rate and there is an optimal speed interval corresponding to the minimum pressure loss the existence of the optimal speed interval indicates that the effect of fluid flow rate on the pressure loss of the pipeline is two sided 1 when the fluid velocity is lower than the optimum flow rate the gravity is significantly affected the liquid phase dragging solid phase ability is insufficient and the relative slip between the particle phase and the liquid phase becomes large when the particle velocity is low the solid phase falls down significantly and the number of particle collisions increases resulting in an increase in the pressure loss gradient 2 when the flow rate is higher than the optimal flow rate the particle velocity is large the inertia is large the collision probability between the particles and between the particles and the pipe is increased and the pressure loss is increased in fig 13 the velocity of the falling section of the curve is much larger than that of the rising section reflecting the greater influence of relative slip at low speed at low speeds there may even be a backflow that can cause damage to the pump the pressure loss gradient is minimal when the fluid velocity is in the optimal flow rate range the difference in the optimal speed range is due to the difference in particle diameter the larger the particle diameter the heavier the particles under the same density conditions and the greater the sedimentation rate the greater the optimum flow rate considering the ability of the natural gas hydrate mining system to transmit water the fluid flow rate should be between 2 and 4 m s and the specific value should vary according to the diameter of the particles 3 3 the impact of solid phase on flow field fig 14 is the cloud diagram of the liquid phase velocity distribution at the outlet of the pipeline when the solid phase particle size d is 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm respectively as can be seen from the figure when the solid phase particle size is different the contour of the liquid phase velocity distribution at the outlet of the pipe is a non circular eccentric structure it indicates that the radial forces of the phases are not uniform the smaller the particle size the closer the liquid phase velocity distribution at the outlet of the pipeline is to the concentric circle as the particle size of the solid phase increases the central high speed region of the liquid phase gradually decreases and the velocity distribution on the cross section of the pipeline becomes uneven at this time the turbulence of the fluid in the central region is enhanced and the speed accumulation is accelerated fig 15 shows the distribution of the volume fraction of solid liquid gas phase at the outlet of the pipe when the solid phase particle size is 20 mm and the solid phase concentration is 10 20 and 30 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 that when the solid phase volume fraction is less than 10 there is no clear water ring at this time the vicinity of the pipe wall is a high concentration zone of gas solid two phases and the pipe transmission efficiency is not high this is because the solid phase volume concentration is small the particle spacing is large and the movement is relatively free when the particles move to and collide with the tube wall the momentum decreases and the velocity decreases to stay near the tube wall as the volume fraction of the solid phase increases the water ring begins to appear the gas ring disappears and the gas solid two phases are evenly distributed in the middle of the pipe at this time the average density of the fluid is reduced and the resistance loss is reduced which is favorable for pipeline transmission and conforms to an ideal flow state after the solid phase volume fraction is increased to 30 the fresh water ring begins to weaken and the flow state deteriorates therefore the solid volume fraction should be controlled between 10 and 30 fig 16 a and b show the effect of solid phase volume fraction and particle size on the pressure loss gradient of the pipeline respectively it can be seen from fig 16 a that under the four particle size conditions of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm the pressure loss gradient of the pipeline increases with the increase of the solid phase particle size but the difference is not large the pressure loss gradient of the pipeline increases with increasing solid phase volume fraction for every 1 increase in solid particle volume fraction the pressure loss gradient increases by about 65 pa m there are two reasons for the phenomenon shown in fig 16 on the one hand as the solid phase volume fraction increases the slurry density increases and the slurry potential energy loss increases on the other hand the larger the solid phase volume fraction the greater the solid phase density per unit volume of the pipeline the greater the probability of collision between particles and the greater the number of collisions and the greater the probability and the number of collisions between the particles and the pipe wall the greater the pressure loss the difference between the four fold lines in fig 16 a is not large indicating that the particle diameter has a small effect on the pressure gradient and the pressure loss gradient increases slightly with increasing particle diameter it is because the larger the particle diameter the larger the weight and the worse the follow ability moreover the greater the relative slip between the solid and liquid phases the greater the resulting pressure loss gradient the results of the study in fig 16 b show that for every 10 mm increase in solid phase particle diameter the pressure loss gradient increases by approximately 40 pa m taken together the effect of particle diameter is less than the effect of particle volume fraction on the pressure loss gradient 3 4 influence of different flow parameters on the flow pattern structure of the inlet section during the hydraulic lifting process of natural gas hydrate the fluid flow state in the pipeline especially the flow pattern structure of the fluid from two phase to three phase after the gas hydrate is decomposed has an important impact on the hydraulic efficiency of the pipeline chuanlin et al 2012 since the gas hydrate is likely to decompose at 510 m the pipeline at 510 m is used as the three phase flow inlet and the inlet 10 m upwards is used as the control fluid outlet the effect of different fluid parameters on the fluid flow pattern structure in the pipeline was studied in order to study the flow state of the mixed fluid in the lifting pipeline under different conditions the mixed reynolds number r em of the fluid is defined as 26 r em b g b l b s d v m where b is the apparent speed m s d is the inside diameter of the pipe m v m is the kinematic viscosity of the mixed fluid m2 s and the subscript g indicates the gas phase l indicates the liquid phase and s indicates the solid phase as the fluid moves the kinematic viscosity of the liquid phase in the mixed fluid is generally several orders of magnitude greater than that of the solid and gas phases in order to simplify the analysis the kinematic viscosity v l of the liquid phase is used instead of the kinematic viscosity v m of the mixed fluid according to the momentum theorem the mass conservation theorem and the energy conservation theorem the apparent velocities of the fluids in each phase in the pipeline under study should satisfy the constraint conditions shown in equation 27 and 28 chuanlin et al 2017 27 b l b s r l b l r s b s b l r l v l e b s r s v s e 0 28 p o mb g o 2 rtb s o r l b l 2 1 b g o b s o r l b s b s o b l b s b s o r g o v g o b l r l v l o b s o r s v s o 0 where ρ is the density kg m 3 v is the velocity m s p is the pressure pa m is the average molecular weight of the gas kg mol 1 r is the gas constant j mol k t is the thermodynamic temperature k β is the parts by volume and the subscript o indicates exit and e indicates entrance the calculation parameters and initial values are shown in table 6 during the calculation the pipeline under study is evenly divided into 10 000 sections each section is 1 mm long so as to ensure the calculation accuracy and save the calculation time given the initial value of b l set the pressure change between adjacent nodes in the gas liquid solid three phase section to be linear and calculate the apparent gas phase velocity bg solid phase apparent velocity b s at the outlet and the mixed reynolds number r em of the fluid the calculation results are shown in fig 17 fig 17 a shows the relationship between the apparent velocity of the liquid phase the apparent velocity of the solid phase and the apparent velocity of the gas phase fig 17 b shows the changes between the apparent velocity of the liquid phase the apparent velocity of the gas phase and the mixed reynolds number according to the above calculation results and calculation parameters numerical simulation is performed on the flow characteristics of the fluid in the pipeline under study the effects of different gas phase volume fractions and different inlet flow rates on the fluid structure in the pipeline were studied numerical simulation results are shown in fig 18 fig 18 a d show the distribution phase diagram of each phase about the three phase flow in the pipeline when the solid phase particles with a diameter of 0 02 m a concentration of 20 an inlet flow velocity of 2 m s and the gas phase volume fraction of 5 10 15 and 20 respectively fig 18 d g show the distribution phase diagram of each phase about the three phase flow in the pipeline when the diameter of the solid phase particles of the mixed fluid is 0 02 m the concentration is 20 the volume fraction of the gas phase is 20 and the inlet velocity is 2 m s 4 m s 6 m s and 10 m s respectively next based on the calculation results of fig 17 and the simulation results of fig 18 the flow pattern structure of the mixed fluid in the pipeline under study is specifically analyzed from the calculation results in fig 17 a it can be known that when the apparent velocity of the liquid phase is constant the apparent velocity of the solid phase increases first and then decreases with the increase of the gas phase expression speed the higher the apparent velocity of the liquid phase the higher the apparent velocity of the gas phase and the solid phase but the change law is non linear with the increase of the apparent velocity of the gas phase and the liquid phase the growth rate of the solid phase is suppressed and the increase of the mixed reynolds number is approximately linear from the calculation results in fig 17 b it can be known that when the liquid phase apparent velocity increases from 2 m s to 10 m s the minimum value of the mixed reynolds number is 1 5 104 and the maximum value is 1 75 105 according to the analysis results shown in fig 18 when the diameter of the solid phase particles is 0 02 m and the concentration is 20 the inlet flow rate is increased from 2 m s to 10 m s and the gas phase volume fraction is 5 10 15 and 20 respectively the fluid in the tube is in a turbulent state from fig 18 a when the gas phase volume fraction is 5 the gas phase and solid phase in the analysis pipeline are surrounded by the liquid phase and the mainstream is the liquid phase the flow pattern in the tube is bubble flow and small elastic flow when the gas phase volume fraction is increased to 10 as shown in fig 18 b the bubbles are discretely distributed in the pipe and the flow pattern in the pipe is mainly laminar wave flow and large elastic flow at the entrance of the pipeline since the kinetic energy obtained by the gas phase is much smaller than that of the liquid and solid phases bubbles begin to accumulate at the entrance which will have an inhibitory effect on the velocity of the solid phase at the entrance of the pipeline when the volume fraction of the gas phase increased to 15 as shown in fig 18 c the bubbles agglomerated in the pipe to form a circular flow the gas phase and the solid phase are dispersed and wrapped by the liquid phase the chance of the solid particles colliding with the pipe wall surface is small the energy loss is low and it is beneficial to the hydraulic improvement of the ore particles when the volume fraction of the gas phase is increased to 20 as shown in fig 18 d the flow pattern in the tube is mainly plunger flow and large bubble flow at the entrance of the pipeline a large area of gas plugs are likely to form at the entrance of the pipeline due to the large amount of air bubbles it will cause the surge phenomenon of the lift pump which will affect the life of the pump and the efficiency of the pipeline as shown in fig 18 e when the inlet flow rate is increased to 4 m s the fluid in the pipe is alternately distributed in a circular flow and a plunger flow when the solid particles are squeezed between the two fluid clusters the magnus force saffman force and basset force increased it has a certain destructive effect on the air bubbles which is conducive to reducing the occurrence of gas plugging however the collision between the solid particles and the tube wall is aggravated which increases the turbulence effect of the fluid and easily leads to a decrease in hydraulic efficiency as shown in fig 18 f when the inlet velocity increases to 6 m s the fluid in the pipeline is distributed in a continuous and circular pattern the solid phase particles are wrapped up by the liquid phase and the gas phase and rise upward with the fluid the lift and drag force are at an approximate equilibrium state at this time and the mixed fluid is in a relatively stable transmission state as shown in fig 18 g when the inlet flow velocity is increased to 10 m s due to the increase of the fluid velocity in the tube the effect of inertial force on the flow field is greater than the viscous force the fluid flow is extremely unstable and the irregular turbulent flow field is formed in the pipeline under the impact of the kinetic energy of the solid particles the bubble clusters around the liquid phase are crushed and the turbulence effect is strengthened the fluid is in a strong turbulent state in the pipeline and the flow pattern structure is mainly boiling flow at this time the energy loss of the fluid is large and the transmission efficiency is low which has a large adverse effect on the stability of the pipe connection structure and the life of the slurry pump it can be seen that when the inlet velocity increases from 6 m s to 10 m s the flow pattern of the fluid in the pipeline is transformed and a violent oscillation occurs within the fluid therefore when improving the transmission efficiency of the hydraulic lifting system it is necessary to carefully select the fluid inlet flow rate according to the operating parameters of the fluid 4 conclusion based on the basic principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics the mathematical modeling method was used to model the internal temperature and pressure model multiphase flow model and hydrate decomposition mass transfer model of hydraulic lifting pipeline the effects of outlet pressure and depth on the three phase flow field and natural gas hydrate interface were studied on this basis the numerical simulation and experimental verification of the three phase flow field of natural gas hydrate vertical pipeline are carried out the main findings are as follows 1 when the outlet pressure increases the hydrate begins to shift up and the decomposition speed slows down as the depth of mining increases the decomposition rate of hydrates slows down and the position at which decomposition begins to move up when hydrates are mined at depths below 1500 m the increase in mining depth has little effect on the rate of hydrate decomposition and the decomposition start position is always around 510 m 2 as the pipe diameter increases the three phases of the solid liquid gas are the highest in the center concentration and decrease in the radial direction the liquid ring and gas ring phenomenon occur during the homogenization of gas liquid two phases the average velocity of the liquid phase first increases and then decreases and the gas solid two phases are opposite to the liquid phase the pipe pressure loss gradient decreases as the pipe diameter increases after the pipe diameter is larger than 300 mm the pressure loss gradient decreases slowly and tends to be stable the pressure loss gradient drops sharply at 450 mm and eventually stabilizes again after 500 mm 3 when the inlet flow rate is low the flow is unstable and reflow occurs when the speed is increased to 2 5 m s the flow regime tends to be stable the liquid phase forms a clear water ring at the tube wall the particle phase is evenly distributed in the water ring and the gas phase forms a gas ring around the solid phase the inlet flow velocity of the pipe has a great influence on the flow pattern structure of the flow field in the pipe when the flow velocity increases to 10 m s the flow pattern in the tube is transformed the fluid is in a strong turbulent state the energy loss in the internal flow field increases and the transmission efficiency decreases credit authorship contribution statement wei chen writing original draft

21590,based on the basic principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics the temperature and pressure model of natural gas hydrate hydraulic lifting pipeline the hydrate decomposition mass transfer model and the mathematical model of pipeline multiphase flow are established the relationship between the back pressure of the pipeline outlet the decomposition surface and the depth of the seawater was analyzed on this basis the numerical simulation and experimental verification of natural gas hydrate pipeline transmission were carried out the effects of pipe diameter inlet velocity and solid phase parameters on the three phase flow of natural gas hydrate pipelines were analyzed the result shows that with the outlet pressure increasing the position at which the hydrate begins to decompose moves up and the decomposition rate slows down as the depth of mining increases the rate of hydrate decomposition slows and the position at which decomposition begins to move up in deep sea mining below 1500 m the increase of mining depth has little effect on the decomposition rate of hydrate and the decomposition starting position is always near 510 m in sea depth the pipe pressure loss gradient decreases as the pipe diameter increases after the pipe diameter is larger than 300 mm the pressure loss gradient decreases slowly and the pressure loss gradient drops sharply at 450 mm and eventually stabilizes after 500 mm when the inlet velocity of the pipe is low the fluid flow in the pipe is unstable and reflow occurs the pipe pressure loss gradient first decreases and then increases as the fluid flow rate increases and there is an optimal flow rate value that minimizes the pressure loss gradient keywords gas hydrate pipeline transmission solid liquid gas three phase flow numerical simulation pressure loss gradient natural gas hydrate also known as combustible ice which is considered to be the most ideal alternative energy source for the 21st century makogon et al 2007 currently the most promising method for commercial exploitation of submarine gas hydrates is the cutter suction mining method uchida et al 2006 hai liang et al 2018 hailiang et al 2019 makogon 2010 the cutter suction mining method is a kind of solid state mining method which is aimed at a digenetic hydrate deposit with a bare sea surface or a shallow cover layer the schematic diagram of the mining system is shown in fig 1 the specific working process of the mining system is as follows milkov 2000 submarine mining vehicles rely on the front cutter head to break up the hydrate deposits and pipette them into the auxiliary pump under the action of the auxiliary pump the granular hydrate is sent to the hose drawn by the buoyancy ball and then the particles enter the main slurry pump the high power main slurry pump draws hydrates into vertical pipes of several kilometers when it is lifted through the pipeline the tube flow pressure is lowered and the temperature is raised after reaching the critical surface the hydrate begins to decompose part of the methane to make the fluid into a solid liquid gas three phase flow after flowing through the bend at the exit it flows into the surface hydrate separator the decomposition of hydrates makes solid liquid two phase flow transportation into solid liquid gas three phase flow transportation which is very likely to cause a blowout accident safe mining and pipeline transportation are important issues in gas hydrate mining the study of gas hydrate decomposition sites and three phase flow in hydraulic lifting pipelines is critical for safe mining 7 8 wu chuanzhi and zhao zhenwei wu et al 2016 zhao and shang 2010 studied various heating methods and their advantages on the seabed and transmission pipelines during hydrate mining mitra majundar mitra majumdar et al 1997 used a multi fluid model numerical simulation to verify the three phase flow structure in a vertical pipe padial padial et al 2000 and other numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic behavior of solid liquid gas three phase flow in a riser bubble column based on the volume control method kassab kassab et al 2007 established a gasification performance prediction model for gas hydrate under three phase flow the model has higher prediction accuracy for gas liquid two phase flow and lower accuracy for three phase flow prediction kato kato et al 2008 and so on modeled the hydraulically enhanced natural gas hydrate mixed fluid and analyzed the system characteristics under different lifting distances and pipe diameters however the study did not consider the effects of bubble distribution and gas phase interaction li et al 2015 used the euler model and cfd pbm computational fluid dynamics population balance model abbreviated as cfd pbm model to simulate the three phase flow of natural gas hydrate in the hydraulic lifting pipeline under the larger gas phase volume fraction the results show that the flow distribution calculated

current force and intra tube fluid force by means of nonlinear finite element model wang z m wang et al 2010 and other high speed camera analysis obtained the velocity distribution of natural gas hydrate solid particles in vertical pipelines dzyuba a v dzyuba and zektser 2013a and other methods were used to analyze the distribution of the concentration of each phase of the solid liquid gas three phase flow of natural gas hydrate in vertical pipelines under different transport pipe diameters although these research results are lacking in accuracy and adaptability they have promoted the development of natural gas hydraulic lifting three phase flow research in summary the researchers have done a lot of work on the research of natural gas hydrate mining and pipeline transportation and have a deep understanding and understanding of the hydrate decomposition problem in the basic pipeline however the research on the position and influence law of the three phase flow decomposition surface of the hydrate pipeline is not sufficient the research on the solid liquid gas three phase flow of the pipeline transmission system is not comprehensive and the interface of the sea surface hydrate is not studied in depth the author of this article has designed the overall design of the cutter suction mining system by analyzing the lift of the pump it is concluded that the single stage large lift slurry pump can lift the seabed hydrate particles to the sea surface at one time xu et al 2016 2017 2018 the crushing capacity of the sea bottom reamer the cutter suction flow field and the cavitation performance of the multi stage slurry pump were studied the range of the solid phase particles particle size and solid phase volume fraction at the inlet of the pipeline was obtained zeng et al 2015 based on the previous research the paper establishes a mathematical model for the location of the decomposition surface of the weather hot water pipe the influence law of tube flow temperature tube flow pressure phase equilibrium pressure and pipeline transmission pressure loss gradient under different seawater depths was analyzed based on the calculation method provided by computational fluid dynamics the flow characteristics of gas hydrate three phase flow pipelines are studied by pipe diameter inlet velocity and solid phase parameters and experimental verification is carried out the flow field characteristics of the three phase flow decomposition surface of the pipeline and the flow field in the pipeline are obtained which provides a theoretical basis for the system design of gas hydrate three phase flow pipeline transmission 1 analysis of the decomposition surface of natural gas hydrate pipeline 1 1 basic assumptions according to the actual mining conditions of natural gas hydrates in the theoretical analysis the following assumptions are made on the calculation conditions 1 the heat transfer coefficient of the pipe at different positions is constant and the cutting heat transfer of the reamer is not considered 2 after the crushing the natural gas deposit particles are uniform spherulites and the solid liquid two phases are incompressible steady flow 3 the gas obeys the redlich kwong equation of state referred to as the r k equation redlich and kwong 1949 1 2 mathematical model 1 2 1 seawater temperature model when the water in the pipeline increases the natural gas hydrate the temperature of the mixed fluid at the inlet is the same as the seabed temperature and changes with the heat transfer during the upward transfer the seawater is divided into a mixed layer a thermo cline and a constant temperature layer and the temperature decreases as the depth of the seawater increases alari et al 2016 the mixing layer has a depth of 20 200 m and the temperature in this layer changes uniformly the temperature change of the next layer of thermocline is more obvious and the temperature of the seawater in the lowermost constant temperature layer decreases more smoothly with little change at depths below 2000 m seawater remains at a low temperature throughout the year li et al 2018 the temperature distribution of

order to make the mining safe and controllable a back pressure device is added initial attempts were made to select outlet back pressures of 2 mpa 1 mpa 0 mpa 1 mpa and 2 mpa for analysis 1 4 result analysis 1 4 1 influence of outlet pressure on flow field in pipeline at the exit of the natural gas hydrate mining pipeline there are gas collection devices hydrate decomposition devices etc for well control safety pressure is often applied at the outlet of the pipeline ie outlet back pressure zhao et al 2015 the influence of outlet back pressure on the flow field in the pipeline was analyzed when the outlet back pressure was 2 mpa 1 mpa 0 mpa 1 mpa and 2 mpa fig 3 shows the relationship between the seawater temperature tw the tube flow temperature t and the water depth h under different outlet back pressures in fig 3 the subscript 2 1 0 1 and 2 of t represent the back pressure value respectively it can be seen from the analysis results shown in fig 3 that the higher the pressure the higher the temperature this is because the tube flow temperature is mainly related to the heat generation caused by frictional heat generation hydrate phase change heat and temperature difference between the inside and outside of the pipeline the greater the pressure the larger the friction coefficient the more frictional heat generation the smaller the convection coefficient the greater the heat conduction and the higher the tube flow temperature as shown in fig 3 the curves are approximately coincident which indicates that the tube flow temperature changes less under different back pressure conditions fig 4 shows the relationship between the tube flow pressure p the phase equilibrium pressure p eq and the water depth h under different outlet back pressures it can be seen from fig 4 that the intersection point of the phase equilibrium pressure and the tube flow pressure decreases as the back pressure decreases indicating that the hydrate decomposition surface accelerates to sink as the back pressure decreases when the phase equilibrium pressure is lowered the decomposition surface rises this indicates that the outlet back pressure has a great influence on the decomposition position of the hydrate therefore the outlet back pressure is also an important parameter for regulating the decomposition position of the hydrate in the pipeline and ensuring the safe and controllable gas hydrate transmission fig 5 shows the relationship between the single gas hydrate particle decomposition surface ds depth surface and the amount of substance n and the water depth h under different back pressures it can be seen from fig 5 that the greater the back pressure of the pipe outlet the closer the hydrate decomposition surface is to the sea surface under the influence of positive pressure on the outlet the gas hydrate particles are not completely decomposed and the larger the positive pressure the more the residual amount the slower the decomposition rate under the influence of the outlet negative pressure the hydrate particles have completely decomposed before reaching the sea surface and the larger the absolute value of the negative pressure the faster the decomposition speed 1 4 2 influence of mineral depth on pipeline flow field natural gas hydrate mining vehicles can move freely on the seabed to accommodate the depth of the deposit and analyze deposits with depths of 4000 m 3000 m 2000 m and 1000 m fig 6 shows the relationship between seawater temperature t w tube flow temperature t and water depth h at different depths of mineral deposits it can be seen from fig 6 that at a depth of 2000 m or more the temperature difference between the seawater and the tube flow is large the heat transfer efficiency is higher and the temperature of the inlet water of the tube inlet is higher than the temperature raised from the deeper to the same depth below 2000 m the depth of the deposit increases and the friction inside the pipe increases while mining but the impact is small below 2000m the temperature lines of each tube flow almost coincide and the deeper the depth the higher the degree of coincidence which indicates that the increase in mining depth in the depth of the ocean has little effect on the tube flow temperature fig 7 shows the relationship between tube flow pressure p phase equilibrium pressure p eq and water depth h at different depths of mineral deposits it can be seen from fig 7 that as the depth of the deposit increases the intersection of the pressure lines rises as the depth of the mineral deposit deepens the distance between the phase equilibrium pressure curve and the tube flow pressure curve moves up indicating that the hydrate decomposition position rises slowly below 1500 m sea water depth the increase in mining depth has little effect on the rate of hydrate decomposition and the decomposition start position is always at a depth of 510 m 2 numerical simulation of three phase flow in natural gas hydrate vertical pipeline based on the calculation method provided by computational fluid dynamics the fluent software is used to simulate the three phase flow of the bubble compression section pipeline study the influence of the pipe diameter inlet flow rate and solid phase concentration of the transmission system on the flow field 2 1 basic assumptions according to the actual working conditions of the deep sea mining system operation combined with the principle of hydraulic transmission taking into account the limitations of numerical calculation and the feasibility of regular analysis the following assumptions are made 1 the solid phase and the liquid phase are continuous incompressible fluids the gas phase obeys the r k equation of state 2 the main phase is seawater the secondary phase is hydrate deposit particles and the third phase is methane both the solid phase particles and the gas phase bubbles are spherical 2 2 model and meshing in the numerical simulation for the solid liquid gas three phase flow of the compression section the liquid phase volume fraction is high the three phases are full of the flow field and the interaction between the phases is continuous and the euler eulerian model is selected the model considers the interactions between different phases and each of them is solved separately which satisfies the independent conservation equation zhong et al 2016 stabile et al 2017 the continuity equation for each phase is 22 ρ q t ρ q u q i x i 0 where ρ is the density kg m3 q is the phase code g is the gas phase l is the liquid

mass force of fluid micelles n m3 c v is the volume fraction and u d is the slip speed m s because the research object is a vertical pipeline three phase flow with a small amount of bubbles the structure is simple and there is no obvious swirl in the flow field so a standard turbulence model with a wide range of applications is selected 24 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ i α k k x j g k ρ ε 25 ρ ε

compressible turbulent pulsation expansion on total dissipation rate α k is the reciprocal of the effective prandtl number of the kinetic energy and α ε is the reciprocal of the effective prandtl number of the turbulent dissipation rate before the numerical simulation of the flow field the watershed needs to be meshed common grids have structured grids and unstructured grids the adjacent elements of the internal nodes of the structured grid are the same and the speed quality and precision of the generated grid are higher which is closer to the actual model wiesenberger et al 2018 the vertical cross section o type division of the vertical pipe was carried out by using the icem integrated computer engineering and manufacturing code software and the boundary layer was encrypted using the exponential rule and the mesh quality inspection was performed fig 8 shows the pipe model and cross section meshing the cross section was enlarged by 20 times 2 3 model validation 2 3 1 experimental program the experimental system adopts the deep sea mining experimental system of china national key laboratory of deep sea mineral resources development and utilization with a vertical height of 30 m and a pipe diameter of 200 mm the system can simulate the submarine ore hydraulic transmission of 5000 m deep by applying back pressure at the outlet end the working principle diagram of the experimental platform is shown in fig 9 since submarine gas hydrates and synthetic natural gas hydrates are relatively difficult to obtain in order to simplify the experiment the nodule particles with a density of 1679 kg m3 are used to simulate the solid phase in the natural gas hydrate and the gas is injected into the pipeline by artificial gas addition during the experiment the volume fraction of the bubbles in the pipe was controlled by adjusting the throttle valve on the pump injection device the diameter of the bubble in the pipe is controlled by adjusting the back pressure of the pipe outlet to control the gas phase volume fraction and diameter within a certain range the lift pump is a two stage slurry pump that controls the flow of the pump by adjusting the speed of the slurry pump to control the flow rate in order to achieve gas addition a gas source inlet is installed at the junction of the elbow and the vertical pipe on the working platform and the airflow moves vertically upward along the pipe axis 2 3 2 experimental procedure first add the tuberculosis pellets given in the experiment to the silo and fill the tank with water then start the two stage slurry pump to pump the clean water from the water bag into the riser after the outlet water at the outlet of the pipeline is stable adjust the inverter to stabilize it at the required flow rate start the feeder and control the volume fraction of the solid phase particles at the bottom of the riser by adjusting the speed of the feeder after the flow field is stabilized the air pump is turned on and the flow rate is adjusted to a certain speed to introduce gas into the middle of the pipe the parameters are adjusted to the required conditions by observing the instrument data of the experimental system experimental data under different control variables is obtained by changing different parameters 2 3 3 analysis of experimental results change the back pressure of the pipe outlet and measure the pressure loss of 5 m above and below the glass pipe of the experimental system for each experiment the experimental values and simulation results of different tube flow velocity solid phase volume fraction particle size and gas phase volume fraction are shown in tables 1 3 it can be seen from the above experimental results that the experimental and simulation laws are consistent and the relative error is small all within 10 this proves that the calculation model and simulation method used in this paper are feasible 3 numerical simulation results analysis 3 1 influence of pipe diameter on flow field the pipe diameter is different the distribution of each phase in the pipeline the flow velocity of each phase etc will be affected and the pipeline pressure loss will also be affected refer to the current large medium and small models of the cutter suction dredger the diameter of the small dredger is about 250 mm the diameter of the medium dredger is about 300 mm and the diameter of the large dredger is about 500 mm liu 2009 the pipe diameter of each phase of the pipeline is compared and analyzed by selecting the pipe diameter of 100 700 m pipe length flow rate solid phase and gas phase parameters are shown in table 4 the effect of pipe diameter on the volume fraction of each phase was analyzed at 100 mm 300 mm 500 mm and 700 mm fig 10 shows the cloud distribution of the volume fraction of each phase when the pipe diameters are different it can be clearly seen from fig 10 that the proportion of the liquid phase seawater at the wall of the pipe is the largest forming a clear water ring as can be seen from fig 10 the proportion of the fresh water ring decreases as the diameter of the pipe increases the concentration gradient also decreased significantly with increasing tube diameter from 41 93 52 to 22 86 74 that is to say as the diameter of the pipe increases the liquid phase distribution is more uniform the process of homogenization is also the process of gradually decreasing the volume fraction gradient this is because the larger the pipe diameter the larger the curvature the smaller the boundary layer overlap region and the smaller the influence range so the smaller the proportion of the water ring the weaker the influence of the boundary layer and the smaller the numerical gradient of the volume fraction the pipe diameter increased from 100 mm to 700 mm and the solid phase concentration gradient decreased from 22 34 12 to 11 27 16 when the pipe diameter is increased to 300 mm the solid phase homogenization is basically completed and the uniformization area is over 90 in addition the manner in which the solid phase is homogenized is not consistent with the liquid phase the liquid phase diffuses from the high concentration zone of the pipe wall to the center of the pipe and the solid phase is the highest concentration from the middle and diffuses radially toward the pipe wall in the process of homogenizing the two phases of solid and liquid it can be clearly seen that in the 300 mm pipe diameter a ring like agglomeration occurs in the gas phase at a pipe diameter of 100 mm the gas phase distribution in the middle of the pipe has a high volume fraction and a low volume fraction at the pipe wall when the pipe diameter increases to about 300 mm the gas phase volume fraction is no longer the highest in the middle but a concentration collapse zone appears in the middle and the gas ring with the highest gas phase volume fraction is formed around the collapse zone inside the liquid ring after more than 300 mm the gas ring disappears and the gas phase is gradually unstable fig 11 shows the variation of pressure loss gradient with pipe diameter under different operating parameters flow rate particle size solid phase volume fraction bubble average diameter gas phase volume fraction it can be seen from the calculation results shown in fig 11 that the influence of velocity on the pressure loss gradient is smaller than the influence of the gas solid two phases volume fraction on the pressure loss gradient when the pipe diameter is between 100 mm and 300 mm the smaller the pipe diameter the greater the gradient of pipe pressure loss this is because the main flow area of the pipe center is small the wall effect is obvious and the frictional resistance loss between the pipe wall and each phase accounts for a large proportion resulting in a large pressure loss gradient with the diameter of the pipe increasing the contact area of the fluid per unit volume with the pipe decreases the friction area between the phases of the fluid and the pipe wall decreases the collision probability decreases and the pressure loss gradient decreases when the pipe diameter is between 300 mm and 450 mm the pressure loss gradient tends to be gentle this is because the solid liquid two phase influence is large at this time and the solid liquid two phase flow plays a leading role at this time the frictional resistance loss of the pipe wall and the collision loss with the particles account for the total pressure loss ratio and the solid liquid two phases in the mixed fluid reach a relative equilibrium state and the pressure loss gradient is at a relatively low value when the pipe diameter is larger than 450 mm the pressure loss gradient begins to drop sharply and reaches a steady state again after 500 mm this is because the drag reduction effect of the gas phase in the mixed fluid is optimal the pipe diameter is matched with the optimal pressure loss gradient of the three phase flow in the pipe and the total pressure loss of the fluid is minimized from this it can be judged that after the pipe diameter is larger than 500 mm the influence of the increase of the pipe diameter on the gradient of the pipe flow pressure loss is negligible combined with the variation of the volume fraction of each phase it can be seen that the moment when the total pressure loss of the fluid reaches relatively stable is the time when the liquid ring appears and the gas ring disappears therefore the appearance and disappearance of the liquid ring and the gas ring can be initially judged and the state of the pipeline pressure loss can be predicted 3 2 influence of inlet velocity on flow field when the fluid is transported vertically upwards the fluid flow rate is generally greater than three times the particle settling velocity goyal 2010 calculated by the settlement velocity calculation formula u t π g d s ρ s ρ l 6 φ ρ l the velocity should be greater than 1 01 m s 1 42 m s 1 74 m s when transporting 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm diameter particles the pipe diameter is 500 mm by changing the inlet flow rate of the pipe the remaining parameters are as shown in table 5 and the flow patterns of the various phases in the pipe are analyzed fig 12 is a volume fraction distribution diagram of each phase of the pipe outlet when the fluid inlet velocity is 1 m s 2 m s 4 m s and 6 m s respectively it can be seen from fig 12 that the distribution of the phases in the pipeline is confusing when the speed is too small this is because the speed is too small and the power is insufficient under the combined action of gravity pressure gradient force radial force etc the liquid phase is large and small when the force is applied and the resultant force swings to the left and right resulting in acceleration and speed also being large and small the particles are affected by the liquid phase and the motion path deviates from the center of the pipe and the reflow phenomenon is obvious part of the liquid phase is close to the tube wall and part of the solid phase is close to the tube wall showing flow instability as the flow rate increases the liquid phase forms a water ring at the tube wall the solid phase is evenly distributed in the clean water ring and the gas phase forms a ring like aggregate around the solid phase this is because as the speed increases the resultant force of the pressure gradient force and buoyancy begins to be greater than gravity and the upward force dominates at the same time the role of the radial force in the gas phase is relatively obvious forming a gas ring at this point both the liquid ring and the gas ring are present achieving a relatively good state of drag reduction before the speed increases to 4 m s the water ring begins to expand inward and the gas ring disappears at this time the gas solid two phases are evenly distributed in the center of the pipe as the flow rate continues to increase the solid phase distribution becomes chaotic and the water ring continues to expand inward this is because the upward lift is far greater than the force of gravity resistance etc and as the reynolds number increases the solid liquid two phases are greatly affected by the turbulence resulting in uneven distribution of the solid liquid two phases fig 13 shows the variation of the pressure loss gradient with the fluid flow rate at different inlet velocities it can be seen from the analysis results of fig 13 that the influence of the solid phase particles on the pressure loss is greater than the influence of the fluid flow rate and the average diameter of the bubbles is 5 mm which has a certain drag reducing effect the pressure drop gradient of the pipeline decreases first and then increases with the increase of the fluid flow rate and there is an optimal speed interval corresponding to the minimum pressure loss the existence of the optimal speed interval indicates that the effect of fluid flow rate on the pressure loss of the pipeline is two sided 1 when the fluid velocity is lower than the optimum flow rate the gravity is significantly affected the liquid phase dragging solid phase ability is insufficient and the relative slip between the particle phase and the liquid phase becomes large when the particle velocity is low the solid phase falls down significantly and the number of particle collisions increases resulting in an increase in the pressure loss gradient 2 when the flow rate is higher than the optimal flow rate the particle velocity is large the inertia is large the collision probability between the particles and between the particles and the pipe is increased and the pressure loss is increased in fig 13 the velocity of the falling section of the curve is much larger than that of the rising section reflecting the greater influence of relative slip at low speed at low speeds there may even be a backflow that can cause damage to the pump the pressure loss gradient is minimal when the fluid velocity is in the optimal flow rate range the difference in the optimal speed range is due to the difference in particle diameter the larger the particle diameter the heavier the particles under the same density conditions and the greater the sedimentation rate the greater the optimum flow rate considering the ability of the natural gas hydrate mining system to transmit water the fluid flow rate should be between 2 and 4 m s and the specific value should vary according to the diameter of the particles 3 3 the impact of solid phase on flow field fig 14 is the cloud diagram of the liquid phase velocity distribution at the outlet of the pipeline when the solid phase particle size d is 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm respectively as can be seen from the figure when the solid phase particle size is different the contour of the liquid phase velocity distribution at the outlet of the pipe is a non circular eccentric structure it indicates that the radial forces of the phases are not uniform the smaller the particle size the closer the liquid phase velocity distribution at the outlet of the pipeline is to the concentric circle as the particle size of the solid phase increases the central high speed region of the liquid phase gradually decreases and the velocity distribution on the cross section of the pipeline becomes uneven at this time the turbulence of the fluid in the central region is enhanced and the speed accumulation is accelerated fig 15 shows the distribution of the volume fraction of solid liquid gas phase at the outlet of the pipe when the solid phase particle size is 20 mm and the solid phase concentration is 10 20 and 30 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 that when the solid phase volume fraction is less than 10 there is no clear water ring at this time the vicinity of the pipe wall is a high concentration zone of gas solid two phases and the pipe transmission efficiency is not high this is because the solid phase volume concentration is small the particle spacing is large and the movement is relatively free when the particles move to and collide with the tube wall the momentum decreases and the velocity decreases to stay near the tube wall as the volume fraction of the solid phase increases the water ring begins to appear the gas ring disappears and the gas solid two phases are evenly distributed in the middle of the pipe at this time the average density of the fluid is reduced and the resistance loss is reduced which is favorable for pipeline transmission and conforms to an ideal flow state after the solid phase volume fraction is increased to 30 the fresh water ring begins to weaken and the flow state deteriorates therefore the solid volume fraction should be controlled between 10 and 30 fig 16 a and b show the effect of solid phase volume fraction and particle size on the pressure loss gradient of the pipeline respectively it can be seen from fig 16 a that under the four particle size conditions of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm the pressure loss gradient of the pipeline increases with the increase of the solid phase particle size but the difference is not large the pressure loss gradient of the pipeline increases with increasing solid phase volume fraction for every 1 increase in solid particle volume fraction the pressure loss gradient increases by about 65 pa m there are two reasons for the phenomenon shown in fig 16 on the one hand as the solid phase volume fraction increases the slurry density increases and the slurry potential energy loss increases on the other hand the larger the solid phase volume fraction the greater the solid phase density per unit volume of the pipeline the greater the probability of collision between particles and the greater the number of collisions and the greater the probability and the number of collisions between the particles and the pipe wall the greater the pressure loss the difference between the four fold lines in fig 16 a is not large indicating that the particle diameter has a small effect on the pressure gradient and the pressure loss gradient increases slightly with increasing particle diameter it is because the larger the particle diameter the larger the weight and the worse the follow ability moreover the greater the relative slip between the solid and liquid phases the greater the resulting pressure loss gradient the results of the study in fig 16 b show that for every 10 mm increase in solid phase particle diameter the pressure loss gradient increases by approximately 40 pa m taken together the effect of particle diameter is less than the effect of particle volume fraction on the pressure loss gradient 3 4 influence of different flow parameters on the flow pattern structure of the inlet section during the hydraulic lifting process of natural gas hydrate the fluid flow state in the pipeline especially the flow pattern structure of the fluid from two phase to three phase after the gas hydrate is decomposed has an important impact on the hydraulic efficiency of the pipeline chuanlin et al 2012 since the gas hydrate is likely to decompose at 510 m the pipeline at 510 m is used as the three phase flow inlet and the inlet 10 m upwards is used as the control fluid outlet the effect of different fluid parameters on the fluid flow pattern structure in the pipeline was studied in order to study the flow state of the mixed fluid in the lifting pipeline under different conditions the mixed reynolds number r em of the fluid is defined as 26 r em b g b l b s d v m where b is the apparent speed m s d is the inside diameter of the pipe m v m is the kinematic viscosity of the mixed fluid m2 s and the subscript g indicates the gas phase l indicates the liquid phase and s indicates the solid phase as the fluid moves the kinematic viscosity of the liquid phase in the mixed fluid is generally several orders of magnitude greater than that of the solid and gas phases in order to simplify the analysis the kinematic viscosity v l of the liquid phase is used instead of the kinematic viscosity v m of the mixed fluid according to the momentum theorem the mass conservation theorem and the energy conservation theorem the apparent velocities of the fluids in each phase in the pipeline under study should satisfy the constraint conditions shown in equation 27 and 28 chuanlin et al 2017 27 b l b s r l b l r s b s b l r l v l e b s r s v s e 0

the average molecular weight of the gas kg mol 1 r is the gas constant j mol k t is the thermodynamic temperature k β is the parts by volume and the subscript o indicates exit and e indicates entrance the calculation parameters and initial values are shown in table 6 during the calculation the pipeline under study is evenly divided into 10 000 sections each section is 1 mm long so as to ensure the calculation accuracy and save the calculation time given the initial value of b l set the pressure change between adjacent nodes in the gas liquid solid three phase section to be linear and calculate the apparent gas phase velocity bg solid phase apparent velocity b s at the outlet and the mixed reynolds number r em of the fluid the calculation results are shown in fig 17 fig 17 a shows the relationship between the apparent velocity of the liquid phase the apparent velocity of the solid phase and the apparent velocity of the gas phase fig 17 b shows the changes between the apparent velocity of the liquid phase the apparent velocity of the gas phase and the mixed reynolds number according to the above calculation results and calculation parameters numerical simulation is performed on the flow characteristics of the fluid in the pipeline under study the effects of different gas phase volume fractions and different inlet flow rates on the fluid structure in the pipeline were studied numerical simulation results are shown in fig 18 fig 18 a d show the distribution phase diagram of each phase about the three phase flow in the pipeline when the solid phase particles with a diameter of 0 02 m a concentration of 20 an inlet flow velocity of 2 m s and the gas phase volume fraction of 5 10 15 and 20 respectively fig 18 d g show the distribution phase diagram of each phase about the three phase flow in the pipeline when the diameter of the solid phase particles of the mixed fluid is 0 02 m the concentration is 20 the volume fraction of the gas phase is 20 and the inlet velocity is 2 m s 4 m s 6 m s and 10 m s respectively next based on the calculation results of fig 17 and the simulation results of fig 18 the flow pattern structure of the mixed fluid in the pipeline under study is specifically analyzed from the calculation results in fig 17 a it can be known that when the apparent velocity of the liquid phase is constant the apparent velocity of the solid phase increases first and then decreases with the increase of the gas phase expression speed the higher the apparent velocity of the liquid phase the higher the apparent velocity of the gas phase and the solid phase but the change law is non linear with the increase of the apparent velocity of the gas phase and the liquid phase the growth rate of the solid phase is suppressed and the increase of the mixed reynolds number is approximately linear from the calculation results in fig 17 b it can be known that when the liquid phase apparent velocity increases from 2 m s to 10 m s the minimum value of the mixed reynolds number is 1 5 104 and the maximum value is 1 75 105 according to the analysis results shown in fig 18 when the diameter of the solid phase particles is 0 02 m and the concentration is 20 the inlet flow rate is increased from 2 m s to 10 m s and the gas phase volume fraction is 5 10 15 and 20 respectively the fluid in the tube is in a turbulent state from fig 18 a when the gas phase volume fraction is 5 the gas phase and solid phase in the analysis pipeline are surrounded by the liquid phase and the mainstream is the liquid phase the flow pattern in the tube is bubble flow and small elastic flow when the gas phase volume fraction is increased to 10 as shown in fig 18 b the bubbles are discretely distributed in the pipe and the flow pattern in the pipe is mainly laminar wave flow and large elastic flow at the entrance of the pipeline since the kinetic energy obtained by the gas phase is much smaller than that of the liquid and solid phases bubbles begin to accumulate at the entrance which will have an inhibitory effect on the velocity of the solid phase at the entrance of the pipeline when the volume fraction of the gas phase increased to 15 as shown in fig 18 c the bubbles agglomerated in the pipe to form a circular flow the gas phase and the solid phase are dispersed and wrapped by the liquid phase the chance of the solid particles colliding with the pipe wall surface is small the energy loss is low and it is beneficial to the hydraulic improvement of the ore particles when the volume fraction of the gas phase is increased to 20 as shown in fig 18 d the flow pattern in the tube is mainly plunger flow and large bubble flow at the entrance of the pipeline a large area of gas plugs are likely to form at the entrance of the pipeline due to the large amount of air bubbles it will cause the surge phenomenon of the lift pump which will affect the life of the pump and the efficiency of the pipeline as shown in fig 18 e when the inlet flow rate is increased to 4 m s the fluid in the pipe is alternately distributed in a circular flow and a plunger flow when the solid particles are squeezed between the two fluid clusters the magnus force saffman force and basset force increased it has a certain destructive effect on the air bubbles which is conducive to reducing the occurrence of gas plugging however the collision between the solid particles and the tube wall is aggravated which increases the turbulence effect of the fluid and easily leads to a decrease in hydraulic efficiency as shown in fig 18 f when the inlet velocity increases to 6 m s the fluid in the pipeline is distributed in a continuous and circular pattern the solid phase particles are wrapped up by the liquid phase and the gas phase and rise upward with the fluid the lift and drag force are at an approximate equilibrium state at this time and the mixed fluid is in a relatively stable transmission state as shown in fig 18 g when the inlet flow velocity is increased to 10 m s due to the increase of the fluid velocity in the tube the effect of inertial force on the flow field is greater than the viscous force the fluid flow is extremely unstable and the irregular turbulent flow field is formed in the pipeline under the impact of the kinetic energy of the solid particles the bubble clusters around the liquid phase are crushed and the turbulence effect is strengthened the fluid is in a strong turbulent state in the pipeline and the flow pattern structure is mainly boiling flow at this time the energy loss of the fluid is large and the transmission efficiency is low which has a large adverse effect on the stability of the pipe connection structure and the life of the slurry pump it can be seen that when the inlet velocity increases from 6 m s to 10 m s the flow pattern of the fluid in the pipeline is transformed and a violent oscillation occurs within the fluid therefore when improving the transmission efficiency of the hydraulic lifting system it is necessary to carefully select the fluid inlet flow rate according to the operating parameters of the fluid 4 conclusion based on the basic principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics the mathematical modeling method was used to model the internal temperature and pressure model multiphase flow model and hydrate decomposition mass transfer model of hydraulic lifting pipeline the effects of outlet pressure and depth on the three phase flow field and natural gas hydrate interface were studied on this basis the numerical simulation and experimental verification of the three phase flow field of natural gas hydrate vertical pipeline are carried out the main findings are as follows 1 when the outlet pressure increases the hydrate begins to shift up and the decomposition speed slows down as the depth of mining increases the decomposition rate of hydrates slows down and the position at which decomposition begins to move up when hydrates are mined at depths below 1500 m the increase in mining depth has little effect on the rate of hydrate decomposition and the decomposition start position is always around 510 m 2 as the pipe diameter increases the three phases of the solid liquid gas are the highest in the center concentration and decrease in the radial direction the liquid ring and gas ring phenomenon occur during the homogenization of gas liquid two phases the average velocity of the liquid phase first increases and then decreases and the gas solid two phases are opposite to the liquid phase the pipe pressure loss gradient decreases as the pipe diameter increases after the pipe diameter is larger than 300 mm the pressure loss gradient decreases slowly and tends to be stable the pressure loss gradient drops sharply at 450 mm and eventually stabilizes again after 500 mm 3 when the inlet flow rate is low the flow is unstable and reflow occurs when the speed is increased to 2 5 m s the flow regime tends to be stable the liquid phase forms a clear water ring at the tube wall the particle phase is evenly distributed in the water ring and the gas phase forms a gas ring around the solid phase the inlet flow velocity of the pipe has a great influence on the flow pattern structure of the flow field in the pipe when the flow velocity increases to 10 m s the flow pattern in the tube is transformed the fluid is in a strong turbulent state the energy loss in the internal flow field increases and the transmission efficiency decreases credit authorship contribution statement wei chen writing original draft

the most widely used turbulence models which are zero equation one equation two equation stress equation and algebraic stress models he also expressed that further studies about the rans models can make remarkable contributions to the field of turbulence modeling generally turbulence models aim to transform the original unsteady navier stokes equations by the addition of averaged and fluctuating terms to develop the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations turbulence models are implemented for determining the pressure gradient in both single phase and slurry flow in this study the performance of turbulence models for estimating pressure losses in single phase flow and slurry flow through closed conduits is investigated single phase flow is encountered in pipe flow as well as annular flow rough pipes are used in almost every field of industry such as in water supply sewerage systems energy systems heating and cooling systems vijiapurapu and cui 2010 analyzed the

measurements recorded by nourmohammadi et al 1985 and other numerical data published in the literature unger and friedrich 1991 zagarola and smits 1997 annular flow takes place between two pipes and has many applications in the chemical process oil industry particularly in drilling and cementing operations a numerical and experimental study was performed by erge et al 2016 to investigate the flow of newtonian and non newtonian fluids in annuli and to predict the annular frictional pressure losses with and without pipe rotation the results obtained from the numerical model offers a good compromise with the experiments and the experimental data from the literature kelessidis et al 2011 studied experimentally to predict the pressure losses of fluids in concentric and eccentric annuli in laminar transitional and turbulent flows they obtained good agreement when compared to the results from the experiments with the model results presented formerly for concentric annulus the significant results for the eccentric annulus were accomplished when corrected by using correlations from the published literature for eccentricity the slurry flow in pipelines is also seen in various industrial operations such as dredging construction of dams design of storm sewers culverts coal and ore transport and chemical process dredging and construction of hydraulic fill dams are the most important applications of sediment transport through pipes garde 1956 ling et al 2003 conducted a numerical study related to the sand water slurry flow by using a 3d algebraic slip mixture asm method with rng κ ϵ turbulence model they compared the calculated data with the measured data and obtained significant results they also made some important contributions to the slurry flow characteristics kökpınar and göğüş 2001 developed a new empirical correlation for estimating the critical flow velocity of slurry transport in horizontal pipelines they conducted experimental and theoretical studies the results of the empirical correlation were adequately accurate when compared with the observed data it was concluded that the proposed equation could be used for the noncohesive uniform and nonuniform coarse particles reliably ting et al 2019 studied the behavior of the fully suspended slurry flow in the horizontal pipeline they used the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and the delft head loss limit deposit velocity dhlldv method to estimate the hydraulic gradient and concentration distribution the results obtained from the models gave very good agreement when compared with

the simulation results with the experimental data available in the literature numerical simulations found out the mean velocity mean concentration and mean pressure gradient they presented that the simulation results gave good agreement arolla and desjardins 2015 although there are contradictory findings from different studies it is known that fluid rheology controls the small cuttings transport whereas large sediment transport is mainly led by fluid flow rate when examining the particle sizes kelin et al 2013 akshik et al akhshik et al 2015 analyzed the dynamic behavior of particles by simulating the dynamic collision process that occurs during sediment transport they used both computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method walker and li 2000 presented a study covering the effects of different particle sizes fluid rheology and pipe eccentricity they deduced that the fluid rheology plays an important role for solids transport and the results of the investigation of particle size showed that when the borehole is at various inclined angles for particles up to 7 mm in diameter there was a significant effect on solids transport they also remarked that fine particles are the easiest to clean out and spherical particles with an average size of 0 76 mm pose the greatest difficulty for solids transport the importance of the particle size in sediment transport was discussed by duan et al 2006 they pointed out that the smaller sediment particles are more difficult to transport than larger sediment particles in a horizontal annulus mishra 2007 studied with small 3 mm and large particle 8 mm sizes to investigate their effect on sediment transport in horizontal and deviated wells he observed that the increasing flow rate has a significant cleaning effect for larger particles when compared to smaller particles and using water as the drilling fluid sediment transport was easier for larger particles than smaller ones sanchez et al 1997 also indicated that the larger particles transported easier than smaller particles and they emphasized that the sediment particle size was effective when the thicker mud was used on the contrary martins et al 1996 stated that the smaller particles were transported easier than the larger particles similarly peden et al 1990 observed that the smaller cuttings are transported most efficiently at all angles of deviation when using low viscosity fluids although larger particles are transported most efficiently with high viscosity fluids between the angles of 0 and 50 in this study the performances of turbulence models

analyze the deviation in turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate eddy viscosity and turbulent intensity with the increase in reynolds number for each numerical model they inferred that the standard k ε model gave the most appropriate results the swirling flow in a straight pipe was investigated numerically with the help of computational fluid dynamics cfd by escue and cui 2010 they used two different turbulence models which were rng κ ϵ and reynolds stress model and compared the results with the experimental data available in the literature brown et al brown et al 2018 analyzed which turbulence model was better at predicting the time averaged flow field in the industrial crystallizer they used the κ ϵ rng κ ϵ sst ssg reynolds stress and explicit algebraic reynolds stress models

performed rans turbulence models for single phase flow in pipes to consider the effects of the different turbulence models and different pipe diameters they compared the results with experimental data from the literature to provide an estimation of turbulence effects many cfd researchers focused on turbulence modeling in various engineering fields menter 1994 huang et al 2019 mor yossef 2019 ouyang

the most widely used turbulence models which are zero equation one equation two equation stress equation and algebraic stress models he also expressed that further studies about the rans models can make remarkable contributions to the field of turbulence modeling generally turbulence models aim to transform the original unsteady navier stokes equations by the addition of averaged and fluctuating terms to develop the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations turbulence models are implemented for determining the pressure gradient in both single phase and slurry flow in this study the performance of turbulence models for estimating pressure losses in single phase flow and slurry flow through closed conduits is investigated single phase flow is encountered in pipe flow as well as annular flow rough pipes are used in almost every field of industry such as in water supply sewerage systems energy systems heating and cooling systems vijiapurapu and cui 2010 analyzed the

measurements recorded by nourmohammadi et al 1985 and other numerical data published in the literature unger and friedrich 1991 zagarola and smits 1997 annular flow takes place between two pipes and has many applications in the chemical process oil industry particularly in drilling and cementing operations a numerical and experimental study was performed by erge et al 2016 to investigate the flow of newtonian and non newtonian fluids in annuli and to predict the annular frictional pressure losses with and without pipe rotation the results obtained from the numerical model offers a good compromise with the experiments and the experimental data from the literature kelessidis et al 2011 studied experimentally to predict the pressure losses of fluids in concentric and eccentric annuli in laminar transitional and turbulent flows they obtained good agreement when compared to the results from the experiments with the model results presented formerly for concentric annulus the significant results for the eccentric annulus were accomplished when corrected by using correlations from the published literature for eccentricity the slurry flow in pipelines is also seen in various industrial operations such as dredging construction of dams design of storm sewers culverts coal and ore transport and chemical process dredging and construction of hydraulic fill dams are the most important applications of sediment transport through pipes garde 1956 ling et al 2003 conducted a numerical study related to the sand water slurry flow by using a 3d algebraic slip mixture asm method with rng κ ϵ turbulence model they compared the calculated data with the measured data and obtained significant results they also made some important contributions to the slurry flow characteristics kökpınar and göğüş 2001 developed a new empirical correlation for estimating the critical flow velocity of slurry transport in horizontal pipelines they conducted experimental and theoretical studies the results of the empirical correlation were adequately accurate when compared with the observed data it was concluded that the proposed equation could be used for the noncohesive uniform and nonuniform coarse particles reliably ting et al 2019 studied the behavior of the fully suspended slurry flow in the horizontal pipeline they used the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and the delft head loss limit deposit velocity dhlldv method to estimate the hydraulic gradient and concentration distribution the results obtained from the models gave very good agreement when compared with

the simulation results with the experimental data available in the literature numerical simulations found out the mean velocity mean concentration and mean pressure gradient they presented that the simulation results gave good agreement arolla and desjardins 2015 although there are contradictory findings from different studies it is known that fluid rheology controls the small cuttings transport whereas large sediment transport is mainly led by fluid flow rate when examining the particle sizes kelin et al 2013 akshik et al akhshik et al 2015 analyzed the dynamic behavior of particles by simulating the dynamic collision process that occurs during sediment transport they used both computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method walker and li 2000 presented a study covering the effects of different particle sizes fluid rheology and pipe eccentricity they deduced that the fluid rheology plays an important role for solids transport and the results of the investigation of particle size showed that when the borehole is at various inclined angles for particles up to 7 mm in diameter there was a significant effect on solids transport they also remarked that fine particles are the easiest to clean out and spherical particles with an average size of 0 76 mm pose the greatest difficulty for solids transport the importance of the particle size in sediment transport was discussed by duan et al 2006 they pointed out that the smaller sediment particles are more difficult to transport than larger sediment particles in a horizontal annulus mishra 2007 studied with small 3 mm and large particle 8 mm sizes to investigate their effect on sediment transport in horizontal and deviated wells he observed that the increasing flow rate has a significant cleaning effect for larger particles when compared to smaller particles and using water as the drilling fluid sediment transport was easier for larger particles than smaller ones sanchez et al 1997 also indicated that the larger particles transported easier than smaller particles and they emphasized that the sediment particle size was effective when the thicker mud was used on the contrary martins et al 1996 stated that the smaller particles were transported easier than the larger particles similarly peden et al 1990 observed that the smaller cuttings are transported most efficiently at all angles of deviation when using low viscosity fluids although larger particles are transported most efficiently with high viscosity fluids between the angles of 0 and 50 in this study the performances of turbulence models

21592,flow through and around fishing net cages is an important issue in aquaculture a three dimensional multi relaxation time mrt lattice boltzmann model was used to simulate the flow field around a plane net in a constant current the model was validated with experimental data the results show that this numerical model is applicable to and reliable for the investigation of the flow field around a fishing net and can provide the detailed velocity distribution in the net aperture based on this model a series of simulations were carried out to analyze the influences of the net solidity and the current velocity on hydrodynamic characteristics and flow velocity attenuation the results indicate that the flow velocity attenuation is mainly related to the net solidity of the plane net with a higher velocity drop response related to a higher net solidity these results provide fundamental information for further studies on the flow field around the fishing net cage which has potential application in analyzing the impacts of biofouling on fishing nets keywords lattice boltzmann method flow field flow velocity reduction numerical simulation fishing plane net 1 introduction to meet the increasing demand for seafood the aquaculture industry has continuously expanded aquaculture production accounts for more than half of the fish production worldwide weiss et al 2018 and has a great potential to rise in the future natale et al 2013 technological advances in offshore aquaculture have promoted aquaculture development benetti et al 2010 in which the net cage is the prevalent pattern having a complicated porous small scale structure a net cage plays an important role in maintaining the space for fish growing it prevents fish from escaping but keeps the water exchange the effect of the net structure on flow is important because the net cage can influence fish living environment by varying the surrounding flow characteristics and the spatial distribution of nutrients and dissolved oxygen the distribution of the dissolved oxygen inside the net cage is closely related to fish welfare and development but the hypoxic environment leads to a high mortality remen et al 2012 johansson et al 2007 conducted a survey on four salmon farms and concluded that the cage resistance was the main factor affecting the physical and chemical conditions around nets the hydrodynamic conditions inside a cage were mainly related to the inflow the interaction between the flow and the net structures cha et al 2013 tsukrov et al 2011 and the fish behaviour juell 1995 the investigation of water movement around net cages is key to the future development of aquaculture at present the research methods mainly include field monitoring laboratory experiments and numerical simulations rasmussen et al 2015 measured the full scale flow field of a salmon farm using a boat mounted acoustic doppler current profiler and predicted the flow velocity attenuation of this farm bi et al 2014 conducted laboratory experiments to analyze the downstream flow velocity distribution of a plane net and concluded that the flow velocity attenuation of a single net was less than 10 since the aquaculture productive activities are usually at the area where the measurement is difficult and expensive the hydrodynamic model is an alternative method to study hydrodynamic variability at the real scale lland 1993 used linear free wake equations in combination with an eddy viscosity formulation to simulate the flow field around a plane net and analyzed the relationship between the drag coefficient and flow velocity attenuation bi et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic condition around a single fishing net aperture under different structures and incidence angles and analyzed the force acting on the aperture because the net is a porous structure the simulation of the surrounding flows is a complicated process where the digital description of the net structure is necessary the net is usually described as a thin volume porous medium with the added resistance governed by the flow motion equation klebert et al 2013 patursson et al 2010 rasmussen et al 2015 simonsen et al 2006 the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a mesoscopic numerical method based on microscopic molecular dynamics liu et al 2013 yu et al 2003 compared with the traditional methods the lbm has characteristics of easy fluid solid boundary treatment and high parallel efficiency it has been successfully applied to the modelling of the flows in two dimensional porous media chai et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 and three dimensional porous media pazdniakou and adler 2013 pazdniakou et al 2018 therefore the lattice boltzmann method is used to investigate the flow field around a plane net in this study considering the actual fishing net is a combination of multiple cylinders the net is represented according to its real parameters the objectives of this study are i to setup and validate the numerical model by experimental data and ii to study the hydrodynamic effects of a fishing net cage in a three dimensional environment and compare the influences of changes in net solidity and current velocity on the flow velocity attenuation 2 numerical approach 2 1 multi relaxation time lattice boltzmann method traditional numerical methods solve the navier stokes n s equation by direct discretization the lattice boltzmann method constructs a simplified discrete velocity dynamic model at the mesoscopic level and utilizes the distribution function of the virtual particles to describe the behaviour of

previously published data patursson et al 2010 were carried out 3 1 test a a plane net normal to the inflow 3 1 1 experiment setup the experiment setup has been sketched in fig 1 the flume is 25 m long and 0 8 m wide the pump system can offer the maximum flow discharge of 240 l s the tank is equipped with a current producing system at one end to produce a constant uniform flow particle image velocimetry piv is used to obtain the velocity distribution around the plane net the piv was an optical non intrusive measurement technique which can record velocity distribution information at a large number of spatial points in the same transient state providing flow field characteristics and structure bi et al 2013 the time averaged velocity can be obtained by performing a series of processing on the captured image with dynamicstudio software the depth of the water was 0 3 m consistent with the height of the net the sequence of particle image frames recorded in real time was processed by the cross correlation analysis technique to obtain the displacement information of the flow field the net used in the experiment was a 0 8 m 0 3 m knotless nylon plane net with a twine diameter d 0 002 m and a mesh bar length l 0 02 m the mesh bar length is the length of one mesh bar between twine intersections when it was stretched onto the frame the net solidity s n is defined as the ratio between the area covered by the threads and the total area of the plane net lland 1993 in this study the square knotless mesh was used and the net solidity can be expressed as s n 2 l d d 2 l 2 0 19 tsukrov et al 2011 the average flow velocity at 0 2 m in front of the plane net was taken as the incoming velocity the measurements were performed with three different incoming velocities u i n 0 571 m s 0 301 m s and 0 156 m s the downstream flow field through the centre of the plane net was measured with the piv technique the location of the gauging points is shown in fig 2 3 1 2 numerical parameters a three dimensional numerical model was set up based on the experiments to simulate the hydrodynamic effects around the plane net the lateral view of the flume is depicted in fig 3 in which the computational field is shown as a cuboid 0 6 m 0 2 m 0 1 m the grid size is determined by the twine diameter which is set as 0 002 m the mesh bar length l is used to set the interval between twines the velocity boundary condition is applied to the entrance and the nonequilibrium extrapolation scheme is applied to the other boundaries and the plane net is set as an immovable reticular solid which is marked as solid grids and treated with the bounce back boundary condition the time step δ t is 0 0002 s after 50 000 iterations the flow field reached a relatively steady state and another 50 000 iterations were carried out to record the velocity histories at points a b and c see fig 2 3 1 3 result comparison numerical simulations of flow through a plane net with net solidity s n 0 19 were performed at three different incoming velocities u i n 0 571 0 301 and 0 156 m s the contour plots of velocity on the horizontal and vertical cut through the centre of the plane net with various incoming velocities are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the flow velocity is obviously increased behind the net aperture and reduced after passing through and this zone of the wake behind the net aperture continues for a long distance the comparison of flow velocities between numerical simulations and laboratory tests for different incoming velocities is presented in fig 5 and the relative error is given in fig 6 the calculated relative error in general decreases with an increase in the distance the maximum relative error is 5 78 with u i n 0 301 m s the wake bending in fig 4 shows different degrees which is related to the flow pattern from fig 4 c 4 a the inflow velocity is increased from 0 156 to 0 571 m s that leads to an increase in turbulence as is shown in fig 4 case c is within laminar range and the weak area is stable while case b is in transient region with fluctuating bending in case a it is obviously in turbulent range where vortex shedding could be seen however due to the lateral mixing of flow layer between apertures the flow field does not show a very clear structure overall the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results demonstrating that the lattice boltzmann method is able to simulate the flow field around a plane net accurately 3 2 test b the plane net with different attack angles 3 2 1 numerical model description this test is based on the experimental data presented in patursson et al 2010 in which a plane net with various attack angles was placed into different incoming velocities the experiments were carried out in a flume which is 37 m long 3 66 m wide and 2 44 m deep a 1 m 1 m square knotless nylon net was tested in the flume the net solidity is 0 184 with the twine diameter d 0 0028 m and the mesh bar length l 0 0029 m the ratio of the plane net to the computational domain in terms of the width and the height is consistent with the physical model in patursson et al 2010 the computational field was 0 896 m 0 512 m 0 347 m the plane net is 0 14 m 0 14 m and the grid size δ x is 0 0028 m the sketch of the computational domain is shown in fig 7 where w represents the width of the plane net and p represents the point at 2 5 w behind the centre of the plane net the incoming velocity is u i n 0 25 m s the velocity boundary condition is used at the inflow boundary the zero gradient boundary condition is adopted at the outlet and the bounce back boundary conditions are adopted at the other boundaries the time step δ t is set to 0 00028 s the value of p was not recorded until the flow field was established then the result of the following 20 000 iterations was averaged based on the numerical model the net with different attack angles θ 90 and 45 was studied by rotating the plane net around the z axis 3 2 2 result comparison fig 8 shows the velocity contours on a horizontal and vertical cut through the centre of the plane net with θ 90 and 45 respectively detailed hydrodynamic processes of these cases were captured the velocity attenuation behind the plane net is a continuous process and the flow velocity increased with the distance from the plane net however it should be noted that there are no disturbances in the fluid except the wake generated by the plane net and these results are based on the assumption that the flow is uniform upstream the flow velocity at gauging point p u p and the data obtained from patursson et al 2010 and chen and christensen 2016 are shown in table 1 the u p reaches values 0 214 m s and 0 205 m s for the plane net under θ 90 and 45 respectively the results were consistent with the experimental data in patursson et al 2010 the relative error for θ 90 and 45 are 3 17 and 5 96 respectively this deviation possibly occurs because the frame of the plane net in the present numerical model was not modelled and the simulation scale is relatively small compared with other studies even so the lattice boltzmann method achieves satisfactory results in the numerical simulation of the flow field for a plane net in addition the attack angles have an effect on the width of the wake fig 8 but are not obvious in terms of the flow velocity reduction table 1 which coincides with the research by zhao et al 2013 3 3 test c the plane net with variable solidity the dimension of the computational domain was 0 64 m 0 32 m 0 20 m and the plane net was 0 16 m 0 12 m fig 9 m represents the monitoring point for calculating the flow velocity reduction factor r u i n u m u i n where u m represents the flow velocity at point m by changing the mesh bar length l with the same twine diameter d 0 002 m three net solidity values s n 0 19 0 234 and 0 301 were tested the grid size was equal to the twine diameter and the time step was set to 0 0002 s the velocity boundary condition is applied to the entrance the zero gradient boundary condition is adopted at the outlet and the bounce back boundary conditions are adopted at the other boundaries the total number of iterations is 60 000 and the average flow velocity of m was obtained from the following 30 000 iterations at steady state there are different centre planes of plane nets due to different s n one possibility is that the centre plane is at the centres of holes fig 10 a and the other is the centre plane is at the threads fig 10 b to ensure the consistency of the results analysis when the second scenario happens the centre plane moves up to the centres of holes the streamwise development of u behind the centre of the aperture a and the thread t at the centre plane are shown in figs 11 13 two constant inflow velocities u i n 0 1 m s and 0 5 m s and three net solidity values are tested s n 0 190 0 234 0 306 the flow is significantly varied in the wake around the net aperture and is mixed with the surrounding low speed flow until fully mixed the percentage of the velocity difference behind a is calculated and the flow is considered to be fully mixed when it is less than 2 and lasts at least 20l distance in which the distance from the plane net to the fully mixed point is defined as d fig 11 shows that when net solidity is 0 306 the value of d is 7 8l and 15 3l for low and high inflow velocity respectively when the net solidity is 0 234 the value of d is 10 5l and 19 25l for low and high inflow velocity respectively fig 12 when the net solidity is 0 19 the value of d is 13 1l and 17 4l for low and high inflow velocity respectively fig 13 with the increase in the inflow velocity the value of d is increased by 4 3l 8 75l and 7 5l for low medium and high net solidities respectively low net solidity of a plane net leads to a low water blockage and allows more water to flow through the plane net and figs 11 13 reveal that the value of d increases with a decrease in the net solidity figs 14 and 15 show the velocity distribution on a horizontal cut through the centre of the plane net with constant inflow velocities u i n 0 1 m s and 0 5 m s respectively in all three cases there is a region of flow velocity reduction behind the plane net and the widths of the wake are almost the same as the plane net the flow velocity increases at the flanks of the wake region and then decreases in the x direction with the increase in the inflow velocity the length of the wake zone around each net aperture is increased low net solidity of a plane net leads to a low water blockage and allows more water to flow through the plane net when the inflow velocity is 0 1 m s the velocity at point m falls to 0 091 m s 0 076 m s and 0 059 m s and the flow velocity reduction factors are 9 24 and 41 for the low medium and high net solidities respectively while these reduction factors increase to 10 27 and 52 for 0 5 m s inflow rate although the velocity in the wake zone depends on the inflow velocity cornejo et al 2014 and the net solidity yao et al 2016 the flow velocity reduction factor is more sensitive to the net solidity the results suggest that the velocity attenuation in the wake is dependent on the mesh structure i e high net solidity leads to a significant velocity drop the velocity reduction has a direct effect on the transport and diffusion of the pollutants nutrients or oxygen in a net cage the concentration of these substances has a great influence on the health and survival environment of aquaculture species in practice the mesh geometry of a net cage deformation may be caused by biofouling blockage leading to an increase in the solidity of the net cage the increased flow velocity at the flanks and the apertures and a decrease in the velocity in wake 4 conclusions in this study a three dimensional lattice boltzmann model has been established to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow around the plane net the model is verified by two typical cases and is further used to study the influence of the net solidity on the velocity attenuation as the indicator the velocity reduction factor at a particular point in the wake has been calculated under the constant inflow condition the results show that the velocity reduction factor is very sensitive to the net solidity ranging from 9 to 52 however it does not obviously vary when the inflow rate is changed at the boundary compared with traditional numerical models the present model is able to provide a more detailed flow field obtained by simulating each of the filaments that compose the meshes therefore this model makes it possible to accurately capture the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic process

21592,flow through and around fishing net cages is an important issue in aquaculture a three dimensional multi relaxation time mrt lattice boltzmann model was used to simulate the flow field around a plane net in a constant current the model was validated with experimental data the results show that this numerical model is applicable to and reliable for the investigation of the flow field around a fishing net and can provide the detailed velocity distribution in the net aperture based on this model a series of simulations were carried out to analyze the influences of the net solidity and the current velocity on hydrodynamic characteristics and flow velocity attenuation the results indicate that the flow velocity attenuation is mainly related to the net solidity of the plane net with a higher velocity drop response related to a higher net solidity these results provide fundamental information for further studies on the flow field around the fishing net cage which has potential application in analyzing the impacts of biofouling on fishing nets keywords lattice boltzmann method flow field flow velocity reduction numerical simulation fishing plane net 1 introduction to meet the increasing demand for seafood the aquaculture industry has continuously expanded aquaculture production accounts for more than half of the fish production worldwide weiss et al 2018 and has a great potential to rise in the future natale et al 2013 technological advances in offshore aquaculture have promoted aquaculture development benetti et al 2010 in which the net cage is the prevalent pattern having a complicated porous small scale structure a net cage plays an important role in maintaining the space for fish growing it prevents fish from escaping but keeps the water exchange the effect of the net structure on flow is important because the net cage can influence fish living environment by varying the surrounding flow characteristics and the spatial distribution of nutrients and dissolved oxygen the distribution of the dissolved oxygen inside the net cage is closely related to fish welfare and development but the hypoxic environment leads to a high mortality remen et al 2012 johansson et al 2007 conducted a survey on four salmon farms and concluded that the cage resistance was the main factor affecting the physical and chemical conditions around nets the hydrodynamic conditions inside a cage were mainly related to the inflow the interaction between the flow and the net structures cha et al 2013 tsukrov et al 2011 and the fish behaviour juell 1995 the investigation of water movement around net cages is key to the future development of aquaculture at present the research methods mainly include field monitoring laboratory experiments and numerical simulations rasmussen et al 2015 measured the full scale flow field of a salmon farm using a boat mounted acoustic doppler current profiler and predicted the flow velocity attenuation of this farm bi et al 2014 conducted laboratory experiments to analyze the downstream flow velocity distribution of a plane net and concluded that the flow velocity attenuation of a single net was less than 10 since the aquaculture productive activities are usually at the area where the measurement is difficult and expensive the hydrodynamic model is an alternative method to study hydrodynamic variability at the real scale lland 1993 used linear free wake equations in combination with an eddy viscosity formulation to simulate the flow field around a plane net and analyzed the relationship between the drag coefficient and flow velocity attenuation bi et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic condition around a single fishing net aperture under different structures and incidence angles and analyzed the force acting on the aperture because the net is a porous structure the simulation of the surrounding flows is a complicated process where the digital description of the net structure is necessary the net is usually described as a thin volume porous medium with the added resistance governed by the flow motion equation klebert et al 2013 patursson et al 2010 rasmussen et al 2015 simonsen et al 2006 the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a mesoscopic numerical method based on microscopic molecular dynamics liu et al 2013 yu et al 2003 compared with the traditional methods the lbm has characteristics of

three dimensional porous media pazdniakou and adler 2013 pazdniakou et al 2018 therefore the lattice boltzmann method is used to investigate the flow field around a plane net in this study considering the actual fishing net is a combination of multiple cylinders the net is represented according to its real parameters the objectives of this study are i to setup and validate the numerical model by experimental data and ii to study the hydrodynamic effects of a fishing net cage in a three dimensional environment and compare the influences of changes in net solidity and current velocity on the flow velocity attenuation 2 numerical approach 2 1 multi relaxation time lattice boltzmann method traditional numerical methods solve the navier stokes n s equation by direct discretization the

previously published data patursson et al 2010 were carried out 3 1 test a a plane net normal to the inflow 3 1 1 experiment setup the experiment setup has been sketched in fig 1 the flume is 25 m long and 0 8 m wide the pump system can offer the maximum flow discharge of 240 l s the tank is equipped with a current producing system at one end to produce a constant uniform flow particle image velocimetry piv is used to obtain the velocity distribution around the plane net the piv was an optical non intrusive measurement technique which can record velocity distribution information at a large number of spatial points in the same transient state providing flow field characteristics and structure bi et al 2013 the time averaged velocity can be obtained by performing a series of processing on the captured image with dynamicstudio software the depth of the water was 0 3 m consistent with the height of the net the sequence of particle image frames recorded in real time was processed by the cross correlation analysis technique to obtain the displacement information of the flow field the net used in the experiment was a 0 8 m 0 3 m knotless nylon plane net with a twine diameter d 0 002 m and a mesh bar length l 0 02 m the mesh bar length is the length of one mesh bar between twine intersections when it was stretched onto the frame the net solidity s n is defined as the ratio between the area covered by the threads and the total area of the plane net lland 1993 in this study the square knotless mesh was used and the net solidity can be expressed as s n 2 l d d 2 l 2 0 19 tsukrov et al 2011 the average flow velocity at 0 2 m in front of the plane net was taken as the incoming velocity the measurements were performed with three different incoming velocities u i n 0 571 m s 0 301 m s and 0 156 m s the downstream flow field through the centre of the plane net was measured with the piv technique the location of the gauging points is shown in fig 2 3 1 2 numerical parameters a three dimensional numerical model was set up based on the experiments to simulate the hydrodynamic effects around the plane net the lateral view of the flume is depicted in fig 3 in which the computational field is shown as a cuboid 0 6 m 0 2 m 0 1 m the grid size is determined by the twine diameter which is set as 0 002 m the mesh bar length l is used to set the interval between twines the velocity boundary condition is applied to the entrance and the nonequilibrium extrapolation scheme is applied to the other boundaries and the plane net is set as an immovable reticular solid which is marked as solid grids and treated with the bounce back boundary condition the time step δ t is 0 0002 s after 50 000 iterations the flow field reached a relatively steady state and another 50 000 iterations were carried out to record the velocity histories at points a b and c see fig 2 3 1 3 result comparison numerical simulations of flow through a plane net with net solidity s n 0 19 were performed at three different incoming velocities u i n 0 571 0 301 and 0 156 m s the contour plots of velocity on the horizontal and vertical cut through the centre of the plane net with various incoming velocities are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the flow velocity is obviously increased behind the net aperture and reduced after passing through and this zone of the wake behind the net aperture continues for a long distance the comparison of flow velocities between numerical simulations and laboratory tests for different incoming velocities is presented in fig 5 and the relative error is given in fig 6 the calculated relative error in general decreases with an increase in the distance the maximum relative error is 5 78 with u i n 0 301 m s the wake bending in fig 4 shows different degrees which is related to the flow pattern from fig 4 c 4 a the inflow velocity is increased from 0 156 to 0 571 m s that leads to an increase in turbulence as is shown in fig 4 case c is within laminar range and the weak area is stable while case b is in transient region with fluctuating bending in case a it is obviously in turbulent range where vortex shedding could be seen however due to the lateral mixing of flow layer between apertures the flow field does not show a very clear structure overall the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results demonstrating that the lattice boltzmann method is able to simulate the flow field around a plane net accurately 3 2 test b the plane net with different attack angles 3 2 1 numerical model description this test is based on the experimental data presented in patursson et al 2010 in which a plane net with various attack angles was placed into different incoming velocities the experiments were carried out in a flume which is 37 m long 3 66 m wide and 2 44 m deep a 1 m 1 m square knotless nylon net was tested in the flume the net solidity is 0 184 with the twine diameter d 0 0028 m and the mesh bar length l 0 0029 m the ratio of the plane net to the computational domain in terms of the width and the height is consistent with the physical model in patursson et al 2010 the computational field was 0 896 m 0 512 m 0 347 m the plane net is 0 14 m 0 14 m and the grid size δ x is 0 0028 m the sketch of the computational domain is shown in fig 7 where w represents the width of the plane net and p represents the point at 2 5 w behind the centre of the plane net the incoming velocity is u i n 0 25 m s the velocity boundary condition is used at the inflow boundary the zero gradient boundary condition is adopted at the outlet and the bounce back boundary conditions are adopted at the other boundaries the time step δ t is set to 0 00028 s the value of p was not recorded until the flow field was established then the result of the following 20 000 iterations was averaged based on the numerical model the net with different attack angles θ 90 and 45 was studied by rotating the plane net around the z axis 3 2 2 result comparison fig 8 shows the velocity contours on a horizontal and vertical cut through the centre of the plane net with θ 90 and 45 respectively detailed hydrodynamic processes of these cases were captured the velocity attenuation behind the plane net is a continuous process and the flow velocity increased with the distance from the plane net however it should be noted that there are no disturbances in the fluid except the wake generated by the plane net and these results are based on the assumption that the flow is uniform upstream the flow velocity at gauging point p u p and the data obtained from patursson et al 2010 and chen and christensen 2016 are shown in table 1 the u p reaches values 0 214 m s and 0 205 m s for the plane net under θ 90 and 45 respectively the results were consistent with the experimental data in patursson et al 2010 the relative error for θ 90 and 45 are 3 17 and 5 96 respectively this deviation possibly occurs because the frame of the plane net in the present numerical model was not modelled and the simulation scale is relatively small compared with other studies even so the lattice boltzmann method achieves satisfactory results in the numerical simulation of the flow field for a plane net in addition the attack angles have an effect on the width of the wake fig 8 but are not obvious in terms of the flow velocity reduction table 1 which coincides with the research by zhao et al 2013 3 3 test c the plane net with variable solidity the dimension of the computational domain was 0 64 m 0 32 m 0 20 m and the plane net was 0 16 m 0 12 m fig 9 m represents the monitoring point for calculating the flow velocity reduction factor r u i n u m u i n where u m represents the flow velocity at point m by changing the mesh bar length l with the same twine diameter d 0 002 m three net solidity values s n 0 19 0 234 and 0 301 were tested the grid size was equal to the twine diameter and the time step was set to 0 0002 s the velocity boundary condition is applied to the entrance the zero gradient boundary condition is adopted at the outlet and the bounce back boundary conditions are adopted at the other boundaries the total number of iterations is 60 000 and the average flow velocity of m was obtained from the following 30 000 iterations at steady state there are different centre planes of plane nets due to different s n one possibility is that the centre plane is at the centres of holes fig 10 a and the other is the centre plane is at the threads fig 10 b to ensure the consistency of the results analysis when the second scenario happens the centre plane moves up to the centres of holes the streamwise development of u behind the centre of the aperture a and the thread t at the centre plane are shown in figs 11 13 two constant inflow velocities u i n 0 1 m s and 0 5 m s and three net solidity values are tested s n 0 190 0 234 0 306 the flow is significantly varied in the wake around the net aperture and is mixed with the surrounding low speed flow until fully mixed the percentage of the velocity difference behind a is calculated and the flow is considered to be fully mixed when it is less than 2 and lasts at least 20l distance in which the distance from the plane net to the fully mixed point is defined as d fig 11 shows that when net solidity is 0 306 the value of d is 7 8l and 15 3l for low and high inflow velocity respectively when the net solidity is 0 234 the value of d is 10 5l and 19 25l for low and high inflow velocity respectively fig 12 when the net solidity is 0 19 the value of d is 13 1l and 17 4l for low and high inflow velocity respectively fig 13 with the increase in the inflow velocity the value of d is increased by 4 3l 8 75l and 7 5l for low medium and high net solidities respectively low net solidity of a plane net leads to a low water blockage and allows more water to flow through the plane net and figs 11 13 reveal that the value of d increases with a decrease in the net solidity figs 14 and 15 show the velocity distribution on a horizontal cut through the centre of the plane net with constant inflow velocities u i n 0 1 m s and 0 5 m s respectively in all three cases there is a region of flow velocity reduction behind the plane net and the widths of the wake are almost the same as the plane net the flow velocity increases at the flanks of the wake region and then decreases in the x direction with the increase in the inflow velocity the length of the wake zone around each net aperture is increased low net solidity of a plane net leads to a low water blockage and allows more water to flow through the plane net when the inflow velocity is 0 1 m s the velocity at point m falls to 0 091 m s 0 076 m s and 0 059 m s and the flow velocity reduction factors are 9 24 and 41 for the low medium and high net solidities respectively while these reduction factors increase to 10 27 and 52 for 0 5 m s inflow rate although the velocity in the wake zone depends on the inflow velocity cornejo et al 2014 and the net solidity yao et al 2016 the flow velocity reduction factor is more sensitive to the net solidity the results suggest that the velocity attenuation in the wake is dependent on the mesh structure i e high net solidity leads to a significant velocity drop the velocity reduction has a direct effect on the transport and diffusion of the pollutants nutrients or oxygen in a net cage the concentration of these substances has a great influence on the health and survival environment of aquaculture species in practice the mesh geometry of a net cage deformation may be caused by biofouling blockage leading to an increase in the solidity of the net cage the increased flow velocity at the flanks and the apertures and a decrease in the velocity in wake 4 conclusions in this study a three dimensional lattice boltzmann model has been established to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow around the plane net the model is verified by two typical cases and is further used to study the influence of the net solidity on the velocity attenuation as the indicator the velocity reduction factor at a particular point in the wake has been calculated under the constant inflow condition the results show that the velocity reduction factor is very sensitive to the net solidity ranging from 9 to 52 however it does not obviously vary when the inflow rate is changed at the boundary compared with traditional numerical models the present model is able to provide a more detailed flow field obtained by simulating each of the filaments that compose the meshes therefore this model makes it possible to accurately capture the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic process

21593,the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over a soft clayey seabed is a challenging issue in marine engineering excessive settlement and the sinking of such structures into the seabed sludge impose high costs on a project and can cause operational problems the present study evaluated the mechanisms contributing to the large deformation that can occur during the construction of a breakwater using the results of four centrifuge tests the result showed that the penetration of individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores were the leading mechanisms contributing to material loss during the construction of the breakwater according to the conducted tests the amount of material loss contributing to the penetration of individual rock particles for cu 3 2 4 1 11 2 kpa equal 10 3 7 6 and 2 of the initial breakwater section respectively also the amount of material loss caused by the flow of sludge into rock pores for the three mentioned undrained shear strengths are equal to 15 1 10 4 and 5 9 of the initial section respectively so current study indicates that failing to account for these two mechanisms can lead to considerable underestimation of the required material for construction keywords soft seabed rubble mound breakwater material loss settlement geotechnical centrifuge modeling 1 introduction rubble mound breakwaters are commonly constructed to protect ports and coastal regions from wave action and provide sea access sedimentation caused by factors such as wind waves tides and river mouths soft foundations are much more likely to occur at the shoreline than in areas far from the coast wang et al 2019 a breakwater constructed on a soft seabed having low strength and high compressibility is always a matter of concern high settlement of a breakwater with such a foundation can cause great material loss and settlement the challenge of excessive settlements during construction of a breakwater in barth harbor germany was pointed out by schlie 2006 the study also proposed some geotechnical interventions such as replacement of the sludge layer when confronting such soft foundations replacement of the sludge when the soft foundation is deep is not feasible owing to the high amount of material loss under such circumstances the material would be dumped in a random manner similar observations were made by de rouck et al 2010 and verhaeghe et al 2014 during construction of ostend harbor in belgium a number of ground improvement techniques are available these include preloading with vertical drains stone columns jet grouting and basal reinforcement using a mattress or geotextiles the efficiency of each of these methods has been assessed in previous studies yadav et al 2019 wu et al 2019 liu et al 2017 lim et al 2018 in order to select the most appropriate approach when confronting a soft foundation all the mechanisms contributing to material loss must be determined also when material is dumped randomly it is essential to identify all corresponding mechanisms to accurately estimate the amount of material required elastic and consolidation settlement are typical geotechnical phenomena that appear when dealing with clayey foundations in addition to these penetration of the individual pieces of rubble in the early stages of construction visser and van der meer 2008 and the flow of soft clay into the pores of the rock material can occur because of the increase in surcharge mobarrez et al 2004 few studies have focused on the mechanisms that cause excessive settlements during the construction of rubble mound structures on a soft bed de vries et al 2009 and beemsterboer 2013 conducted a series of studies to evaluate the amount of rock material needed for offshore rock installation these studies aimed to provide a sound foundation at a depth of 850 m below the seabed for norwegian gas pipelines the aggregate was transferred through flexible pipes to the seabed the researchers estimated the penetration depth using an analytical approach that considered the forces acting upon the individual pieces of aggregate at the time of contact with the sludge the analytical formula was then verified with field measurements the output data and verifications were limited to the construction of a support pipeline it should be noted that the diameters of the pieces of aggregate employed in these experiments were much smaller than the diameter required for construction of a rubble mound breakwater also mobarrez and fakher 2005 designed a device at laboratory scale to determine the amount of penetration of sludge into the rubble they tested sand mattresses of different thicknesses to evaluate the amount of decrease in settlement corresponding the sludge penetration the mechanism of penetration of a piece of rock into soil has been conceived of using cavity expansion theory by hill 1998 and russell and khalili 2006 bijnagte and luger 2005 proposed an analytical approach for calculating penetration depth based on the transmission of water through pipelines several other laboratory and field tests were conducted by various researchers on the free fall piezocone penetrometer and sphere to estimate the undrained shear strength of clay foundations morton et al 2014 2016 chung et al 2006 chow et al 2014 the results of these studies cannot be used for solving the problem of breakwaters because of fundamental differences between them and the present problem regarding the dimensions and the weight of the object along with the impact velocity also the mentioned studies are not dependent on the shear strength of the seabed which is as an effective parameter in penetration much research has been conducted on the control of material loss bolton and sharma 1994 found that the undrained deformation of a clayey foundation is strongly dependent on its depth less settlement occurs when the depth is small these researchers conducted a number of centrifuge tests to analyze the effect of laying a geotextile layer over a soft clay foundation under the embankment yu et al 2005 studied the behavior of a reinforced breakwater using centrifuge modeling on a section of the huangua breakwater it was assumed that a stair step increase in centrifugal acceleration would be equivalent to the loading stages of the prototype the horizontal and vertical deformation of the clayey foundation revealed that reinforcement enhanced the stability and reduced the horizontal displacement of the foundation and breakwater body this trend was more significant when the shear strength of the foundation decreased also bayesteh and mansouriboroujeni 2019 used numerical modeling and postulated that the penetration of individual rocks was the main reason for excessive settlement during the construction of rubble mound breakwaters they found that the use of a geogrid reduced the amount of settlement this study focused on only penetration of individual rock particle mechanism that contributes to material loss it is necessary to assess all effective mechanisms in order to choose the appropriate intervention for tackling the issue of excessive settlement during the construction of a rubble mound breakwater on a clayey foundation recent studies that have proposed solutions to controlling settlement have not considered the influence of all contributing mechanisms a comprehensive full scale experimental data set is required in this regard the present study aimed to identify the mechanisms associated with material loss during the course of the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over a soft foundation using the results of four geotechnical centrifuge tests the penetration of individual rock particles and the flow of sludge through the rock pores at the base frequently have been overlooked in the technical literature on the subject therefore the contribution of each mechanism has been calculated and their influence on material loss has been assessed 2 geotechnical centrifuge modeling 2 1 design of model tests four geotechnical centrifuge tests were conducted in the laboratory to identify the material loss mechanisms the characteristics of the model and the clay foundation such as the side slope of the breakwater core the undrained shear strength of the foundation cu the unit weight γclay water content ω and void ratio of the foundation soil for each test are presented in table 1 the undrained shear strength of the foundation and the breakwater side slope were selected as the variable parameters the amount of material loss greatly depends on the foundation strength thus the undrained shear strength of the foundation was selected as a key variable in designed tests chung et al 2006 jang et al 2007 reduction of the side slope angle is a viable solution to improving the stress distribution of such foundations cur 2007 one test was designed to evaluate the influence of this intervention on the mechanisms these experiments were carried out in a geotechnical centrifuge with a 3 m long arm having a maximum capacity of 1 ton at 130 g of acceleration on a testing platform with an area of 0 8 1 m the magnitude of the centrifugal acceleration was selected regarding dimensional limitations of the box along with the size of the model so all tests were carried out at an acceleration of 50 g fig 1 shows a section of the model breakwater at 1 50 scale the strong box used for testing was 70 cm in length 40 cm in width and 50 cm in height due to the high length to width ratio for the breakwater plane strain assumption can be employed here because the section was axisymmetric only half of it was modeled liang et al 2018 yu b zhang and j zhang 2005 centrifugal scaling laws can be determined using dimensional analysis or by consideration of the governing differential equations the basic scaling law derives from the need to ensure stress similarity between the model and the corresponding prototype taylor 2005 if an acceleration of n times earth s gravity g is applied to a material of density ρ the vertical stress σv at depth hm in the model using subscription m to indicate model is given by 1 σvm ρng hm in the prototype indicated by subscript p then 2 σvp ρg hp thus for σvm σvp then hm hpn 1 and the scale factor model prototype for linear dimensions is 1 n other scaling laws are proved in geotechnical centrifuge technology taylor 2005 table 2 lists common scaling laws used in modeling 2 2 modeling of material because the soft clayey seabed was assumed to be under consolidation poulos 1988 the consolidation process was not taken into account during the creation of sludge samples in the laboratory in test 3 only after making the clay sample in the strong box the model was consolidated under a 100 kpa surcharge at 50 g of acceleration over 35 min in accordance with the scaling laws this period would be equivalent to about 2 months in the prototype the diagram of shear strength versus water content increase was obtained by adding different amounts of water to the clay sample and determining the undrained shear strength of the mixture in the laboratory this diagram shows the percentage of water that must be added in order to attain the target strength the atterberg tests carried out on the clay samples resulted in pi 18 and ll 35 the possible failure wedge were determined using the limit equilibrium analysis for the model as a result the thickness of the sludge layer was chosen so that the possible failure lines pass through the soil and prevent any boundary condition errors the aggregate used in the breakwater body had a diameter of 0 5 to 1in and a unit weight of 13 9 kn m3 the internal friction angle was determined to be 39 and the cohesion of the breakwater materials to be zero 2 3 instrumentation the transparent side of the box was reticulated and several marking foam cubes were placed in clay at various depths to allow determination of foundation displacement during the tests photographs taken of the transparent side of the strong box during testing and image processing analysis were used to record the displacement at each stage to record foundation displacement and pore water pressure in the clay bed four linear variable differential transformers lvdts and three pore pressure transducers ppts were placed in the foundation according to fig 1 the lvdts were capable of measuring up to 80 mm of displacement and the ppts quantified pore water pressure up to 300 kpa 2 4 testing procedure the following procedure was used each test test box preparation the sidewall friction of the box was minimized by gluing a plastic layer over the transparent plexiglas side of box a thin sheet of cellophane with one vaseline coated side was placed on the other sidewalls to eliminate boundary effects foundation preparation outside the strong box the desired amount of water was added to the clay and they were blended by a mixer with 1600 w of power and an angular velocity of 700 rpm to create a uniform combination of soft clay after determining that the clay water mixture was perfectly homogeneous the samples were carefully placed in the strong box in 1 cm thick layers to assure that no air was trapped between the layers the ppts then were fixed in place in order to determine the undrained shear strength of the foundation vane shear tests were carried out according to astm d2573 before placing the strong box on the centrifuge platform breakwater construction the lvdts were placed underneath the breakwater and over the foundation as shown in fig 1 next the rubble was dumped over the clay layer within the specified dimensions at an acceleration of 1 g a periodic increase in centrifugal acceleration was done to model the staged construction of the prototype fig 2 fig 3 shows the typical deformation of one sample before and after testing 3 results and discussion the deformation of the clay foundation and breakwater settlement of the ground level and excess pore water pressure were continuously measured with the increase in centrifugal acceleration and the results are presented below 3 1 deformation of clay foundation the deformation induced in the clayey foundation during testing was determined as described in section 2 deformation of the breakwater body was measured by observing the movement of the rubble fig 4 shows the horizontal and vertical displacement contours for each test in this figure the bold continuous line represents the corresponding prototype section that contains horizontal and vertical displacement contours within its area the negative values of the vertical displacement contours indicate settlement while the positive values show heave in the clay foundation also the positive values of the horizontal displacement contours are sketched to show the movement of the particles toward the toe since the most important variable in these tests is the undrained shear strength cu the results reveal that the horizontal and vertical displacements decreased substantially with the increase in cu for example in test 1 which has the lowest amount of undrained shear strength cu 3 2 kpa the largest horizontal and vertical deformation happens on the contrary test 4 having the highest undrained shear strength cu 11 2 kpa undergoes the least deformation in test 3 which had been consolidated for 60 days under a surcharge of 100 kpa the undrained shear strength increased by 0 3 kpa however no significant difference between the contours of foundation displacement for tests 2 and 3 was observed the amount of settlement in the breakwater body in test 3 especially at the crest showed less material loss but the amount of settlement in the foundation is almost the same in test 3 the surficial layer has been consolidated under the applied surcharge so this thin layer experiences over consolidation oc condition this thin over consolidated layer causes the elimination of one of the excessive settlement mechanisms being the penetration of individual pieces of rubble in the sludge foundation this leads to a reduction in crest settlement in comparison tests 3 and 4 detailed description could be found in section 4 1 in this regard a comparison between fig 4 b and 4 c reveals that deformation contours of the clayey foundation are slightly different it could be concluded that marginal changes in the breakwater side slope have little influence on foundation deformation 3 2 settlement at ground level ground surface settlement was measured by the four lvdt sensors in the test box fig 5 shows the results of settlement versus the height of the breakwater at different acceleration levels for each lvdt the location of each loading step for the staged modeling can be seen the settlement recorded during each step should be considered equal to the consolidation settlement the results indicate that this type of settlement consolidation has marginal effect on material loss compared to the total settlement so consolidation settlement during the construction period was negligible by fitting a regression line through the final data recorded by the lvdts which represents surficial settlement of the foundation at a breakwater height of 8 m the deformed seabed was sketched for each test fig 6 shows the scaled deformation of the prototype along with the displacement vectors for each test according to fig 6 the maximum amount of material loss occurs below the breakwater crest since the amount of stress in the foundation is maximum below the crest it is evident from a geotechnical perspective that the major part of displacements takes place at this location however an interesting point could be observed in the obtained results looking closely at fig 6 a the breakwater crest s deformation line show a settlement of 4 5 m but the deformation lines of the foundation just beneath the breakwater crest show an amount of around 3 5 m the 1 m difference in this test demonstrates one interesting mechanism in the construction of rubble mound structures over sludge foundations the reason for this difference is the penetration of the individual rock particles the details related to the calculation of material loss caused by this mechanism are thoroughly described in section 4 1 another significant observation in fig 6 a is related to bed deformation vectors sketched according to the marking foam cubes placed in the clayey foundation apparently the size of the bed deformation vector at 1st row located at the surficial layer has to be the same size as the sludge foundation surficial deformation dashed lines but this is not observed in the sketched drawings the reason can be found in another contributing mechanism introduced as the flow of sludge into rock pores in this article this brand new mechanism was assessed in section 4 3 the mentioned observation in fig 6 b 6 c and 6 d depends on the circumstances of each test and the amount of cu for example in test 4 the increase in cu counteracts the influence of the two discussed mechanisms fig 7 shows the foundation settlement for each test for comparison because of the symmetrical geometry of the breakwater the deformation of both sides was considered to be identical it can be seen that foundation deformation at the breakwater crest decreased remarkably when the undrained shear strength decreased on the other hand foundation heave at the breakwater toe experienced less variation 3 3 pore water pressure the excess pore pressure associated with each construction stage was measured at three points in tests 1 and 4 the change in pore water pressure over time and the height of the breakwater are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively because of the low permeability of clay the trend of change in pore pressure increased at a steady rate throughout the loading time and no considerable pore pressure dissipation was observed 4 main mechanisms contributing to material loss different mechanisms can cause material waste during construction of a breakwater to determine the contribution of each mechanism distinct areas have been defined at the hypothetical deformation shown in fig 10 the total volume of material required for construction of the model breakwater before testing is denoted as v total the initial volume of material decreased after testing the final section required a volume denoted as v material loss to reach the initial section the part of the model which remained after construction is denoted as v remaining breakwater after the breakwater was constructed the foundation deformed at the surface below the breakwater crest after having undergone a volume change denoted as v bed deformation this volume is measured by the lvdt sensors the amount of rock material which penetrated the soft clay is denoted as v rock penetration the remaining deformed areas can be divided into v toe heave v toe deformation and v total heave as defined below v toe heave volume of heave of the foundation under the toe v toe deformation volume of displaced material at the breakwater toe as a result of horizontal deformation v total heave volume of total heave of clayey foundation after construction the amount of settlement and heave at the foundation level was measured by four lvdts spaced as shown in fig 1 it is possible to sketch the deformed bed by fitting a regression line through these four points by calculating an integral under this curve at specific intervals v bed deformation v toe heave and v total heave can be obtained also image processing revealed that v toe deformation v material loss and v remaining breakwater could be achieved so these parameters could be directly obtained from each test 4 1 penetration of individual pieces of rubble one important mechanism leading to material loss during breakwater construction over a soft bed is the penetration of the pieces of rubble into the sludge this occurs because a rubble mound breakwater consists of individual rocks that do not form a continuum bayesteh and mansouriboroujeni 2019 veiskarami et al 2017 mousavi et al 2017 penetration proceeds until a complete sludge foundation is formed bernard 1987 and young 1981 conducted military focused research aiming at predicting the amount of rubble penetration through soft soil they analyzed rubble falling at high speed onto relatively soft soil layers and developed empirical relationships for estimating the magnitude of rubble penetration as related to the velocities and shapes of the individual pieces beemsterboer 2013 developed a formula based on force equilibrium to estimate individual penetration by revealing the forces acting upon an object sinking into sludge in the present study the volumes defined in the previous section were used to determine the amount of rubble penetration the initial volume of the breakwater before deformation can be calculated as 3 v total v material loss v breakwater remaining v toe heave the total volume after final deformation can be calculated as 4 v total v breakwater remaining v bed deformation v rock penetration v toe deformation equating these two formulas the volume of material loss corresponding to the penetration of the individual pieces of rubble can be calculated as 5 v rock penetration v material loss v toe heave v bed deformation v toe deformation table 3 lists the volumes in each test for a 1 m length of breakwater the values refer to the full scale breakwater prototype because half of the breakwater was modeled and the model was axisymmetric all quantities were doubled the amount of material loss caused by the penetration of individual pieces of rubble as a percentage of the initial breakwater volume is given in the last column of table 3 the results indicate that the amount of individual penetration at c u 3 2 kpa was about 10 3 of the initial volume while at c u 11 2 kpa it was about 2 of the initial volume this penetration decreased in test 3 to less than 1 the undrained shear strength conditions were almost identical in tests 2 and 3 which could have been related to consolidation conducted in test 3 under a surcharge of 100 kpa for 60 days 35 min in the model before testing because it experienced one way drainage the surficial layer was more consolidated than the underlying layers thus the amount of penetration was negligible for this case another comparison between the results of tests 2 and 3 suggests that the difference between the volumes of material loss v material loss was actually the difference between the rubble penetration volume into the sludge v rock penetration this is the reason why the breakwater crest settled more in test 2 than in test 3 see section 3 4 2 material loss due to immediate and consolidation settlement elastic settlement caused by the immediate deformation of the foundation and consolidation settlement are conventional mechanisms considered when constructing a structure on saturated clayey soil consolidation settlement is time dependent and occurs both during and after construction thus the estimation of this type of settlement is vital to the service life of a structure various methods have been introduced in classic soil mechanics and plasticity research to calculate this type of settlement muthing et al 2018 because the present study focused on short term mechanisms contributing to material loss during construction of a rubble mound breakwater over a clayey foundation long term consolidation settlement was not taken into account as a result the centrifuge tests terminated a short while after completion of the breakwater the amount of settlement at each loading step during the tests defined the consolidation settlement which was negligible in all tests immediate settlement occurs both in clay and sand this kind of settlement causes the foundation to deform however in the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over clay this deformation does not occur as a consequence of volume change or an alteration in the structure of the soil instead it takes place by driving the clay to the sides this occurs because loading is relatively fast throughout construction of the breakwater with no time for drainage or volume change the deformation occurred in undrained conditions it should be noted that long term staged construction of such structures helps reduce the amount of material loss 4 3 flow of soft clay into rubble pores the last mechanism affecting material loss during the construction of a rubble mound breakwater is the penetration of soft clay into the pores of the rubble as stated in the early stages of material dumping some of the rubble particles penetrate the sludge to form a clay foundation in this situation a combination of clay and rock exists at the surface as the dumping of the rubble proceeds and the surcharge increases the surficial stress grows the surficial soft clay having a moisture content near the liquid limit acts like a viscous fluid under this condition the pores between the rocks act as pipelines with the stress build up the soft clay begins to flow into these pores fig 11 this mechanism increases settlement and as a result the amount of material loss the dashed line on the surface of the foundation in fig 10 corresponds to the deformation measured by the lvdts during testing regardless of the consolidation settlement this line represents the sum of elastic settlement and settlement caused by the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores considering the relatively fast process of loading the behavior of the clay foundation can be assumed to be perfectly undrained it is expected that the deformation underneath the breakwater v bed deformation will be equal to the deformation at the toe front v total heave in the tests of the present study because of the porous body of the breakwater some of the material flowed into the rock mass this means that the material flow v material flow can be calculated as 6 v material flow v bed deformation v total heave this equation yields the volume of material flowing into the rocks for a 1 m length of the breakwater as given in table 4 also the amount of material loss caused by the material flowing into the rock pore s as a percentage of the initial breakwater volume is given in the 5th column of table 4 the results indicate that the amount of material loss in this mechanism is greater than for the individual penetration mechanism which conflicts with the findings of beemsterboer 2013 as explained the amount of material loss below the breakwater the settled volume sketched as dashed line in the diagrams of fig 6 is a representative of the sum of two settlements the settlement caused by material flow vmaterial flow and the elastic settlement velastic deformaion thereby the following equation could be derived vbed deformation velastic deformaion vmaterial flow 7 velastic deformaion vbed deformation vmaterial flow based on the above equation the amount of material loss attributed to elastic settlement could be acquired this quantity is calculated as a percentage of the initial volume of the breakwater and presented in the last column of table 4 fig 12 shows the percentage of material loss attributed to each parameter versus the undrained shear strength the tests having identical conditions are drawn on the graph for purposes of comparison the loss due to elastic settlement was calculated as shown in table 4 versus the amount of heave the amount of material loss caused by elastic settlement was found to be the most effective factor in total loss as the gradients of the curves show in fig 10 the amount of rock penetration increased significantly when the undrained shear strength dropped to below 4 kpa for all mechanisms investigated in the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over a clay foundation at c u 3 2 kpa about 25 of the material was wasted because of penetration of individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores if a designer does not take these two mechanisms into account and only considers short term and long term settlement the estimation of the materials will have an approximate error of 25 this imposes a heavy burden on the budget of a marine project because of the difficulty of supplying rock material 5 conclusions in this study four geotechnical centrifuge tests were carried out in order to identify the mechanisms affecting large deformation of a rubble mound breakwater constructed over soft clayey bed two mechanisms appear to have been overlooked in the technical literature because they are specific to rubble mound structures the penetration of individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay through the porous body of the breakwater these two mechanisms are important because a remarkable portion of the settlements and consequently the material loss is attributed to them in the design of the tests the undrained shear strength of the foundation was chosen as the variable and the impacts of each of the above mechanisms were assessed along with the elastic and consolidation settlements the amount of penetration individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores at c u 3 2 kpa was about 10 3 and 15 1 of the initial volume respectively at c u 11 2 kpa it was about 2 and 5 9 of the initial volume respectively so if a designer does not take these two mechanisms into account and only considers short term and long term settlement the estimation of the materials loss would have considerable errors also the results indicate that as the sludge foundation consolidated individual penetration decreased significantly however because of the high stress at the interface of the breakwater and the foundation this did not considerably influence the flow of soft clay into the rock pores credit authorship contribution

21593,the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over a soft clayey seabed is a challenging issue in marine engineering excessive settlement and the sinking of such structures into the seabed sludge impose high costs on a project and can cause operational problems the present study evaluated the mechanisms contributing to the large deformation that can occur during the construction of a breakwater using the results of four centrifuge tests the result showed that the penetration of individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores were the leading mechanisms contributing to material loss during the construction of the breakwater according to the conducted tests the amount of material loss contributing to the penetration of individual rock particles for cu 3 2 4 1 11 2 kpa equal 10 3 7 6 and 2 of the initial breakwater section respectively also the amount of material loss caused by the flow of sludge into rock pores for the three mentioned undrained shear strengths are equal to 15 1 10 4 and 5 9 of the initial section respectively so current study indicates that failing to account for these two mechanisms can lead to considerable underestimation of the required material for construction keywords soft seabed rubble mound breakwater material loss settlement geotechnical centrifuge modeling 1 introduction rubble mound breakwaters are commonly constructed to protect ports and coastal regions from wave action and provide sea access sedimentation caused by factors such as wind waves tides and river mouths soft foundations are much more likely to occur at the shoreline than in areas far from the coast wang et al 2019 a breakwater constructed on a soft seabed having low strength and high compressibility is always a matter of concern high settlement of a breakwater with such a foundation can cause great material loss and settlement the challenge of excessive settlements during construction of a breakwater in barth harbor germany was pointed out by schlie 2006 the study also proposed some geotechnical interventions such as replacement of the sludge layer when confronting such soft foundations replacement of the sludge when the soft foundation is deep is not feasible owing to the high amount of material loss under such circumstances the material would be dumped in a random manner similar observations were made by de rouck et al 2010 and verhaeghe et al 2014 during construction of ostend harbor in belgium a number of ground improvement techniques are available these include preloading with vertical drains stone columns jet grouting and basal reinforcement using a mattress or geotextiles the efficiency of each of these methods has been assessed in previous studies yadav et al 2019 wu et al 2019 liu et al 2017 lim et al 2018 in order to select the most appropriate approach when confronting a soft foundation all the mechanisms contributing to material loss must be determined also when material is dumped randomly it is essential to identify all corresponding mechanisms to accurately estimate the amount of material required elastic and consolidation settlement are typical geotechnical phenomena that appear when dealing with clayey foundations in addition to these penetration of the individual pieces of rubble in the early stages of construction visser and van der meer 2008 and the flow of soft clay into the pores of the rock material can occur because of the increase in surcharge mobarrez et al 2004 few studies have focused on the mechanisms that cause excessive settlements during the construction of rubble mound structures on a soft bed de vries et al 2009 and beemsterboer 2013 conducted a series of studies to evaluate the amount of rock material needed for offshore rock installation these studies aimed to provide a sound foundation at a depth of 850 m below the seabed for norwegian gas pipelines the aggregate was transferred through flexible pipes to the seabed the researchers estimated the penetration depth using an analytical approach that considered the forces acting upon the individual pieces of aggregate at the time of contact with the sludge the analytical formula was then verified with field measurements the output data and verifications were limited to the construction of a support pipeline it should be noted that the diameters of the pieces of aggregate employed in these experiments were much smaller than the diameter required for construction of a rubble mound breakwater also mobarrez and fakher 2005 designed a device at laboratory scale to determine the amount of penetration of sludge into the rubble they tested sand mattresses of different thicknesses to evaluate the amount of decrease in settlement corresponding the sludge penetration the mechanism of penetration of a piece of rock into soil has been conceived of using cavity expansion theory by hill 1998 and russell and khalili 2006 bijnagte and luger 2005 proposed an analytical approach for calculating penetration depth based on the transmission of water through pipelines several other laboratory and field tests were conducted by various researchers on the free fall piezocone penetrometer and sphere to estimate the undrained shear strength of clay foundations morton et al 2014 2016 chung et al 2006 chow et al 2014 the results of these studies cannot be used for solving the problem of breakwaters because of fundamental differences between them and the present problem regarding the dimensions and the weight of the object along with the impact velocity also the mentioned studies are not dependent on the shear strength of the seabed which is as an effective parameter in penetration much research has been conducted on the control of material loss bolton and sharma 1994 found that the undrained deformation of a clayey foundation is strongly dependent on its depth less settlement occurs when the depth is small these researchers conducted a number of centrifuge tests to analyze the effect of laying a geotextile layer over a soft clay foundation under the embankment yu et al 2005 studied the behavior of a reinforced breakwater using centrifuge modeling on a section of the huangua breakwater it was assumed that a stair step increase in centrifugal acceleration would be equivalent to the loading stages of the prototype the horizontal and vertical deformation of the clayey foundation revealed that reinforcement enhanced the stability and reduced the horizontal displacement of the foundation and breakwater body this trend was more significant when the shear strength of the foundation decreased also bayesteh and mansouriboroujeni 2019 used numerical modeling and postulated that the penetration of individual rocks was the main reason for excessive settlement during the construction of rubble mound breakwaters they found that the use of a geogrid reduced the amount of settlement this study focused on only penetration of individual rock particle mechanism that contributes to material loss it is necessary to assess all effective mechanisms in order to choose the appropriate intervention for tackling the issue of excessive settlement during the construction of a rubble mound breakwater on a clayey foundation recent studies that have proposed solutions to controlling settlement have not considered the influence of all contributing mechanisms a comprehensive full scale experimental data set is required in this regard the present study aimed to identify the mechanisms associated with material loss during the course of the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over a soft foundation using the results of four geotechnical centrifuge tests the penetration of individual rock particles and the flow of sludge through the rock pores at the base frequently have been overlooked in the technical literature on the subject therefore the contribution of each mechanism has been calculated and their influence on material loss has been assessed 2 geotechnical centrifuge modeling 2 1 design of model tests four geotechnical centrifuge tests were conducted in the laboratory to identify the material loss mechanisms the characteristics of the model and the clay foundation such as the side slope of the breakwater core the undrained shear strength of the foundation cu the unit weight γclay water content ω and void ratio of the foundation soil for each test are presented in table 1 the undrained shear strength of the foundation and the breakwater side slope were selected as the variable parameters the amount of material loss greatly depends on the foundation strength thus the undrained shear strength of the foundation was selected as a key variable in designed tests chung et al 2006 jang et al 2007 reduction of the side slope angle is a viable solution to improving the stress distribution of such foundations cur 2007 one test was designed to evaluate the influence of this intervention on the mechanisms these experiments were carried out in a geotechnical centrifuge with a 3 m long arm having a maximum capacity of 1 ton at 130 g of acceleration on a testing platform with an area of 0 8 1 m the magnitude of the centrifugal acceleration was selected regarding dimensional limitations of the box along with the size of the model so all tests were carried out at an acceleration of 50 g fig 1 shows a section of the model breakwater at 1 50 scale the strong box used for testing was 70 cm in length 40 cm in width and 50 cm in height due to the high length to width ratio for the breakwater plane strain assumption can be employed here because the section was axisymmetric only half of it was modeled liang et al 2018 yu b zhang and j zhang 2005 centrifugal scaling laws can be determined using dimensional analysis or by consideration of the governing differential equations the basic scaling law derives from the need to ensure stress similarity between the model and the corresponding prototype taylor 2005 if an acceleration of n times earth s gravity g is applied to a material of density ρ the vertical stress σv at depth hm in the model using subscription m to indicate model is given by 1 σvm ρng hm in the prototype indicated by subscript p then 2 σvp ρg hp thus for σvm σvp then hm hpn 1 and the scale factor model prototype for linear dimensions is 1 n other scaling laws are proved in geotechnical centrifuge technology taylor 2005 table 2 lists common scaling laws used in modeling 2 2 modeling of material because the soft clayey seabed was assumed to be under consolidation poulos 1988 the consolidation process was not taken into account during the creation of sludge samples in the laboratory in test 3 only after making the clay sample in the strong box the model was consolidated under a 100 kpa surcharge at 50 g of acceleration over 35 min in accordance with the scaling laws this period would be equivalent to about 2 months in the prototype the diagram of shear strength versus water content increase was obtained by adding different amounts of water to the clay sample and determining the undrained shear strength of the mixture in the laboratory this diagram shows the percentage of water that must be added in order to attain the target strength the atterberg tests carried out on the clay samples resulted in pi 18 and ll 35 the possible failure wedge were determined using the limit equilibrium analysis for the model as a result the thickness of the sludge layer was chosen so that the possible failure lines pass through the soil and prevent any boundary condition errors the aggregate used in the breakwater body had a diameter of 0 5 to 1in and a unit weight of 13 9 kn m3 the internal friction angle was determined to be 39 and the cohesion of the breakwater materials to be zero 2 3 instrumentation the transparent side of the box was reticulated and several marking foam cubes were placed in clay at various depths to allow determination of foundation displacement during the tests photographs taken of the transparent side of the strong box during testing and image processing analysis were used to record the displacement at each stage to record foundation displacement and pore water pressure in the clay bed four linear variable differential transformers lvdts and three pore pressure transducers ppts were placed in the foundation according to fig 1 the lvdts were capable of measuring up to 80 mm of displacement and the ppts quantified pore water pressure up to 300 kpa 2 4 testing procedure the following procedure was used each test test box preparation the sidewall friction of the box was minimized by gluing a plastic layer over the transparent plexiglas side of box a thin sheet of cellophane with one vaseline coated side was placed on the other sidewalls to eliminate boundary effects foundation preparation outside the strong box the desired amount of water was added to the clay and they were blended by a mixer with 1600 w of power and an angular velocity of 700 rpm to create a uniform combination of soft clay after determining that the clay water mixture was perfectly homogeneous the samples were carefully placed in the strong box in 1 cm thick layers to assure that no air was trapped between the layers the ppts then were fixed in place in order to determine the undrained shear strength of the foundation vane shear tests were carried out according to astm d2573 before placing the strong box on the centrifuge platform breakwater construction the lvdts were placed underneath the breakwater and over the foundation as shown in fig 1 next the rubble was dumped over the clay layer within the specified dimensions at an acceleration of 1 g a periodic increase in centrifugal acceleration was done to model the staged construction of the prototype fig 2 fig 3 shows the typical deformation of one sample before and after testing 3 results and discussion the deformation of the clay foundation and breakwater settlement of the ground level and excess pore water pressure were continuously measured with the increase in centrifugal acceleration and the results are presented below 3 1 deformation of clay foundation the deformation induced in the clayey foundation during testing was determined as described in section 2 deformation of the breakwater body was measured by observing the movement of the rubble fig 4 shows the horizontal and vertical displacement contours for each test in this figure the bold continuous line represents the corresponding prototype section that contains horizontal and vertical displacement contours within its area the negative values of the vertical displacement contours indicate settlement while the positive values show heave in the clay foundation also the positive values of the horizontal displacement contours are sketched to show the movement of the particles toward the toe since the most important variable in these tests is the undrained shear strength cu the results reveal that the horizontal and vertical displacements decreased substantially with the increase in cu for example in test 1 which has the lowest amount of undrained shear strength cu 3 2 kpa the largest horizontal and vertical deformation happens on the contrary test 4 having the highest undrained shear strength cu 11 2 kpa undergoes the least deformation in test 3 which had been consolidated for 60 days under a surcharge of 100 kpa the undrained shear strength increased by 0 3 kpa however no significant difference between the contours of foundation displacement for tests 2 and 3 was observed the amount of settlement in the breakwater body in test 3 especially at the crest showed less material loss but the amount of settlement in the foundation is almost the same in test 3 the surficial layer has been consolidated under the applied surcharge so this thin layer experiences over consolidation oc condition this thin over consolidated layer causes the elimination of one of the excessive settlement mechanisms being the penetration of individual pieces of rubble in the sludge foundation this leads to a reduction in crest settlement in comparison tests 3 and 4 detailed description could be found in section 4 1 in this regard a comparison between fig 4 b and 4 c reveals that deformation contours of the clayey foundation are slightly different it could be concluded that marginal changes in the breakwater side slope have little influence on foundation deformation 3 2 settlement at ground level ground surface settlement was measured by the four lvdt sensors in the test box fig 5 shows the results of settlement versus the height of the breakwater at different acceleration levels for each lvdt the location of each loading step for the staged modeling can be seen the settlement recorded during each step should be considered equal to the consolidation settlement the results indicate that this type of settlement consolidation has marginal effect on material loss compared to the total settlement so consolidation settlement during the construction period was negligible by fitting a regression line through the final data recorded by the lvdts which represents surficial settlement of the foundation at a breakwater height of 8 m the deformed seabed was sketched for each test fig 6 shows the scaled deformation of the prototype along with the displacement vectors for each test according to fig 6 the maximum amount of material loss occurs below the breakwater crest since the amount of stress in the foundation is maximum below the crest it is evident from a geotechnical perspective that the major part of displacements takes place at this location however an interesting point could be observed in the obtained results looking closely at fig 6 a the breakwater crest s deformation line show a settlement of 4 5 m but the deformation lines of the foundation just beneath the breakwater crest show an amount of around 3 5 m the 1 m difference in this test demonstrates one interesting mechanism in the construction of rubble mound structures over sludge foundations the reason for this difference is the penetration of the individual rock particles the details related to the calculation of material loss caused by this mechanism are thoroughly described in section 4 1 another significant observation in fig 6 a is related to bed deformation vectors sketched according to the marking foam cubes placed in the clayey foundation apparently the size of the bed deformation vector at 1st row located at the surficial layer has to be the same size as the sludge foundation surficial deformation dashed lines but this is not observed in the sketched drawings the reason can be found in another contributing mechanism introduced as the flow of sludge into rock pores in this article this brand new mechanism was assessed in section 4 3 the mentioned observation in fig 6 b 6 c and 6 d depends on the circumstances of each test and the amount of cu for example in test 4 the increase in cu counteracts the influence of the two discussed mechanisms fig 7 shows the foundation settlement for each test for comparison because of the symmetrical geometry of the breakwater the deformation of both sides was considered to be identical it can be seen that foundation deformation at the breakwater crest decreased remarkably when the undrained shear strength decreased on the other hand foundation heave at the breakwater toe experienced less variation 3 3 pore water pressure the excess pore pressure associated with each construction stage was measured at three points in tests 1 and 4 the change in pore water pressure over time and the height of the breakwater are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively because of the low permeability of clay the trend of change in pore pressure increased at a steady rate throughout the loading time and no considerable pore pressure dissipation was observed 4 main mechanisms

was not taken into account as a result the centrifuge tests terminated a short while after completion of the breakwater the amount of settlement at each loading step during the tests defined the consolidation settlement which was negligible in all tests immediate settlement occurs both in clay and sand this kind of settlement causes the foundation to deform however in the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over clay this deformation does not occur as a consequence of volume change or an alteration in the structure of the soil instead it takes place by driving the clay to the sides this occurs because loading is relatively fast throughout construction of the breakwater with no time for drainage or volume change the deformation occurred in undrained conditions it should be noted that long term staged construction of such structures helps reduce the amount of material loss 4 3 flow of soft clay into rubble pores the last mechanism affecting material loss during the construction of a rubble mound breakwater is the penetration of soft clay into the pores of the rubble as stated in the early stages of material dumping some of the rubble particles penetrate the sludge to form a clay foundation in this situation a combination of clay and rock exists at the surface as the dumping of the rubble proceeds and the surcharge increases the surficial stress grows the surficial soft clay having a moisture content near the liquid limit acts like a viscous fluid under this condition the pores between the rocks act as pipelines with the stress build up the soft clay begins to flow into these pores fig 11 this mechanism increases settlement and as a result the amount of material loss the dashed line on the surface of the foundation in fig 10 corresponds to the deformation measured by the lvdts during testing regardless of the consolidation settlement this line represents the sum of elastic settlement and settlement caused by the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores considering the relatively fast process of loading the behavior of the clay foundation can be assumed to be perfectly undrained it is expected that the deformation underneath the breakwater v bed deformation will be equal to the deformation at the toe front v total heave in the tests of the present study because of the porous body of the breakwater some of the material flowed into the rock mass this means that the material flow v material flow can be calculated as 6 v material flow v bed deformation v total heave this equation yields the volume of material flowing into the rocks for a 1 m length of the breakwater as given in table 4 also the amount of material loss caused by the material flowing into the rock pore s as a percentage of the initial breakwater volume is given in the 5th column of table 4 the results indicate that the amount of material loss in this mechanism is greater than for the individual penetration mechanism which conflicts with the findings of beemsterboer 2013 as explained the amount of material loss below the breakwater the settled volume sketched as dashed line in the diagrams of fig 6 is a representative of the sum of two settlements the settlement caused by material flow vmaterial flow and the elastic settlement velastic deformaion thereby the following equation could be derived vbed deformation velastic deformaion vmaterial flow 7 velastic deformaion vbed deformation vmaterial flow based on the above equation the amount of material loss attributed to elastic settlement could be acquired this quantity is calculated as a percentage of the initial volume of the breakwater and presented in the last column of table 4 fig 12 shows the percentage of material loss attributed to each parameter versus the undrained shear strength the tests having identical conditions are drawn on the graph for purposes of comparison the loss due to elastic settlement was calculated as shown in table 4 versus the amount of heave the amount of material loss caused by elastic settlement was found to be the most effective factor in total loss as the gradients of the curves show in fig 10 the amount of rock penetration increased significantly when the undrained shear strength dropped to below 4 kpa for all mechanisms investigated in the construction of a rubble mound breakwater over a clay foundation at c u 3 2 kpa about 25 of the material was wasted because of penetration of individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores if a designer does not take these two mechanisms into account and only considers short term and long term settlement the estimation of the materials will have an approximate error of 25 this imposes a heavy burden on the budget of a marine project because of the difficulty of supplying rock material 5 conclusions in this study four geotechnical centrifuge tests were carried out in order to identify the mechanisms affecting large deformation of a rubble mound breakwater constructed over soft clayey bed two mechanisms appear to have been overlooked in the technical literature because they are specific to rubble mound structures the penetration of individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay through the porous body of the breakwater these two mechanisms are important because a remarkable portion of the settlements and consequently the material loss is attributed to them in the design of the tests the undrained shear strength of the foundation was chosen as the variable and the impacts of each of the above mechanisms were assessed along with the elastic and consolidation settlements the amount of penetration individual pieces of rubble and the flow of soft clay into the rubble pores at c u 3 2 kpa was about 10 3 and 15 1 of the initial volume respectively at c u 11 2 kpa it was about 2 and 5 9 of the initial volume respectively so if a designer does not take these two mechanisms into account and only considers short term and long term settlement the estimation of the materials loss would have considerable errors also the results indicate that as the sludge foundation consolidated individual penetration decreased significantly however because of the high stress at the interface of the breakwater and the foundation this did not considerably influence the flow of soft clay into the rock pores credit authorship contribution

21594,the theoretical prediction of trimaran motion and load in complex environment has always been a hot issue in the field of ship and ocean engineering based on the calculation principle of rankine source and free surface green function for solving ship wave interaction a new kind of nonlinear three dimensional time domain rankine green matching method for simulating the trimaran motion and wave load in head seas is studied in the numerical simulation the influence of factors such as wave slamming green water panel space and density are investigated systematically and the elevation of surrounding wave surface caused by speed effect and side hull interference is also considered to modify the instantaneous impact load in order to verify the reliability of rankine green matching method a kind of segmented trimaran model with water jet propulsion system was designed and taken in regular and irregular waves finally the numerical forecasting values based on rankine green matching method are compared with the results of model test and traditional frequency domain green function method to illustrate its advantages and application scope keywords trimaran potential flow theory rankine green matching method wave load 1 introduction initial trimaran appeared in polynesia at the beginning of 11th century in order to improve seakeeping performance of canoe the local fishermen placed two independent wooden floating bodies at the port and starboard sides of single hull wooden boat and fixed them using some bamboos thus forming a unique three hull boat in the 1990s on the basis of traditional ship design british scholars put forward the concept of modern high speed trimaran firstly and this concept design of trimaran had been widely used in warships and civil ships since then pattison d 1994 subsequently based on the high performance ship plan a new type of trimaran called rv triton was designed and built in 2000 which gradually opened the prelude of modern trimaran research some relevant researches indicated the trimaran could achieve better seakeeping performance and smaller wave making resistance under the reasonable arrangement of side hull wang et al 2011 these incomparable advantages brought trimarans a wider application prospect but the flow interference of side hull and instantaneous impact phenomena in high speed also make the trimaran motion and load become a difficult issue for numerical simulation in fact the numerical forecasting research towards trimaran motion and load has never stopped and always followed the development of traditional ship numerical calculations the theoretical forecasting method for trimaran had been pushed forward from the empirical formula to the numerical simulation and the dimension of mathematical ship model solved was also gradually raised from the original two dimension to the three dimension the motion and wave load calculation method based on potential flow theory had been used widely in ship industry for its advantages which took less computer resources and faster calculation speed newman 1979 due to the difference in the processing of time term and the selection of green function the potential flow theory also had two branches that are frequency domain and time domain potential flow theories and these numerical calculations towards trimaran had both made remarkable progress under these two theories based on the potential flow theory in frequency domain bingham et al 2001 studied the motion and wave load of trimaran using three numerical simulation methods which included the frequency domain pulsating source method frequency domain moving pulsating source method and hydroelastic method in their research it was found that there was little difference on the load prediction results between the pulsating source method and moving pulsating source method at low speed while this gap became relatively obvious at high speed and the predicted values of hydroelastic method and rigid body method also appeared deviation in some cases then hebblewhite et al 2007 investigated the effect of side hull arrangement towards the heave and pitch of a round bilge high speed trimaran using the hydros software in frequency domain through comparison of the results obtained theoretically and experimentally it was proved that the trimaran longitudinal motion characteristics can be effectively reflected by the numerical simulation and the roll motion of trimaran in theoretical prediction was also feasible based on onas 2009 research for wave induced load wu et al 2008 applied the frequency domain potential flow theory to predict the trimaran load in both short term and long term compared with the calculated values of simplified formula in lloyd s classification society the reliability of wave load simulation based on three dimensional frequency domain method was demonstrated based on the frequency domain hydroelastic theory tang et al 2016 studied the wave load of trimaran in regular waves through the comparison with the load results of trimaran model test the hydroelastic method for load forecasting of trimaran was demonstrated to be useful although it was relatively simple and fast to apply the frequency domain potential flow theory to calculate the motion and wave load of trimaran in steady state it was still difficult to solve such instantaneous problems as hull wet surface fluctuation wave slamming and green water however the time domain potential flow theory which did not separate the time term in the solving process showed its advantages in this respect especially with the rapid development of computer technology it provided favorable conditions for solving ship motion and load in time domain potential flow theory based on the time domain potential flow theory ma et al 2012 studied the trimaran motion under oblique regular waves using time domain 2 5d method the roll damping coefficients obtained from the model experiment were combined with the time domain 2 5d theory to predict the rolling motion of trimaran his research indicated the forecasting results were in good agreement with the measured value in model tests in the three dimensional time domain potential flow theory for ship motion and loads the main methods used at present are time domain free surface green function method and time domain rankine source method although free surface green function can satisfy the linear boundary conditions well its integral characteristics of high frequency oscillation and amplitude enlargement brought some difficulties in numerical simulation especially when the free surface green function method was used to calculate the non straight walled ship the numerical oscillation and divergence may occur therefore scholars often adopt rankine source method which was more flexible to calculate the motion and wave load of trimaran xiang 2008 applied the time domain rankine method to systematically analyze the effect of trimaran motion and wave load by the factors such as sailing speed wave direction side hull arrangement and hull type and xu 2008 summarized the characteristics of trimaran motion and wave load in irregular waves using the time domain rankine source method wang et al 2010 combined nurbs method with rankine source method to simulate the trimaran heave and pitch motion in his study the influence of motion on wave resistance was illustrated and the effect of side hull interference on additional mass and inertia moment toward trimaran was also analyzed wang et al 2009 xu and zhang 2011a studied the motion and load of trimaran at different water depths and speeds under the rankine source method and the side hull position with the smallest wave load was also identified in his research xu and zhang 2011b based on the wave data of north atlantic ocean li 2014 calculated the load response function using the rankine source method to build the wave load forecasting of trimaran in long term although it is relatively mature to predict the motion and wave load of trimaran using time domain rankine source method this method still had its own shortcomings in fact the rankine source method needed a large number of panels on the wave free surface and there were also some difficulties in the numerical processing of radiation potential therefore in order to make up for the shortcomings of rankine source method scholars tried to mix two kinds of time domain green functions zhang et al 1998 put forward the hybrid green function matching method and this method gradually matured with the development of time domain potential flow theory in the rankine green matching method the flow field was divided into two basins artificially the rankine function and the free surface green function was applied in the inner and outer region respectively a simple regular wall was used on the artificial control surface thus avoiding the numerical divergence of free surface green function on the outer free surface obviously this rankine green matching method could obtain the advantages of these two green functions then lin et al 1999 extended this method to the calculation of hull motion and load response and demonstrated that it was superior to the free surface green function method in the prediction of ship wave load subsequently tong 2014 studied the heave and wave exciting force of hemisphere using rankine green matching method compared with the results of king 1987 research the reliability of his method was demonstrated based on this hybrid method tang 2014 simulated the motion of wigley hull further when the ship was beside a rectangular barge and li 2016 studied the motion of wigley hull in forward speed combined the rankine green matching method with high order panel the validity of rankine green matching theory and numerical implementation towards simplified hull was preliminarily proved in view of the advantages of the time domain rankine green matching method it has a high application prospect to predict the motion and load of trimaran so far there are few researches towards the numerical forecasting of trimaran motion and wave load using the time domain rankine green matching method and there is also a lack of corresponding analysis on the characteristics of trimaran motion and wave load in numerical simulation in addition most ship numerical forecasting researches about the rankine green matching method only focus on the linear fluid force and the nonlinear factors are always neglected when ship is sailing in high wave and speed relevant research indicated that nonlinear factors such as slamming and green water had some influence on the motion and load of trimaran nowruzi et al 2020 obviously the nonlinear numerical prediction of trimaran motion and load based on the time domain hybrid green function is urgently needed therefore in the paper a kind of nonlinear forecasting method towards trimaran motion and wave load is studied in detail based on the time domain rankine green matching method in the time domain numerical simulation the effects of wave slamming transient loads at the main hull side hull and cross bridge wet deck are taken into account and the green water at main hull and side hull is also calculated in addition the numerical calculation of slamming and green water force is further revised by considering the wave surface lifting under the speed effect and interference of side hulls the instantaneous wet surface changes caused by the hull large scale motion are also included under the combination of b spline surface method and instantaneous element division method in order to verify the reliability of rankine green matching method towards trimaran the segmented trimaran model with water jet propulsion system was designed and taken in different wave cases finally the numerical results using this rankine green method is analyzed and compared with the results of model test and the traditional frequency domain method and the application scope and advantage of nonlinear rankine green matching method for trimaran is also illustrated through the comprehensive research toward trimaran motion and wave load forecasting method it is beneficial to improve the efficiency of trimaran numerical forecasting and contributed to the development of trimaran structural design optimization and structural strength assessment 2 theory of time domain rankine green matching method 2 1 time domain potential flow theory when the potential flow theory is applied to solve the motion and wave load of trimaran in waves it is assumed that the fluid around ship is incompressible and inviscid the surface tension of fluid is also neglected and the fluid flow is regarded as a kind of irrotational motion thus the velocity potential exists in fluid in the ship following translational coordinate the velocity potential in the whole flow field is decomposed as follows 1 φ t u 0 x φ 0 φ i t k 1 7 φ k t where u 0 x φ 0 denotes steady velocity potential it is solved on the double body assumption kring 1994 φ k is the unsteady perturbation velocity potential which can be further decomposed into radiation velocity potential and diffraction velocity potential when k is 1 6 φ k denotes the radiation velocity potential under the six degree of freedom motion of trimaran and φ 7 is the diffraction velocity potential φ i represents the velocity potential of incident wave its analytical expression is as follows 2 φ i t a g ω e k z sin k x cos β y sin β ω t ε herein ω is the wave natural frequency k is the wave number and β is heading angle ε denotes the phase of regular wave the amplitude of regular incident wave is expressed as a and t is the time moment for wave numerical simulation 2 2 division of flow field around ship in the time domain rankine green method the whole flow field around trimaran is artificially divided into two parts namely the internal flow field ω i and the external flow field ω i i as shown in fig 1 herein s b denotes the wet surface of trimaran s f is the free surface of flow s c is the manual control boundary and s is the flow field boundary at the infinity thus the unsteady perturbation velocity potential in the whole fluid domain can be further decomposed into 3 φ k t φ k i t φ k i i t where φ k i is the perturbation velocity potential in the internal flow field and φ k i i is the perturbation velocity potential for the external flow field these velocity potential should also satisfy the related boundary conditions and initial conditions in potential flow theory 2 2 1 internal and external domain of flow field according to green second theorem and the division of flow field in the internal domain of flow field the perturbation velocity potential satisfies the boundary integral equation based on rankine source as shown in eq 4 4 2 π ϕ k i p t s ϕ k i q t n q 1 r d s q s 1 r n q ϕ k i q t d s q p q s c s f s b where p x y z t and q ξ η ζ t is the location of source point and field point in the inner domain respectively r denotes the distance between the source point and field point in the external domain of flow field the green second theorem and free surface green function is applied thus the perturbation potential satisfies the boundary integral equation as follows 5 2 π φ k i i p t s c φ k i i q t g 0 n q g 0 φ k i i q t n q d s q t 0 t d τ s c φ k i i q τ n q g g n q φ k i i q τ d s q u 0 2 g t 0 t d τ γ φ k i i q τ ξ g g ξ φ k i i q τ d η u 0 g t 0 t d τ γ φ k i i q τ τ g g τ φ k i i q τ d η where g 0 is instantaneous term of free surfaces green function g is free surface memory term of free surfaces green function they are calculated using the precise time integration li et al 2015 2 2 2 artificial control surface the unsteady perturbation velocity potential satisfies the flow continuous condition on control surface therefore the velocity potential and its normal derivatives in the internal and external fluid domains are equal on the control surface the specific equations are as follows 6 ϕ k i ϕ k i i p q s c 7 ϕ k i n ϕ k i i n p q s c 2 3 numerical simulation method of unsteady velocity potential in potential flow theory the interaction between hull and waves is finally transformed into the relationship of velocity potential in order to calculate the unsteady velocity potential effectively the unsteady velocity potential of internal and external domain is further divided into the first instantaneous velocity potential ψ 1 k the second instantaneous velocity potential ψ 2 k and memory velocity potential χ k as shown in eq 8 8 ϕ k p t ψ 1 k p δ t ψ 2 k p h t χ k p t k 1 2 6 herein ψ 1 k is represent as the instantaneous effect of trimaran suffered a pulse velocity at the initial time and ψ 2 k is the auxiliary instantaneous term of trimaran motion with forward speed χ k is the partial item of pulse velocity memory which reflects the memory effect induced by ship displacement after the impulse excitation combined with the auxiliary instantaneous term ψ 2 k based on the surface conditions satisfied by velocity potential in potential flow theory it is deduced that the surface conditions satisfied by the instantaneous velocity potential and memory velocity potential are as follows 9 2 ψ 1 k 0 i n f l u i d ψ 1 k 0 o n s f ψ 1 k n n k o n s b 10 2 ψ 2 k 0 i n f l u i d ψ 2 k 0 o n s f ψ 2 k n m k o n s b 11 2 χ k 0 i n f l u i d t u 0 x 2 g z χ k ψ 2 k 0 o n s f χ k n 0 o n s b χ k t 0 0 χ k t t 0 g ψ 1 k z o n s f the boundary integral equation satisfied by the instantaneous velocity potential and memory velocity potential is obtained by combining these surface condition equations with eq 4 eq 5 and eq 8 then the first instantaneous velocity potential ψ 1 k and second instantaneous velocity potential ψ 2 k both satisfy the following equations 12 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 ψ c i ψ f i ψ b i s b 11 b 12 b 13 b 21 b 22 b 23 b 31 b 32 b 33 ψ ˆ c i ψ ˆ f i ψ ˆ b i s s 1 2 13 c ψ c i i s d ψ ˆ c i i s s 1 2 herein a lm and b lm represent the influence of the source point on the boundary surface l toward the field point on the boundary surface m the subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent boundary s c s f and s b respectively according to the panel method hess 1964 the values of coefficient matrix a lm b lm c and d can be calculated in addition the normal derivatives of arbitrary variable γ are specified as γ ˆ in order to facilitate the description of numerical solutions and the instantaneous memory velocity potential is also solved based on eq 14 14 a 11 c 1 d b 11 b 12 a 13 a 21 c 1 d b 21 b 22 a 23 a 31 c 1 d b 31 b 32 a 33 χ ˆ c i χ ˆ f i χ b i a 11 c 1 a 12 a 21 c 1 a 22 a 31 c 1 a 32 r c i w r f where r c and r f is the control surface and free surface item respectively it is calculated based on the dispersion of the control surface and free surface i w is the waterline integral term the value is obtained using the numerical method liapis and beck 1985 finally the unsteady velocity potential is obtained by combining the first instantaneous velocity potential ψ 1 k the second instantaneous velocity potential ψ 2 k and memory velocity potential χ k 2 4 time domain motion and load of trimaran under the assumption that the elastic deformation of trimaran is neglected the trimaran motion in waves is considered as a kind of rigid body motion under the combination of wave exciting force the time domain nonlinear motion equation of trimaran is achieved as follows 15 m i j a i j ζ j t b i j ζ j t 0 t k i j t τ ζ j τ d τ c i j c i j ζ j t f j f k t f j d t f s l a m t f g w t i j 1 2 6 where ζ j t is the trimaran motion in waves m i j is the generalized structural mass matrix c i j is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient matrix the four related coefficients a j k b j k c j k k j k are based on radiation force f i j r and obtained using unsteady velocity potential as shown in eq 16 20 and the solution of incident wave force f j f k and diffraction force f j d is also related to the incident wave velocity potential and diffraction velocity potential whose calculation is based on the king 1987 research 16 a j k ρ s b ψ 1 k q n j d s k 1 2 6 17 b j k ρ s b ψ 2 k q n j ψ 1 k q m j d s k 1 2 6 18 c j k ρ s b ψ 2 k q m j d s k 1 2 6 19 k j k ρ s b χ k q t t n j χ k q t m j d s k 1 2 6 20 k j 7 t ρ s ϕ 7 q t t n j ϕ 7 q t m j d s then according to the d alembert s principle the wave load response m j w is also calculated in eq 21 21 m j w x p t v x p a m j d m s x p f j n j d s j 1 2 6 where f j is the total fluid force on the trimaran shell and n j is normal vector of motion a mj is the acceleration of mass towards trimaran unlike the conventional ship numerical methods some non linear factors are taken into account in the rankine green matching method due to the addition of instantaneous wave slamming and green water force the nonlinear influence caused by wave slamming and green water is considered in trimaran motion and wave load the specific calculation of slamming and green water force on trimaran is illustrated in section 2 5 and section 2 6 respectively in addition the effect of instantaneous wet surface fluctuation caused by trimaran large scale motion is also included in time domain numerical simulation the relative location of trimaran in waves is recorded in every numerical calculation moment and the wet surface mesh information is updated in real time the specific surface generation of trimaran shell is also introduced in section 2 7 2 5 wave slamming previous experiments have shown that the transient slamming load has some non negligible effect on trimaran motion and wave load tang et al 2017 therefore the slamming force should be taken into account when calculating the interaction between trimaran and wave especially in a high speed condition in fact wave slamming phenomena towards trimaran occurs obviously at both the main hull and side hull bow in head sea in addition in the harsh sea environment with high sailing speed and wave height wave slamming is also found on the lower surface of cross bridge structure which is called the wave slamming phenomenon on wet deck of trimaran cross bridge thus according to the structural characteristics of trimaran the slamming force is decomposed further the trimaran slamming force f s l a m is divided into three sub forces which are main hull bow slamming f s l a m m side hull bow slamming f s l a m s and wet deck slamming of cross bridge f s l a m c and each sub force is calculated separately in numerical simulation 22 f s l a m t f s l a m m t f s l a m s t f s l a m c t the momentum theorem for slamming load simulation which is based on karman 1929 research is widely applied in the numerical simulation jia et al 2012 demonstrated the theory reliability using two dimensional wedge and applied it to the slamming calculation of simplified trimaran yu et al 2018 and jiao et al 2019a also used the slamming method to wave load simulation for monohull good results had been obtained for wave load forecasting after the comparison with the monitored results in model test so it is feasible and reliable to calculate the slamming load of trimaran according to the momentum theorem and integration method the simulate wave slamming of trimaran shell is as follows 23 f s l a m i t d m x d z z r e l x t 2 d x z r e l x t 0 0 z r e l x t 0 i 1 2 3 herein f s l a m i i 1 2 3 denotes f s l a m m f s l a m s and f s l a m c respectively x is the longitudinal position of calculated cross section for wave slamming m is the additional mass term when the ship encounter frequency tends to infinite and z r e l is the relative displacement between wave and hull shell in head sea cases the formula for calculating the relative displacement is also given as follows 24 z r e l x t ζ 3 t x b ζ 5 t ζ w x t ζ e l x t where ζ 3 and ζ 5 is heave and pitch motion respectively x b is the distances of the calculated slamming sections to the hull gravity center ζ w is height of incident wave fluctuation at calculated slamming sections ζ e l is the wave surface elevation term caused by side hull interference and speed effect it can be calculated based on perturbation velocity potential and free surface condition 2 6 green water the phenomenon of green water at bow is often observed when ship is sailing in some harsh marine environments this nonlinear water impact also affects ship motion and load especially in high wave height case based on different occurrence locations of green water green water force towards trimaran f g w is divided into two sub forces which are green water force at main hull bow f g w m and green water force at side hull bow f g w s each sub force is also calculated separately in numerical simulation 25 f g w t f g w m t f g w s t in order to simulate the green water load the numerical model of flood wave is applied and combined with the empirical calculation formula of green water in fact the flood model was built on a large number of experimental studies in buchner and cozijn 1997 research and wang 2011 demonstrated that the flood model was more effective than the dam break model at forward speed cases using impact test of ship bow model then jiao et al 2019b applied this method of green water to forecast the wave load of monohull which also proved effective therefore flood numerical model is used in green water simulation of trimaran and the calculation formula of green water load is simplified as shown in eq 26 26 f g w j t d ρ z d x h g w x t d t ρ g h g w x t cos ζ 5 t d x h b d t 0 h b d t j 1 2 where f g w j i 1 2 denotes f g w m and f g w s respectively z d is the vertical motion displacement of bow desk at the occurrence location of green water it is calculated by trimaran heave and pitch and h gw denotes the equivalent height of green water over freeboard based on the flood wave model this equivalent height is expressed as follows 27 h g w x t 1 4 π d g w 0 t h e t x t 3 2 exp t c g w x 2 4 t d g w d t herein h e is the height of green water over trimaran bow freeboard which is also revised further by the wave surface elevation of perturbation potential c gw and d gw is the correlation coefficient of green water they depend on ship speed ship motion and green water height the specific calculation of these correlation coefficient are found in wang 2011 research 2 7 panel generation of trimaran when the potential flow theory is applied to calculate the ship motion and load response it is necessary to arrange panels at the fluid boundaries for the time domain rankine green matching method the meshed areas include hull wet surface free surface and control surface therefore a kind of flexible panel partitioning method for trimaran is also studied based on b spline surface function and infinite interpolation method in addition in order to obtain instantaneous wet surface changes caused by the large scale motion the instantaneous element division method is also introduced 2 7 1 panel generation of wet surface on trimaran in the ship building field the shape description of hull shell mainly relies on the data of waterlines and cross section lines however due to the requirement of panel s size and number in numerical simulation the node information of panels often cannot receive the initial data from the basic hull curves directly thus based on b spline surface an autonomous meshing method for trimaran hydrodynamic panels is developed in the b spline surface theory the equation for calculating the surface q w v is written as follows 28 q w v i 0 m j 0 n d i j n i k w n j l v where d i j denotes the control vertices n i k w i 0 1 m and n j l v j 0 1 n is the k order and l order b spline basis functions determined by the node vectors w and v the k order b spline basis functions are calculated as eq 29 and the l order b spline basis function is also obtained using the same method 29 n i 0 w 1 w i w w i 1 0 other n i k w w w i w i k w i n i k 1 w w i k 1 w w i k 1 w i 1 n i 1 k 1 w according to the initial information of hull shell curves the node vectors w and v are calculated and the b spline basis functions for target surface are constructed then the panel nodes that satisfy the specific requirements of hull surface in numerical simulation are obtained using the control points d i j node vectors w and v for monohull with simple geometric shape b spline surface method is used to obtain the required node coordinates in the whole ship but for trimarans it is necessary to divide the mesh area of hull shell into five regions which are the main hull bow region the main hull midship region the main hull stern region and two side hull regions in order to improve the accuracy of node calculation the b spline surface method is applied respectively in each region finally all regions are joined together to obtain the node coordinates of trimaran hydrodynamic panel on the hull surface as shown in fig 2 in order to realize automatic panel generation on trimaran shell the control variables are defined and the total panel number of hull surface is obtained as follows 30 n w s n b 1 1 h m 1 1 n b 2 1 h m 2 1 n b 3 1 h m 3 1 2 n b 4 1 h m 4 1 herein n b 1 n b 2 and n b 3 are the number of transverse node connection lines in the main hull bow midship and stern regions while h m 1 h m 2 and h m 3 are the number of vertical node connection lines in the main hull bow midship and stern areas n b 4 and h m 4 are the number of transverse and vertical node connection lines in side hulls in order to facilitate the subsequent wave free surface meshing the default number of transverse node connection lines in side hull is equal to the transverse node line number in the main hull stern region n b 3 n b 4 in order to consider the wet surface nonlinearity caused by trimaran large scale motion the instantaneous element division method is applied so the panel information of hull wet surface is calculated and updated in real time according to the relative location between trimaran and wave in the ship following translational coordinate system assuming the coordinate of panel node is x t 0 y t 0 z t 0 at the initial time t 0 the coordinates of node x t y t z t at the calculated time t is expressed as follows 31 x t y t z t ζ 1 ζ 2 ζ 3 z g cos ζ 5 cos ζ 6 cos ζ 5 sin ζ 6 sin ζ 5 sin ζ 4 sin ζ 5 cos ζ 6 cos ζ 4 sin ζ 6 sin ζ 4 sin ζ 5 sin ζ 6 cos ζ 4 cos ζ 6 sin ζ 4 cos ζ 5 cos ζ 4 sin ζ 5 cos ζ 6 sin ζ 4 sin ζ 6 cos ζ 4 sin ζ 5 sin ζ 6 sin ζ 4 cos ζ 6 cos ζ 4 cos ζ 5 x t 0 y t 0 z t 0 z g where z g is the vertical coordinate of ship weight center then the panel coordinates at the calculated time are compared with the height of wave free surface and the panels below the free surface are intercepted which is regarded as the instantaneous wet surface panel needed for numerical calculation for the panels near the water line the location equation of node is constructed to obtain the intersection node at the water line the shape and the location of corresponding panel are modified further based on these new nodes fig 3 shows the instantaneous wet surface panels of main hull at a certain time 2 7 2 panel generation of free surface and control surface in the time domain green rankine matching method the free surface of flow field around trimaran is meshed using infinite interpolation algorithm the free surface around trimaran is also divided into four regions that are the fore trimaran region back trimaran region trimaran tunnel region and trimaran outer region because the trimaran is symmetrical about the mid longitudinal line the mirror method is also applied to improve the efficiency of panel generation fig 4 shows the panel partition of free surface around the trimaran because the ship length and the tunnel width is constant the dimensions of meshed free surface mainly depends on the overall width of free surface w f s the lengths of fore ship l f f and back ship areas l f b and the total panel number of free surface is also obtained as follows 32 n f s 2 n f f 1 l f f 1 2 n f m t 1 l f m t 1 2 n f m o 1 l f m o 1 2 n f b 1 l f b 1 where n f f n f b n f m t and n f m o are the transverse partition number of the fore trimaran region back trimaran region trimaran tunnel region and trimaran outer region respectively and l f f l f b l f m t l f m o denote the longitudinal partition number for these regions in addition in order to facilitate the numerical simulation of wave surface fluctuation around trimaran the panel nodes of hull wet surface and free surface at water lines are matched n f m t n f m o n b 1 n b 2 n b 3 in addition to hydrodynamic panel distribution of wet surface and free surface the artificial control surface between internal and external flow domain is also meshed using the infinite interpolation method in order to match the panel distribution of free surface the length and width of control surface are equal to the size of free surface thus the control surface height h c s is the only parameter to control the dimensions of control surface and h c is defined as the vertical panel distribution number of control surface so the number of panels in control surface is calculated as eq 33 33 n c s 2 h c 1 l f f l f m t l f m o l f b 1 2 h c 1 n f f n f m t n f m o n f b 1 n f f n f m t n f m o n f b 1 l f f l f m t l f m o l f b 1 finally combined with the panels of wet surface free surface and control surface the panel information needed for numerical simulation of trimaran motion and wave load in time domain green rankine matching method is obtained the range and density of panels is also controlled effectively by adjusting the corresponding parameters thus the goal of autonomous panel generation for trimaran motion and load forecasting is realized fig 5 shows the results of hydrodynamic panels in time domain rankine green matching method 3 model test of segmented trimaran with waterjet propulsion in order to further observe the motion and load characteristics of trimaran and verify the reliability of numerical simulation a kind of segmented trimaran model with water jet propulsion system was designed this model is improved based on the traditional trimaran model design with conventional propeller whose scale ratio is 1 25 the trimaran model has a small bulbous bow and the arrangement of side hull is at stern the length of trimaran model is 5 64 m and its width is 1 06 m the trimaran depth is 0 47 m and the design draft is 0 20 m the design scheme of trimaran model is shown in fig 6 the trimaran model consisted of a segmented model shell a longitudinal steel backbone system two transverse connecting backbones and a water jet propulsion system herein the model shell of trimaran was designed using the geometric similarity rule and made by the fibre reinforced plastic and the wet deck of cross bridge was retained to consider the influence of wave slamming in tunnel which was between the main hull and side hull there were seven segments along the trimaran model length the main hull and side hull was also separated at the 6th and 7th longitudinal segment in order to satisfy the hull deformation of trimaran model in waves the interval about 1 cm was remained at each part of segments the silica gel plates and latexes were also used to ensure the model watertight in the trimaran model the reasonable arrangement of kentledge was taken to maintain a stationary proportional relationship with the prototype ship weight at different locations and the thicknesses of longitudinal and transverse backbones in model were adjusted to meet the hull stiffness distribution in addition the water jet propulsion system was composed of propellers draft tubes transmission shafts and motors when the propellers were rotating in the draft tubes water under the trimaran was sucked into the draft tubes and ejected out from the back end of draft tubes fig 7 shows the specific shape and the installment of draft tube in model shell strain gauges were mounted on the longitudinal steel backbones to monitor the wave induced hull deformation the specific locations are summarized in table 1 based on the monitored deformation vertical bending moment vbm and shear force of trimaran in waves was obtained finally the relative errors of these vibration monitoring were also calculated using the static calibration experiment which were less than 2 5 and accepted in the model experiment and through connecting with the wooden base of trimaran model the motion monitoring equipment was also applied to obtain the trimaran heave and pitch the monitoring accuracy of model heave reached 0 01 m and the accuracy was 0 01 for pitch motion the model test was taken in the towing tank of harbin engineering university the wave maker in tank can simulate the reliable long crested wave including regular waves and irregular waves and the wave making relative error was less than 4 1 table 2 shows the wave cases simulated in trimaran model test herein the irregular waves followed the issc dual parameter spectrum the characteristics of irregular waves depended on the statistical significant wave height h s and zero crossing period t z and the average wave making time was 10 min in model test the uniform model speed was achieved by making the model to be the relative stationary with the moving trailer when model was traveling in the heading waves all fluctuation of trimaran motion and load was monitored fig 8 a shows the test process of segmented trimaran model with waterjet propulsion the average amplitude is calculated after five repeated tests and all the statistical data is converted into the value of prototype ship to analyze the characteristics of trimaran motion and load the monitored time histories of wave load amidships in regular and irregular waves are also shown in fig 8 b 4 numerical simulations and comparative analysis 4 1 stability analysis of motion and hydrodynamic force based on the rankine green matching method introduced above a numerical simulation program for trimaran motion and load is developed using intel fortran compiler for the time domain numerical simulation based on rankine green matching method the simulation stability is concerned firstly fig 9 and fig 10 show the time domain numerical simulation of trimaran motion and hydrodynamic force at different speeds and wave heights respectively in the process of numerical simulation the fluctuation amplitude of motion and hydrodynamic force is monitored in real time the relative deviation is calculated when the simulation amplitude at the current time minus the amplitude at the previous time and the relative error is based on the relative deviation divided by the amplitude at the current time which is also given in figs 9 and 10 when the relative error is less than 0 1 the simulated response is considered to fall into the stable condition because the variation of simulated amplitude in different cases is not easy to observe the red vertical line is also used to show the range of transition time the time to reach the steady state amplitude is obtained by the position of red vertical line at the time axis through observing the required transition time and the error of amplitude in numerical simulation the stability characteristics of trimaran motion and hydrodynamic force based on time domain rankine green method are analyzed in detail obviously it is easily observed that the time domain numerical simulation of trimaran heave and hydrodynamic force in these designed cases are gradually transformed from small oscillation into large scale fluctuation and finally these fluctuation curves trend to be stabilized however the transitional time of heave motion is varied with different speeds as shown in fig 9 a in the zero speed case the numerical heave motion takes only 37 65s to fall into the steady state and the transitional time of numerical simulation is prolonged which lasts 156 85s and 183 75 s at low and high speed case respectively similarly it is found that the transitional periods of radiation force are 42 75s 168 95s and 193 40s respectively in fig 9 b the numerical transitional time of hydrodynamic force is also gradually delayed with the sailing speed increasing thus it is concluded that the high speed case always requires longer transitional time in the numerical simulation of trimaran motion and wave load in addition through the comparison of transition time between the motion and radiation force it is indicated that the motion often falls into the steady condition before the load fluctuation become stable in fig 10 the transitional time of heave and hydrodynamic force in numerical simulation is also counted with different wave heights it is found that deviation of transitional time is less than 10s in different wave height cases the growth of wave height has only a slight effect on transition time in numerical simulation through observation on the fluctuation of motion and force during the transition period further it is also found that the amplitude of motion and hydrodynamic force will both fluctuate alternately in the vicinity of stationary amplitude before reaching the steady state and this fluctuation phenomenon appears more significantly in high speed and wave height cases 4 2 convergence analysis of motion and hydrodynamic force when the boundary element method is used to calculate the motion and load of trimaran in waves the dimension and density of boundaries such as free surface and control surface also affect the accuracy of final numerical simulation therefore it is necessary to analyze the influence of free surface dimension and density towards heave and hydrodynamic force in order to facilitate the comparison of boundary space the boundary dimension is always based on the trimaran length between perpendiculars l pp because the side hull arrangement of trimaran is at stern the default length of back ship area in free surface is twice as long as that of the fore ship area l f b 2 l f f under the other simulation conditions unchanged the motion and hydrodynamic force of trimaran are calculated with different free surface lengths 1 15l pp 1 30l pp 1 45l pp 1 60l pp and widths 0 05l pp 0 75l pp 0 1l pp 0 125l pp 0 15l pp 0 175l pp 0 2l pp then the spatial curve and surface with different free surface dimensions is obtained as shown in fig 11 it is easily observed that the growths of statistical surfaces on heave and hydrodynamic force both gradually stop with the increasing of free surface lengths and widths so it is indicated that the amplitudes of motion and load gradually converge with the enlargement of free surface dimension and the convergence trend is more obvious with different free surface widths w f s when w f s 0 2 l p p the motion and load are relatively stable and the relative error of motion and force is less than 0 019 and 0 011 respectively which catch the general calculation requirements of engineering through comparing the motion and force in vary free surfaces it is also found that hydrodynamic force converges more quickly than the simulated motion fluctuation the similar methods are also applied in the control surface and the control surface condition that h c s 2 0 t is considered to meet the computational requirements because the meshing of free surface is divided into four regions the influence of panel density toward motion is analyzed respectively at each region fig 12 shows the changing trend of free surface panel density on heave motion in fig 12 a the free surface dimension and panel quantity in other regions remain constant and the number of panel is varied by changing the longitudinal partition number l f m t and l f m o to observe the influence of panel density in trimaran tunnel region and outer region towards final simulation obviously the convergence of motion is found with the increasing number of panels in mid ship region and this convergence trend is more remarkable with high panel density in tunnel region the function of motion convergence surface is also described with different panel densities in fore trimaran and back trimaran region as seen in fig 12 b and the back trimaran region with high panel density converges more quickly than the changing of panel density in fore trimaran region in the stable condition n f s 6284 the relative error of motion with different panel density is less than 0 008 the similar results of panel density convergence are also found in hydrodynamic force in fact it is also found that the changing of boundary dimension has a greater impact on numerical simulation compared with the boundary density fluctuation 4 3 nonlinear transient force generation and revision when ship is sailing at high speed and wave height the transient impact phenomenon happens inevitably such as wave slamming and green water these nonlinear factors always make the ship motion and load more complex and the unique side hull interference in trimaran also intensifies these load responses further therefore the simulated force of wave slamming and green water for trimaran is observed and analyzed fig 13 shows the simulated slamming and green water force toward the trimaran at high sailing speed obviously the three types of slamming forces gradually appear with the gradual expansion of trimaran motion and eventually tend to be steady as shown in fig 13 a through observation on the time history curves of these slamming forces further it is found that the slamming forces increases rapidly at the slamming moment then this force decreases and falls into zero in the comparison of slamming happened time at three positions it is indicated that the main hull bow is always observed to appear slamming fluctuation firstly its slamming occurrence moment on average was 1 70s earlier than that moment of side hull bow the slamming moment of cross bridge is relatively later and its delay time of slamming is 1 55s toward the main hull bow slamming obviously the slamming moment of side hull bow is between the slamming moment of main hull bow and cross bridge it is only 0 15s earlier than the slamming time of cross bridge which is closer to the trimaran cross bridge slamming time then the average peak of wave slamming are counted and analyzed in the steady state of slamming calculation the measured slamming peak of main hull bow is 17 74 mn which accounts for 60 32 of the total slamming force the slamming of the side hull bow and wet deck is just accounted for 2 65 and 37 03 respectively thus it is suggested that the slamming effect of main hull bow is still most obvious and the slamming effect of cross bridge is relatively weak the weakest slamming is found at side hull bow among these monitoring positions this similar phenomenon is found in the simulation of green water in fig 13 b the green water of main hull bow is also happened earlier than the green water of side hull bow compared with the changing of green water at side hull the changing rates of green water at main hull are relatively large at occurrence moment of green water obviously the impact of green water at main hull bow is more violent than this instantaneous impact at side hull fig 14 shows the motion time histories of trimaran with slamming and green water in numerical simulation and the influence of nonlinear forces towards heave and pitch is also studied through the comparison of motion time curve at three different simulated cases it is found that the amplitude of heave and pitch with slamming forces both decreases at steady state and the force of green water brings more intense motion therefore it is concluded that the nonlinear slamming load may restrains the trimaran motion but the impact of green water can relieve this downward trend to a certain extent in order to further consider the wave making effect of trimaran disturbance on the surrounding flow field especially the wave surface elevation caused by the interference of side hull in the tunnel it is necessary to revise the calculation of slamming and green water force the wave surface elevation caused by the perturbation potential is shown in fig 15 a and fig 15 b indicates the total wave fluctuation in the surrounding flow field of trimaran obviously the phenomenon of wave surface elevation is observed at the bow of main hull and side hull and similar elevation phenomenon is also found in the cross bridge tunnel due to the narrow space between the main hull and the side hull in fact the flow field disturbance of perturbation potential around the trimaran has affected the shape of original regular waves so it is reasonable to calculate the slamming and green water force considering this wave surface elevation fig 16 shows the calculated instantaneous impact forces at main hull bow before and after wave correction in fig 16 a it is indicated that the slamming peak of main hull bow after the wave correction is improved in the steady state and the increased average amplitude is 13 35 of the slamming force without wave correction the same analysis is taken at side hull and cross bridge it is found that the slamming peak of side hull bow increases by 5 42 and the cross bridge slamming peak also grows by 9 21 obviously the main hull slamming is still most sensitive to the wave correction but the influence of wave correction on the side hull and cross bridge also cannot be ignored the influence of wave correction towards green water is also studied as shown in fig 16 b the peak of green water at main hull bow is enlarged after the wave correction and its amplitude grows by 4 30 the similar growth of green water at the side hull bow is also found after the wave correction but its peak growth is smaller than the growth at main hull bow through the observation of nonlinear transient force at different speeds and wave heights it is known that the influence of wave correction appears more obvious with the increasing of sailing speed and wave height therefore the wave correction in numerical simulation should be considered especially in the high wave height and speed cases 4 4 load prediction analysis of trimaran according to the calculation principle in eq 21 the sectional load of trimaran in waves is simulated using time domain rankine green matching method fig 17 shows the simulated results of trimaran load under low wave height and sailing speed cases obviously in addition to the numerical simulation of trimaran motion the rankine green matching method can also predict fluctuation of shear force and vertical bending moment stably through the observation of load time history curves in detail it is found that due to the influence of transient slamming and green water the shear force and vertical bending moment both appear slightly high frequency fluctuation at load time history curves this abrupt fluctuation of vertical bending moment is relatively more obvious in the crest and trough of time history curve thus it is indicated that the numerical simulation of vertical bending moment is more sensitive to the nonlinear transient force fig 18 shows fluctuation of trimaran load at high wave height and sailing speed with the speed and wave height increasing the effect of slamming and green water on the load curve becomes more significant and this abrupt change on time history curve of shear force and vertical bending moment appear frequently especially near the wave crest and trough in the same case the abrupt high frequency fluctuation is not found in the time history curves of heave and pitch in fact although the nonlinear impact of slamming and green water can affect the motion amplitude obviously there is little interference on the shape of time history motion curve but for wave load this influence of transient force always enlarges the load amplitude and high frequency fluctuation components in time history curve according to the linear superposition principle and wave frequency equalization method the wave load of trimaran in irregular waves is also obtained using time domain rankine green matching method fig 19 shows the final load results of trimaran under irregular wave conditions the time history curves of shear force and vertical bending moment in irregular waves is observed respectively it is found that load of trimaran are also irregular and random in irregular wave case and the fluctuation frequency of vertical bending moment is relatively higher under the impact of slamming and green water which is consistent with the summarized rule in the regular wave the vertical bending moment and shear force shows the large fluctuations during the time period of intense ship motion 200s 250s but the peak moment of shear force and vertical bending moment is not the same the peak of shear force appears earlier than the max value of vertical bending moment 4 5 comparative analysis of motion and load calculating method for trimaran in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical forecasting for trimaran based on time domain rankine green matching method further the numerical results of hull motion and wave load for trimaran are compared with the results based on frequency domain green method wu et al 2008 and the model test as shown in figs 20 22 herein the experimental value of trimaran model test is converted to the prototype ship value by the similarity rule and the theoretical forecasting results in frequency domain are also converted into time domain to compare with the load forecasting values of rankine green matching method in the high wave height and speed case the instantaneous average wet surface is adopted and the influence of nonlinearity on hull wet surface under the large scale motion is also considered in the time domain rankine green matching method fig 20 a shows the comparison of heave prediction and model test in different regular wave cases at zero speed the heave prediction value in time domain rankinegreen matching method and frequency domain green function method is close and the simulation trend of heave motion is in good agreement with the experimental results at medium speed the deviation of heave motion among these two numerical methods is gradually enlarged the predicted motion based on frequency domain green function method is always more violent than the experimental result it is explained that the effect of slamming and green water becomes more and more obvious with the sailing speed increasing and the combination of instantaneous impact forces finally weakens the heave motion to a certain extent thus the experimental value is relatively small in addition the traditional frequency domain green function method bases on the tacit hypothesis that the simulation environment is high frequency wave and low sailing speed which makes the speed effect unable to be effectively considered it is also one of important factors causing the prediction deviation between time domain rankine green matching method and frequency domain green function method in high speed case the frequency domain green function method still overestimates the heave motion and the error between theoretical prediction of rankine green matching method and experimental value is further reduced in fact these similar results of comparative analysis toward pitch motion are also found as shown in fig 20 b the pitch deviation in two prediction methods is relatively small in zero speed case and this deviation growth is found with higher sailing speed but the prediction value in time domain rankine green matching method is closer to the experimental value in forward speed cases therefore it is concluded that the rankine green matching method is more suitable for predicting the trimaran motion at high speed then the vertical bending moment and shear force of trimaran is studied as shown in fig 21 a b obviously the load mean amplitude of rankine green method which is half of calculated value after the positive peak minus the negative peak is larger than the result based on frequency domain green function and its mean amplitude is also closer to the test value considering the instantaneous impact load and wet surface fluctuation two kinds of load components in rankine green matching method both appears some high frequency fluctuation phenomenon in trough and crest and the simulated load curve of vertical bending moment contains more high frequency responses the difference between the time domain load prediction and test results is observed in detail it is indicated that the actual wave load in model test has more complex high frequency vibration components which often need longer decay time it is also explained that this oscillation attenuation of high frequency load in test results is derived from the whipping effect caused by wave slamming which regard trimaran as an elastomer with structural damping the load calculation model adopted in this paper is based on the rigid body assumption so the oscillation attenuation cannot be further simulated in addition the interference of air flow above water line for trimaran which is ignored in numerical simulation is also one of the reasons for the error between experiment and theory because the current model test is carried indoors and limited by the model speed fr 0 35 the influence of air flow is relatively small the motion and load of ship mainly come from the wave excitation therefore the comparison between experiment and theoretical prediction is still reasonable on the basis of test results the relative errors of load forecasting values using frequency domain green function method and time domain rankine green method are calculated respectively it is found that the relative errors of vertical bending moment and shear force on rankine green method are reduced by 13 71 and 12 11 respectively compared with the errors of frequency domain green function method therefore it is superior to the traditional frequency domain methods for trimaran in load forecasting calculation the theoretical and experimental values of load midships with different speeds and ratios of wave length to ship length are counted in fig 22 a b and the characteristics of load forecasting values are analyzed further through the observation it is found that the load forecasting values of frequency domain method and rankine green matching method are similar in zero speed case and their changing trends are also consistent with the experimental values basically the theoretical predicted values are larger than the experimental values in most regular wave cases and the load prediction values of time domain rankine green matching method is closer to the model test value compared with theoretical predicted values using frequency domain method the test value of vertical bending moment and shear force grows rapidly at higher speed and the deviation between the load forecast value of frequency domain method and rankine green matching method become more obvious in forward speed cases in most forward speed cases the numerical simulation always underestimates the wave loads of trimaran compared with the model test results but the relative error between the load prediction value using rankine green matching method and the monitored value in model test is relatively small with the sailing speed increasing the growth on load forecasting value of rankine green method shows some nonlinear characteristics considering the instantaneous wave impact and wet surface interference and the amplitude of vertical bending moment and shear force enhances quickly in high speed cases the deviation between the load forecast value of rankine green method and the measured value from model test decreases relatively compared with the gaps in low speed cases thus it is concluded that the time domain rankine green method can reflect the load variation of trimaran well especially under the condition that trimaran has a non negligible speed the reliability of load forecasting using rankine green method is higher than that by the frequency domain green function method the similar results are also found in irregular waves due to the randomness of motion and load in irregular waves the statistical eigenvalues are used to express the severity of motion and load autocorrelation function method was conducted to obtain the statistical eigenvalues of motion and load jiao and ren 2016 table 3 shows the results of motion and load in irregular wave case iw1 obviously the theoretical predictions both overestimate the trimaran motion in irregular wave and the statistical eigenvalues of vertical bending moment and shear force in numerical simulation is smaller than the statistical result of model test based on the test results the errors of vertical bending moment using frequency domain method and rankine green matching method are 16 54 and 7 15 respectively so the relative errors on the theoretical prediction of vertical bending moment using rankine green matching method decreases 9 39 compared with the errors of frequency domain green function method for shear force the error reduction in the comparison of two numerical methods is 7 16 although the advantage of time domain rankine green matching method in irregular waves is weakened the numerical simulation using rankine green matching method in irregular waves is still benefit to the forward speed cases through the comparison on a series of theoretical predictions and experimental values it is indicated that the time domain rankine green method can take the trimaran motion and wave load more fully into account in forward speed cases and it has some advantages over the traditional frequency domain green function method in fact the trends of two prediction methods are basically consistent and the load forecasting of trimaran based on time domain rankine green method is closer to the model test results in most cases therefore it is suggested that the conventional frequency domain method can still be applied for preliminary design of trimaran to obtain critical cases for high speed trimaran and subsequent detailed structure design the time domain rankine green method should be used for motion and load forecasting 5 conclusions the nonlinear time domain rankine green matching method for trimaran motion and wave load is introduced in the paper and the corresponding model experiments is designed and taken to verify the reliability of numerical simulation the forecasting results are compared with the results of model test and frequency domain green function method and the correlative conclusions are made as follows 1 the numerical simulation of trimaran motion and load using time domain rankine green matching method has good stability and convergence based on the efficient panel generation method the delayed phenomenon of transitional time is found in high speed and wave height cases and the delayed effect is more obvious in higher sailing speed cases with the enlargement of boundary dimension and panel density the motion and hydrodynamic force both trend to convergence and the increasing of panel density in tunnel region and back trimaran region is a relatively effective way for rankine green matching method to improve the accuracy of numerical calculation when the boundary space size is fixed 2 the influence of instantaneous impact force on wave induced motion and load cannot be ignored for high speed trimaran with side hull at stern the slamming force often restrains the trimaran heave and pitch while green water always inspires the longitudinal motion the high frequency fluctuation in load is caused under the combination of slamming and wave and the simulated curve of vertical bending moment is relatively more obvious in addition the wave surface elevation should be considered in the numerical calculation of slamming and green water force 3 for the trimaran with side hull arrangement at stern it is feasible and reliable to predict the wave induced motion and load using time domain rankine green matching method no matter in regular waves or irregular waves in forward speed case the theoretical prediction accuracy of trimaran motion and load is improved by the rankine green matching method compared with the numerical simulation by frequency domain green function method therefore the rankine green matching method is suitable for the detailed design and structural strength assessment of trimaran with small bulbous bow and side hull stern especially at relatively high sailing speeds in present research the nonlinear rankine green matching method for trimaran motion and load forecasting is developed with considering the phenomenon of wave slamming green water and instantaneous wet surface fluctuation but there are still some limitations for the numerical simulation in the extreme sea conditions due to the neglect of factors such as fluid viscosity wave breaking phenomenon and interference of air flow above water line so the theoretical prediction based on rankine green matching method is recommended to be used best under the relatively high speed condition fr 0 35 and the influence of these ignored factors and varied

21594,the theoretical prediction of trimaran motion and load in complex environment has always been a hot issue in the field of ship and ocean engineering based on the calculation principle of rankine source and free surface green function for solving ship wave interaction a new kind of nonlinear three dimensional time domain rankine green matching method for simulating the trimaran motion and wave load in head seas is studied in the numerical simulation the influence of factors such as wave slamming green water panel space and density are investigated systematically and the elevation of surrounding wave surface caused by speed effect and side hull interference is also considered to modify the instantaneous impact load in order to verify the reliability of rankine green matching method a kind of segmented trimaran model with water jet propulsion system was designed and taken in regular and irregular waves finally the numerical forecasting values based on rankine green matching method are compared with the results of model test and traditional frequency domain green function method to illustrate its advantages and application scope keywords trimaran potential flow theory rankine green matching method wave load 1 introduction initial trimaran appeared in polynesia at the beginning of 11th century in order to improve seakeeping performance of canoe the local fishermen placed two independent wooden floating bodies at the port and starboard sides of single hull wooden boat and fixed them using some bamboos thus forming a unique three hull boat in the 1990s on the basis of traditional ship design british scholars put forward the concept of modern high speed trimaran firstly and this concept design of trimaran had been widely used in warships and civil ships since then pattison d 1994 subsequently based on the high performance ship plan a new type of trimaran called rv triton was designed and built in 2000 which gradually opened the prelude of modern trimaran research some relevant researches indicated the trimaran could achieve better seakeeping performance and smaller wave making resistance under the reasonable arrangement of side hull wang et al 2011 these incomparable advantages brought trimarans a wider application prospect but the flow interference of side hull and instantaneous impact phenomena in high speed also make the trimaran motion and load become a difficult issue for numerical simulation in fact the numerical forecasting research towards trimaran motion and load has never stopped and always followed the development of traditional ship numerical calculations the theoretical forecasting method for trimaran had been pushed forward from the empirical formula to the numerical simulation and the dimension of mathematical ship model solved was also gradually raised from the original two dimension to the three dimension the motion and wave load calculation method based on potential flow theory had been used widely in ship industry for its advantages which took less computer resources and faster calculation speed newman 1979 due to the difference in the processing of time term and the selection of green function the potential flow theory also had two branches that are frequency domain and time domain potential flow theories and these numerical calculations towards trimaran had both made remarkable progress under these two theories based on the potential flow theory in frequency domain bingham et al 2001 studied the motion and wave load of trimaran using three numerical simulation methods which included the frequency domain pulsating source method frequency domain moving pulsating source method and hydroelastic method in their research it was found that there was little difference on the load prediction results between the pulsating source method and moving pulsating source method at low speed while this gap became relatively obvious at high speed and the predicted values of hydroelastic method and rigid body method also appeared deviation in some cases then hebblewhite et al 2007 investigated the effect of side hull arrangement towards the heave and pitch of a round bilge high speed trimaran using the hydros software in frequency domain through comparison of the results obtained theoretically and experimentally it was proved that the trimaran longitudinal motion characteristics can be effectively reflected by the numerical simulation and the roll motion of trimaran in theoretical prediction was also feasible based on onas 2009 research for wave induced load wu et al 2008 applied the frequency domain potential flow theory to predict the trimaran load in both short term and long term compared with the calculated values of simplified formula in lloyd s classification society the reliability of wave load simulation based on three dimensional frequency domain method was demonstrated based on the frequency domain hydroelastic theory tang et al 2016 studied the wave load of trimaran in regular waves through the comparison with the load results of trimaran model test the hydroelastic method for load forecasting of trimaran was demonstrated to be useful although it was relatively simple and fast to apply the frequency domain potential flow theory to calculate the motion and wave load of trimaran in steady state it was still difficult to solve such instantaneous problems as hull wet surface fluctuation wave slamming and green water however the time domain potential flow theory which did not separate the time term in the solving process showed its advantages in this respect especially with the rapid development of computer technology it provided favorable conditions for solving ship motion and load in time domain potential flow theory based on the time domain potential flow theory ma et al 2012 studied the trimaran motion under oblique regular waves using time domain 2 5d method the roll damping coefficients obtained from the model experiment were combined with the time domain 2 5d theory to predict the rolling motion of trimaran his research indicated the forecasting results were in good agreement with the measured value in model tests in the three dimensional time domain potential flow theory for ship motion and loads the main methods used at present are time domain free surface green function method and time domain rankine source method although free surface green function can satisfy the linear boundary conditions well its integral characteristics of high frequency oscillation and amplitude enlargement brought some difficulties in numerical simulation especially when the free surface green function method was used to calculate the non straight walled ship the numerical oscillation and divergence may occur therefore scholars often adopt rankine source method which was more flexible to calculate the motion and wave load of trimaran xiang 2008 applied the time domain rankine method to systematically analyze the effect of trimaran motion and wave load by the factors such as sailing speed wave direction side hull arrangement and hull type and xu 2008 summarized the characteristics of trimaran motion and wave load in irregular waves using the time domain rankine source method wang et al 2010 combined nurbs method with rankine source method to simulate the trimaran heave and pitch motion in his study the influence of motion on wave resistance was illustrated and the effect of side hull interference on additional mass and inertia moment toward trimaran was also analyzed wang et al 2009 xu and zhang 2011a studied the motion and load of trimaran at different water depths and speeds under the rankine source method and the side hull position with the smallest wave load was also identified in his research xu and zhang 2011b based on the wave data of north atlantic ocean li 2014 calculated the load response function using the rankine source method to build the wave load forecasting of trimaran in long term although it is relatively mature to predict the motion and wave load of trimaran using time domain rankine source method this method still had its own shortcomings in fact the rankine source method needed a large number of panels on the wave free surface and there were also some difficulties in the numerical processing of radiation potential therefore in order to make up for the shortcomings of rankine source method scholars tried to mix two kinds of time domain green functions zhang et al 1998 put forward the hybrid green function matching method and this method gradually matured with the development of time domain potential flow theory in the rankine green matching method the flow field was divided into two basins artificially the rankine function and the free surface green function was applied in the inner and outer region respectively a simple regular wall was used on the artificial control surface thus avoiding the numerical divergence of free surface green function on the outer free surface obviously this rankine green matching method could obtain the advantages of these two green functions then lin et al 1999 extended this method to the calculation of hull motion and load response and demonstrated that it was superior to the free surface green function method in the prediction of ship wave load subsequently tong 2014 studied the heave and wave exciting force of hemisphere using rankine green matching method compared with the results of king 1987 research the reliability of his method was demonstrated based on this hybrid method tang 2014 simulated the motion of wigley hull further when the ship was beside a rectangular barge and li 2016 studied the motion of wigley hull in forward speed combined the rankine green matching method with high order panel the validity of rankine green matching theory and numerical implementation towards simplified hull was preliminarily proved in view of the advantages of the time domain rankine green matching method it has a high application prospect to predict the motion and load of trimaran so far there are few researches towards the numerical forecasting of trimaran motion and wave load using the time domain rankine green matching method and there is also a lack of corresponding analysis on the characteristics of trimaran motion and wave load in numerical simulation in addition most ship numerical forecasting researches about the rankine green matching method only focus on the linear fluid force and the nonlinear factors are always neglected when ship is sailing in high wave and speed relevant research indicated that nonlinear factors such as slamming and green water had some influence on the motion and load of trimaran nowruzi et al 2020 obviously the nonlinear numerical prediction of trimaran motion and load based on the time domain hybrid green function is urgently needed therefore in the paper a kind of nonlinear forecasting method towards trimaran motion and wave load is studied in detail based on the time domain rankine green matching method in the time domain numerical simulation the effects of wave slamming transient loads at the main hull side hull and cross bridge wet deck are taken into account and the green water at main hull and side hull is also calculated in addition the numerical calculation of slamming and green water force is further revised by considering the wave surface lifting under the speed effect and interference of side hulls the instantaneous wet surface changes caused by the hull large scale motion are also included under the combination of b spline surface method and instantaneous element division method in order to verify the reliability of rankine green matching method towards trimaran the segmented trimaran model with water jet propulsion system was designed and taken in different wave cases finally the numerical results using this rankine green method is analyzed and compared with the results of model test and the traditional frequency domain method and the application scope and advantage of nonlinear rankine green matching method for trimaran is also illustrated through the comprehensive research toward trimaran motion and wave load forecasting method it is beneficial to improve the efficiency of trimaran numerical forecasting and contributed to the development of trimaran structural design optimization and structural strength assessment 2 theory of time domain rankine green matching method 2 1 time domain potential flow theory when the potential flow theory is applied to solve the motion and wave load of trimaran in waves it is assumed that the fluid around ship is incompressible and inviscid the surface tension of fluid is also neglected and the fluid flow is regarded as a kind of irrotational motion thus the velocity potential exists in fluid in the ship following translational coordinate the velocity potential in the whole flow field is decomposed as follows 1 φ t u 0 x φ 0 φ i t k 1 7 φ k t where u 0 x φ 0 denotes steady velocity potential it is solved on the double body assumption kring 1994 φ k is the unsteady perturbation velocity potential which can be further decomposed into radiation velocity potential and diffraction velocity potential when k is 1 6 φ k denotes the radiation velocity potential under the six degree of freedom motion of trimaran and φ 7 is the diffraction velocity potential φ i represents the velocity potential of incident wave its analytical expression is as follows 2 φ i t a g ω e k z sin k x cos β y sin β ω t ε herein ω is the wave natural frequency k is the wave number and β is heading angle ε denotes the phase of regular wave the amplitude of regular incident wave is expressed as a and t is the time moment for wave numerical simulation 2 2 division of flow field around ship in the time domain rankine green method the whole flow field around trimaran is artificially divided into two parts namely the internal flow field ω i and the external flow field ω i i as shown in fig 1 herein s b denotes the wet surface of trimaran s f is the free surface of flow s c is the manual control boundary and s is the flow field boundary at the infinity thus the unsteady perturbation velocity potential in the whole fluid domain can be further decomposed into 3 φ k t φ k i t φ k i i t where φ k i is the perturbation velocity potential in the internal flow field and φ k i i is the perturbation velocity potential for the external flow field these velocity potential should also satisfy the related boundary conditions and initial conditions in potential flow theory 2 2 1 internal and external domain of flow field according to green second theorem and the division of flow field in the internal domain of flow field the perturbation velocity potential satisfies the boundary integral equation based on rankine source as shown in eq 4 4 2 π ϕ k i p t s ϕ k i q t n q 1 r d s q s 1 r n q ϕ k i q t d s q p q s c s f s b where p x y z t and q ξ η ζ t is the location of source point and field point in the inner domain respectively r denotes the distance between the source point and field point in the external domain of flow field the green second theorem and free surface green function is applied thus the perturbation potential satisfies the boundary integral equation as follows 5 2 π φ k i i p t s c φ k i i q t g 0 n q g 0 φ k i i q t n q d s q t 0 t d τ s c φ k i i q τ n q g g n q φ k i i q τ d s q u 0 2 g t 0 t d τ γ φ k i i q τ ξ g g ξ φ k i i q τ d η u 0 g t 0 t d τ γ φ k i i q τ τ g g τ φ k i i q τ d η where g 0 is instantaneous term of free surfaces green function g is free surface memory term of free surfaces green function they are calculated using the precise time integration li et al 2015 2 2 2 artificial control surface the unsteady perturbation velocity potential satisfies the flow continuous condition on control surface therefore the velocity potential and its normal derivatives in the internal and external fluid domains are equal on the control surface the specific equations are as follows 6 ϕ k i ϕ k i i p q s c 7 ϕ k i n ϕ k i i n p q s c 2 3 numerical simulation method of unsteady velocity potential in potential flow theory the interaction between hull and waves is finally transformed into the relationship of velocity potential in order to calculate the unsteady velocity potential effectively the unsteady velocity potential of internal and external domain is further divided into the first instantaneous velocity potential ψ 1 k the second instantaneous velocity potential ψ 2 k and memory velocity potential χ k as shown in eq 8 8 ϕ k p t ψ 1 k p δ t ψ 2 k p h t χ k p t k 1 2 6 herein ψ 1 k is represent as the instantaneous effect of trimaran suffered a pulse velocity at the initial time and ψ 2 k is the auxiliary instantaneous term of trimaran motion with forward speed χ k is the partial item of pulse velocity memory which reflects the memory effect induced by ship displacement after the impulse excitation combined with the auxiliary instantaneous term ψ 2 k based on the surface conditions satisfied by velocity potential in potential flow theory it is deduced that the surface conditions satisfied by the instantaneous velocity potential and memory velocity potential are as follows 9 2 ψ 1 k 0 i n f l u i d ψ 1 k 0 o n s f ψ 1 k n n k o n s b 10 2 ψ 2 k 0 i n f l u i d ψ 2 k 0 o n s f ψ 2 k n m k o n s b 11 2 χ k 0 i n f l u i d t u 0 x 2 g z χ k ψ 2 k 0 o n s f χ k n 0 o n s b χ k t 0 0 χ k t t 0 g ψ 1 k z o n s f the boundary integral equation satisfied by the instantaneous velocity potential and memory velocity potential is obtained by combining these surface condition equations with eq 4 eq 5 and eq 8 then the first instantaneous velocity potential ψ 1 k and second instantaneous velocity potential ψ 2 k both satisfy the following equations 12 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 ψ c i ψ f i ψ b i s b 11 b 12 b 13 b 21 b 22 b 23 b 31 b 32 b 33 ψ ˆ c i ψ ˆ f i ψ ˆ b i s s 1 2 13 c ψ c i i s d ψ ˆ c i i s s 1 2 herein a lm and b lm represent the influence of the source point on the boundary surface l toward the field point on the boundary surface m the subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent boundary s c s f and s b respectively according to the panel method hess 1964 the values of coefficient matrix a lm b lm c and d can be calculated in addition the normal derivatives of arbitrary variable γ are specified as γ ˆ in order to facilitate the description of numerical solutions and the instantaneous memory velocity potential is also solved based on eq 14 14 a 11 c 1 d b 11 b 12 a 13 a 21 c 1 d b 21 b 22 a 23 a 31 c 1 d b 31 b 32 a 33 χ ˆ c i χ ˆ f i χ b i a 11 c 1 a 12 a 21 c 1 a 22 a 31 c 1 a 32 r c i w r f where r c and r f is the control surface and free surface item respectively it is calculated based on the dispersion of the control surface and free surface i w is the waterline integral term the value is obtained using the numerical method liapis and beck 1985 finally the unsteady velocity potential is obtained by combining the first instantaneous velocity potential ψ 1 k the second instantaneous velocity potential ψ 2 k and memory velocity potential χ k 2 4 time domain motion and load of trimaran under the assumption that the elastic deformation of trimaran is neglected the trimaran motion in waves is considered as a kind of rigid body motion under the combination of wave exciting force the time domain nonlinear motion equation of trimaran is achieved as follows 15 m i j a i j ζ j t b i j ζ j t 0 t k i j t τ ζ j τ d τ c i j c i j ζ j t f j f k t f j d t f s l a m t f g w t i j 1 2 6 where ζ j t is the trimaran motion in waves m i j is the generalized structural mass matrix c i j is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient matrix the four related coefficients a j k b j k c j k k j k are based on radiation force f i j r and obtained using unsteady velocity potential as shown in eq 16 20 and the solution of incident wave force f j f k and diffraction force f j d is also related to the incident wave velocity potential and diffraction velocity potential whose calculation is based on the king 1987 research 16 a j k ρ s b ψ 1 k q n j d s k 1 2 6 17 b j k ρ s b ψ 2 k q n j ψ 1 k q m j d s k 1 2 6 18 c j k ρ s b ψ 2 k q m j d s k 1 2 6 19 k j k ρ s b χ k q t t n j χ k q t m j d s k 1 2 6 20 k j 7 t ρ s ϕ 7 q t t n j ϕ 7 q t m j d s then according to the d alembert s principle the wave load response m j w is also calculated in eq 21 21 m j w x p t v x p a m j d m s x p f j n j d s j 1 2 6 where f j is the total fluid force on the trimaran shell and n j is normal vector of motion a mj is the acceleration of mass towards trimaran unlike the conventional ship numerical methods some non linear factors are taken into account in the rankine green matching method due to the addition of instantaneous wave slamming and green water force the nonlinear influence caused by wave slamming and green water is considered in trimaran motion and wave load the specific calculation of slamming and green water force on trimaran is illustrated in section 2 5 and section 2 6 respectively in addition the effect of instantaneous wet surface fluctuation caused by trimaran large scale motion is also included in time domain numerical simulation the relative location of trimaran in waves is recorded in every numerical calculation moment and the wet surface mesh information is updated in real time the specific surface generation of trimaran shell is also introduced in section 2 7 2 5 wave slamming previous experiments have shown that the transient slamming load has some non negligible effect on trimaran motion and wave load tang et al 2017 therefore the slamming force should be taken into account when calculating the interaction between trimaran and wave especially in a high speed condition in fact wave slamming phenomena towards trimaran occurs obviously at both the main hull and side hull bow in head sea in addition in the harsh sea environment with high sailing speed and wave height wave slamming is also found on the lower surface of cross bridge structure which is called the wave slamming phenomenon on wet deck of trimaran cross bridge thus according to the structural characteristics of trimaran the slamming force is decomposed further the trimaran slamming force f s l a m is divided into three sub forces which are main hull bow slamming f s l a m m side hull bow slamming f s l a m s and wet deck slamming of cross bridge f s l a m c and each sub force is calculated separately in numerical simulation 22 f s l a m t f s l a m m t f s l a m s t f s l a m c t the momentum theorem for slamming load simulation which is based on karman 1929 research is widely applied in the numerical simulation jia et al 2012 demonstrated the theory reliability using two dimensional wedge and applied it to the slamming calculation of simplified trimaran yu et al 2018 and jiao et al 2019a also used the slamming method to wave load simulation for monohull good results had been obtained for wave load forecasting after the comparison with the monitored results in model test so it is feasible and reliable to calculate the slamming load of trimaran according to the momentum theorem and integration method the simulate wave slamming of trimaran shell is as follows 23 f s l a m i t d m x d z z r e l x t 2 d x z r e l x t 0 0 z r e l x t 0 i 1 2 3 herein f s l a m i i 1 2 3 denotes f s l a m m f s l a m s and f s l a m c respectively x is the longitudinal position of calculated cross section for wave slamming m is the additional mass term when the ship encounter frequency tends to infinite and z r e l is the relative displacement between wave and hull shell in head sea cases the formula for calculating the relative displacement is also given as follows 24 z r e l x t ζ 3 t x b ζ 5 t ζ w x t ζ e l x t where ζ 3 and ζ 5 is heave and pitch motion respectively x b is the distances of the calculated slamming sections to the hull gravity center ζ w is height of incident wave fluctuation at calculated slamming sections ζ e l is the wave surface elevation term caused by side hull interference and speed effect it can be calculated based on perturbation velocity potential and free surface condition 2 6 green water the phenomenon of green water at bow is often observed when ship is sailing in some harsh marine environments this nonlinear water impact also affects ship motion and load especially in high wave height case based on different occurrence locations of green water green water force towards trimaran f g w is divided into two sub forces which are green water force at main hull bow f g w m and green water force at side hull bow f g w s each sub force is also calculated separately in numerical simulation 25 f g w t f g w m t f g w s t in order to simulate the green water load the numerical model of flood wave is applied and combined with the empirical calculation formula of green water in fact the flood model was built on a large number of experimental studies in buchner and cozijn 1997 research and wang 2011 demonstrated that the flood model was more effective than the dam break model at forward speed cases using impact test of ship bow model then jiao et al 2019b applied this method of green water to forecast the wave load of monohull which also proved effective therefore flood numerical model is used in green water simulation of trimaran and the calculation formula of green water load is simplified as shown in eq 26 26 f g w j t d ρ z d x h g w x t d t ρ g h g w x t cos ζ 5 t d x h b d t 0 h b d t j 1 2 where f g w j i 1 2 denotes f g w m and f g w s respectively z d is the vertical motion displacement of bow desk at the occurrence location of green water it is calculated by trimaran heave and pitch and h gw denotes the equivalent height of green water over freeboard based on the flood wave model this equivalent height is expressed as follows 27 h g w x t 1 4 π d g w 0 t h e t x t 3 2 exp t c g w x 2 4 t d g w d t herein h e is the height of green water over trimaran bow freeboard which is also revised further by the wave surface elevation of perturbation potential c gw and d gw is the correlation coefficient of green water they depend on ship speed ship motion and green water height the specific calculation of these correlation coefficient are found in wang 2011 research 2 7 panel generation of trimaran when the potential flow theory is applied to calculate the ship motion and load response it is necessary to arrange panels at the fluid boundaries for the time domain rankine green matching method the meshed areas include hull wet surface free surface and control surface therefore a kind of flexible panel partitioning method for trimaran is also studied based on b spline surface function and infinite interpolation method in addition in order to obtain instantaneous wet surface changes caused by the large scale motion the instantaneous element division method is also introduced 2 7 1 panel generation of wet surface on trimaran in the ship building field the shape description of hull shell mainly relies on the data of waterlines and cross section lines however due to the requirement of panel s size and number in numerical simulation the node information of panels often cannot receive the initial data from the basic hull curves directly thus based on b spline surface an autonomous meshing method for trimaran hydrodynamic panels is developed in the b spline surface theory the equation for calculating the surface q w v is written as follows 28 q w v i 0 m j 0 n d i j n i k w n j l v where d i j denotes the control vertices n i k w i 0 1 m and n j l v j 0 1 n is the k order and l order b spline basis functions determined by the node vectors w and v the k order b spline basis functions are calculated as eq 29 and the l order b spline basis function is also obtained using the same method 29 n i 0 w 1 w i w w i 1 0 other n i k w w w i w i k w i n i k 1 w w i k 1 w w i k 1 w i 1 n i 1 k 1 w according to the initial information of hull shell curves the node vectors w and v are calculated and the b spline basis functions for target surface are constructed then the panel nodes that satisfy the specific requirements of hull surface in numerical simulation are obtained using the control points d i j node vectors w and v for monohull with simple geometric shape b spline surface method is used to obtain the required node coordinates in the whole ship but for trimarans it is necessary to divide the mesh area of hull shell into five regions which are the main hull bow region the main hull midship region the main hull stern region and two side hull regions in order to improve the accuracy of node calculation the b spline surface method is applied respectively in each region finally all regions are joined together to obtain the node coordinates of trimaran hydrodynamic panel on the hull surface as shown in fig 2 in order to realize automatic panel generation on trimaran shell the control variables are defined and the total panel number of hull surface is obtained as follows 30 n w s n b 1 1 h m 1 1 n b 2 1 h m 2 1 n b 3 1 h m 3 1 2 n b 4 1 h m 4 1 herein n b 1 n b 2 and n b 3 are the number of transverse node connection lines in the main hull bow midship and stern regions while h m 1 h m 2 and h m 3 are the number of vertical node connection lines in the main hull bow midship and stern areas n b 4 and h m 4 are the number of transverse and vertical node connection lines in side hulls in order to facilitate the subsequent wave free surface meshing the default number of transverse node connection lines in side hull is equal to the transverse node line number in the main hull stern region n b 3 n b 4 in order to consider the wet surface nonlinearity caused by trimaran large scale motion the instantaneous element division method is applied so the panel information of hull wet surface is calculated and updated in real time according to the relative location between trimaran and wave in the ship following translational coordinate system assuming the coordinate of panel node is x t 0 y t 0 z t 0 at the initial time t 0 the coordinates of node x t y t z t at the calculated time t is expressed as follows 31 x t y t z t ζ 1 ζ 2 ζ 3 z g cos ζ 5 cos ζ 6 cos ζ 5 sin ζ 6 sin ζ 5 sin ζ 4 sin ζ 5 cos ζ 6 cos ζ 4 sin ζ 6 sin ζ 4 sin ζ 5 sin ζ 6 cos ζ 4 cos ζ 6 sin ζ 4 cos ζ 5 cos ζ 4 sin ζ 5 cos ζ 6 sin ζ 4 sin ζ 6 cos ζ 4 sin ζ 5 sin ζ 6 sin ζ 4 cos ζ 6 cos ζ 4 cos ζ 5 x t 0 y t 0 z t 0 z g where z g is the vertical coordinate of ship weight center then the panel coordinates at the calculated time are compared with the height of wave free surface and the panels below the free surface are intercepted which is regarded as the instantaneous wet surface panel needed for numerical calculation for the panels near the water line the location equation of node is constructed to obtain the intersection node at the water line the shape and the location of corresponding panel are modified further based on these new nodes fig 3 shows the instantaneous wet surface panels of main hull at a certain time 2 7 2 panel generation of free surface and control surface in the time domain green rankine matching method the free surface of flow field around trimaran is meshed using infinite interpolation algorithm the free surface around trimaran is also divided into four regions that are the fore trimaran region back trimaran region trimaran tunnel region and trimaran outer region because the trimaran is symmetrical about the mid longitudinal line the mirror method is also applied to improve the efficiency of panel generation fig 4 shows the panel partition of free surface around the trimaran because the ship length and the tunnel width is constant the dimensions of meshed free surface mainly depends on the overall width of free surface w f s the lengths of fore ship l f f and back ship areas l f b and the total panel number of free surface is also obtained as follows 32 n f s 2 n f f 1 l f f 1 2 n f m t 1 l f m t 1 2 n f m o 1 l f m o 1 2 n f b 1 l f b 1 where n f f n f b n f m t and n f m o are the transverse partition number of the fore trimaran region back trimaran region trimaran tunnel region and trimaran outer region respectively and l f f l f b l f m t l f m o denote the longitudinal partition number for these regions in addition in order to facilitate the numerical simulation of wave surface fluctuation around trimaran the panel nodes of hull wet surface and free surface at water lines are matched n f m t n f m o n b 1 n b 2 n b 3 in addition to hydrodynamic panel distribution of wet surface and free surface the artificial control surface between internal and external flow domain is also meshed using the infinite interpolation method in order to match the panel distribution of free surface the length and width of control surface are equal to the size of free surface thus the control surface height h c s is the only parameter to control the dimensions of control surface and h c is defined as the vertical panel distribution number of control surface so the number of panels in control surface is calculated as eq 33 33 n c s 2 h c 1 l f f l f m t l f m o l f b 1 2 h c 1 n f f n f m t n f m o n f b 1 n f f n f m t n f m o n f b 1 l f f l f m t l f m o l f b 1 finally combined with the panels of wet surface free surface and control surface the panel information needed for numerical simulation of trimaran motion and wave load in time domain green rankine matching method is obtained the range and density of panels is also controlled effectively by adjusting the corresponding parameters thus the goal of autonomous panel generation for trimaran motion and load forecasting is realized fig 5 shows the results of hydrodynamic panels in time domain rankine green matching method 3 model test of segmented trimaran with waterjet propulsion in order to further observe the motion and load characteristics of trimaran and verify the reliability of numerical simulation a kind of segmented trimaran model with water jet propulsion system was designed this model is improved based on the traditional trimaran model design with conventional propeller whose scale ratio is 1 25 the trimaran model has a small bulbous bow and the arrangement of side hull is at stern the length of trimaran model is 5 64 m and its width is 1 06 m the trimaran depth is 0 47 m and the design draft is 0 20 m the design scheme of trimaran model is shown in fig 6 the trimaran model consisted of a segmented model shell a longitudinal steel backbone system two transverse connecting backbones and a water jet propulsion system herein the model shell of trimaran was designed using the geometric similarity rule and made by the fibre reinforced plastic and the wet deck of cross bridge was retained to consider the influence of wave slamming in tunnel which was between the main hull and side hull there were seven segments along the trimaran model length the main hull and side hull was also separated at the 6th and 7th longitudinal segment in order to satisfy the hull deformation of trimaran model in waves the interval about 1 cm was remained at each part of segments the silica gel plates and latexes were also used to ensure the model watertight in the trimaran model the reasonable arrangement of kentledge was taken to maintain a stationary proportional relationship with the prototype ship weight at different locations and the thicknesses of longitudinal and transverse backbones in model were adjusted to meet the hull stiffness distribution in addition the water jet propulsion system was composed of propellers draft tubes transmission shafts and motors when the propellers were rotating in the draft tubes water under the trimaran was sucked into the draft tubes and ejected out from the back end of draft tubes fig 7 shows the specific shape and the installment of draft tube in model shell strain gauges were mounted on the longitudinal steel backbones to monitor the wave induced hull deformation the specific locations are summarized in table 1 based on the monitored deformation vertical bending moment vbm and shear force of trimaran in waves was obtained finally the relative errors of these vibration monitoring were also calculated using the static calibration experiment which were less than 2 5 and accepted in the model experiment and through connecting with the wooden base of trimaran model the motion monitoring equipment was also applied to obtain the trimaran heave and pitch the monitoring accuracy of model heave reached 0 01 m and the accuracy was 0 01 for pitch motion the model test was taken in the towing tank of harbin engineering university the wave maker in tank can simulate the reliable long crested wave including regular waves and irregular waves and the wave making relative error was less than 4 1 table 2 shows the wave cases simulated in trimaran model test herein the irregular waves followed the issc dual parameter spectrum the characteristics of irregular waves depended on the statistical significant wave height h s and zero crossing period t z and the average wave making time was 10 min in model test the uniform model speed was achieved by making the model to be the relative stationary with the moving trailer when model was traveling in the heading waves all fluctuation of trimaran motion and load was monitored fig 8 a shows the test process of segmented trimaran model with waterjet propulsion the average amplitude is calculated after five repeated tests and all the statistical data is converted into the value of prototype ship to analyze the characteristics of trimaran motion and load the monitored time histories of wave load amidships in regular and irregular waves are also shown in fig 8 b 4 numerical simulations and comparative analysis 4 1 stability analysis of motion and hydrodynamic force based on the rankine green matching method introduced above a numerical simulation program for trimaran motion and load is developed using intel fortran compiler for the time domain numerical simulation based on rankine green matching method the simulation stability is concerned firstly fig 9 and fig 10 show the time domain numerical simulation of trimaran motion and hydrodynamic force at different speeds and wave heights respectively in the process of numerical simulation the fluctuation amplitude of motion and hydrodynamic force is monitored in real time the relative deviation is calculated when the simulation amplitude at the current time minus the amplitude at the previous time and the relative error is based on the relative deviation divided by the amplitude at the current time which is also given in figs 9 and 10 when the relative error is less than 0 1 the simulated response is considered to fall into the stable condition because the variation of simulated amplitude in different cases is not easy to observe the red vertical line is also used to show the range of transition time the time to reach the steady state amplitude is obtained by the position of red vertical line at the time axis through observing the required transition time and the error of amplitude in numerical simulation the stability characteristics of trimaran motion and hydrodynamic force based on time domain rankine green method are analyzed in detail obviously it is easily observed that the time domain numerical simulation of trimaran heave and hydrodynamic force in these designed cases are gradually transformed from small oscillation into large scale fluctuation and finally these fluctuation curves trend to be stabilized however the transitional time of heave motion is varied with different speeds as shown in fig 9 a in the zero speed case the numerical heave motion takes only 37 65s to fall into the steady state and the transitional time of numerical simulation is prolonged which lasts 156 85s and 183 75 s at low and high speed case respectively similarly it is found that the transitional periods of radiation force are 42 75s 168 95s and 193 40s respectively in fig 9 b the numerical transitional time of hydrodynamic force is also gradually delayed with the sailing speed increasing thus it is concluded that the high speed case always requires longer transitional time in the numerical simulation of trimaran motion and wave load in addition through the comparison of transition time between the motion and radiation force it is indicated that the motion often falls into the steady condition before the load fluctuation become stable in fig 10 the transitional time of heave and hydrodynamic force in numerical simulation is also counted with different wave heights it is found that deviation of transitional time is less than 10s in different wave height cases the growth of wave height has only a slight effect on transition time in numerical simulation through observation on the fluctuation of motion and force during the transition period further it is also found that the amplitude of motion and hydrodynamic force will both fluctuate alternately in the vicinity of stationary amplitude before reaching the steady state and this fluctuation phenomenon appears more significantly in high speed and wave height cases 4 2 convergence analysis of motion and hydrodynamic force when the boundary element method is used to calculate the motion and load of trimaran in waves the dimension and density of boundaries such as free surface and control surface also affect the accuracy of final numerical simulation therefore it is necessary to analyze the influence of free surface dimension and density towards heave and hydrodynamic force in order to facilitate the comparison of boundary space the boundary dimension is always based on the trimaran length between perpendiculars l pp because the side hull arrangement of trimaran is at stern the default length of back ship area in free surface is twice as long as that of the fore ship area l f b 2 l f f under the other simulation conditions unchanged the motion and hydrodynamic force of trimaran are calculated with different free surface lengths 1 15l pp 1 30l pp 1 45l pp 1 60l pp and widths 0 05l pp 0 75l pp 0 1l pp 0 125l pp 0 15l pp 0 175l pp 0 2l pp then the spatial curve and surface with different free surface dimensions is obtained as shown in fig 11 it is easily observed that the growths of statistical surfaces on heave and hydrodynamic force both gradually stop with the increasing of free surface lengths and widths so it is indicated that the amplitudes of motion and load gradually converge with the enlargement of free surface dimension and the convergence trend is more obvious with different free surface widths w f s when w f s 0 2 l p p the motion and load are relatively stable and the relative error of motion and force is less than 0 019 and 0 011 respectively which catch the general calculation requirements of engineering through comparing the motion and force in vary free surfaces it is also found that hydrodynamic force converges more quickly than the simulated motion fluctuation the similar methods are also applied in the control surface and the control surface condition that h c s 2 0 t is considered to meet the computational requirements because the meshing of free surface is divided into four regions the influence of panel density toward motion is analyzed respectively at each region fig 12 shows the changing trend of free surface panel density on heave motion in fig 12 a the free surface dimension and panel quantity in other regions remain constant and the number of panel is varied by changing the longitudinal partition number l f m t and l f m o to observe the influence of panel density in trimaran tunnel region and outer region towards final simulation obviously the convergence of motion is found with the increasing number of panels in mid ship region and this convergence trend is more remarkable with high panel density in tunnel region the function of motion convergence surface is also described with different panel densities in fore trimaran and back trimaran region as seen in fig 12 b and the back trimaran region with high panel density converges more quickly than the changing of panel density in fore trimaran region in the stable condition n f s 6284 the relative error of motion with different panel density is less than 0 008 the similar results of panel density convergence are also found in hydrodynamic force in fact it is also found that the changing of boundary dimension has a greater impact on numerical simulation compared with the boundary density fluctuation 4 3 nonlinear transient force generation and revision when ship is sailing at high speed and wave height the transient impact phenomenon happens inevitably such as wave slamming and green water these nonlinear factors always make the ship motion and load more complex and the unique side hull interference in trimaran also intensifies these load responses further therefore the simulated force of wave slamming and green water for trimaran is observed and analyzed fig 13 shows the simulated slamming and green water force toward the trimaran at high sailing speed obviously the three types of slamming forces gradually appear with the gradual expansion of trimaran motion and eventually tend to be steady as shown in fig 13 a through observation on the time history curves of these slamming forces further it is found that the slamming forces increases rapidly at the slamming moment then this force decreases and falls into zero in the comparison of slamming happened time at three positions it is indicated that the main hull bow is always observed to appear slamming fluctuation firstly its slamming occurrence moment on average was 1 70s earlier than that moment of side hull bow the slamming moment of cross bridge is relatively later and its delay time of slamming is 1 55s toward the main hull bow slamming obviously the slamming moment of side hull bow is between the slamming moment of main hull bow and cross bridge it is only 0 15s earlier than the slamming time of cross bridge which is closer to the trimaran cross bridge slamming time then the average peak of wave slamming are counted and analyzed in the steady state of slamming calculation the measured slamming peak of main hull bow is 17 74 mn which accounts for 60 32 of the total slamming force the slamming of the side hull bow and wet deck is just accounted for 2 65 and 37 03 respectively thus it is suggested that the slamming effect of main hull bow is still most obvious and the slamming effect of cross bridge is relatively weak the weakest slamming is found at side hull bow among these monitoring positions this similar phenomenon is found in the simulation of green water in fig 13 b the green water of main hull bow is also happened earlier than the green water of side hull bow compared with the changing of green water at side hull the changing rates of green water at main hull are relatively large at occurrence moment of green water obviously the impact of green water at main hull bow is more violent than this instantaneous impact at side hull fig 14 shows the motion time histories of trimaran with slamming and green water in numerical simulation and the influence of nonlinear forces towards heave and pitch is also studied through the comparison of motion time curve at three different simulated cases it is found that the amplitude of heave and pitch with slamming forces both decreases at steady state and the force of green water brings more intense motion therefore it is concluded that the nonlinear slamming load may restrains the trimaran motion but the impact of green water can relieve this downward trend to a certain extent in order to further consider the wave making effect of trimaran disturbance on the surrounding flow field especially the wave surface elevation caused by the interference of side hull in the tunnel it is necessary to revise the calculation of slamming and green water force the wave surface elevation caused by the perturbation potential is shown in fig 15 a and fig 15 b indicates the total wave fluctuation in the surrounding flow field of trimaran obviously the phenomenon of wave surface elevation is observed at the bow of main hull and side hull and similar elevation phenomenon is also found in the cross bridge tunnel due to the narrow space between the main hull and the side hull in fact the flow field disturbance of perturbation potential around the trimaran has affected the shape of original regular waves so it is reasonable to calculate the slamming and green water force considering this wave surface elevation fig 16 shows the calculated instantaneous impact forces at main hull bow before and after wave correction in fig 16 a it is indicated that the slamming peak of main hull bow after the wave correction is improved in the steady state and the increased average amplitude is 13 35 of the slamming force without wave correction the same analysis is taken at side hull and cross bridge it is found that the slamming peak of side hull bow increases by 5 42 and the cross bridge slamming peak also grows by 9 21 obviously the main hull slamming is still most sensitive to the wave correction but the influence of wave correction on the side hull and cross bridge also cannot be ignored the influence of wave correction towards green water is also studied as shown in fig 16 b the peak of green water at main hull bow is enlarged after the wave correction and its amplitude grows by 4 30 the similar growth of green water at the side hull bow is also found after the wave correction but its peak growth is smaller than the growth at main hull bow through the observation of nonlinear transient force at different speeds and wave heights it is known that the influence of wave correction appears more obvious with the increasing of sailing speed and wave height therefore the wave correction in numerical simulation should be considered especially in the high wave height and speed cases 4 4 load prediction analysis of trimaran according to the calculation principle in eq 21 the sectional load of trimaran in waves is simulated using time domain rankine green matching method fig 17 shows the simulated results of trimaran load under low wave height and sailing speed cases obviously in addition to the numerical simulation of trimaran motion the rankine green matching method can also predict fluctuation of shear force and vertical bending moment stably through the observation of load time history curves in detail it is found that due to the influence of transient slamming and green water the shear force and vertical bending moment both appear slightly high frequency fluctuation at load time history curves this abrupt fluctuation of vertical bending moment is relatively more obvious in the crest and trough of time history curve thus it is indicated that the numerical simulation of vertical bending moment is more sensitive to the nonlinear transient force fig 18 shows fluctuation of trimaran load at high wave height and sailing speed with the speed and wave height increasing the effect of slamming and green water on the load curve becomes more significant and this abrupt change on time history curve of shear force and vertical bending moment appear frequently especially near the wave crest and trough in the same case the abrupt high frequency fluctuation is not found in the time history curves of heave and pitch in fact although the nonlinear impact of slamming and green water can affect the motion amplitude obviously there is little interference on the shape of time history motion curve but for wave load this influence of transient force always enlarges the load amplitude and high frequency fluctuation components in time history curve according to the linear superposition principle and wave frequency equalization method the wave load of trimaran in irregular waves is also obtained using time domain rankine green matching method fig 19 shows the final load results of trimaran under irregular wave conditions the time history curves of shear force and vertical bending moment in irregular waves is observed respectively it is found that load of trimaran are also irregular and random in irregular wave case and the fluctuation frequency of vertical bending moment is relatively higher under the impact of slamming and green water which is consistent with the summarized rule in the regular wave the vertical bending moment and shear force shows the large fluctuations during the time period of intense ship motion 200s 250s but the peak moment of shear force and vertical bending moment is not the same the peak of shear force appears earlier than the max value of vertical bending moment 4 5 comparative analysis of motion and load calculating method for trimaran in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical forecasting for trimaran based on time domain rankine green matching method further the numerical results of hull motion and wave load for trimaran are compared with the results based on frequency domain green method wu et al 2008 and the model test as shown in figs 20 22 herein the experimental value of trimaran model test is converted to the prototype ship value by the similarity rule and the theoretical forecasting results in frequency domain are also converted into time domain to compare with the load forecasting values of rankine green matching method in the high wave height and speed case the instantaneous average wet surface is adopted and the influence of nonlinearity on hull wet surface under the large scale motion is also considered in the time domain rankine green matching method fig 20 a shows the comparison of heave prediction and model test in different regular wave cases at zero speed the heave prediction value in time domain rankinegreen matching method and frequency domain green function method is close and the simulation trend of heave motion is in good agreement with the experimental results at medium speed the deviation of heave motion among these two numerical methods is gradually enlarged the predicted motion based on frequency domain green function method is always more violent than the experimental result it is explained that the effect of slamming and green water becomes more and more obvious with the sailing speed increasing and the combination of instantaneous impact forces finally weakens the heave motion to a certain extent thus the experimental value is relatively small in addition the traditional frequency domain green function method bases on the tacit hypothesis that the simulation environment is high frequency wave and low sailing speed which makes the speed effect unable to be effectively considered it is also one of important factors causing the prediction deviation between time domain rankine green matching method and frequency domain green function method in high speed case the frequency domain green function method still overestimates the heave motion and the error between theoretical prediction of rankine green matching method and experimental value is further reduced in fact these similar results of comparative analysis toward pitch motion are also found as shown in fig 20 b the pitch deviation in two prediction methods is relatively small in zero speed case and this deviation growth is found with higher sailing speed but the prediction value in time domain rankine green matching method is closer to the experimental value in forward speed cases therefore it is concluded that the rankine green matching method is more suitable for predicting the trimaran motion at high speed then the vertical bending moment and shear force of trimaran is studied as shown in fig 21 a b obviously the load mean amplitude of rankine green method which is half of calculated value after the positive peak minus the negative peak is larger than the result based on frequency domain green function and its mean amplitude is also closer to the test value considering the instantaneous impact load and wet surface fluctuation two kinds of load components in rankine green matching method both appears some high frequency fluctuation phenomenon in trough and crest and the simulated load curve of vertical bending moment contains more high frequency responses the difference between the time domain load prediction and test results is observed in detail it is indicated that the actual wave load in model test has more complex high frequency vibration components which often need longer decay time it is also explained that this oscillation attenuation of high frequency load in test results is derived from the whipping effect caused by wave slamming which regard trimaran as an elastomer with structural damping the load calculation model adopted in this paper is based on the rigid body assumption so the oscillation attenuation cannot be further simulated in addition the interference of air flow above water line for trimaran which is ignored in numerical simulation is also one of the reasons for the error between experiment and theory because the current model test is carried indoors and limited by the model speed fr 0 35 the influence of air flow is relatively small the motion and load of ship mainly come from the wave excitation therefore the comparison between experiment and theoretical prediction is still reasonable on the basis of test results the relative errors of load forecasting values using frequency domain green function method and time domain rankine green method are calculated respectively it is found that the relative errors of vertical bending moment and shear force on rankine green method are reduced by 13 71 and 12 11 respectively compared with the errors of frequency domain green function method therefore it is superior to the traditional frequency domain methods for trimaran in load forecasting calculation the theoretical and experimental values of load midships with different speeds and ratios of wave length to ship length are counted in fig 22 a b and the characteristics of load forecasting values are analyzed further through the observation it is found that the load forecasting values of frequency domain method and rankine green matching method are similar in zero speed case and their changing trends are also consistent with the experimental values basically the theoretical predicted values are larger than the experimental values in most regular wave cases and the load prediction values of time domain rankine green matching method is closer to the model test value compared with theoretical predicted values using frequency domain method the test value of vertical bending moment and shear force grows rapidly at higher speed and the deviation between the load forecast value of frequency domain method and rankine green matching method become more obvious in forward speed cases in most forward speed cases the numerical simulation always underestimates the wave loads of trimaran compared with the model test results but the relative error between the load prediction value using rankine green matching method and the monitored value in model test is relatively small with the sailing speed increasing the growth on load forecasting value of rankine green method shows some nonlinear characteristics considering the instantaneous wave impact and wet surface interference and the amplitude of vertical bending moment and shear force enhances quickly in high speed cases the deviation between the load forecast value of rankine green method and the measured value from model test decreases relatively compared with the gaps in low speed cases thus it is concluded that the time domain rankine green method can reflect the load variation of trimaran well especially under the condition that trimaran has a non negligible speed the reliability of load forecasting using rankine green method is higher than that by the frequency domain green function method the similar results are also found in irregular waves due to the randomness of motion and load in irregular waves the statistical eigenvalues are used to express the severity of motion and load autocorrelation function method was conducted to obtain the statistical eigenvalues of motion and load jiao and ren 2016 table 3 shows the results of motion and load in irregular wave case iw1 obviously the theoretical predictions both overestimate the trimaran motion in irregular wave and the statistical eigenvalues of vertical bending moment and shear force in numerical simulation is smaller than the statistical result of model test based on the test results the errors of vertical bending moment using frequency domain method and rankine green matching method are 16 54 and 7 15 respectively so the relative errors on the theoretical prediction of vertical bending moment using rankine green matching method decreases 9 39 compared with the errors of frequency domain green function method for shear force the error reduction in the comparison of two numerical methods is 7 16 although the advantage of time domain rankine green matching method in irregular waves is weakened the numerical simulation using rankine green matching method in irregular waves is still benefit to the forward speed cases through the comparison on a series of theoretical predictions and experimental values it is indicated that the time domain rankine green method can take the trimaran motion and wave load more fully into account in forward speed cases and it has some advantages over the traditional frequency domain green function method in fact the trends of two prediction methods are basically consistent and the load forecasting of trimaran based on time domain rankine green method is closer to the model test results in most cases therefore it is suggested that the conventional frequency domain method can still be applied for preliminary design of trimaran to obtain critical cases for high speed trimaran and subsequent detailed structure design the time domain rankine green method should be used for motion and load forecasting 5 conclusions the nonlinear time domain rankine green matching method for trimaran motion and wave load is introduced in the paper and the corresponding model experiments is designed and taken to verify the reliability of numerical simulation the forecasting results are compared with the results of model test and frequency domain green function method and the correlative conclusions are made as follows 1 the numerical simulation of trimaran motion and load using time domain rankine green matching method has good stability and convergence based on the efficient panel generation method the delayed phenomenon of transitional time is found in high speed and wave height cases and the delayed effect is more obvious in higher sailing speed cases with the enlargement of boundary dimension and panel density the motion and hydrodynamic force both trend to convergence and the increasing of panel density in tunnel region and back trimaran region is a relatively effective way for rankine green matching method to improve the accuracy of numerical calculation when the boundary space size is fixed 2 the influence of instantaneous impact force on wave induced motion and load cannot be ignored for high speed trimaran with side hull at stern the slamming force often restrains the trimaran heave and pitch while green water always inspires the longitudinal motion the high frequency fluctuation in load is caused under the combination of slamming and wave and the simulated curve of vertical bending moment is relatively more obvious in addition the wave surface elevation should be considered in the numerical calculation of slamming and green water force 3 for the trimaran with side hull arrangement at stern it is feasible and reliable to predict the wave induced motion and load using time domain rankine green matching method no matter in regular waves or irregular waves in forward speed case the theoretical prediction accuracy of trimaran motion and load is improved by the rankine green matching method compared with the numerical simulation by frequency domain green function method therefore the rankine green matching method is suitable for the detailed design and structural strength assessment of trimaran with small bulbous bow and side hull stern especially at relatively high sailing speeds in present research the nonlinear rankine green matching method for trimaran motion and load forecasting is developed with considering the phenomenon of wave slamming green water and instantaneous wet surface fluctuation but there are still some limitations for the numerical simulation in the extreme sea conditions due to the neglect of factors such as fluid viscosity wave breaking phenomenon and interference of air flow above water line so the theoretical prediction based on rankine green matching method is recommended to be used best under the relatively high speed condition fr 0 35 and the influence of these ignored factors and varied side hull arrangement will be further studied in the future research credit authorship contribution statement haoyun tang investigation formal analysis writing original draft xianku zhang
