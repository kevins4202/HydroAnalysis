1255,properties of fluids and media such as soil moisture may play a significant role in the absorption of microwave and heat distribution during the remediation of soil contaminated with volatile and semi volatile compounds previous studies have been performed on soil samples placed inside a microwave oven cavity in a reactor far from the waveguide outlet or directly inside the metal waveguides these conditions are far from in situ applications where the unsaturated soil is directly exposed to microwaves through the antenna slots the objective of this study was therefore to understand better how soil temperature and pollutant recovery change during microwave and conduction heating and how soil properties liquid type and saturation influence that we developed a unique experimental setup that consists of a splittable soil column inserted inside the cavity of a modified domestic microwave oven power 1000 w and frequency 2 45 ghz so that the soil surface is in direct contact with the radiated microwaves experiments with electrical resistance heating using the same column but with a modified design were conducted for comparison we used three types of soils spanning fine medium and coarse sands and two semi volatile pollutants xylene and diesel fuel the pollutants and water of different volumes 12 and 25 were mixed with soils to make the artificially contaminated soils temperature values were measured at different points along the sand packed column using fiber based optical thermocouples we evaluated treatment efficiency in space soil analysis and time outlet phase decantation the experimental results show that microwave heating technology is optimal for water saturation of around 12 which gives the best compromise between the overall dielectric properties and allows rapid and efficient heating the temperature increases fast at the beginning of the microwave heating and stabilizes because of the latent heat of the water and pollutant vaporization and then increases again but slowly for dry soil conditions a maximum temperature of 170 c was achieved after 140 min of microwave heating the type of soil and pollution can drastically affect remediation efficiency through mechanical mechanisms because of a pressure increase in addition to physical mechanisms evaporation for pollutant removal the removal efficiencies using the outlet fluids decantation were 67 73 and 75 for fine medium and coarse sand respectively for the applied heating time we found that microwave heating works better in coarser sand where classical conduction heating usually failed comparing the two types of heating microwave and conductive heating under the same conditions highlights that the use of microwaves makes it possible to reach very high temperatures in a shorter time than with thermal conduction heating keywords microwaves in situ soil remediation thermal desorption unsaturated zone volatile organic compounds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the leakage of volatile and semi volatile products such as mixtures of petroleum hydrocarbons chlorinated solvents dioxins and even mercury through various kinds of accidents causes pollution and areas become hazardous for the local environment recently the interest in in situ and ex situ techniques that are quick low cost and suitable for a wide range of physical and chemical conditions has increased in situ thermal treatment typically involves heating soils to vaporize water and contaminants based on their boiling temperature the vapors are then extracted and treated using vacuum pumps and treatment units respectively several in situ thermal methods exist for soil remediation for example steam based heating in situ thermal desorption istd electrical resistance heating erh and more kingston et al 2010 the main principle of istd technology consists of thermal conduction heating ch from an array of vertical or horizontal heaters with temperatures in the 650 800 c range in the soil contaminants in the form of volatile organic compounds or chlorinated organic compounds undergo evaporation and destruction due to mechanisms of evaporation into the subsurface boiling hydrolysis oxidation and pyrolysis lachance et al 2004 in the case of erh heating occurs due to resistance to the flow of current through saturated and unsaturated soil zones between electrodes installed into the ground kingston et al 2010 among these others microwave heating mwh presents a promising technique for volatile and semi volatile contaminants this technology has been widely investigated for soil remediation in recent years thanks to its fast action and high efficiency falciglia et al 2018a jones et al 2002 the idea of in situ mwh is to send microwaves into the soil using an antenna a slotted waveguide to remediate the volatile or semi volatile non aqueous phase liquid contaminants in the vadose zone fig 1 several microwave setups have been explored for larger scale applications such as slotted waveguides antennas acierno et al 2004 chien 2012 kawala and atamanczuk 1998 krouzek et al 2018 pauli et al 2011 or the inner tube with a rigid coaxial line terminating with the antenna bientinesi et al 2013 1 1 laboratory scale experiments regan et al 1995 conducted laboratory experiments to clean up soil contaminated with dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl connected to the test chamber through a coaxial transmission line by applying a power of only 200 w at a frequency of 425 mhz they succeeded in extracting 90 of the 1 1 1 trichloroethane from the dry soil regan et al 1995 in another study related to microwave irradiation of soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and nitrogen pahs falciglia et al 2016 achieved a 70 to 100 efficiency for a processing power of 1000 w for 10 min with a frequency of 2 45 ghz falciglia et al 2016 a study to remediate soils polluted by crude oil using microwaves was conducted with the addition of carbon fiber this study effectively removed contaminants up to 99 the results showed that the temperature can reach 700 c in only 4 min with a frequency of 2 45 ghz and an applied power of 800 w the experimental setup used a modified microwave oven maximum power of 850 w and frequency of 2 45 ghz and a quartz reactor installed directly in the oven cavity a nitrogen inlet was also connected to the reactor the sample was placed in the tube the temperature measurements were not taken during heating but after the oven was turned off li et al 2009 in another investigation a sealed vial containing mixed mno2 fe powder and an aqueous solution of h2so4 naoh and h2o was contaminated with 0 5 g of hexachlorobenzene this flask was then subjected to domestic microwaves 700 w 2 45 ghz depending on the experimental conditions it was possible to remove 98 of the pollutants yuan et al 2006 robinson and friedman 2001 also studied the effect of microwaves on sand remediation their experimental setup included a 3000 w microwave generator operating at 2 45 ghz connected to a wr430 waveguide 150 g samples were placed in the waveguide cavity and treated for 15 s by changing mw power a thermocouple was inserted to measure the temperature when the microwaves were turned off the study showed that applied power is one of the fundamental parameters in the process of hydrocarbon extraction indeed this applied power is directly proportional to the increase in temperature heating the sands at higher power for a short time was more effective at extracting the pollutant than heating the sands at lower power for a longer period this should therefore be considered when designing large scale remediation robinson et al 2014 the water content of the soil is an important parameter for microwave studies as water changes the soil s dielectric properties the dielectric properties are expressed by a real part and an imaginary part called the loss factor the higher the loss factor the more the material absorbs energy sun et al 2016 horikoshi et al 2011 found by measuring the dielectric properties of dry soil 0 water and moist soil 15 water that the loss factor for moist soil is higher than for dry soil this has resulted in higher treatment efficiency as mentioned above horikoshi et al 2011 mwh treatment of soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyl aromatic hydrocarbons pcbs performed in laboratory scale experiments is efficient at 98 acierno et al 2003 liu et al 2008 also investigated how to extract pcbs from contaminated soil in the case of soil naturally containing 0 5 of water the extraction efficiency was about 60 with the addition of 2 ml of water 20 water the extraction efficiency exceeded 95 however the addition of 6 ml 30 water decreased the efficacy of the treatment by 70 80 liu et al 2008 along the same lines horikoshi et al 2011 also highlighted a difference in remediation yield for dry and wet soil contaminated with trichloroethylene tce 15 moisture content they obtained 68 and 91 yields within 10 min of treatment for dry and wet soils respectively in their experiment the soil sample was placed in a quartz tube this tube was placed in the cavity of a waveguide the waveguide was connected to a 2 45 ghz microwave generator and had a maximum power of 200 w horikoshi et al 2011 falciglia et al 2013 also noted a difference in treatment efficacy between soil containing 0 water and soil containing 8 and 12 water when studying the microwave treatment of soil contaminated with diesel with a frequency of 2 45 ghz and a power of 1000 w they obtained an extraction rate of 95 in 60 min of treatment for soils with a water content of 12 and 8 versus 90 for dry soil 0 water under the same conditions a quartz reactor was installed in the cavity of the microwave oven so that the contaminated soil sample occupied the central section of the cavity the temperature was measured when the oven was turned off by inserting a thermocouple in the middle of the sample falciglia et al 2013 it has also been found that the removal efficiency depends on pollutant type through their loss dielectric factor cioni and petarca 2011 polar compounds with asymmetric structures have a higher dielectric constant 1 2 field scale experiments chien 2012 used mw heating for the treatment of a hydrocarbon contaminated site located in a refinery in southern taiwan during irradiation the microwaves reached the soil through slots on the antenna the generator had a frequency of 2 45 ghz and a power of 2000 w the chien results confirm the enormous potential of the microwave heating technique chien 2012 the removal efficiency was between 75 and 100 depending on the contaminant s chemical formula and the distance from the heating source temperature changes were not measured during the treatments more recently krouzek et al 2018 applied mwh technology at two different sites contaminated with diesel or heavy oils the authors used a 6 kw microwave generator with an antenna applicator made on a steel grid over a length of 1 m this work carried out under real site conditions provides valuable information e g although recovery was good near the antenna some samples further away 50 cm had higher pollutant concentrations according to the authors this could be due to initially heterogeneous pollutant concentration and or a mass transfer from hot to cold zones krouzek et al 2018 however given the complexity of the case studied it was impossible to be certain such difficulties can be avoided by using a mathematical model of in situ processing for example falciglia et al proposed such models to study the impact of the microwave generator power and soil characteristics on how temperature changed over space and time and were able to give recommendations for scaling up the mwh technology falciglia et al 2018b 1 3 objectives of this study in all the laboratory studies mentioned the soil samples were small and placed either inside the oven cavity in a reactor far from the waveguide outlet or directly inside the metal waveguides this means that they received the maximum of the waves hitting the samples without considering the wave losses this is far from in situ treatment conditions temperature measurements were not also made continuously during irradiations but after the heating processes were stopped our proposed experimental setup allows us to follow the kinetics of liquid recovery both water and pollutant as a function of time we wanted to better understand how soil temperature changes during microwave heating and how water and pollutants influence saturations as well as how the nature of the soil and pollutants affects the temperature rise and remediation efficiency all of our work was performed using the same setup to make comparisons easier one of our main goals was to compare microwaves as heating means with the conventional conduction heating technique using the same experimental setup and conditions to investigate thermal desorption in soil using microwave and conduction heating we propose a new laboratory scale experimental device although the centimeter scale used in this study is not fully adapted to the field situation it provides conditions closer to in situ soil treatment compared to the experiments performed using small reactors installed inside a microwave oven because the microwave emission point is directly in contact with the soil 2 materials and experimental setup this section presents our soil and pollutant properties the experimental setup and procedures 2 1 soil and pollutant properties three types of soils spanning fine medium and coarse sands were used their thermophysical properties are listed in table 1 the semi volatile compounds used as a pollutant in the experiments were as follows a mixture of three xylene isomers p m and o xylene and ethylbenzene mixture of three xylene isomers and ethylbenzene 98 5 and a multi component fluid diesel fuel the xylene was provided from vwr chemicals analar normapur acs and the diesel fuel came from a total gas station the properties of the xylene mixture and diesel fuel compared to water are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental setup the setup shown in fig 2 consists of a packed soil column inserted inside a microwave oven so that the soil surface is in direct contact with the radiated microwaves a domestic microwave oven samsung nq50c7235as working with a maximum of 1000 w power and 2 45 ghz frequency was used the oven cavity measured 410 mm long 275 mm wide and 374 mm deep the cavity of the oven was modified to handle the required conditions for the experiments the inside of the oven was lined with a wave absorber to minimize the reflection of the waves during heating the oven also had on its left side two outlets one of which was equipped with a fan to ventilate the inside of the oven to prevent overheating the other output was used to connect a tube to the column outlet this outlet was used to recover the vapor and the liquids water and pollutants during the treatments due to the small scale and closed nature of the experimental setup the active vapor flow system e g soil vapor extraction which is usually used in the field was not applied the oven has two other outlets on its upper side to allow the exit of cables and tubes the gas outlet was adapted to monitor the volume of gas evaporated from the soil during heating to recover all evaporated gases a condensation system was connected to the outlet of the column this device was composed of an allinhn condenser no 7 in fig 2 a graduated bottle no 9 in fig 2 a thermostated bath of the mark lauda no 11 in fig 2 and an activated carbon filter no 6 in fig 2 the temperature of the bathwater was set at 5 c the refrigerant tube is connected at the bottom to the bottle for recovering the condensate vapors the gases from the column arrived at the system through a pipe connected directly to the bottle they condensed in contact with the internal wall of the refrigerant and fell back into the bottle by gravity a blue dye powder was placed in the bottom of the refrigerant tube this blue dye is fully soluble in water but insoluble in pollutants therefore we could distinguish between decanted water and pollutant phases and calculate the liquids recovery during the heating from the known volume of each phase a camera filmed the phase decantation in the tube to avoid any error in reading the phases levels 2 3 heating column the experimental column fig 3 made of teflon was 36 8 cm long and had inner diameter of 8 cm outer diameter of 8 8 cm the column was divided into seven independent segments numbers 1 7 to facilitate its filling and sampling and had a special closure system at the heating side no 12 in fig 2 there were six intermediate compartments 5 cm long and the final one 6 8 cm long which was the outlet compartment each compartment had five orifices placed on its external wall ends and an o ring joint in the cross section for sealing purposes the closure system consisted of an aluminum ring same inner and outer diameter as the column onto which five screws 40 cm long passing through five orifices of each compartment external wall were screwed the compartments were thus interconnected by this system of screws to ensure a good seal the last compartment of the column had an outlet for the gas or liquid coming from the column and a teflon nut that is unscrewed inside the oven to hold the column against the oven wall each compartment is equipped on its upper surface part with a hole for temperature sensor access except the first two compartments close to the heating source which have two holes the column is designed to be used with microwave heating or electrical resistance through a closure system which is tightened against the waveguide port for microwave heating a pyrex disk fig 4a was used to insert into the aluminum closure system the pyrex disk transparent for the waves makes it possible to contain the soils or the fluids gas or liquid without affecting the microwave propagations into the soil column the column filled with soil is directly in contact by its front pyrex disk face with the output of microwaves in the oven to avoid wave leakage between the column and waveguide port during heating a metal grid is used as an o ring mw seal two silicone o rings were used to seal the experimental column from liquid gas or liquid leakages from both sides of the closure system fig 4a the experimental column that simulates the thermal conduction heating method uses the same setup but the source of heat was presented as a spiral resistance element 200 w as the heater and pyrex disk was replaced by a copper plate very good heat conductor the spiral electrical resistance heating element within an integrated j type thermocouple was placed between a high conductive plate copper disk from the soil side and a low conductive plate isolated plate on the aluminum closure system side fig 4b from the oven wall side waveguide port a teflon ring was installed on the aluminum closure system to receive the silicone o ring of the column and to seal the leakages from the soil column fig 4b the setup was therefore interchangeable between microwaves and electrical resistance heating the electrical energy consumption during the heating was measured using the rohde schwarz hmc8015 power analyzer finally a pid proportional integral derivative temperature controller was used to fix a desired temperature for the electrical resistance heating element to measure the temperature along the column optocon ag ts3 2 optical fibers length of the probe tip of 1 cm are used these sensors are transparent to the radiation and avoid any interference between microwaves and temperature measurement that can exist if using classical metallic thermocouple probes there were seven temperature measurement points on the column which were located respectively at 4 cm 8 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm and 30 cm from the source of heating microwaves or electrical resistance so that their tips are situated at the column center see fig 4 a sensor also was placed inside the oven cavity to measure the internal oven temperature the fibers were connected to an optocon fotempmk 19 data logger which itself was connected to a computer via a usb cable the fotemp assistant software displayed and recorded the measurements automatically for the duration of the experiment 2 4 artificial soil contamination and experimental procedures the clean soil samples were placed first in an oven for 24 h at 105 c to dry them then they were mixed extremely carefully manually first with water and then with pollutants xylene or diesel fuel to prepare the desired water and pollutant saturation soil samples arthurs et al 1995 bajagain et al 2021 gidda et al 1999 rakowska 2020 salehian et al 2012 we added 116 5 cl or 243 cl of pollutant or water to 3 kg of dried soil to make the pollutant or water saturation of 12 and 25 respectively this step was done by dividing the total soil into small portions to obtain a more homogeneous distribution of water and pollutants the choice for the pollutant saturation values 12 and 25 of pore volume are related to their residual saturations in the unsaturated zone for the real cases 10 20 in the unsaturated zone fitzhenry et al 2022 joo et al 1998 mercer and cohen 1990 the column was packed compartment by compartment by the artificially contaminated soil from the bottom from the closure system to the top column outlet finally the packed column was inserted into the microwave oven for heating after tightening the teflon nut against the oven wall as soon as the heating started fotemp software was run to log the temperature data and the power analyzer and camera were turned on to measure the energy consumption and film fluid decantation the maximum heating duration was 140 min to measure the temperature changes as a function of time along the column the experiments were conducted with known water and pollutant saturations the microwave oven s parameters were constant for all experiments power and frequency 1000 w and 2 45 ghz respectively at the end of heating we let the column cool down for a few minutes before handling it to avoid more pollutant evaporation during the soil sampling to estimate the remediation yield the soil and outlet liquid samples were taken and sent to a laboratory for analysis for each experiment this comprised one soil sample before heating as the reference one sample from each compartment after heating seven samples and finally one sample of the recovered pollutant from the graduated bottle these analyses were carried out by the analytical methods developed by abuhelou et al 2017 which gives the sample s concentration per kg of dry soil the aim was to study the influence of water and pollutant saturation pollutant type and soil type on temperature increase and remediation efficiency to do this we varied one parameter at a time while keeping the others constant in addition we compared heating by microwave and electrical resistance for the same condition soil type saturation the experiments are listed in table 3 the removal efficiency r can then be calculated using eq 1 1 r c 0 c i c 0 100 where c 0 mg kg dry soil is the initial pollutant concentration before heating and c i mg kg dry soil is the pollutant concentration of compartment i at the end of the heating treatment the temperature values pollutant concentration of soil and recovered liquid were obtained for each experiment this allows us to interpret the effect of liquid saturation and soil type on heating efficiency and compare the microwave mw and conductive heating ch processes this study highlights the role of the different parameters affecting temperature distribution and removal efficiency 3 results and discussions fig 5a shows the temperature changes for fixed xylene and water saturation sx and sw respectively at 12 the same volume of water and xylene was used for mw heating in the medium sand case the temperature across the entire column increased over time the temperature variation behavior varied throughout the column for various times and locations this different behavior may have been cause by the hot spot kok et al 1993 or the complex behavior of the three phase flow gas water and pollutant inside the column because of these variations the closest temperature probe to the mw source 4 cm from the heating source was chosen for the parametrical study of temperature changes in each case the horizontal temperature profiles at the column center are also plotted for two specific times 5 min and 140 min fig 5b shows the temperature changes for this experiment for the first optical fiber sensor at 4 cm from the heat source x 4 cm because the temperature measurements were registered every second the results are shown as a line six different zones can be identified i a zone with a very fast temperature increase ii a short stabilized transition zone below water s boiling point that can be related to the impurities present in the xylene mixture followed by a small increase of the temperature until 100 c in this stage the temperature does not exceed 100 c until most of the water is evaporated from the soil iii a stabilized transition zone related to water s latent heat of vaporization the phenomenon is accompanied by a pressure increase inside the column and instantly by the release of a mixture of water vapor mechanically pushing the pollutant liquid iv a zone with a moderate temperature increase above 100 c starting when the soil becomes dry from water in this case only the pollutant vapor is released from the column outlet v a second stabilized transition zone related to xylene s latent heat of vaporization in this stage the temperature does not exceed 140 c until most of the xylene mixture is evaporated from the soil vi when the soil becomes dry of water and pollutant the temperature increases again but more slowly the temperature rise seems to be linear in this step the temperature inside the oven increases quickly at first and then becomes stable at around 60 c now let us explore the impact of different parameters on the efficiency of microwave heating 3 1 influence of soil water saturation to study the influence of water saturation experiments were performed with xylene using the same sand medium sand varying only the water saturation from 0 to 12 and 25 in this case xylene saturation was chosen to be 12 the duration of the heating was 140 min the temperature changes in the first thermocouple at x 4 cm for fixed xylene saturation for different water saturations are plotted in fig 6a the increasing water saturation causes a faster temperature increase below 100 c then for moderate saturation sw 12 the temperature increased again but using higher water saturation slowed down the temperature rise all the curves approach at the end of the experiment as an example the temperature reaches 100 c after only 2 5 and 5 min respectively for soils with water saturation of 25 and 12 versus 33 min for soil with a water saturation of 0 dry soil the maximum temperatures reached at the end of the heating are similar for all cases around 170 c for comparison the temperature reached 100 c after 2 2 min of heating for a dry sand sample packed directly inside the microwave waveguide wrj 2 of 30 cm length using a frequency of 2 45 ghz and a power of 650 w horikoshi et al 2011 this duration was around 4 min for a soil sample contaminated by diesel fuel and placed in a quartz reactor inside a domestic microwave cavity frequency 2 45 ghz and power 1000 w falciglia et al 2013 the sample with sw 12 resulted in the best compromise between the overall dielectric properties which allows rapid and efficient heating water accelerates the temperature rise by increasing the soil s mw absorption the presence of water in the soil increases the dielectric loss factor in the case of microwave remediation this would reduce the treatment time the increase in water saturation from 12 to 25 results in higher temperature stabilization time at 100 c this stabilization is explained by the fact that at 100 c water s boiling point all the energy of the microwaves is used for the phase change process rather than an increase in temperature hence the temperature plateau the other reason is that in higher water saturation values more of the soil s pore spaces are filled with water this can reduce the vapor transport mechanism and reduce evaporation as expected there is no temperature stabilization at 100 c for dry medium sand as shown in fig 6a the temperature stabilization zone before the water boiling point zone ii in fig 5b depends also on the presence of water to study the temperature distribution inside the soil column the horizontal temperature fields are plotted against the distance from mw heating source in fig 6b for different times 5 min and 140 min as shown the temperature distributions at the end of the heating are more homogenous for water wetted saturation 12 and 25 compared to dry sands at higher water saturation 25 the first part of the column reached 100 c after only 5 min and shows a higher temperature than less water saturated cases however the temperature of the second part of the column for sw 25 decreases gradually toward the end of the column to become colder than the sw 12 case most of the microwaves are absorbed due to higher water saturation near the mw source the heat transfer by vapor convection inside the pores is also reduced because of the reduction in vapor relative permeability therefore more mw waves are absorbed the temperature increases with increasing water saturation at a shorter time for longer heating the temperature profile for sw 12 shows a higher temperature this is also shown in fig 6a for the first probe quite a homogeneous temperature profile was achieved after 140 min of heating for water saturations of 12 and 25 however the temperature values for dry soil are only the same as for wetted sand in 2 first centimeters of the column then the temperature profile decreases with distance from the heating source and becomes constant around 9 cm from the heating source the same behaviors not shown in this paper were observed for the diesel case confirming the optimal heating value at 12 water saturation the kinetics of total remediation efficiencies are calculated from the recovery liquids volumes during each experiment and plotted in fig 6c increasing water saturation increases the recovery rate the recovery efficiency is around 73 and 78 for the medium sand samples with water saturation values of 12 and 25 respectively these results are consistent with those found by falciglia et al 2013 in which a higher efficiency was reached for most soil samples as shown in fig 6c the kinetics of xylene recovery volume depends on the water s kinetics increasing the water saturation from 12 to 25 increases the pollutant recovery rate but the total pollutant recovery volume is only slightly increased increasing the water saturation increased the water recovery volume and consequently increased the pollutant recovery volume mechanically by water vapor pushing the pollutant 3 2 influence of soil type the experiments were carried out for fixed water and xylene saturations 12 but different soil types fine medium and coarse sand temperature changes at x 4 cm for fixed water saturation and different soil types are plotted in fig 7a for contaminated samples sw 12 and sx 12 and different sand types for the same saturation increasing the grain size increases the kinetics of mw heating decreasing the temperature stabilization time and duration related to water s and the pollutant s latent heat of vaporization first increasing the soil particle size increases the relative dielectric constant robinson and friedman 2001 in addition the mechanism of vapor transport becomes slower with decreasing grain size there will be also more liquid water trapped in the pore space because of higher capillary pressure and lower intrinsic permeability therefore the transition zone becomes longer for fine sand under the same conditions it is found that mw heating works better in coarse sand than in medium and fine sand cases where the classical conduction heating failed these results confirm the fact that the coarser grain size the faster the mw heating the temperature profiles across the column are plotted in fig 7b for different sand types and times it is shown that the temperature is increased across the column with increasing soil grain size at t 5 min at least for the first half of the column the temperature profile is increased with increasing grain size for both plotted times the changes in pollutant recovery are depicted in fig 7c the water recovery rate increased with increasing grain size as explained before the mechanical pollutant recovery depends on water recovery as water recovery is higher for coarser sands xylene recovery is also higher 3 3 influence of pollutant type and saturation the experiments were performed for medium sand and fixed water saturation and xylene and diesel fuel fig 8a shows the temperature changes at x 4 cm for fixed water and pollutant saturation but different pollutants xylene and diesel although xylene s dielectric constant is slightly higher than that of diesel the temperature rise rate zone i is similar for the two pollutants as shown before there is a temperature stabilization below 100 c around 93 c for xylene that is not present for diesel the duration of the temperature stabilization related to the boiling of water is the same for both cases the value of the second temperature stabilization related to pollutant latent heat iv zone is higher for diesel this value is around 143 c and 160 c for xylene and diesel respectively which corresponds to the difference in their boiling points the duration of this stabilization is longer for xylene this period corresponds to the evaporation of all xylene in the medium however it corresponds to the evaporation of only the lighter components of the diesel finally in the end the heating rate is higher for xylene compared to the diesel case because the soil is completely free of liquid all water and xylene have evaporated in this stage the energy of the microwaves is used for heating the sand for the xylene pollutant case whereas for the diesel pollutant the largest quantity of energy is used for the evaporation of the components with a higher boiling point fig 8b plots the temperature profiles for these two cases at t 5 min and 140 min more homogenous temperature distribution is observed for the xylene case after 5 min of heating however at the end of heating t 140 min there is only a small temperature difference between the two cases the changes in the total recovery volume of water and pollutants are plotted in fig 8c the recovered water is higher for the diesel case than for xylene however the recovered diesel volume is three times less than xylene this may be because the dynamic viscosity of diesel is about four times higher than for xylene more vapor pressure gradient is also needed to push the diesel compared to xylene therefore the pressure increase causes more water recovery contrary to diesel recovery which is more mechanical xylene recovery is affected by both mechanical pushing by water vapor flow and physical evaporation forces to study the influence of pollutant saturation we kept all the parameters constant and varied the pollutant saturation diesel from 12 to 25 for constant water saturation of 12 the temperature changes at x 4 cm for wetted medium sand and different diesel saturations 12 and 25 are plotted in fig 9a increasing the diesel saturation slightly increased the temperature rate increases at the beginning of the experiment and decreased the stabilization time at 100 c the horizontal temperature fields are plotted against the distance from the mw heating source in fig 9b the temperature of the beginning part of the column was warmer for higher pollutant saturation however at the end of heating the differences between the two temperature profiles were negligible fig 9c shows how liquid recovery efficiency changes even if increasing the diesel saturation gives a higher temperature inside the column it decreases the rate and amount of water recovery this is because adding more diesel reduces the pore space and consequently decreases the relative permeability of the medium for water vapor flow as shown in fig 9d no clear difference was observed between the kinetics of diesel recoveries 3 4 recovery efficiency the removal efficiencies at the end of the heating process after 140 min of heating along the column for contaminated sand experiments are listed in table 4 1 2 3 6 and 7 the recovery efficiency decreased with increasing distance from the heating source at least in the first 10 cm from the oven s microwave port a considerable difference in efficiency was observed between wetted and dry medium sand experiments 1 3 the removal efficiency for wetted sand varied between 95 2 at the column outlet and 99 9 close to the heating source for water wetted sand sw 12 and 25 however the maximum removal efficiency was only 17 3 for dry medium sand this low efficiency can be explained by the fact that i there was no liquid water to push the pollutant at the outlet and ii the column temperature was just below xylene s boiling point 138 40 c in the absence of the pressure gradient the xylene vapor is transported only by a slow diffusion mechanism therefore longer heating is necessary to increase the efficiency the negative efficiency values should correspond to the recondensation of pollutants from the warmer part of the column to the colder outlet part according to experiments 6 and 7 the lower removal efficiency was observed for diesel averaged 26 19 compared to xylene averaged 98 62 this difference comes mainly from the differences between the saturated vapor pressure and the maximum boiling point of diesel 160 c and xylene 140 c the remediation efficiency values calculated using the outlet phase decantation are lower between 1 2 and 2 5 times lower than the total remediation efficiency calculated using the soil analysis of each compartment this can be related to i not accounting for the fluids trapped in the tube outlet or drops inside the condensation system ii heterogeneity in pollutant concentration in the column compartments that can affect sampling iii small loss of pollutant during sampling transport and analysis however this does not influence the change trends or our analysis of how parameters impact temperature distribution and efficiency fig 10 shows the ratio of the outlet effluent concentration crecovery to initial diesel fuel concentration cinitial for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions the values are averaged from the effluent analysis of different experiments the results show that the concentration of aliphatic compounds was higher in the recovery liquid compared to the initial concentration we conclude that greater elimination occurs for aliphatic compounds than for aromatic ones during microwave heating this elimination is higher for compounds with less than nc14 for aromatic compounds the elimination begins to be effective for compounds lighter than nc8 3 5 comparison between microwave and conduction heating here we compare the results of the experiments done with ch heating experiment 8 with the mw heating case experiment 1 for the same soil type medium sand and liquid saturation 12 xylene and water as mentioned before the thermal conductive heating method used the same setup as mw heating in addition the column was inserted into the oven cavity to produce the same conditions for both heating techniques the temperature of the heating element was fixed to 250 c using a pid temperature controller for all ch heating cases the energy power was regulated by a pid temperature controller to ensure a constant temperature over time for the heating element the total heating duration was 140 min for both mw and ch heating the temperature changes for the first sensor at x 4 cm for fixed water saturation and medium sand are plotted in fig 11a and for different heating techniques mw and ch the temperature increase rate and amount are much higher for mw heating than for the ch technique even after 140 min of heating the temperature of the first probe is still below the boiling point of water the recovered volumes of water and xylene were zero for the ch technique the temperature profiles of mw and ch heating at t 5 and 140 min are compared in fig 11b the temperature is higher all across the column for mw heating in the case of ch heating the temperature is increased by only a few degrees in the soil in contact with the heating element after 3 min then after 30 min of heating the first 9 cm of the column is heated linearly from 57 0 c to 23 c after 130 min of heating at the end of the experiment for mw heating a more homogenous temperature profile was obtained as depicted in fig 12 an especially significant difference in removal efficiency was observed between ch heating averaged 10 6 and mw heating averaged 98 6 the recovery is at the first few centimeters of the column close to the heating element the evaporated pollutants are condensed at the end of the column the value of negative efficiency causing no pollutant recovery from the column outlet the total energy consumption during the experiment was 200 w h and 2333 w h for ch and mw heating respectively the energy consumption per unit of recovery liquid efficiency gives around 15 w h and 23 w h for ch and mw heating respectively the energy consumption per unit of recovery efficiency for mw heating is 1 5 times higher than that of ch heating however if we consider a linear increase in recovery efficiency for the ch technique the recovery time for the ch technique will be around 17 times more than the mw technique without considering the heat loss which can considerably increase the treatment duration future experiments using a larger scale column and longer duration might shed light on our findings and clarify them 4 conclusions to best investigate the use of microwave heating for the in situ treatment of polluted soils we should conduct experiments very close to in situ conditions therefore we conducted our experimental studies with a unique experimental setup partially satisfying these conditions the experimental setup was a soil column inserted directly into the cavity of a modified domestic microwave oven so that the outlet waves hit the soil surface this condition simulates an antenna slot during the in situ microwave treatment we performed different experiments to understand how various parameters impact heat distribution during microwave heating to reach this objective we used coarse medium and fine sands d50 2 50 mm 1 50 mm and 0 21 mm respectively and two types of pollutants diesel fuel and xylene the experiments not only allowed us to study the influence of the main parameters water and pollutant saturation type of soil and pollutant on microwave heating but also to investigate the differences between microwave and conduction heating we have highlighted the following results moisture in the soil allows very high temperatures of 100 c to be reached in just a few minutes increasing water saturation allows for higher maximum temperatures which also increase recovery efficiency however we have found that mw heating technology works best in a given range of water saturation near 12 this value is high enough that the temperature quickly reaches water s boiling point and low enough that only moderate energy is devoted to boiling the water shortening the plateau where the temperature does not exceed 100 c increasing soil grain sizes allows higher maximum temperatures to be reached however those size variations have only a small influence on final total remediation efficiency i e after 140 min in this study the remediation efficiency with xylene is much higher than that with diesel fuel about 15 for diesel fuel against near 75 for xylene in similar conditions this is related to its lower boiling point compared to diesel fuel comparing the two types of heating microwave and conduction demonstrated that a higher temperature could be achieved in a shorter time using microwave heating than with electric resistance heating under our experimental conditions the energy consumption per unit of pollutant recovery for mw heating was twice that of ch heating the most important parameters to take into account for optimal pollution control efficiency with large scale microwave apparatuses are the soil s initial water content and the pollutant s intrinsic properties the type of soil is the key parameter for the choice of heating technique we have found that mw heating technology recovered more xylene for coarse and medium sand 77 and 75 respectively than for fine sand 61 after 140 min of heating these findings and knowledge can help better manage the real case thermal desorption treatment future research will focus on modeling processes to validate the physical and mechanical phenomena governing the heating processes using both microwave and conduction

1255,properties of fluids and media such as soil moisture may play a significant role in the absorption of microwave and heat distribution during the remediation of soil contaminated with volatile and semi volatile compounds previous studies have been performed on soil samples placed inside a microwave oven cavity in a reactor far from the waveguide outlet or directly inside the metal waveguides these conditions are far from in situ applications where the unsaturated soil is directly exposed to microwaves through the antenna slots the objective of this study was therefore to understand better how soil temperature and pollutant recovery change during microwave and conduction heating and how soil properties liquid type and saturation influence that we developed a unique experimental setup that consists of a splittable soil column inserted inside the cavity of a modified domestic microwave oven power 1000 w and frequency 2 45 ghz so that the soil surface is in direct contact with the radiated microwaves experiments with electrical resistance heating using the same column but with a modified design were conducted for comparison we used three types of soils spanning fine medium and coarse sands and two semi volatile pollutants xylene and diesel fuel the pollutants and water of different volumes 12 and 25 were mixed with soils to make the artificially contaminated soils temperature values were measured at different points along the sand packed column using fiber based optical thermocouples we evaluated treatment efficiency in space soil analysis and time outlet phase decantation the experimental results show that microwave heating technology is optimal for water saturation of around 12 which gives the best compromise between the overall dielectric properties and allows rapid and efficient heating the temperature increases fast at the beginning of the microwave heating and stabilizes because of the latent heat of the water and pollutant vaporization and then increases again but slowly for dry soil conditions a maximum temperature of 170 c was achieved after 140 min of microwave heating the type of soil and pollution can drastically affect remediation efficiency through mechanical mechanisms because of a pressure increase in addition to physical mechanisms evaporation for pollutant removal the removal efficiencies using the outlet fluids decantation were 67 73 and 75 for fine medium and coarse sand respectively for the applied heating time we found that microwave heating works better in coarser sand where classical conduction heating usually failed comparing the two types of heating microwave and conductive heating under the same conditions highlights that the use of microwaves makes it possible to reach very high temperatures in a shorter time than with thermal conduction heating keywords microwaves in situ soil remediation thermal desorption unsaturated zone volatile organic compounds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the leakage of volatile and semi volatile products such as mixtures of petroleum hydrocarbons chlorinated solvents dioxins and even mercury through various kinds of accidents causes pollution and areas become hazardous for the local environment recently the interest in in situ and ex situ techniques that are quick low cost and suitable for a wide range of physical and chemical conditions has increased in situ thermal treatment typically involves heating soils to vaporize water and contaminants based on their boiling temperature the vapors are then extracted and treated using vacuum pumps and treatment units respectively several in situ thermal methods exist for soil remediation for example steam based heating in situ thermal desorption istd electrical resistance heating erh and more kingston et al 2010 the main principle of istd technology consists of thermal conduction heating ch from an array of vertical or horizontal heaters with temperatures in the 650 800 c range in the soil contaminants in the form of volatile organic compounds or chlorinated organic compounds undergo evaporation and destruction due to mechanisms of evaporation into the subsurface boiling hydrolysis oxidation and pyrolysis lachance et al 2004 in the case of erh heating occurs due to resistance to the flow of current through saturated and unsaturated soil zones between electrodes installed into the ground kingston et al 2010 among these others microwave heating mwh presents a promising technique for volatile and semi volatile contaminants this technology has been widely investigated for soil remediation in recent years thanks to its fast action and high efficiency falciglia et al 2018a jones et al 2002 the idea of in situ mwh is to send microwaves into the soil using an antenna a slotted waveguide to remediate the volatile or semi volatile non aqueous phase liquid contaminants in the vadose zone fig 1 several microwave setups have been explored for larger scale applications such as slotted waveguides antennas acierno et al 2004 chien 2012 kawala and atamanczuk 1998 krouzek et al 2018 pauli et al 2011 or the inner tube with a rigid coaxial line terminating with the antenna bientinesi et al 2013 1 1 laboratory scale experiments regan et al 1995 conducted laboratory experiments to clean up soil contaminated with dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl connected to the test chamber through a coaxial transmission line by applying a power of only 200 w at a frequency of 425 mhz they succeeded in extracting 90 of the 1 1 1 trichloroethane from the dry soil regan et al 1995 in another study related to microwave irradiation of soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and nitrogen pahs falciglia et al 2016 achieved a 70 to 100 efficiency for a processing power of 1000 w for 10 min with a frequency of 2 45 ghz falciglia et al 2016 a study to remediate soils polluted by crude oil using microwaves was conducted with the addition of carbon fiber this study effectively removed contaminants up to 99 the results showed that the temperature can reach 700 c in only 4 min with a frequency of 2 45 ghz and an applied power of 800 w the experimental setup used a modified microwave oven maximum power of 850 w and frequency of 2 45 ghz and a quartz reactor installed directly in the oven cavity a nitrogen inlet was also connected to the reactor the sample was placed in the tube the temperature measurements were not taken during heating but after the oven was turned off li et al 2009 in another investigation a sealed vial containing mixed mno2 fe powder and an aqueous solution of h2so4 naoh and h2o was contaminated with 0 5 g of hexachlorobenzene this flask was then subjected to domestic microwaves 700 w 2 45 ghz depending on the experimental conditions it was possible to remove 98 of the pollutants yuan et al 2006 robinson and friedman 2001 also studied the effect of microwaves on sand remediation their experimental setup included a 3000 w microwave generator operating at 2 45 ghz connected to a wr430 waveguide 150 g samples were placed in the waveguide cavity and treated for 15 s by changing mw power a thermocouple was inserted to measure the temperature when the microwaves were turned off the study showed that applied power is one of the fundamental parameters in the process of hydrocarbon extraction indeed this applied power is directly proportional to the increase in temperature heating the sands at higher power for a short time was more effective at extracting the pollutant than heating the sands at lower power for a longer period this should therefore be considered when designing large scale remediation robinson et al 2014 the water content of the soil is an important parameter for microwave studies as water changes the soil s dielectric properties the dielectric properties are expressed by a real part and an imaginary part called the loss factor the higher the loss factor the more the material absorbs energy sun et al 2016 horikoshi et al 2011 found by measuring the dielectric properties of dry soil 0 water and moist soil 15 water that the loss factor for moist soil is higher than for dry soil this has resulted in higher treatment efficiency as mentioned above horikoshi et al 2011 mwh treatment of soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyl aromatic hydrocarbons pcbs performed in laboratory scale experiments is efficient at 98 acierno et al 2003 liu et al 2008 also investigated how to extract pcbs from contaminated soil in the case of soil naturally containing 0 5 of water the extraction efficiency was about 60 with the addition of 2 ml of water 20 water the extraction efficiency exceeded 95 however the addition of 6 ml 30 water decreased the efficacy of the treatment by 70 80 liu et al 2008 along the same lines horikoshi et al 2011 also highlighted a difference in remediation yield for dry and wet soil contaminated with trichloroethylene tce 15 moisture content they obtained 68 and 91 yields within 10 min of treatment for dry and wet soils respectively in their experiment the soil sample was placed in a quartz tube this tube was placed in the cavity of a waveguide the waveguide was connected to a 2 45 ghz microwave generator and had a maximum power of 200 w horikoshi et al 2011 falciglia et al 2013 also noted a difference in treatment efficacy between soil containing 0 water and soil containing 8 and 12 water when studying the microwave treatment of soil contaminated with diesel with a frequency of 2 45 ghz and a power of 1000 w they obtained an extraction rate of 95 in 60 min of treatment for soils with a water content of 12 and 8 versus 90 for dry soil 0 water under the same conditions a quartz reactor was installed in the cavity of the microwave oven so that the contaminated soil sample occupied the central section of the cavity the temperature was measured when the oven was turned off by inserting a thermocouple in the middle of the sample falciglia et al 2013 it has also been found that the removal efficiency depends on pollutant type through their loss dielectric factor cioni and petarca 2011 polar compounds with asymmetric structures have a higher dielectric constant 1 2 field scale experiments chien 2012 used mw heating for the treatment of a hydrocarbon contaminated site located in a refinery in southern taiwan during irradiation the microwaves reached the soil through slots on the antenna the generator had a frequency of 2 45 ghz and a power of 2000 w the chien results confirm the enormous potential of the microwave heating technique chien 2012 the removal efficiency was between 75 and 100 depending on the contaminant s chemical formula and the distance from the heating source temperature changes were not measured during the treatments more recently krouzek et al 2018 applied mwh technology at two different sites contaminated with diesel or heavy oils the authors used a 6 kw microwave generator with an antenna applicator made on a steel grid over a length of 1 m this work carried out under real site conditions provides valuable information e g although recovery was good near the antenna some samples further away 50 cm had higher pollutant concentrations according to the authors this could be due to initially heterogeneous pollutant concentration and or a mass transfer from hot to cold zones krouzek et al 2018 however given the complexity of the case studied it was impossible to be certain such difficulties can be avoided by using a mathematical model of in situ processing for example falciglia et al proposed such models to study the impact of the microwave generator power and soil characteristics on how temperature changed over space and time and were able to give recommendations for scaling up the mwh technology falciglia et al 2018b 1 3 objectives of this study in all the laboratory studies mentioned the soil samples were small and placed either inside the oven cavity in a reactor far from the waveguide outlet or directly inside the metal waveguides this means that they received the maximum of the waves hitting the samples without considering the wave losses this is far from in situ treatment conditions temperature measurements were not also made continuously during irradiations but after the heating processes were stopped our proposed experimental setup allows us to follow the kinetics of liquid recovery both water and pollutant as a function of time we wanted to better understand how soil temperature changes during microwave heating and how water and pollutants influence saturations as well as how the nature of the soil and pollutants affects the temperature rise and remediation efficiency all of our work was performed using the same setup to make comparisons easier one of our main goals was to compare microwaves as heating means with the conventional conduction heating technique using the same experimental setup and conditions to investigate thermal desorption in soil using microwave and conduction heating we propose a new laboratory scale experimental device although the centimeter scale used in this study is not fully adapted to the field situation it provides conditions closer to in situ soil treatment compared to the experiments performed using small reactors installed inside a microwave oven because the microwave emission point is directly in contact with the soil 2 materials and experimental setup this section presents our soil and pollutant properties the experimental setup and procedures 2 1 soil and pollutant properties three types of soils spanning fine medium and coarse sands were used their thermophysical properties are listed in table 1 the semi volatile compounds used as a pollutant in the experiments were as follows a mixture of three xylene isomers p m and o xylene and ethylbenzene mixture of three xylene isomers and ethylbenzene 98 5 and a multi component fluid diesel fuel the xylene was provided from vwr chemicals analar normapur acs and the diesel fuel came from a total gas station the properties of the xylene mixture and diesel fuel compared to water are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental setup the setup shown in fig 2 consists of a packed soil column inserted inside a microwave oven so that the soil surface is in direct contact with the radiated microwaves a domestic microwave oven samsung nq50c7235as working with a maximum of 1000 w power and 2 45 ghz frequency was used the oven cavity measured 410 mm long 275 mm wide and 374 mm deep the cavity of the oven was modified to handle the required conditions for the experiments the inside of the oven was lined with a wave absorber to minimize the reflection of the waves during heating the oven also had on its left side two outlets one of which was equipped with a fan to ventilate the inside of the oven to prevent overheating the other output was used to connect a tube to the column outlet this outlet was used to recover the vapor and the liquids water and pollutants during the treatments due to the small scale and closed nature of the experimental setup the active vapor flow system e g soil vapor extraction which is usually used in the field was not applied the oven has two other outlets on its upper side to allow the exit of cables and tubes the gas outlet was adapted to monitor the volume of gas evaporated from the soil during heating to recover all evaporated gases a condensation system was connected to the outlet of the column this device was composed of an allinhn condenser no 7 in fig 2 a graduated bottle no 9 in fig 2 a thermostated bath of the mark lauda no 11 in fig 2 and an activated carbon filter no 6 in fig 2 the temperature of the bathwater was set at 5 c the refrigerant tube is connected at the bottom to the bottle for recovering the condensate vapors the gases from the column arrived at the system through a pipe connected directly to the bottle they condensed in contact with the internal wall of the refrigerant and fell back into the bottle by gravity a blue dye powder was placed in the bottom of the refrigerant tube this blue dye is fully soluble in water but insoluble in pollutants therefore we could distinguish between decanted water and pollutant phases and calculate the liquids recovery during the heating from the known volume of each phase a camera filmed the phase decantation in the tube to avoid any error in reading the phases levels 2 3 heating column the experimental column fig 3 made of teflon was 36 8 cm long and had inner diameter of 8 cm outer diameter of 8 8 cm the column was divided into seven independent segments numbers 1 7 to facilitate its filling and sampling and had a special closure system at the heating side no 12 in fig 2 there were six intermediate compartments 5 cm long and the final one 6 8 cm long which was the outlet compartment each compartment had five orifices placed on its external wall ends and an o ring joint in the cross section for sealing purposes the closure system consisted of an aluminum ring same inner and outer diameter as the column onto which five screws 40 cm long passing through five orifices of each compartment external wall were screwed the compartments were thus interconnected by this system of screws to ensure a good seal the last compartment of the column had an outlet for the gas or liquid coming from the column and a teflon nut that is unscrewed inside the oven to hold the column against the oven wall each compartment is equipped on its upper surface part with a hole for temperature sensor access except the first two compartments close to the heating source which have two holes the column is designed to be used with microwave heating or electrical resistance through a closure system which is tightened against the waveguide port for microwave heating a pyrex disk fig 4a was used to insert into the aluminum closure system the pyrex disk transparent for the waves makes it possible to contain the soils or the fluids gas or liquid without affecting the microwave propagations into the soil column the column filled with soil is directly in contact by its front pyrex disk face with the output of microwaves in the oven to avoid wave leakage between the column and waveguide port during heating a metal grid is used as an o ring mw seal two silicone o rings were used to seal the experimental column from liquid gas or liquid leakages from both sides of the closure system fig 4a the experimental column that simulates the thermal conduction heating method uses the same setup but the source of heat was presented as a spiral resistance element 200 w as the heater and pyrex disk was replaced by a copper plate very good heat conductor the spiral electrical resistance heating element within an integrated j type thermocouple was placed between a high conductive plate copper disk from the soil side and a low conductive plate isolated plate on the aluminum closure system side fig 4b from the oven wall side waveguide port a teflon ring was installed on the aluminum closure system to receive the silicone o ring of the column and to seal the leakages from the soil column fig 4b the setup was therefore interchangeable between microwaves and electrical resistance heating the electrical energy consumption during the heating was measured using the rohde schwarz hmc8015 power analyzer finally a pid proportional integral derivative temperature controller was used to fix a desired temperature for the electrical resistance heating element to measure the temperature along the column optocon ag ts3 2 optical fibers length of the probe tip of 1 cm are used these sensors are transparent to the radiation and avoid any interference between microwaves and temperature measurement that can exist if using classical metallic thermocouple probes there were seven temperature measurement points on the column which were located respectively at 4 cm 8 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm and 30 cm from the source of heating microwaves or electrical resistance so that their tips are situated at the column center see fig 4 a sensor also was placed inside the oven cavity to measure the internal oven temperature the fibers were connected to an optocon fotempmk 19 data logger which itself was connected to a computer via a usb cable the fotemp assistant software displayed and recorded the measurements automatically for the duration of the experiment 2 4 artificial soil contamination and experimental procedures the clean soil samples were placed first in an oven for 24 h at 105 c to dry them then they were mixed extremely carefully manually first with water and then with pollutants xylene or diesel fuel to prepare the desired water and pollutant saturation soil samples arthurs et al 1995 bajagain et al 2021 gidda et al 1999 rakowska 2020 salehian et al 2012 we added 116 5 cl or 243 cl of pollutant or water to 3 kg of dried soil to make the pollutant or water saturation of 12 and 25 respectively this step was done by dividing the total soil into small portions to obtain a more homogeneous distribution of water and pollutants the choice for the pollutant saturation values 12 and 25 of pore volume are related to their residual saturations in the unsaturated zone for the real cases 10 20 in the unsaturated zone fitzhenry et al 2022 joo et al 1998 mercer and cohen 1990 the column was packed compartment by compartment by the artificially contaminated soil from the bottom from the closure system to the top column outlet finally the packed column was inserted into the microwave oven for heating after tightening the teflon nut against the oven wall as soon as the heating started fotemp software was run to log the temperature data and the power analyzer and camera were turned on to measure the energy consumption and film fluid decantation the maximum heating duration was 140 min to measure the temperature changes as a function of time along the column the experiments were conducted with known water and pollutant saturations the microwave oven s parameters were constant for all experiments power and frequency 1000 w and 2 45 ghz respectively at the end of heating we let the column cool down for a few minutes before handling it to avoid more pollutant evaporation during the soil sampling to estimate the remediation yield the soil and outlet liquid samples were taken and sent to a laboratory for analysis for each experiment this comprised one soil sample before heating as the reference one sample from each compartment after heating seven samples and finally one sample of the recovered pollutant from the graduated bottle these analyses were carried out by the analytical methods developed by abuhelou et al 2017 which gives the sample s concentration per kg of dry soil the aim was to study the influence of water and pollutant saturation pollutant type and soil type on temperature increase and remediation efficiency to do this we varied one parameter at a time while keeping the others constant in addition we compared heating by microwave and electrical resistance for the same condition soil type saturation the experiments are listed in table 3 the removal efficiency r can then be calculated using eq 1 1 r c 0 c i c 0 100 where c 0 mg kg dry soil is the initial pollutant concentration before heating and c i mg kg dry soil is the pollutant concentration of compartment i at the end of the heating treatment the temperature values pollutant concentration of soil and recovered liquid were obtained for each experiment this allows us to interpret the effect of liquid saturation and soil type on heating efficiency and compare the microwave mw and conductive heating ch processes this study highlights the role of the different parameters affecting temperature distribution and removal efficiency 3 results and discussions fig 5a shows the temperature changes for fixed xylene and water saturation sx and sw respectively at 12 the same volume of water and xylene was used for mw heating in the medium sand case the temperature across the entire column increased over time the temperature variation behavior varied throughout the column for various times and locations this different behavior may have been cause by the hot spot kok et al 1993 or the complex behavior of the three phase flow gas water and pollutant inside the column because of these variations the closest temperature probe to the mw source 4 cm from the heating source was chosen for the parametrical study of temperature changes in each case the horizontal temperature profiles at the column center are also plotted for two specific times 5 min and 140 min fig 5b shows the temperature changes for this experiment for the first optical fiber sensor at 4 cm from the heat source x 4 cm because the temperature measurements were registered every second the results are shown as a line six different zones can be identified i a zone with a very fast temperature increase ii a short stabilized transition zone below water s boiling point that can be related to the impurities present in the xylene mixture followed by a small increase of the temperature until 100 c in this stage the temperature does not exceed 100 c until most of the water is evaporated from the soil iii a stabilized transition zone related to water s latent heat of vaporization the phenomenon is accompanied by a pressure increase inside the column and instantly by the release of a mixture of water vapor mechanically pushing the pollutant liquid iv a zone with a moderate temperature increase above 100 c starting when the soil becomes dry from water in this case only the pollutant vapor is released from the column outlet v a second stabilized transition zone related to xylene s latent heat of vaporization in this stage the temperature does not exceed 140 c until most of the xylene mixture is evaporated from the soil vi when the soil becomes dry of water and pollutant the temperature increases again but more slowly the temperature rise seems to be linear in this step the temperature inside the oven increases quickly at first and then becomes stable at around 60 c now let us explore the impact of different parameters on the efficiency of microwave heating 3 1 influence of soil water saturation to study the influence of water saturation experiments were performed with xylene using the same sand medium sand varying only the water saturation from 0 to 12 and 25 in this case xylene saturation was chosen to be 12 the duration of the heating was 140 min the temperature changes in the first thermocouple at x 4 cm for fixed xylene saturation for different water saturations are plotted in fig 6a the increasing water saturation causes a faster temperature increase below 100 c then for moderate saturation sw 12 the temperature increased again but using higher water saturation slowed down the temperature rise all the curves approach at the end of the experiment as an example the temperature reaches 100 c after only 2 5 and 5 min respectively for soils with water saturation of 25 and 12 versus 33 min for soil with a water saturation of 0 dry soil the maximum temperatures reached at the end of the heating are similar for all cases around 170 c for comparison the temperature reached 100 c after 2 2 min of heating for a dry sand sample packed directly inside the microwave waveguide wrj 2 of 30 cm length using a frequency of 2 45 ghz and a power of 650 w horikoshi et al 2011 this duration was around 4 min for a soil sample contaminated by diesel fuel and placed in a quartz reactor inside a domestic microwave cavity frequency 2 45 ghz and power 1000 w falciglia et al 2013 the sample with sw 12 resulted in the best compromise between the overall dielectric properties which allows rapid and efficient heating water accelerates the temperature rise by increasing the soil s mw absorption the presence of water in the soil increases the dielectric loss factor in the case of microwave remediation this would reduce the treatment time the increase in water saturation from 12 to 25 results in higher temperature stabilization time at 100 c this stabilization is explained by the fact that at 100 c water s boiling point all the energy of the microwaves is used for the phase change process rather than an increase in temperature hence the temperature plateau the other reason is that in higher water saturation values more of the soil s pore spaces are filled with water this can reduce the vapor transport mechanism and reduce evaporation as expected there is no temperature stabilization at 100 c for dry medium sand as shown in fig 6a the temperature stabilization zone before the water boiling point zone ii in fig 5b depends also on the presence of water to study the temperature distribution inside the soil column the horizontal temperature fields are plotted against the distance from mw heating source in fig 6b for different times 5 min and 140 min as shown the temperature distributions at the end of the heating are more homogenous for water wetted saturation 12 and 25 compared to dry sands at higher water saturation 25 the first part of the column reached 100 c after only 5 min and shows a higher temperature than less water saturated cases however the temperature of the second part of the column for sw 25 decreases gradually toward the end of the column to become colder than the sw 12 case most of the microwaves are absorbed due to higher water saturation near the mw source the heat transfer by vapor convection inside the pores is also reduced because of the reduction in vapor relative permeability therefore more mw waves are absorbed the temperature increases with increasing water saturation at a shorter time for longer heating the temperature profile for sw 12 shows a higher temperature this is also shown in fig 6a for the first probe quite a homogeneous temperature profile was achieved after 140 min of heating for water saturations of 12 and 25 however the temperature values for dry soil are only the same as for wetted sand in 2 first centimeters of the column then the temperature profile decreases with distance from the heating source and becomes constant around 9 cm from the heating source the same behaviors not shown in this paper were observed for the diesel case confirming the optimal heating value at 12 water saturation the kinetics of total remediation efficiencies are calculated from the recovery liquids volumes during each experiment and plotted in fig 6c increasing water saturation increases the recovery rate the recovery efficiency is around 73 and 78 for the medium sand samples with water saturation values of 12 and 25 respectively these results are consistent with those found by falciglia et al 2013 in which a higher efficiency was reached for most soil samples as shown in fig 6c the kinetics of xylene recovery volume depends on the water s kinetics increasing the water saturation from 12 to 25 increases the pollutant recovery rate but the total pollutant recovery volume is only slightly increased increasing the water saturation increased the water recovery volume and consequently increased the pollutant recovery volume mechanically by water vapor pushing the pollutant 3 2 influence of soil type the experiments were carried out for fixed water and xylene saturations 12 but different soil types fine medium and coarse sand temperature changes at x 4 cm for fixed water saturation and different soil types are plotted in fig 7a for contaminated samples sw 12 and sx 12 and different sand types for the same saturation increasing the grain size increases the kinetics of mw heating decreasing the temperature stabilization time and duration related to water s and the pollutant s latent heat of vaporization first increasing the soil particle size increases the relative dielectric constant robinson and friedman 2001 in addition the mechanism of vapor transport becomes slower with decreasing grain size there will be also more liquid water trapped in the pore space because of higher capillary pressure and lower intrinsic permeability therefore the transition zone becomes longer for fine sand under the same conditions it is found that mw heating works better in coarse sand than in medium and fine sand cases where the classical conduction heating failed these results confirm the fact that the coarser grain size the faster the mw heating the temperature profiles across the column are plotted in fig 7b for different sand types and times it is shown that the temperature is increased across the column with increasing soil grain size at t 5 min at least for the first half of the column the temperature profile is increased with increasing grain size for both plotted times the changes in pollutant recovery are depicted in fig 7c the water recovery rate increased with increasing grain size as explained before the mechanical pollutant recovery depends on water recovery as water recovery is higher for coarser sands xylene recovery is also higher 3 3 influence of pollutant type and saturation the experiments were performed for medium sand and fixed water saturation and xylene and diesel fuel fig 8a shows the temperature changes at x 4 cm for fixed water and pollutant saturation but different pollutants xylene and diesel although xylene s dielectric constant is slightly higher than that of diesel the temperature rise rate zone i is similar for the two pollutants as shown before there is a temperature stabilization below 100 c around 93 c for xylene that is not present for diesel the duration of the temperature stabilization related to the boiling of water is the same for both cases the value of the second temperature stabilization related to pollutant latent heat iv zone is higher for diesel this value is around 143 c and 160 c for xylene and diesel respectively which corresponds to the difference in their boiling points the duration of this stabilization is longer for xylene this period corresponds to the evaporation of all xylene in the medium however it corresponds to the evaporation of only the lighter components of the diesel finally in the end the heating rate is higher for xylene compared to the diesel case because the soil is completely free of liquid all water and xylene have evaporated in this stage the energy of the microwaves is used for heating the sand for the xylene pollutant case whereas for the diesel pollutant the largest quantity of energy is used for the evaporation of the components with a higher boiling point fig 8b plots the temperature profiles for these two cases at t 5 min and 140 min more homogenous temperature distribution is observed for the xylene case after 5 min of heating however at the end of heating t 140 min there is only a small temperature difference between the two cases the changes in the total recovery volume of water and pollutants are plotted in fig 8c the recovered water is higher for the diesel case than for xylene however the recovered diesel volume is three times less than xylene this may be because the dynamic viscosity of diesel is about four times higher than for xylene more vapor pressure gradient is also needed to push the diesel compared to xylene therefore the pressure increase causes more water recovery contrary to diesel recovery which is more mechanical xylene recovery is affected by both mechanical pushing by water vapor flow and physical evaporation forces to study the influence of pollutant saturation we kept all the parameters constant and varied the pollutant saturation diesel from 12 to 25 for constant water saturation of 12 the temperature changes at x 4 cm for wetted medium sand and different diesel saturations 12 and 25 are plotted in fig 9a increasing the diesel saturation slightly increased the temperature rate increases at the beginning of the experiment and decreased the stabilization time at 100 c the horizontal temperature fields are plotted against the distance from the mw heating source in fig 9b the temperature of the beginning part of the column was warmer for higher pollutant saturation however at the end of heating the differences between the two temperature profiles were negligible fig 9c shows how liquid recovery efficiency changes even if increasing the diesel saturation gives a higher temperature inside the column it decreases the rate and amount of water recovery this is because adding more diesel reduces the pore space and consequently decreases the relative permeability of the medium for water vapor flow as shown in fig 9d no clear difference was observed between the kinetics of diesel recoveries 3 4 recovery efficiency the removal efficiencies at the end of the heating process after 140 min of heating along the column for contaminated sand experiments are listed in table 4 1 2 3 6 and 7 the recovery efficiency decreased with increasing distance from the heating source at least in the first 10 cm from the oven s microwave port a considerable difference in efficiency was observed between wetted and dry medium sand experiments 1 3 the removal efficiency for wetted sand varied between 95 2 at the column outlet and 99 9 close to the heating source for water wetted sand sw 12 and 25 however the maximum removal efficiency was only 17 3 for dry medium sand this low efficiency can be explained by the fact that i there was no liquid water to push the pollutant at the outlet and ii the column temperature was just below xylene s boiling point 138 40 c in the absence of the pressure gradient the xylene vapor is transported only by a slow diffusion mechanism therefore longer heating is necessary to increase the efficiency the negative efficiency values should correspond to the recondensation of pollutants from the warmer part of the column to the colder outlet part according to experiments 6 and 7 the lower removal efficiency was observed for diesel averaged 26 19 compared to xylene averaged 98 62 this difference comes mainly from the differences between the saturated vapor pressure and the maximum boiling point of diesel 160 c and xylene 140 c the remediation efficiency values calculated using the outlet phase decantation are lower between 1 2 and 2 5 times lower than the total remediation efficiency calculated using the soil analysis of each compartment this can be related to i not accounting for the fluids trapped in the tube outlet or drops inside the condensation system ii heterogeneity in pollutant concentration in the column compartments that can affect sampling iii small loss of pollutant during sampling transport and analysis however this does not influence the change trends or our analysis of how parameters impact temperature distribution and efficiency fig 10 shows the ratio of the outlet effluent concentration crecovery to initial diesel fuel concentration cinitial for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions the values are averaged from the effluent analysis of different experiments the results show that the concentration of aliphatic compounds was higher in the recovery liquid compared to the initial concentration we conclude that greater elimination occurs for aliphatic compounds than for aromatic ones during microwave heating this elimination is higher for compounds with less than nc14 for aromatic compounds the elimination begins to be effective for compounds lighter than nc8 3 5 comparison between microwave and conduction heating here we compare the results of the experiments done with ch heating experiment 8 with the mw heating case experiment 1 for the same soil type medium sand and liquid saturation 12 xylene and water as mentioned before the thermal conductive heating method used the same setup as mw heating in addition the column was inserted into the oven cavity to produce the same conditions for both heating techniques the temperature of the heating element was fixed to 250 c using a pid temperature controller for all ch heating cases the energy power was regulated by a pid temperature controller to ensure a constant temperature over time for the heating element the total heating duration was 140 min for both mw and ch heating the temperature changes for the first sensor at x 4 cm for fixed water saturation and medium sand are plotted in fig 11a and for different heating techniques mw and ch the temperature increase rate and amount are much higher for mw heating than for the ch technique even after 140 min of heating the temperature of the first probe is still below the boiling point of water the recovered volumes of water and xylene were zero for the ch technique the temperature profiles of mw and ch heating at t 5 and 140 min are compared in fig 11b the temperature is higher all across the column for mw heating in the case of ch heating the temperature is increased by only a few degrees in the soil in contact with the heating element after 3 min then after 30 min of heating the first 9 cm of the column is heated linearly from 57 0 c to 23 c after 130 min of heating at the end of the experiment for mw heating a more homogenous temperature profile was obtained as depicted in fig 12 an especially significant difference in removal efficiency was observed between ch heating averaged 10 6 and mw heating averaged 98 6 the recovery is at the first few centimeters of the column close to the heating element the evaporated pollutants are condensed at the end of the column the value of negative efficiency causing no pollutant recovery from the column outlet the total energy consumption during the experiment was 200 w h and 2333 w h for ch and mw heating respectively the energy consumption per unit of recovery liquid efficiency gives around 15 w h and 23 w h for ch and mw heating respectively the energy consumption per unit of recovery efficiency for mw heating is 1 5 times higher than that of ch heating however if we consider a linear increase in recovery efficiency for the ch technique the recovery time for the ch technique will be around 17 times more than the mw technique without considering the heat loss which can considerably increase the treatment duration future experiments using a larger scale column and longer duration might shed light on our findings and clarify them 4 conclusions to best investigate the use of microwave heating for the in situ treatment of polluted soils we should conduct experiments very close to in situ conditions therefore we conducted our experimental studies with a unique experimental setup partially satisfying these conditions the experimental setup was a soil column inserted directly into the cavity of a modified domestic microwave oven so that the outlet waves hit the soil surface this condition simulates an antenna slot during the in situ microwave treatment we performed different experiments to understand how various parameters impact heat distribution during microwave heating to reach this objective we used coarse medium and fine sands d50 2 50 mm 1 50 mm and 0 21 mm respectively and two types of pollutants diesel fuel and xylene the experiments not only allowed us to study the influence of the main parameters water and pollutant saturation type of soil and pollutant on microwave heating but also to investigate the differences between microwave and conduction heating we have highlighted the following results moisture in the soil allows very high temperatures of 100 c to be reached in just a few minutes increasing water saturation allows for higher maximum temperatures which also increase recovery efficiency however we have found that mw heating technology works best in a given range of water saturation near 12 this value is high enough that the temperature quickly reaches water s boiling point and low enough that only moderate energy is devoted to boiling the water shortening the plateau where the temperature does not exceed 100 c increasing soil grain sizes allows higher maximum temperatures to be reached however those size variations have only a small influence on final total remediation efficiency i e after 140 min in this study the remediation efficiency with xylene is much higher than that with diesel fuel about 15 for diesel fuel against near 75 for xylene in similar conditions this is related to its lower boiling point compared to diesel fuel comparing the two types of heating microwave and conduction demonstrated that a higher temperature could be achieved in a shorter time using microwave heating than with electric resistance heating under our experimental conditions the energy consumption per unit of pollutant recovery for mw heating was twice that of ch heating the most important parameters to take into account for optimal pollution control efficiency with large scale microwave apparatuses are the soil s initial water content and the pollutant s intrinsic properties the type of soil is the key parameter for the choice of heating technique we have found that mw heating technology recovered more xylene for coarse and medium sand 77 and 75 respectively than for fine sand 61 after 140 min of heating these findings and knowledge can help better manage the real case thermal desorption treatment future research will focus on modeling processes to validate the physical and mechanical phenomena governing the heating processes using both microwave and conduction heating technologies comparing in situ microwave heating using an antenna and the traditional heating technique using heating elements in a metric setup is of great interest credit authorship

1256,freeze thaw cycles in soils lead to break up of soil aggregates and the formation of dispersible soil colloids leaching events following freeze thaw cycles can therefore mobilize and transport colloids through the soil profile here we investigated the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the subsequent mobilization of colloids in a pb contaminated soil and we quantified the amount of colloid facilitated pb transport soil contaminated with pb 250 mg kg or 1000 mg kg was packed into 15 cm tall columns and the soil water content adjusted to field capacity 0 306 kg kg columns were subjected to freeze thaw cycles of 12 h freezing at 20 c followed by 12 h of thawing at 25 c then the soil columns were leached with distilled water and the effluent was analyzed for colloids soluble pb and colloidal bound pb freeze thaw cycles were found to generate dispersible soil colloids and lead to colloid facilitated pb transport colloid and pb mobilization increased with increasing number of freeze thaw cycles the majority 83 97 of the pb that leached out of the columns was colloid bound our findings suggest that freeze thaw cycles in high latitude areas can mobilize heavy metals which are otherwise immobile through colloid facilitated transport more frequent freeze thaw cycles in high latitude regions as predicted by climate change models thus increases the risk of metal leaching from contaminated soils and can lead to subsequent ground water pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords colloids colloid bound pb freeze thawing processes polluted soil mobilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lead is a persistent pollutant that poses a risk to public health and the environment u s epa 2005 du et al 2014 lead is naturally present in soils in low concentrations but accidental chemical spills improper waste disposal and automobile exhausts have increased lead concentrations in soils to toxic levels for instance mine tailings in portugal have contaminated soil with pb concentrations of up to 239 mg kg gerardo et al 2009 in spain pb concentrations in soil of 5034 mg kg have been reported adjacent to a pbsb recycling factory mykolenko et al 2018 similarly high pb concentrations up to 5580 mg kg have been documented in arable soils near smelting activities in china zhang et al 2015 these concentrations exceed local environmental health limits by orders of magnitude in soils pb has a low solubility and strongly sorbs to soil minerals and organic matter through complexation with hydroxylic carboxylic and phenolic groups mcbride and blasiak 1979 karathanasis et al 2005 therefore pb is usually strongly bound and immobile in soils unless soil colloids get mobilized and can act as rapid carrier for immobile contaminants amrhein et al 1993 such colloid facilitated pb transport has been documented in laboratory experiments grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 yin et al 2010 lu et al 2016 as well as field studies denaix et al 2001 durin et al 2007 colloids can be mobilized in soil through a variety of mechanisms including changes of the ionic strength ph or flow rate grolimund and borkovec 2005 shang et al 2008 cheng and saiers 2010 yin et al 2010 liu et al 2013 in addition colloids can also be mobilized through physical disturbances induced by wetting and drying majdalani et al 2008 cheng and saiers 2010 mohanty et al 2015 lu et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 borthakur et al 2021 or freezing and thawing mohanty et al 2014 borthakur et al 2021 wetting and drying causes differential capillary stress which in turn can dislodge soil particles michel et al 2010 freeze thaw processes can induce similar capillary stresses as wetting and drying and in addition cause disintegration of soil aggregates through mechanical stress zhang et al 2016 viran and binal 2018 ye and li 2018 sun et al 2021 this leads to the generation of dispersible colloids which can then be mobilized by subsequent leaching events mohanty et al 2014 borthakur et al 2021 freeze thaw events can enhance the transport of contaminants associated with colloids this has been observed for both inorganic i e cs and sr mohanty et al 2014 as well as organic contaminants i e pfoa borthakur et al 2021 freeze thaw events can also affect the speciation of metals as observed by enhanced metal phosphate formation reported for cu pb and zn hafsteinsdóttir et al 2013 this can lead to immobilization of two valent metals potentially counteracting colloid enhanced transport only few studies are available were colloid facilitated transport of metals has been investigated under freeze thaw conditions the release of colloids during freeze thaw events will depend on the soil type and as such studies are needed with different soils to be able to better generalize effects of freeze thawing on colloid facilitated contaminant transport chernozem soils are some of most productive agricultural soils and contribute to food security worldwide chernozem soils are located in geographic regions where soils seasonally freeze such as in the northeast of china and are subject to repeated freeze thaw cycles during the year such freeze thaw cycles affect soil structure and hydraulic properties of the soils and also affect solute transport freeze thaw cycles cause increased shear and capillary stresses in the soil matrix leading to elevated colloid formation and dispersal when the soil thaws if such soils are polluted with strongly sorbing contaminants such as heavy metals then enhanced mobilization and leaching of colloid bound contaminants is expected during thawing periods this can lead to surface and groundwater pollution from contaminated soil the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the transport of colloids and colloid associated pb in a contaminated chernozem soil we hypothesized that freeze thaw cycles will generate mobile colloids and that these colloids would act as carriers of otherwise immobile pb the soil was artificially contaminated with pb and packed into pvc columns and then subjected to repeated freeze thaw cycles and leaching events column effluent was analyzed for soluble pb colloidal pb and soil colloids the results of this study provide useful information for understanding the environmental behavior of pb in high latitude areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sample materials and methods soil samples were obtained from an agricultural field of heilongjiang academy of agricultural sciences in heilongjiang province china 124 50 e 45 77 n the climate at the site is a typical temperate continental monsoon climate the annual average air temperature is 1 5 c and annual rainfall is 550 mm average lowest winter air temperatures range between 10 c in november and 30 c in january the soil at the site is exposed to frequent freeze thaw cycles at the beginning and at the end of the winter soil samples were collected in may 2017 from the top 20 cm of a field cropped with corn the soil was air dried and then stored in plastic bags at room temperature after plant residues and gravel had been removed the soil had a phh2o of 5 9 organic matter content 29 3 g kg pb content 13 9 mg kg bulk density 1 29 g cm3 and field capacity of 0 306 kg kg the soil texture was 52 3 sand 30 0 silt and 17 7 clay by weight the soil is classified as chernozem according to the fao classification system mollisol according to the us taxonomy soil samples were sieved through a 2 mm mesh and contaminated by mixing with pb no3 2 air dry soil was thoroughly mixed with pb no3 2 powder to obtain the following treatments not considering the soil s initial pb content 0 250 1000 mg pb kg soil representing uncontaminated soil slightly contaminated and heavily contaminated soil our purpose was to uniformly contaminate the soil with pb so we used pb no3 2 powder which could be mixed readily with the soil using pb in an aqueous phase would have resulted in strong immediate sorption of pb to soil particles and prevented us from obtaining a uniform contamination mixing the solid pb no3 2 powder helped to better distribute the pb in the soil 2 2 experimental setup the different soil treatments were then packed into pvc columns 5 cm inner diameter and 15 cm long with a 2 cm thick layer of quartz sand at the bottom of the columns a fine mesh made of polyamide 80 μm aperture was used at the bottom to hold the sand and soil in place soil was packed into the columns to a bulk density of 1 29 g cm and a height of 10 cm distilled water was added to the packed soil columns to wet the soil to its field capacity 0 306 kg kg the soil columns were then covered with plastic foil to prevent evaporation and let to equilibrate at 25 c for 2 weeks the pb no3 2 powder has a high aqueous solubility and will readily dissolve in a soil with a water content of 0 306 kg kg we tested the dissolution of the pb no3 2 salt by placing an equivalent amount of salt into water under stationary conditions and found that the salt had dissolved within 60 min the pb no3 2 will thus have dissolved rapidly in the soil and pb will have sorbed to soil particles during the 2 week equilibration period soil columns were then subjected to freeze thaw cycles each freeze thaw cycle consisted of freezing at 20 c for 12 h followed by thawing at 25 c for 12 h we used three different freeze thaw cycles 0 3 and 6 cycles table 1 soil columns were then leached with distilled water by using a constant head setup fig 1 the constant head 3 cm h2o was maintained with a peristaltic pump and an overflow device we used distilled water for the leaching experiments as worst case scenario for colloid mobilization the effluent was collected in 150 ml conical flasks every 20 min for a total of 400 min the effluent volumes were measured by weight all experiments were run in duplicates 2 3 quantification of outflow volume colloids and pb in effluent after each sample collection 20 min intervals we measured the outflow volume in the flasks gravimetrically an aliquot 10 ml of each effluent sample collected was transferred into aluminum boxes and dried in an oven at 105 c for 12 h to determine the mass of colloids that was leached from the column another aliquot 10 ml was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and the pb concentration in the filtrate were measured by icp ms agilent 7500a series icp ms usa this concentration was considered the soluble pb the colloidal pb was determined by measuring the pb remaining on the filter membrane the filter membrane was placed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 15 ml of 1 mol l hcl hno3 and vortexed for 1 h at 25 c at the rate of 180 rpm the pb concentration in the fluid was then measured by icp ms from the outflow volumes we calculated the saturated hydraulic conductivity by using darcy s law based on the known hydraulic heads at the top and bottom of the column hydraulic conductivity data were then pooled by the number of freeze thaw cycles to obtain six measurements per freeze thaw cycle treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of freeze thaw cycles on effluent volumes and hydraulic conductivity the effluent volumes were larger in columns that were subject to freeze thaw cycles compared to the non freeze thaw control columns fig 2a c however there was not much difference in outflow between 3 and 6 freeze thaw cycles the calculated hydraulic conductivities increased significantly when the columns were frozen and thawed however there was no difference between 3 and 6 freeze thaw cycles fig 2d during freezing water in larger pores freezes first and then can draw unfrozen water into these pores causing fractures in the pore structure taber 1930 when the frozen soil then thaws these fractures caused by the freezing process will remain open resulting in preferential flow channels mohanty et al 2014 and the overall hydraulic conductivity of the soil will increase in our experiments the freeze thaw cycles increased the hydraulic conductivity threefold from about 1 mm min to 3 mm min fig 2d there was little difference in column outflow volumes among the different pb contamination levels fig 2a c this suggests that pb contamination did not affect the hydraulic properties of the columns and did not impact the freeze thawing cycles 3 2 effect of freeze thaw cycles on the mobilization of colloids colloid leaching was the most pronounced at the beginning of the leaching event and subsequently decreased as indicated by the decreasing slope of the cumulative colloid outflow curves fig 3a c the readily mobilizable colloids were flushed from the columns first and the supply of mobile colloids then decreased over time freeze thaw cycles f3 f6 significantly increased colloid mobilization compared to the non frozen control f0 p 0 01 fig 3d freezing causes expansion of water in soil pores and aggregates thereby breaking apart aggregates and weakening the forces between soil particles and aggregates this process will generate dispersible colloids and increase the pool of colloids that can be mobilized by subsequent infiltration events mohanty et al 2014 flury and aramrak 2017 pokrovsky et al 2018 the expansion of the freezing front may also induce colloid formation by scouring off particles from pore surfaces mohanty et al 2014 because each freeze thaw cycle generates new colloids more colloids can be mobilized in columns exposed to 6 freeze thaw cycles f6 compared to columns exposed only to 3 freeze thaw cycles f3 and there was highly significant difference between f6 and f3 p 0 01 fig 3d in addition the possible generation of preferential flow in soil induced by freeze thaw cycles can facilitate the colloid transport with increased water flow mohanty et al 2014 the pb contamination did not affect the colloid leaching i e the cumulative colloid leaching curves as well as the total colloid mass leached were similar for the different pb treatments fig 3 the pb contamination thus did not cause substantial colloid aggregation 3 3 effect of freeze thawing on colloid facilitated pb transport 3 3 1 soluble pb fig 4a c shows the amounts of soluble pb leached for different pb contamination and freeze thaw treatments compared to the non freeze thaw treatments a much greater amount of soluble pb was leached from columns exposed to freeze thaw treatments indicating that freeze thaw cycles promote the release of soluble pb from the contaminated soil freeze thaw cycles have two opposite effects on the mobility of soluble pb the soluble metals could adsorb on secondary minerals induced by salt exclusion from ice crystals or to new mineral surfaces exposed during freeze thaw cycles dietzel 2005 mohanty et al 2014 borthakur et al 2021 both of which would increase sorption and thus decrease the dissolved metal concentration mohanty et al 2014 however in our experiments we did not observe increased sorption of pb with freeze thaw cycles indeed the concentrations of soluble pb in the pore water were not affected by freeze thaw cycles and no distinct pattern of soluble pb concentrations in the outflow versus time was observed fig 5a c the higher total amount of soluble pb leached from the columns exposed to freeze thaw cycles is however related to the enhanced outflow of water from the columns freeze thaw cycles induced a higher hydraulic conductivity fig 2d and thus also more cumulative outflow of water consequently more dissolved pb was leached along with the increased water flux more freeze thaw cycles thus enhanced soluble pb transport because more water leached through the columns higher pb contamination of the soil also led to higher amounts of soluble pb leached for uncontaminated soil only small amounts of soluble pb leached fig 4a for contaminated soil soluble pb leached distinctly even without freeze thaw treatments fig 4b c there appears to be a distinct lag in the pb breakthrough with little pb leaching in the first portion of the leaching event after which the pb outflow started to increase fig 4a c we speculate that during the initial equilibration time 2 weeks at 25 c pb was adsorbed to the soil under higher ion strength than during leaching thus the initial leaching had smaller pb concentrations until the pore water was completely replaced with the low ionic strength solution of the infiltrating water more pb was then desorbed under the lower ion strength in the subsequent leaching process thus inducing an increase of soluble pb in the effluent 3 3 2 colloid bound pb fig 4 d f shows the amount of colloid bound pb leached for different pb contamination and freeze thaw treatments compared with the soluble pb much more colloid bound pb was leached from the columns overall consistent for all treatments about 10 times more colloid bound pb was leached compared to soluble pb the outflow pattern of colloid bound pb fig 4d f followed that of the outflow pattern of the colloids fig 3a c however there was no distinct plateau observed towards the end of the outflow experiment more colloid bound pb was leached when there were more freeze thaw cycles consistent with more colloid leaching observed for these treatments the concentrations of colloid bound pb were not affected by freeze thaw cycles i e no distinct pattern of colloid bound pb concentration versus time was observed fig 5d e this suggests that the sorption of pb to soil colloids was not impacted by freeze thaw cycles however as expected the pb contamination level affected the pb concentrations on the mobilized colloids significantly p 0 01 higher pb contamination led to higher pb concentrations on the mobilized colloids fig 6 while we did not observe a distinct effect of freeze thaw cycles on sorption of pb to soil colloids in our experiment others have reported that freeze thaw cycles decreased the pb adsorption capacity of soil li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 freeze thaw cycles have been reported to reduce the ph due to nitrification brooks et al 1998 and due to the release of dissolved organic acids lipson and monson 1998 semenov et al 2014 the decrease of ph then leads to enhanced solubility of pb freeze thaw cycles may also reduce the soils organic matter content by breaking up soil aggregates and fracturing the organic matter coatings of clay minerals allowing microbes to mineralize and consume organic matter wang et al 2017 decreased organic matter content and ph both will cause the cec to decrease helling et al 1964 martel et al 1978 wang et al 2017 moreover low ph will also increase the solubility and the reduction of free iron oxides in soils kong and luo 2016 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 these changes of the soil properties can all lead to a decreased sorption capacity for heavy metals to the contrary du et al 2020 found that freeze thaw cycles enhanced pb immobilization on soil and sorption capacity increased with additional freeze thaw cycles this was attributed to higher concentration of ions excluded by ice formation which increases the interactions between pb and clay particles after repeated freeze thaw cycles du et al 2020 also the dispersion of clay particles and release soil organic matter caused by freeze thaw cycles increased the specific surface area for pb adsorption and facilitated strong adsorption between organic matter and organic matter associated pb on the surface of soil particles du et al 2020 indeed the effects of freeze thaw on soil properties are dependent on the temperature rate number amplitude and length of freeze thaw cycles hentschel et al 2008 elliott and henry 2009 ren and ren 2013 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 2020 for instance freeze thaw cycles carried out over a moderate temperature range from 5 c to 5 c resulted in a smaller amount of extractable n than when the freeze thaw occurred over a large temperature range from 13 c to 5 c hentschel et al 2008 elliott and henry 2009 when soil chernozem soil was frozen at 5 to 10 c for 12 h and thawed at 5 to 7 c for 12 h the ph was found to increase fan et al 2014 du et al 2020 however when such as soil was frozen at 15 to 35 c for 24 h and then thawed at 5 c for 24 h the ph was observed to have decreased li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 therefore the specific freeze thaw conditions will affect the chemical changes occurring in a given soil we thus also expect that the different freeze thaw conditions will have different effects on the sorption of heavy metals li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 2020 du et al 2020 3 3 3 total mass of pb and form of pb in column effluent the leaching of total pb was enhanced by freeze thaw cycles as well as by elevated pb contamination fig 7 the transport of pb in soil was dominated by colloid facilitated transport i e 83 to 97 of the total pb leached was in colloid bound form this strong association of pb with mobile soil colloids has also been observed by others under non freeze thaw conditions grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 yin et al 2010 grolimund and coauthors grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 found that almost 100 of released pb from a contaminated soil was associated with colloidal particles similarly yin et al 2010 found that 87 of pb in their column effluent was associated with the coarse colloidal fraction 0 45 8 μm when they leached a pb contaminated sandy soil with simulated rainwater the transport of pb is thus manily controlled by factors that govern colloid mobilization and transport grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 yin et al 2010 interestingly the ratio of colloid bound pb to total pb was independent of freeze thaw cycles and independent of pb contamination level fig 7 freeze thaw cycles facilitated the outflow of soluble pb by increasing the outflow volume of water containing the pb desorbed from the soil matrix and the outflow of colloid bound pb by mobilization of colloidal particles these two processes act concurrently under freeze thawing conditions and thus the ratio of colloid bound pb to soluble pb remained stable and so did the ratio of colloid bound pb to total pb as soils are contaminated with pb the sorption of pb onto the soil matrix increases with increasing pb contamination yang et al 2004 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 du et al 2020 during desorption more pb can desorb from heavily contaminated soil yang et al 2004 jiang et al 2012 and more pb will be released into the pore water during leaching with uncontaminated water at the same time the mobilized colloids also carry more pb thereby the ratio of soluble to colloid bound pb remains fairly constant 4 conclusions our results show that freeze thaw cycles can exacerbate the transport of colloids and colloid bound metals in soil in case of strongly sorbing contaminants such as pb most of the contaminant will leach in colloid associated form freeze thawing cycles thus can be considered an important and reoccurring trigger for contaminant release and transport from soils polluted with strongly sorbing contaminants climate warming has significantly impacted snow cover and snow depth in the northern hemisphere solomon et al 2007 and the reduced snow cover is expected to produce more and more freeze thaw events fan et al 2014 this not only leads to enhanced carbon mineralization bonan and cleve 1992 rasmussen et al 2006 but also to enhanced mobilization of mineral and organic colloids which can act as facilitators for the transport of metals and other strongly sorbing pollutants thus global warming can cause contaminated soils to release their pollutants over time thereby compromising the filter and storage

facilitated pb transport soil contaminated with pb 250 mg kg or 1000 mg kg was packed into 15 cm tall columns and the soil water content adjusted to field capacity 0 306 kg kg columns were subjected to freeze thaw cycles of 12 h freezing at 20 c followed by 12 h of thawing at 25 c then the soil columns were leached with distilled water and the effluent was analyzed for colloids soluble pb and colloidal bound pb freeze thaw cycles were found to generate dispersible soil colloids and lead to colloid facilitated pb transport colloid and pb mobilization increased with increasing number of freeze thaw cycles the majority 83 97 of the pb that leached out of the columns was colloid bound our findings suggest that freeze thaw cycles in high latitude areas can mobilize heavy metals which are otherwise immobile through colloid facilitated transport more frequent freeze thaw cycles in high latitude regions as predicted by climate change models thus increases the risk of metal leaching from contaminated soils and can lead to subsequent ground water pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords colloids colloid bound pb freeze thawing processes polluted soil mobilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lead is a persistent pollutant that poses a risk to public health and the environment u s epa 2005 du et al 2014 lead is naturally present in soils in low concentrations but accidental chemical spills improper waste disposal and automobile exhausts have increased lead concentrations in soils to toxic levels for instance mine tailings in portugal have contaminated soil with pb concentrations of up to 239 mg kg gerardo et al 2009 in spain pb concentrations in soil of 5034 mg kg have been reported adjacent to a pbsb recycling factory mykolenko et al 2018 similarly high pb concentrations up to 5580 mg kg have been documented in arable soils near smelting activities in china zhang et al 2015 these concentrations exceed local environmental health limits by orders of magnitude in soils pb has a low solubility and strongly sorbs to soil minerals and organic matter through complexation with hydroxylic carboxylic and phenolic groups mcbride and blasiak 1979 karathanasis et al 2005 therefore pb is usually strongly bound and immobile in soils unless soil colloids get mobilized and can act as rapid carrier for immobile contaminants amrhein et al 1993 such colloid facilitated pb transport has been documented in laboratory experiments grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 yin et al 2010 lu et al 2016 as well as field studies denaix et al 2001 durin et al 2007 colloids can be mobilized in soil through a variety of mechanisms including changes of the ionic strength ph or flow rate grolimund and borkovec 2005 shang et al 2008 cheng and saiers 2010 yin et al 2010 liu et al 2013 in addition colloids can also be mobilized through physical disturbances induced by wetting and drying majdalani et al 2008 cheng and saiers 2010 mohanty et al 2015 lu et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 borthakur et al 2021 or freezing and thawing mohanty et al 2014 borthakur et al 2021 wetting and drying causes differential capillary stress which in turn can dislodge soil particles michel et al 2010 freeze thaw processes can induce similar capillary stresses as wetting and drying and in addition cause disintegration of soil aggregates through mechanical stress zhang et al 2016 viran and binal 2018 ye and li 2018 sun et al 2021 this leads to the generation of dispersible colloids which can then be mobilized by subsequent leaching events mohanty et al 2014 borthakur et al 2021 freeze thaw events can enhance the transport of contaminants associated with colloids this has been observed for both inorganic i e cs and sr mohanty et al 2014 as well as organic contaminants i e pfoa borthakur et al 2021 freeze thaw events can also affect the speciation of metals as observed by enhanced metal phosphate formation reported for cu pb and zn hafsteinsdóttir et al 2013 this can lead to immobilization of two valent metals potentially counteracting colloid enhanced transport only few studies are available were colloid facilitated transport of metals has been investigated under freeze thaw conditions the release of colloids during freeze thaw events will depend on the soil type and as such studies are needed with different soils to be able to better generalize effects of freeze thawing on colloid facilitated contaminant transport chernozem soils are some of most productive agricultural soils and contribute to food security worldwide chernozem soils are located in geographic regions where soils seasonally freeze such as in the northeast of china and are subject to repeated freeze thaw cycles during the year such freeze thaw cycles affect soil structure and hydraulic properties of the soils and also affect solute transport freeze thaw cycles cause increased shear and capillary stresses in the soil matrix leading to elevated colloid formation and dispersal when the soil thaws if such soils are polluted with strongly sorbing contaminants such as heavy metals then enhanced mobilization and leaching of colloid bound contaminants is expected during thawing periods this can lead to surface and groundwater pollution from contaminated soil the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the transport of colloids and colloid associated pb in a contaminated chernozem soil we hypothesized that freeze thaw cycles will generate mobile colloids and that these colloids would act as carriers of otherwise immobile pb the soil was artificially contaminated with pb and packed into pvc columns and then subjected to repeated freeze thaw cycles and leaching events column effluent was analyzed for soluble pb colloidal pb and soil colloids the results of this study provide useful information for understanding the environmental behavior of pb in high latitude areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sample materials and methods soil samples were obtained from an agricultural field of heilongjiang academy of agricultural sciences in heilongjiang province china 124 50 e 45 77 n the climate at the site is a typical temperate continental monsoon climate the annual average air temperature is 1 5 c and annual rainfall is 550 mm average lowest winter air temperatures range between 10 c in november and 30 c in january the soil at the site is exposed to frequent freeze thaw cycles at the beginning and at the end of the winter soil samples were collected in may 2017 from the top 20 cm of a field cropped with corn the soil was air dried and then stored in plastic bags at room temperature after plant residues and gravel had been removed the soil had a phh2o of 5 9 organic matter content 29 3 g kg pb content 13 9 mg kg bulk density 1 29 g cm3 and field capacity of 0 306 kg kg the soil texture was 52 3 sand 30 0 silt and 17 7 clay by weight the soil is classified as chernozem according to the fao classification system mollisol according to the us taxonomy soil samples were sieved through a 2 mm mesh and contaminated by mixing with pb no3 2 air dry soil was thoroughly mixed with pb no3 2 powder to obtain the following treatments not considering the soil s initial pb content 0 250 1000 mg pb kg soil representing uncontaminated soil slightly contaminated and heavily contaminated soil our purpose was to uniformly contaminate the soil with pb so we used pb no3 2 powder which could be mixed readily with the soil using pb in an aqueous phase would have resulted in strong immediate sorption of pb to soil particles and prevented us from obtaining a uniform contamination mixing the solid pb no3 2 powder helped to better distribute the pb in the soil 2 2 experimental setup the different soil treatments were then packed into pvc columns 5 cm inner diameter and 15 cm long with a 2 cm thick layer of quartz sand at the bottom of the columns a fine mesh made of polyamide 80 μm aperture was used at the bottom to hold the sand and soil in place soil was packed into the columns to a bulk density of 1 29 g cm and a height of 10 cm distilled water was added to the packed soil columns to wet the soil to its field capacity 0 306 kg kg the soil columns were then covered with plastic foil to prevent evaporation and let to equilibrate at 25 c for 2 weeks the pb no3 2 powder has a high aqueous solubility and will readily dissolve in a soil with a water content of 0 306 kg kg we tested the dissolution of the pb no3 2 salt by placing an equivalent amount of salt into water under stationary conditions and found that the salt had dissolved within 60 min the pb no3 2 will thus have dissolved rapidly in the soil and pb will have sorbed to soil particles during the 2 week equilibration period soil columns were then subjected to freeze thaw cycles each freeze thaw cycle consisted of freezing at 20 c for 12 h followed by thawing at 25 c for 12 h we used three different freeze thaw cycles 0 3 and 6 cycles table 1 soil columns were then leached with distilled water by using a constant head setup fig 1 the constant head 3 cm h2o was maintained with a peristaltic pump and an overflow device we used distilled water for the leaching experiments as worst case scenario for colloid mobilization the effluent was collected in 150 ml conical flasks every 20 min for a total of 400 min the effluent volumes were measured by weight all experiments were run in duplicates 2 3 quantification of outflow volume colloids and pb in effluent after each sample collection 20 min intervals we measured the outflow volume in the flasks gravimetrically an aliquot 10 ml of each effluent sample collected was transferred into aluminum boxes and dried in an oven at 105 c for 12 h to determine the mass of colloids that was leached from the column another aliquot 10 ml was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and the pb concentration in the filtrate were measured by icp ms agilent 7500a series icp ms usa this concentration was considered the soluble pb the colloidal pb was determined by measuring the pb remaining on the filter membrane the filter membrane was placed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 15 ml of 1 mol l hcl hno3 and vortexed for 1 h at 25 c at the rate of 180 rpm the pb concentration in the fluid was then measured by icp ms from the outflow volumes we calculated the saturated hydraulic conductivity by using darcy s law based on the known hydraulic heads at the top and bottom of the column hydraulic conductivity data were then pooled by the number of freeze thaw cycles to obtain six measurements per freeze thaw cycle treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of freeze thaw cycles on effluent volumes and hydraulic conductivity the effluent volumes were larger in columns that were subject to freeze thaw cycles compared to the non freeze thaw control columns fig 2a c however there was not much difference in outflow between 3 and 6 freeze thaw cycles the calculated hydraulic conductivities increased significantly when the columns were frozen and thawed however there was no difference between 3 and 6 freeze thaw cycles fig 2d during freezing water in larger pores freezes first and then can draw unfrozen water into these pores causing fractures in the pore structure taber 1930 when the frozen soil then thaws these fractures caused by the freezing process will remain open resulting in preferential flow channels mohanty et al 2014 and the overall hydraulic conductivity of the soil will increase in our experiments the freeze thaw cycles increased the hydraulic conductivity threefold from about 1 mm min to 3 mm min fig 2d there was little difference in column outflow volumes among the different pb contamination levels fig 2a c this suggests that pb contamination did not affect the hydraulic properties of the columns and did not impact the freeze thawing cycles 3 2 effect of freeze thaw cycles on the mobilization of colloids colloid leaching was the most pronounced at the beginning of the leaching event and subsequently decreased as indicated by the decreasing slope of the cumulative colloid outflow curves fig 3a c the readily mobilizable colloids were flushed from the columns first and the supply of mobile colloids then decreased over time freeze thaw cycles f3 f6 significantly increased colloid mobilization compared to the non frozen control f0 p 0 01 fig 3d freezing causes expansion of water in soil pores and aggregates thereby breaking apart aggregates and weakening the forces between soil particles and aggregates this process will generate dispersible colloids and increase the pool of colloids that can be mobilized by subsequent infiltration events mohanty et al 2014 flury and aramrak 2017 pokrovsky et al 2018 the expansion of the freezing front may also induce colloid formation by scouring off particles from pore surfaces mohanty et al 2014 because each freeze thaw cycle generates new colloids more colloids can be mobilized in columns exposed to 6 freeze thaw cycles f6 compared to columns exposed only to 3 freeze thaw cycles f3 and there was highly significant difference between f6 and f3 p 0 01 fig 3d in addition the possible generation of preferential flow in soil induced by freeze thaw cycles can facilitate the colloid transport with increased water flow mohanty et al 2014 the pb contamination did not affect the colloid leaching i e the cumulative colloid leaching curves as well as the total colloid mass leached were similar for the different pb treatments fig 3 the pb contamination thus did not cause substantial colloid aggregation 3 3 effect of freeze thawing on colloid facilitated pb transport 3 3 1 soluble pb fig 4a c shows the amounts of soluble pb leached for different pb contamination and freeze thaw treatments compared to the non freeze thaw treatments a much greater amount of soluble pb was leached from columns exposed to freeze thaw treatments indicating that freeze thaw cycles promote the release of soluble pb from the contaminated soil freeze thaw cycles have two opposite effects on the mobility of soluble pb the soluble metals could adsorb on secondary minerals induced by salt exclusion from ice crystals or to new mineral surfaces exposed during freeze thaw cycles dietzel 2005 mohanty et al 2014 borthakur et al 2021 both of which would increase sorption and thus decrease the dissolved metal concentration mohanty et al 2014 however in our experiments we did not observe increased sorption of pb with freeze thaw cycles indeed the concentrations of soluble pb in the pore water were not affected by freeze thaw cycles and no distinct pattern of soluble pb concentrations in the outflow versus time was observed fig 5a c the higher total amount of soluble pb leached from the columns exposed to freeze thaw cycles is however related to the enhanced outflow of water from the columns freeze thaw cycles induced a higher hydraulic conductivity fig 2d and thus also more cumulative outflow of water consequently more dissolved pb was leached along with the increased water flux more freeze thaw cycles thus enhanced soluble pb transport because more water leached through the columns higher pb contamination of the soil also led to higher amounts of soluble pb leached for uncontaminated soil only small amounts of soluble pb leached fig 4a for contaminated soil soluble pb leached distinctly even without freeze thaw treatments fig 4b c there appears to be a distinct lag in the pb breakthrough with little pb leaching in the first portion of the leaching event after which the pb outflow started to increase fig 4a c we speculate that during the initial equilibration time 2 weeks at 25 c pb was adsorbed to the soil under higher ion strength than during leaching thus the initial leaching had smaller pb concentrations until the pore water was completely replaced with the low ionic strength solution of the infiltrating water more pb was then desorbed under the lower ion strength in the subsequent leaching process thus inducing an increase of soluble pb in the effluent 3 3 2 colloid bound pb fig 4 d f shows the amount of colloid bound pb leached for different pb contamination and freeze thaw treatments compared with the soluble pb much more colloid bound pb was leached from the columns overall consistent for all treatments about 10 times more colloid bound pb was leached compared to soluble pb the outflow pattern of colloid bound pb fig 4d f followed that of the outflow pattern of the colloids fig 3a c however there was no distinct plateau observed towards the end of the outflow experiment more colloid bound pb was leached when there were more freeze thaw cycles consistent with more colloid leaching observed for these treatments the concentrations of colloid bound pb were not affected by freeze thaw cycles i e no distinct pattern of colloid bound pb concentration versus time was observed fig 5d e this suggests that the sorption of pb to soil colloids was not impacted by freeze thaw cycles however as expected the pb contamination level affected the pb concentrations on the mobilized colloids significantly p 0 01 higher pb contamination led to higher pb concentrations on the mobilized colloids fig 6 while we did not observe a distinct effect of freeze thaw cycles on sorption of pb to soil colloids in our experiment others have reported that freeze thaw cycles decreased the pb adsorption capacity of soil li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 freeze thaw cycles have been reported to reduce the ph due to nitrification brooks et al 1998 and due to the release of dissolved organic acids lipson and monson 1998 semenov et al 2014 the decrease of ph then leads to enhanced solubility of pb freeze thaw cycles may also reduce the soils organic matter content by breaking up soil aggregates and fracturing the organic matter coatings of clay minerals allowing microbes to mineralize and consume organic matter wang et al 2017 decreased organic matter content and ph both will cause the cec to decrease helling et al 1964 martel et al 1978 wang et al 2017 moreover low ph will also increase the solubility and the reduction of free iron oxides in soils kong and luo 2016 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 these changes of the soil properties can all lead to a decreased sorption capacity for heavy metals to the contrary du et al 2020 found that freeze thaw cycles enhanced pb immobilization on soil and sorption capacity increased with additional freeze thaw cycles this was attributed to higher concentration of ions excluded by ice formation which increases the interactions between pb and clay particles after repeated freeze thaw cycles du et al 2020 also the dispersion of clay particles and release soil organic matter caused by freeze thaw cycles increased the specific surface area for pb adsorption and facilitated strong adsorption between organic matter and organic matter associated pb on the surface of soil particles du et al 2020 indeed the effects of freeze thaw on soil properties are dependent on the temperature rate number amplitude and length of freeze thaw cycles hentschel et al 2008 elliott and henry 2009 ren and ren 2013 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 2020 for instance freeze thaw cycles carried out over a moderate temperature range from 5 c to 5 c resulted in a smaller amount of extractable n than when the freeze thaw occurred over a large temperature range from 13 c to 5 c hentschel et al 2008 elliott and henry 2009 when soil chernozem soil was frozen at 5 to 10 c for 12 h and thawed at 5 to 7 c for 12 h the ph was found to increase fan et al 2014 du et al 2020 however when such as soil was frozen at 15 to 35 c for 24 h and then thawed at 5 c for 24 h the ph was observed to have decreased li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 therefore the specific freeze thaw conditions will affect the chemical changes occurring in a given soil we thus also expect that the different freeze thaw conditions will have different effects on the sorption of heavy metals li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 2020 du et al 2020 3 3 3 total mass of pb and form of pb in column effluent the leaching of total pb was enhanced by freeze thaw cycles as well as by elevated pb contamination fig 7 the transport of pb in soil was dominated by colloid facilitated transport i e 83 to 97 of the total pb leached was in colloid bound form this strong association of pb with mobile soil colloids has also been observed by others under non freeze thaw conditions grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 yin et al 2010 grolimund and coauthors grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 found that almost 100 of released pb from a contaminated soil was associated with colloidal particles similarly yin et al 2010 found that 87 of pb in their column effluent was associated with the coarse colloidal fraction 0 45 8 μm when they leached a pb contaminated sandy soil with simulated rainwater the transport of pb is thus manily controlled by factors that govern colloid mobilization and transport grolimund et al 1996 grolimund and borkovec 2005 yin et al 2010 interestingly the ratio of colloid bound pb to total pb was independent of freeze thaw cycles and independent of pb contamination level fig 7 freeze thaw cycles facilitated the outflow of soluble pb by increasing the outflow volume of water containing the pb desorbed from the soil matrix and the outflow of colloid bound pb by mobilization of colloidal particles these two processes act concurrently under freeze thawing conditions and thus the ratio of colloid bound pb to soluble pb remained stable and so did the ratio of colloid bound pb to total pb as soils are contaminated with pb the sorption of pb onto the soil matrix increases with increasing pb contamination yang et al 2004 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 du et al 2020 during desorption more pb can desorb from heavily contaminated soil yang et al 2004 jiang et al 2012 and more pb will be released into the pore water during leaching with uncontaminated water at the same time the mobilized colloids also carry more pb thereby the ratio of soluble to colloid bound pb remains fairly constant 4 conclusions our results show that freeze thaw cycles can exacerbate the transport of colloids and colloid bound metals in soil in case of strongly sorbing contaminants such as pb most of the contaminant will leach in colloid associated form freeze thawing cycles thus can be considered an important and reoccurring trigger for contaminant release and transport from soils polluted with strongly sorbing contaminants climate warming has significantly impacted snow cover and snow depth in the northern hemisphere solomon et al 2007 and the reduced snow cover is expected to produce more and more freeze thaw events fan et al 2014 this not only leads to enhanced carbon mineralization bonan and cleve 1992 rasmussen et al 2006 but also to enhanced mobilization of mineral and organic colloids which can act as facilitators for the transport of metals and other strongly sorbing pollutants thus global warming can cause contaminated soils to release their pollutants over time thereby compromising the filter and storage

1257,gases that invade during deep water oil and gas drilling may be concealed due to the gas dissolution effect leading to increased well control risks accurate and rapid prediction of carbon dioxide and methane dissolution is of great significance for the prediction and control of wellbore pressure during gas invasion in this study 316 sets of carbon dioxide solubility data at 288 15 to 423 15 k and 0 1 to 100 mpa and 266 sets of methane solubility data at 275 15 to 444 3 k and 0 1 to 68 mpa were used to train a machine learning algorithm the machine learning prediction method for gas solubility was established with a support vector regression machine and a particle swarm optimisation algorithm the kernel function and disciplinary parameters of the support vector regression machine were optimised using the experimental dataset the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water was measured using a gas solubility measurement device the experimental and model analysis showed that the solubility of co2 varied in different phase states at a given pressure the solubility of co2 was highest in the liquid state followed by the supercritical state and then the gaseous state the average absolute relative deviation percentages between the calculated values of the co2 and ch4 solubility models and the experimental values were 2 57 and 8 20 respectively the machine learning method is consistent with the high precision duan thermodynamic model for predicting the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water and can be used to predict the gas solubility in deep water and deep oil and gas drilling keywords machine learning carbon dioxide methane solubility thermodynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic development has led to an increase in energy demand which has resulted in the drilling of natural gas from deeper waters deep water natural gas contains co2 in addition to ch4 for example the liwan 3 1 gas field in china with ch4 content of 80 and co2 content of 3 is considered an acidic gas field zhu et al 2009 gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 fu et al 2020 at the same time gases can easily invade the reservoir during deep water gas drilling the invaded ch4 and co2 will rapidly dissolve into the drilling fluid due to high temperatures and pressures these dissolved gases lead to inaccurate wellbore pressure predictions and difficulties with monitoring the occurrence of blowout accidents moroni et al 2008 verri et al 2016 fu et al 2019 therefore the accurate prediction of co2 and ch4 solubility during drilling gas invasion is crucial for the safe and efficient development of deep water oil and gas fields several studies have measured the solubility of ch4 in water experimentally blount and price 1982 crovetto and rosa 1982 culberson and mcketta 1951 culberson et al 1950 in these studies the maximum temperature was 443 15 k and the maximum pressure was 70 mpa at the same time the duan and mao 2006 model is widely used to predict ch4 solubility in water this model uses complex virial equations mason and spurling 1969 and empirical parameter modelling the solubility of pure co2 in water was studied experimentally by wiebe and gaddy 1939 briones et al 1987 d souza et al 1988 and dohrn et al 1993 at temperatures up to 373 15 k and pressures up to 70 mpa rumpf et al 1994 wei et al 2011 and mohammadian et al 2015a extended the solubility experiment of co2 to salt solutions thus existing experimental data on co2 and ch4provide a basis for the application of machine learning methods the existing solubility prediction models for ch4 and co2 in water are mainly fugacity fugacity models and fugacity activity models akinfiev and diamond 2003 kiepe et al 2003 shabani and vilcáez 2017 the calculation of the two models is inseparable from the application of the state equation including the peng robinson state equation patel teja state equation cubic plus association state equation and statistical associating fluid theory state equation peng and robinson 1976 chapman 1988 kontogeorgis et al 1996 shabani and vilcáez 2017 zuo and guo 1991 although the model established by the state equation significantly improves the prediction accuracy of gas solubility the iterative calculation process of the state equation is complicated furthermore many parameters critical temperature critical pressure and eccentricity coefficient are required resulting in cumbersome calculations it is particularly important to quickly and accurately predict gas solubility in recent years the use of machine learning algorithms has gradually increased machine learning algorithms have high consistency in analysis adaptation nonlinearity and design and can deal with inaccurate data prediction technologies such as backpropagation and support vector machines have been developed huang et al 2013 yan et al 2013 and sedghamiz et al 2015 successively used different machine learning algorithms to predict the solubility of gas in organic and inorganic solutions taherdangkoo et al 2021 predicted the solubility of ch4 in water using four machine learning algorithms region tree boosted region tree least squares support vector machine and gaussian process region temperatures ranging from 273 15 to 518 3 k and pressures ranging from 0 1 to 157 mpa were used in those studies there are few studies on predicting the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water using machine learning algorithms this study uses particle swarm optimisation pso to optimise the disciplinary parameters and kernel function of a support vector regression svr algorithm a training set was composed from 582 groups of literature data on the water solubility of co2 and ch4 using the solubility of co2 and ch4 measured experimentally in water as the prediction set the prediction accuracy of the machine learning method for the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water was verified and analysed 2 machine learning model 2 1 basic algorithm of support vector regression machine the svr algorithm is a feedforward neural network based on statistical theory it has good applicability to small sample machine learning basak et al 2007 given the fitting training data x 1 y 1 x i y i x rn y 1 1 i 1 2 l a linear function y f x was found to infer the output y from the input x expressed as follows 1 f x ωx b according to the structural risk minimisation criterion the non negative relaxation factors ξ i and ξ i are introduced and eq 1 is written as follows 2 min 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i 3 s t y i ω x i b ε ξ i ω x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is the disciplinary parameter and ε is the standard insensitive loss function the lagrange algorithm was used to solve the linear support vector regression machine and lagrange variables were introduced to obtain its decision function 4 f x i 1 l α i α i x i x b here b in eqs 3 and 4 is the top term and is calculated using the following formula 5 b y i i 1 l α i α i x i x j ε for nonlinear regression the input space samples are mapped to the high dimensional feature space using nonlinear mapping x φ x and linear regression is realised in the high dimensional space therefore eq 1 becomes the following form 6 f x ωφ x b due to the nonlinear function φ x unknown its high dimensional number cannot be explicitly stated therefore the kernel function is introduced to make the function return to the linear function calculation of high dimensional space cortes et al 1995 the final decision function is as follows 7 f x i 1 l α i α i k x i x b where k x i x is the kernel function and the gaussian kernel function is used that is 8 k x i x exp x i x 2 2 g 2 where g is the kernel parameter that represents the mean squared deviation of the gaussian function the function width is in the direction of independent variable meaning larger values of g correspond to a wider gaussian function 2 2 parameter optimisation of support vector regression algorithm pso is derived from the study of bird behaviour kennedy and eberhart 1995 in the algorithm the particle swarm optimises the target gradually by updating the speed and position information compares the fitness value of the new particle with the fitness value of the individual optimal position and the group optimal position updates the individual and group optimal positions and finally finds the optimal position of the objective function because the prediction accuracy of the svr algorithm is affected by the control parameters of the model itself penalty coefficient c and kernel parameter g the pso algorithm was used to determine the optimal control parameters in the svr algorithm and establish a more accurate prediction model the optimisation process is shown in fig 1 the specific steps are as follows 1 import the sample database and select the experimental gas solubility data from the database to form the training and prediction sets the data of the training set in this study were composed of temperature pressure critical temperature critical pressure salinity of salt and experimental data of gas solubility 2 initialise svr parameters iteration times acceleration factor etc as shown in table 1 and optimise the svr parameters disciplinary parameters and kernel function using the pso algorithm the main steps of particle swarm optimisation include importing training set data initialising particle swarm optimisation parameters calculating particle fitness searching individual optimal solution and global optimal solution updating particle speed and position and updating the individual and global optimal solutions of particles at the same time until the termination conditions are met the optimal disciplinary parameters and kernel function are given as outputs 3 bring the optimal disciplinary parameters and kernel function to establish the pso svr prediction model and import the prediction data set for calculation the prediction results for the given prediction conditions are obtained the accuracy of the model prediction was expressed by the square of the correlation coefficient r 2 average relative deviation percentage ard and average absolute relative deviation aard 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i exp y i predict 2 i 1 n y i exp y i exp 2 10 ard y i exp y i predict y i exp 100 11 aard 1 n ard where n is the number of data points y i expis the experimental data measured under experimental conditions y i predict is the predicted value and y i exp is the average value of the experimental dataset 3 establishment of machine learning algorithm training database 3 1 establishment of co2 solubility training set in water to establish the pso svr algorithm for predicting the solubility of co2 gas in water temperature and pressure were used as training input parameters and the solubility of co2 gas in water was used as the output parameter the 316 groups of data from 18 studies in table 2 were selected to form the training set the training set was introduced into the pso svr algorithm to optimise the penalty coefficient and kernel parameters the optimal parameters were c 32 and g 1 41 the pso svr algorithm was used to predict and analyse the training set as shown in fig 2 the pso svr algorithm shows good agreement between the predicted value of the co2 mole fraction in water and the experimental value the r 2 value between the predicted and experimental values is 0 9740 and the aard is maintained at 7 79 3 2 establishment of the training set for ch4 solubility in water to predict the solubility of ch4 gas in water only temperature and pressure were used as training input parameters and the ch4 solubility was used as an output parameter the training set was formed from 266 groups of ch4 solubility data from 11 references at high temperature and high pressure as shown in table 3 the established training set was introduced into the pso svr algorithm to optimise the penalty coefficient c and kernel parameter g optimal parameters of c 16 and g 2 828 were obtained new optimal punishment parameters and kernel parameters were then introduced into the pso svr algorithm to predict and analyse the training set fig 3 shows that the pso svr algorithm is in good agreement with the predicted and experimental values of the ch4 mole fraction in water the r 2 between the predicted and experimental values was 0 9938 and the aard was maintained at 5 27 the above machine learning method was used to predict the water solubility of co2 and ch4 based on the training set of existing literature data however the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithm for new experimental data needed to be studied further therefore water solubility experiments on co2 and ch4 were conducted using a phase equilibrium apparatus the trained machine learning model was then used for verification analysis 4 gas solubility experiment 4 1 materials and devices the gas types and manufacturers used in these experiments are listed in table 4 deionised water with a conductivity of 2 to 10 μs cm was produced using a zycgf ultrapure water machine the volume of the high temperature and high pressure reactor was 300 ml the maximum pressure resistance was 60 mpa and the maximum temperature resistance was 473 k using the d 250 l constant speed constant pressure pump the maximum pressure was 70 mpa 4 2 experimental procedure the experimental flow is shown in fig 4 and the specific operation steps are as follows 1 the reactor was cleaned two to three times with deionised water and gas was injected to boost the pressure to 5 mpa when the piston container was connected to the reactor if the pressure was stable for at least 2 h this indicated that the experimental device was adequately sealed otherwise the connection was rechecked 2 the reactor and buffer tank were evacuated injected with a quantity liquid the constant temperature circulating water bath was started and the reactor was heated to a pre set temperature gas at a specific pressure was injected into the reactor through the piston container and the gas and liquid were mixed because the reactor was an adiabatic system temperature fluctuations occurred after the pressure increased therefore it was necessary to re stabilise the temperature the electromagnetic stirrer was switched off after 2 h the pressure change in the kettle was then observed if the pressure did not fluctuate within 2 to 3 h it was assumed that the system reached gas liquid equilibrium 3 the sampler was evacuated and the liquid in the reactor was extracted simultaneously the hand pump injected liquid into the reactor to maintain a stable reactor pressure a gas meter was used to measure the precipitated gas volume after the gas was collected the gas and liquid volumes were recorded in real time measured three times and the average value was taken 4 steps 2 and 3 were repeated to measure solubility at different pressures and temperatures 4 3 experimental accuracy analysis the solubility of co2 gas in pure water at 325 15 k under different pressures was measured using the above experimental device and the results were compared with the experimental data reported by sabirzyanov et al 2003 todheide and franck 1963 and qin et al 2009 as presented in table 5 the maximum ard of the experimental data relative to the literature data is 3 54 and the minimum is 1 55 therefore the aforementioned experimental devices and methods can be used for gas solubility measurements 4 4 experimental law analysis 4 4 1 solubility variation of co2 in water the phase boundary division diagrams of co2 and h2o mixed systems were discussed and analysed in detail by spycher et al 2003 and akinfiev and diamond 2003 the experimental solubility data under different temperatures and pressures from table 2 were drawn into a contour map of solubility with respect to temperature and pressure as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the amount of dissolved co2 in water increases with an increase in pressure and decreases with an increase in temperature in the range of 280 to 360 k the experimental temperature and pressure data from the phase boundary map were added the phase diagram of the co2 h2o mixed system and it was found that the measured temperature and pressure points were primarily distributed in the liquid h2o liquid co2 liquid h2o gaseous co2 and supercritical co2 areas the relationship between the dissolved co2 in water with respect to pressure between 298 15 and 357 15 k was measured experimentally as shown in fig 6 when the pressure is constant the amount of dissolved co2 in water decreases gradually with an increase in temperature and when the temperature is constant the dissolution increases gradually with an increase in pressure when the pressure is below the critical pressure of 7 411 mpa co2 wendland et al 1999 the solubility of co2 gas increases significantly with an increase in pressure and the curve is steeper above the critical pressure the solubility increases more gradually with an increase in pressure that is the slope of the solubility curve tends to be shallower above the critical pressure as shown in fig 5 the amount of dissolved co2 in the liquid h2o liquid co2 phase region is the largest under pressure 7 411 mpa with an increase in temperature the mixed gas phase transitions to the liquid h2o gas co2 phase region and the supercritical co2 region the dissolved amount of co2 in the liquid h2o gas co2 phase region was the smallest below the critical pressure above the critical pressure of 7 411 mpa the amount of dissolved co2 in the supercritical area is the smallest in water and gradually increases relative to the amount dissolved in the liquid h2o gas co2 phase area therefore the highest amount of dissolved co2 was found in the liquid area followed by the supercritical and gas phase areas 4 4 2 dissolution law of ch4 in water the relationship between pressure and the amount of dissolved ch4 gas in water was measured between 303 15 and 363 15 k as shown in fig 7 when the pressure was constant the amount of dissolved ch4 gas decreased gradually with an increase in temperature but the reduction range decreased gradually for example the solubility interval between 303 15 and 323 15 k is larger than that between 348 15 and 363 15 k and the solubility at 348 15 and 363 15 k is approaching kerrick 1981 showed that the critical point of ch4 is 190 56 k and 4 599 mpa and the experimentally measured temperature and pressure were higher than the critical temperature and pressure however when the temperature was constant the solubility of ch4 gas in water deviated from a first order function with increasing pressure therefore the phase change of ch4 was not as significant as that of co2 5 model prediction and analysis 5 1 accuracy analysis of experimental prediction of co2 and ch4 solubility by pso svr the experimental values for temperature and pressure of co2 and ch4 form a prediction set which was used to optimise the pso svr algorithm fig 8 shows a comparison between the experimental data and predicted results from the pso svr algorithm on the water solubility of co2 and ch4 at different temperatures and pressures the predicted values of the pso svr algorithm are in good agreement with the experimentally measured values the r 2 between the predicted solubility of co2 in water and the experimental data was 0 9846 and the aard was 2 77 indicating high accuracy similarly for the predicted solubility of ch4 gas in water the r 2 was 0 9945 and the aard was 7 66 this method can be used to predict the solubility of ch4 gas in water in actual natural gas reservoirs 5 2 comparative analysis of machine learning model and thermodynamic model 5 2 1 comparison of co2 water solubility models to further evaluate the accuracy of the pso svr method in predicting the solubility of co2 in water the predicted results of this method were compared with those of widely used thermodynamic models duan and sun 2003 shabani and vilcáez 2017 the duan and sun 2003 model was developed from the multidimensional viri equation and the shabani and vilcáez 2017 model was developed from the peng and robinson equation peng and robinson 1976 fig 9 shows the comparison between the predicted results of the pso svr the duan and sun 2003 model the shabani and vilcáez 2017 model and the experimental data at 298 15 k king et al 1992 sabirzyanov et al 2003 wiebe and gaddy 1940 the predicted results of each model were significantly different with aard values of 3 81 4 43 and 3 82 respectively at the same time fig 9 shows that the degree of matching between the experimental data of sabirzyanov et al 2003 and the predicted results of the three models is very poor because the accuracy of the experimental data is not within the scope of this study it is not discussed and analysed here fig 10 shows the comparison between the predicted values of the three models and the experimental values at 323 15 k koschel et al 2006 sabirzyanov et al 2003 wiebe and gaddy 1939 yan et al 2013 compared with fig 9 the agreement between the predicted values of the model and the experimental values is very high at 323 15 k the aard between the experimental values and the predicted values of the pso svr algorithm the duan and sun 2003 model and the shabani and vilcáez 2017 model are 4 54 4 16 and 4 32 respectively the prediction error of this method is close to that of the thermodynamic model all of which are 5 therefore the prediction of gas water solubility during oil drilling and production can meet the calculation requirements 5 2 2 comparison of ch4 water solubility models for the accuracy analysis of the ch4 water solubility model the duan and mao 2006 and shabani and vilcáez 2017 models were also used for comparison with the pso svr model as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 at 298 15 k the prediction results of each model correlate strongly with the experimental data chapoy et al 2005 culberson et al 1950 culberson and mcketta 1951 duffy et al 1961 as shown in fig 11 the aard between the predicted values of the pso svr duan and mao 2006 and shabani and vilcáez 2017 models and the experimental values were 6 97 8 35 and 7 47 respectively compared with the thermodynamic theoretical model the prediction accuracy of the pso svr method was improved similarly the predicted value of the model at 375 15 k was compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 11 owing to the lack of experimental data the experimental data of o sullivan and smith 1970 and qin et al 2009 were selected and the agreement between the model predictions and experimental values is also very high the aard values are 2 19 2 42 and 2 50 respectively the prediction accuracy of the pso svr method at 298 15 and 375 15 k was the same as that of the thermodynamic theoretical model therefore the pso svr machine learning method can be used to predict the solubility of ch4 gas in water 6 conclusion the pso svr machine learning algorithm was used to predict the solubility of co2 and ch4 gases in water the training set comprised experimental data from literature to obtain optimal svr parameters this study analysed the solubility composition prediction set of co2 and ch4 gas in water at 298 15 to 373 15 k and 0 to 40 mpa as measured by the phase equilibrium experiment and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the solubility of co2 in water varies with temperature and pressure and is closely related to the phase state of co2 when the pressure was constant the solubility of co2 in the liquid state was greater than that in the supercritical state and when the temperature was constant the solubility of co2 in the supercritical state was greater than that in the gaseous state 2 the pso svr machine learning method used data from previous experimental studies to predict the measured data of the phase equilibrium experiments the prediction error of this method for the co2 water solubility model was 3 and the relative prediction error of ch4 water solubility was large but the average relative error was within 9 3 the comparison between the pso svr machine learning method and thermodynamic model combined with experimental data shows that the prediction errors of the two methods for the solubility of co2 in water are similar both of which are below 5 for the prediction of the solubility of ch4 in water the prediction accuracy of the pso svr model was the same as that of the high precision thermodynamic model considering the complexity and iterative nature of the thermodynamic model the pso svr machine learning algorithm is simpler and easier to operate therefore the pso svr method can be used to predict the water solubility of co2 and ch4 gases although the machine learning method can accurately predict the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water owing to the lack of experimental data more experimental

1257,gases that invade during deep water oil and gas drilling may be concealed due to the gas dissolution effect leading to increased well control risks accurate and rapid prediction of carbon dioxide and methane dissolution is of great significance for the prediction and control of wellbore pressure during gas invasion in this study 316 sets of carbon dioxide solubility data at 288 15 to 423 15 k and 0 1 to 100 mpa and 266 sets of methane solubility data at 275 15 to 444 3 k and 0 1 to 68 mpa were used to train a machine learning algorithm the machine learning prediction method for gas solubility was established with a support vector regression machine and a particle swarm optimisation algorithm the kernel function and disciplinary parameters of the support vector regression machine were optimised using the experimental dataset the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water was measured using a gas solubility measurement device the experimental and model analysis showed that the solubility of co2 varied in different phase states at a given pressure the solubility of co2 was highest in the liquid state followed by the supercritical state and then the gaseous state the average absolute relative deviation percentages between the calculated values of the co2 and ch4 solubility models and the experimental values were 2 57 and 8 20 respectively the machine learning method is consistent with the high precision duan thermodynamic model for predicting the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water and can be used to predict the gas solubility in deep water and deep oil and gas drilling keywords machine learning carbon dioxide methane solubility thermodynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic development has led to an increase in energy demand which has resulted in the drilling of natural gas from deeper waters deep water natural gas contains co2 in addition to ch4 for example the liwan 3 1 gas field in china with ch4 content of 80 and co2 content of 3 is considered an acidic gas field zhu et al 2009 gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 fu et al 2020 at the same time gases can easily invade the reservoir during deep water gas drilling the invaded ch4 and co2 will rapidly dissolve into the drilling fluid due to high temperatures and pressures these dissolved gases lead to inaccurate wellbore pressure predictions and difficulties with monitoring the occurrence of blowout accidents moroni et al 2008 verri et al 2016 fu et al 2019 therefore the accurate prediction of co2 and ch4 solubility during drilling gas invasion is crucial for the safe and efficient development of deep water oil and gas fields several studies have measured the solubility of ch4 in water experimentally blount and price 1982 crovetto and rosa 1982 culberson and mcketta 1951 culberson et al 1950 in these studies the maximum temperature was 443 15 k and the maximum pressure was 70 mpa at the same time the duan and mao 2006 model is widely used to predict ch4 solubility in water this model uses complex virial equations mason and spurling 1969 and empirical parameter modelling the solubility of pure co2 in water was studied experimentally by wiebe and gaddy 1939 briones et al 1987 d souza et al 1988 and dohrn et al 1993 at temperatures up to 373 15 k and pressures up to 70 mpa rumpf et al 1994 wei et al 2011 and mohammadian et al 2015a extended the solubility experiment of co2 to salt solutions thus existing experimental data on co2 and ch4provide a basis for the application of machine learning methods the existing solubility prediction models for ch4 and co2 in water are mainly fugacity fugacity models and fugacity activity models akinfiev and diamond 2003 kiepe et al 2003 shabani and vilcáez 2017 the calculation of the two models is inseparable from the application of the state equation including the peng robinson state equation patel teja state equation cubic plus association state equation and statistical associating fluid theory state equation peng and robinson 1976 chapman 1988 kontogeorgis et al 1996 shabani and vilcáez 2017 zuo and guo 1991 although the model established by the state equation significantly improves the prediction accuracy of gas solubility the iterative calculation process of the state equation is complicated furthermore many parameters critical temperature critical pressure and eccentricity coefficient are required resulting in cumbersome calculations it is particularly important to quickly and accurately predict gas solubility in recent years the use of machine learning algorithms has gradually increased machine learning algorithms have high consistency in analysis adaptation nonlinearity and design and can deal with inaccurate data prediction technologies such as backpropagation and support vector machines have been developed huang et al 2013 yan et al 2013 and sedghamiz et al 2015 successively used different machine learning algorithms to predict the solubility of gas in organic and inorganic solutions taherdangkoo et al 2021 predicted the solubility of ch4 in water using four machine learning algorithms region tree boosted region tree least squares support vector machine and gaussian process region temperatures ranging from 273 15 to 518 3 k and pressures ranging from 0 1 to 157 mpa were used in those studies there are few studies on predicting the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water using machine learning algorithms this study uses particle swarm optimisation pso to optimise the disciplinary parameters and kernel function of a support vector regression svr algorithm a training set was composed from 582 groups of literature data on the water solubility of co2 and ch4 using the solubility of co2 and ch4 measured experimentally in water as the prediction set the prediction accuracy of the machine learning method for the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water was verified and analysed 2 machine learning model 2 1 basic algorithm of support vector regression machine the svr algorithm is a feedforward neural network based on statistical theory it has good applicability to small sample machine learning basak et al 2007 given the fitting training data x 1 y 1 x i y i x rn y 1 1 i 1 2 l a linear function y f x was found to infer the output y from the input x expressed as follows 1 f x ωx b according to the structural risk minimisation criterion the non negative relaxation factors ξ i and ξ i are introduced and eq 1 is written as follows 2 min 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i 3 s t y i ω x i b ε ξ i ω x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is the disciplinary parameter and ε is the standard insensitive loss function the lagrange algorithm was used to solve the linear support vector regression machine and lagrange variables were introduced to obtain its decision function 4 f x i 1 l α i α i x i x b here b in eqs 3 and 4 is the top term and is calculated using the following formula 5 b y i i 1 l α i α i x i x j ε for nonlinear regression the input space samples are mapped to the high dimensional feature space using nonlinear mapping x φ x and linear regression is realised in the high dimensional space therefore eq 1 becomes the following form 6 f x ωφ x b due to the nonlinear function φ x unknown its high dimensional number cannot be explicitly stated therefore the kernel function is introduced to make the function return to the linear function calculation of high dimensional space cortes et al 1995 the final decision function is as follows 7 f x i 1 l α i α i k x i x b where k x i x is the kernel function and the gaussian kernel function is used that is 8 k x i x exp x i x 2 2 g 2 where g is the kernel parameter that represents the mean squared deviation of the gaussian function the function width is in the direction of independent variable meaning larger values of g correspond to a wider gaussian function 2 2 parameter optimisation of support vector regression algorithm pso is derived from the study of bird behaviour kennedy and eberhart 1995 in the algorithm the particle swarm optimises the target gradually by updating the speed and position information compares the fitness value of the new particle with the fitness value of the individual optimal position and the group optimal position updates the individual and group optimal positions and finally finds the optimal position of the objective function because the prediction accuracy of the svr algorithm is affected by the control parameters of the model itself penalty coefficient c and kernel parameter g the pso algorithm was used to determine the optimal control parameters in the svr algorithm and establish a more accurate prediction model the optimisation process is shown in fig 1 the specific steps are as follows 1 import the sample database and select the experimental gas solubility data from the database to form the training and prediction sets the data of the training set in this study were composed of temperature pressure critical temperature critical pressure salinity of salt and experimental data of gas solubility 2 initialise svr parameters iteration times acceleration factor etc as shown in table 1 and optimise the svr parameters disciplinary parameters and kernel function using the pso algorithm the main steps of particle swarm optimisation include importing training set data initialising particle swarm optimisation parameters calculating particle fitness searching individual optimal solution and global optimal solution updating particle speed and position and updating the individual and global optimal solutions of particles at the same time until the termination conditions are met the optimal disciplinary parameters and kernel function are given as outputs 3 bring the optimal disciplinary parameters and kernel function to establish the pso svr prediction model and import the prediction data set for calculation the prediction results for the given prediction conditions are obtained the accuracy of the model prediction was expressed by the square of the correlation coefficient r 2 average relative deviation percentage ard and average absolute relative deviation aard 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i exp y i predict 2 i 1 n y i exp y i exp 2 10 ard y i exp y i predict y i exp 100 11 aard 1 n ard where n is the number of data points y i expis the experimental data measured under experimental conditions y i predict is the predicted value and y i exp is the average value of the experimental dataset 3 establishment of machine learning algorithm training database 3 1 establishment of co2 solubility training set in water to establish the pso svr algorithm for predicting the solubility of co2 gas in water temperature and pressure were used as training input parameters and the solubility of co2 gas in water was used as the output parameter the 316 groups of data from 18 studies in table 2 were selected to form the training set the training set was introduced into the pso svr algorithm to optimise the penalty coefficient and kernel parameters the optimal parameters were c 32 and g 1 41 the pso svr algorithm was used to predict and analyse the training set as shown in fig 2 the pso svr algorithm shows good agreement between the predicted value of the co2 mole fraction in water and the experimental value the r 2 value between the predicted and experimental values is 0 9740 and the aard is maintained at 7 79 3 2 establishment of the training set for ch4 solubility in water to predict the solubility of ch4 gas in water only temperature and pressure were used as training input parameters and the ch4 solubility was used as an output parameter the training set was formed from 266 groups of ch4 solubility data from 11 references at high temperature and high pressure as shown in table 3 the established training set was introduced into the pso svr algorithm to optimise the penalty coefficient c and kernel parameter g optimal parameters of c 16 and g 2 828 were obtained new optimal punishment parameters and kernel parameters were then introduced into the pso svr algorithm to predict and analyse the training set fig 3 shows that the pso svr algorithm is in good agreement with the predicted and experimental values of the ch4 mole fraction in water the r 2 between the predicted and experimental values was 0 9938 and the aard was maintained at 5 27 the above machine learning method was used to predict the water solubility of co2 and ch4 based on the training set of existing literature data however the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithm for new experimental data needed to be studied further therefore water solubility experiments on co2 and ch4 were conducted using a phase equilibrium apparatus the trained machine learning model was then used for verification analysis 4 gas solubility experiment 4 1 materials and devices the gas types and manufacturers used in these experiments are listed in table 4 deionised water with a conductivity of 2 to 10 μs cm was produced using a zycgf ultrapure water machine the volume of the high temperature and high pressure reactor was 300 ml the maximum pressure resistance was 60 mpa and the maximum temperature resistance was 473 k using the d 250 l constant speed constant pressure pump the maximum pressure was 70 mpa 4 2 experimental procedure the experimental flow is shown in fig 4 and the specific operation steps are as follows 1 the reactor was cleaned two to three times with deionised water and gas was injected to boost the pressure to 5 mpa when the piston container was connected to the reactor if the pressure was stable for at least 2 h this indicated that the experimental device was adequately sealed otherwise the connection was rechecked 2 the reactor and buffer tank were evacuated injected with a quantity liquid the constant temperature circulating water bath was started and the reactor was heated to a pre set temperature gas at a specific pressure was injected into the reactor through the piston container and the gas and liquid were mixed because the reactor was an adiabatic system temperature fluctuations occurred after the pressure increased therefore it was necessary to re stabilise the temperature the electromagnetic stirrer was switched off after 2 h the pressure change in the kettle was then observed if the pressure did not fluctuate within 2 to 3 h it was assumed that the system reached gas liquid equilibrium 3 the sampler was evacuated and the liquid in the reactor was extracted simultaneously the hand pump injected liquid into the reactor to maintain a stable reactor pressure a gas meter was used to measure the precipitated gas volume after the gas was collected the gas and liquid volumes were recorded in real time measured three times and the average value was taken 4 steps 2 and 3 were repeated to measure solubility at different pressures and temperatures 4 3 experimental accuracy analysis the solubility of co2 gas in pure water at 325 15 k under different pressures was measured using the above experimental device and the results were compared with the experimental data reported by sabirzyanov et al 2003 todheide and franck 1963 and qin et al 2009 as presented in table 5 the maximum ard of the experimental data relative to the literature data is 3 54 and the minimum is 1 55 therefore the aforementioned experimental devices and methods can be used for gas solubility measurements 4 4 experimental law analysis 4 4 1 solubility variation of co2 in water the phase boundary division diagrams of co2 and h2o mixed systems were discussed and analysed in detail by spycher et al 2003 and akinfiev and diamond 2003 the experimental solubility data under different temperatures and pressures from table 2 were drawn into a contour map of solubility with respect to temperature and pressure as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the amount of dissolved co2 in water increases with an increase in pressure and decreases with an increase in temperature in the range of 280 to 360 k the experimental temperature and pressure data from the phase boundary map were added the phase diagram of the co2 h2o mixed system and it was found that the measured temperature and pressure points were primarily distributed in the liquid h2o liquid co2 liquid h2o gaseous co2 and supercritical co2 areas the relationship between the dissolved co2 in water with respect to pressure between 298 15 and 357 15 k was measured experimentally as shown in fig 6 when the pressure is constant the amount of dissolved co2 in water decreases gradually with an increase in temperature and when the temperature is constant the dissolution increases gradually with an increase in pressure when the pressure is below the critical pressure of 7 411 mpa co2 wendland et al 1999 the solubility of co2 gas increases significantly with an increase in pressure and the curve is steeper above the critical pressure the solubility increases more gradually with an increase in pressure that is the slope of the solubility curve tends to be shallower above the critical pressure as shown in fig 5 the amount of dissolved co2 in the liquid h2o liquid co2 phase region is the largest under pressure 7 411 mpa with an increase in temperature the mixed gas phase transitions to the liquid h2o gas co2 phase region and the supercritical co2 region the dissolved amount of co2 in the liquid h2o gas co2 phase region was the smallest below the critical pressure above the critical pressure of 7 411 mpa the amount of dissolved co2 in the supercritical area is the smallest in water and gradually increases relative to the amount dissolved in the liquid h2o gas co2 phase area therefore the highest amount of dissolved co2 was found in the liquid area followed by the supercritical and gas phase areas 4 4 2 dissolution law of ch4 in water the relationship between pressure and the amount of dissolved ch4 gas in water was measured between 303 15 and 363 15 k as shown in fig 7 when the pressure was constant the amount of dissolved ch4 gas decreased gradually with an increase in temperature but the reduction range decreased gradually for example the solubility interval between 303 15 and 323 15 k is larger than that between 348 15 and 363 15 k and the solubility at 348 15 and 363 15 k is approaching kerrick 1981 showed that the critical point of ch4 is 190 56 k and 4 599 mpa and the experimentally measured temperature and pressure were higher than the critical temperature and pressure however when the temperature was constant the solubility of ch4 gas in water deviated from a first order function with increasing pressure therefore the phase change of ch4 was not as significant as that of co2 5 model prediction and analysis 5 1 accuracy analysis of experimental prediction of co2 and ch4 solubility by pso svr the experimental values for temperature and pressure of co2 and ch4 form a prediction set which was used to optimise the pso svr algorithm fig 8 shows a comparison between the experimental data and predicted results from the pso svr algorithm on the water solubility of co2 and ch4 at different temperatures and pressures the predicted values of the pso svr algorithm are in good agreement with the experimentally measured values the r 2 between the predicted solubility of co2 in water and the experimental data was 0 9846 and the aard was 2 77 indicating high accuracy similarly for the predicted solubility of ch4 gas in water the r 2 was 0 9945 and the aard was 7 66 this method can be used to predict the solubility of ch4 gas in water in actual natural gas reservoirs 5 2 comparative analysis of machine learning model and thermodynamic model 5 2 1 comparison of co2 water solubility models to further evaluate the accuracy of the pso svr method in predicting the solubility of co2 in water the predicted results of this method were compared with those of widely used thermodynamic models duan and sun 2003 shabani and vilcáez 2017 the duan and sun 2003 model was developed from the multidimensional viri equation and the shabani and vilcáez 2017 model was developed from the peng and robinson equation peng and robinson 1976 fig 9 shows the comparison between the predicted results of the pso svr the duan and sun 2003 model the shabani and vilcáez 2017 model and the experimental data at 298 15 k king et al 1992 sabirzyanov et al 2003 wiebe and gaddy 1940 the predicted results of each model were significantly different with aard values of 3 81 4 43 and 3 82 respectively at the same time fig 9 shows that the degree of matching between the experimental data of sabirzyanov et al 2003 and the predicted results of the three models is very poor because the accuracy of the experimental data is not within the scope of this study it is not discussed and analysed here fig 10 shows the comparison between the predicted values of the three models and the experimental values at 323 15 k koschel et al 2006 sabirzyanov et al 2003 wiebe and gaddy 1939 yan et al 2013 compared with fig 9 the agreement between the predicted values of the model and the experimental values is very high at 323 15 k the aard between the experimental values and the predicted values of the pso svr algorithm the duan and sun 2003 model and the shabani and vilcáez 2017 model are 4 54 4 16 and 4 32 respectively the prediction error of this method is close to that of the thermodynamic model all of which are 5 therefore the prediction of gas water solubility during oil drilling and production can meet the calculation requirements 5 2 2 comparison of ch4 water solubility models for the accuracy analysis of the ch4 water solubility model the duan and mao 2006 and shabani and vilcáez 2017 models were also used for comparison with the pso svr model as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 at 298 15 k the prediction results of each model correlate strongly with the experimental data chapoy et al 2005 culberson et al 1950 culberson and mcketta 1951 duffy et al 1961 as shown in fig 11 the aard between the predicted values of the pso svr duan and mao 2006 and shabani and vilcáez 2017 models and the experimental values were 6 97 8 35 and 7 47 respectively compared with the thermodynamic theoretical model the prediction accuracy of the pso svr method was improved similarly the predicted value of the model at 375 15 k was compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 11 owing to the lack of experimental data the experimental data of o sullivan and smith 1970 and qin et al 2009 were selected and the agreement between the model predictions and experimental values is also very high the aard values are 2 19 2 42 and 2 50 respectively the prediction accuracy of the pso svr method at 298 15 and 375 15 k was the same as that of the thermodynamic theoretical model therefore the pso svr machine learning method can be used to predict the solubility of ch4 gas in water 6 conclusion the pso svr machine learning algorithm was used to predict the solubility of co2 and ch4 gases in water the training set comprised experimental data from literature to obtain optimal svr parameters this study analysed the solubility composition prediction set of co2 and ch4 gas in water at 298 15 to 373 15 k and 0 to 40 mpa as measured by the phase equilibrium experiment and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the solubility of co2 in water varies with temperature and pressure and is closely related to the phase state of co2 when the pressure was constant the solubility of co2 in the liquid state was greater than that in the supercritical state and when the temperature was constant the solubility of co2 in the supercritical state was greater than that in the gaseous state 2 the pso svr machine learning method used data from previous experimental studies to predict the measured data of the phase equilibrium experiments the prediction error of this method for the co2 water solubility model was 3 and the relative prediction error of ch4 water solubility was large but the average relative error was within 9 3 the comparison between the pso svr machine learning method and thermodynamic model combined with experimental data shows that the prediction errors of the two methods for the solubility of co2 in water are similar both of which are below 5 for the prediction of the solubility of ch4 in water the prediction accuracy of the pso svr model was the same as that of the high precision thermodynamic model considering the complexity and iterative nature of the thermodynamic model the pso svr machine learning algorithm is simpler and easier to operate therefore the pso svr method can be used to predict the water solubility of co2 and ch4 gases although the machine learning method can accurately predict the solubility of co2 and ch4 in water owing to the lack of experimental data more experimental measurements are required to establish a database to realise the engineering application of the machine learning algorithm credit authorship contribution statement baojiang sun conceptualization

1258,when assessing the risk from an underground environment that is contaminated by radioactive nuclides and hazardous chemicals and planning for remediation the contaminant plume distribution and the associated uncertainty from measured data should be estimated accurately while the release history of the contaminant plume may be unknown the extent of the plume caused by a known source and the associated uncertainty can be calculated inversely from the concentration data using a geostatistical method that accounts for the temporal correlation of its release history and groundwater flow modeling however the preceding geostatistical approaches have three drawbacks 1 no applications of the three dimensional plume estimation using concentration data from multiple depths in real situations 2 no constraints for the estimation of the plume distribution which can yield negative concentration and large uncertainties and 3 few applications to actual cases with multiple contaminants to address these problems the non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling was incorporated into the geostatistical method with groundwater flow modeling for contaminant plume estimation this method was then tested on groundwater contamination in the gloucester landfill in ontario canada using three dimensional contaminant transport model and concentration data from multiple depths the method was applied to three water soluble organic contaminants 1 4 dioxane tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the general agreement of the calculated plume distributions of the three contaminants with concentration data from 66 points in 1982 linear correlation coefficient of about 0 7 in particular the reproduced peak of 1 4 dioxane corresponding to the large disposal in 1978 was more accurate than the result of preceding minimum relative entropy based studies the same peak also appeared in the tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether distributions approximately within the range of the retardation factor derived from the fraction of organic carbon keywords contaminant plume estimation geostatistical inversion gibbs sampling groundwater contamination groundwater flow data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction over recent decades the underground environment in various areas worldwide has been contaminated by anthropogenic chemical radiological and microbiological substances there are numerous reports of contamination of groundwater by substances that migrate easily into groundwater examples include contamination by volatile organic compounds heavy metals and radionuclides such as 3h and 90sr in nuclear facilities including hanford washington usa sellafield united kingdom and chalk river canada oecd 2014 to assess the risk of groundwater contamination and support plans for remediating contaminated sites the hydrogeological structures and underlying physical processes that govern contaminant transport and the contaminant plume distribution must be correctly understood there are three main challenges when developing practical methods to estimate the extent and concentrations of actual contaminant plumes first the amount and location of measured concentration data may be limited because of temporal and budgetary constraints if there are enough data the plume distribution can be estimated by interpolation or extrapolation of the data using a spatial estimation method such as kriging to date several types of kriging such as ordinary and indicator kriging cokriging for multivariate data and spatio temporal kriging have been applied in various settings e g saby et al 2006 juang et al 2008 iskandar et al 2012 antunes and albuquerque 2013 boente et al 2017 dalla libera et al 2017 liang et al 2018 masoudi et al 2021 however these spatial estimation methods may not be suitable for accurately reproducing the plume distribution in groundwater because the monitoring wells are not always optimally sited to allow the delineation of plume structures formed by advection dispersion and sorption along with the groundwater flow shlomi and michalak 2007 therefore flow and transport modeling is indispensable for reproducing the plume distribution in a groundwater system second the contaminant source source location or release history for accidental contamination incidents is usually not identified and release history records are particularly rare for example when remediating nuclear sites in the past source locations have been detected by preliminary surveys or historical site assessments u s epa 2000 in drain lines sumps pipes and tanks and the transient release histories have been unknown in all cases oecd 2014 in such a situation either the plume cannot be estimated from only the flow and transport simulation or the uncertainty associated with the estimation will be large third risk assessments should include a quantitative evaluation of the uncertainty of the plume estimation the uncertainty of the estimated plume distribution can aid in determining the number and location of new measurement points snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 to overcome these issues a geostatistical approach that incorporated groundwater flow and transport modeling was proposed to estimate the distribution of a contaminant plume and the associated uncertainty shlomi and michalak 2007 this approach assumes that the source locations are known but the release history is unknown the plume distribution is calculated from the release history estimated by geostatistical inversion that accounts for its temporal covariance e g snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 if groundwater contamination is a result of multiple actions of several parties the reproduced release history can assist in determining how to divide the remediation cost among the responsible parties skaggs and kabala 1994 michalak 2002 michalak and kitanidis 2002 butera and tanda 2003 however there are three problems with the preceding geostatistical approaches 1 although actual contamination is three dimensional the preceding geostatistical approaches have so far been applied to estimate contamination and release histories in one dimension along depth profiles e g michalak and kitanidis 2003 or two dimensional aquifer modeled with one layer in which a homogeneous vertical contaminant distribution is assumed e g butera and tanda 2003 gyzl et al 2014 this problem is common to geostatistical and other stochastic approaches such as minimum relative entropy and backward probability tracking because most preceding studies e g colombo et al 2020 have generally been based on two dimensional aquifer models gomez hernandez and xu 2022 2 the concentrations that are produced from plume estimations can include negative values and large uncertainties because of a lack of constraints negative values frequently appear in practical applications where the problem is ill conditioned and has large errors while negative values can be avoided by transforming data with a power law box and cox 1964 e g snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 gyzl et al 2014 data transformation can change linear inversion problems to nonlinear and can yield highly asymmetric probability density functions for the estimated parameter values in the untransformed space that are unrealistic in some cases michalak and kitanidis 2003 alternative approaches include the markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods which use bayes rule to constrain the posterior probabilistic density function pdf michalak and kitanidis 2002 2003 2004a 2004b 2005 michalak 2008 michalak 2008 showed that an application of the non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling an mcmc method improved the accuracy and precision of the estimates of the arsenic release history in the north fork of the humboldt river the superiority of gibbs sampling over power transformation has been verified by a case study of the atmospheric inverse modeling of trace gas emissions miller et al 2014 such study demonstrated the great flexibility of the gibbs sampler in determining the shape of the posterior pdf and its computational efficiency so far however the gibbs sampling method has not been applied to estimate plumes in groundwater flow 3 although contamination is commonly caused by multiple contaminants most studies tackle only one contaminant such as 1 4 dioxane 14dne michalak and kitanidis 2002 and hexachlorocyclohexane gyzl et al 2014 michalak and kitanidis 2003 studies the release histories of two contaminants tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce but did not discuss the consistency between the results of the two contaminants therefore we are not sure if it is feasible to analyze multiple components in the same study to address these problems the non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling was incorporated into the geostatistical method with groundwater flow modeling for estimating the distribution of contaminant plume and the associated uncertainty the method was then tested on groundwater contamination in the gloucester landfill in ontario canada using three dimensional contaminant transport model and multiple concentration data in 1982 the method was applied to three water soluble organic contaminants 14dne tetrahydrofuran thf and diethyl ether dee the research flows from an estimation of the release history of a conservative tracer 14dne and its comparison with the known large disposal in 1978 reproduction of the estimated peak of 14dne by calculating the retardation factors of thf and dee and verifying the factors using fraction of organic carbon to three dimensional plume estimations of the three contaminants and their verification by comparing the obtained values with concentration data from 66 points 2 methods 2 1 geostatistical inversion the contaminant plumes were calculated with the inverse forward modeling method of shlomi and michalak 2007 which uses a known source location and a steady groundwater flow for the transport of contaminant materials the source intensity is estimated at a time t j j 1 m t using the measured concentration data z ℝ n 1 n dimensional real space at a sample location x i i 1 n and time t mes t m t assuming steady flow z can be related linearly to the release history s ℝ m t 1 as 1 z h s v where h ℝ n m t is the jacobian matrix and v ℝ n 1 is the measurement and model error this linear relationship is illustrated schematically in fig 1 a because the jacobian matrix can be defined in advance typically by simulating the groundwater flow the contaminant plume distribution can be calculated forward over an area by applying inverse analysis of the unknown release history s with limited data z and the linear system of eq 1 the release history can be estimated by geostatistical inversion methods as demonstrated earlier e g kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 kitanidis 1995 where s and v were assumed to be random vectors suppose that s is a multivariate gaussian distribution with a structural parameter θ 2 s x s β s ε ε n 0 q s θ where x s β s is the drift i e the expected value of s x s ℝ m t p s is a known matrix of basis functions β s ℝ p s 1 are p s unknown drift coefficients and q s θ ℝ m t m t is a covariance matrix of s on the basis of these settings the unknown release history is estimated using the following two steps in the first step the optimal θ is specified the posterior pdf p s z can be proportional to the product of the likelihood p z s and the prior pdf of p s as in bayes rule 3 p s z p z s p s assuming that v n 0 r where r ℝn n is an error covariance matrix of z p s and p z s can be expressed as 4 p s 1 2 π m t 2 q s 1 2 exp 1 2 s x s β s t q s 1 s x s β s 5 p z s 1 2 π n 2 r 1 2 exp 1 2 z h s t r 1 z h s the optimal structural parameter θ is estimated using a restricted maximum likelihood approach which maximize the following marginal likelihood l θ p z β s θ d β s p z p z s p s d s in which the unknown β s is eliminated by integrating this is equivalent to minimizing l θ the negative log of l θ 6 l θ 1 2 ln σ 1 2 ln x s t h t σ 1 h x s 1 2 z t ξ 1 z 7 σ h q s h t r 8 ξ σ 1 σ 1 h x s x s t h t σ 1 h x s 1 x s t h t σ 1 the optimal θ is calculated iteratively using the fisher scoring method kitanidis 1995 then the unknown release history s is estimated by maximizing the posterior pdf p s z the system to be solved is described as 9 σ h x s h x s t 0 λ s t m s h q s x s t where λ s ℝ m t n is a weight matrix and m s ℝ p s m t is a lagrange multiplier the form of eq 9 is equivalent to that of universal kriging or kriging with trend which is frequently used as a spatial estimator in geostatistics the best estimate and posterior covariance of s are described as follows 10 s λ s z 11 v s q s q s h t λ s t x s m s once s and v s are solved the estimated plume distribution over a study area z ℝ m 1 and its uncertainty v z can be solved 12 z h s 13 v z h v s h t where h ℝ n m is the jacobian matrix and m is the number of estimation points the steps for optimal estimation of the release histories and plume distributions are illustrated in fig 1 b in most cases the release history is unknown and the drift shape and or the covariance of s are difficult to identify and determine as in the present case study accordingly the simplest linear trend x s 1 t and a cubic generalized covariance q s t i t j θ θ t i t j 3 were used following kitanidis and lee 2014 this was done by assuming that the best s estimate is continuously differentiable and smooth that is equivalent to cubic spline interpolation dubrule 1984 while r contains measurement and model errors only the uncorrelated measurement error was considered simply as r σ r 2 i where σ r 2 is the variance of measurement errors and i ℝ n n is an identity matrix 2 2 non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling the non negativity release history can be achieved by constraining p s z to be non negative using gibbs sampling the sampling can be executed sequentially from the marginal one dimensional conditional distribution because the unconstrained pdf is explicitly derived by a product of multidimensional gaussian distributions as described in detail by michalak 2008 the marginal posterior pdf p s i z s can be expressed using bayes rule 14 p s i z s p z s i s p s i s h s i i 1 m t 15 h s i 1 1 2 0 s i 0 s i 0 s i 0 where s i means s t i and h s i is the heaviside function based on a multidimensional gaussian distribution of the likelihood of the measurements p z s in eq 5 the marginal likelihood p z s i s can be expressed as 16 p z s i s 1 2 π τ l exp 1 2 s i μ l τ l μ l a t b b t b τ l σ r 2 b t b 17 a j z j k 1 k i m t h jk s k b j h ji then the marginal prior pdf p s i s is defined as 18 p s i s 1 2 π τ p exp 1 2 s i μ p 2 τ p where μ p and τ p are obtained as the solution of the following system for s i 19 q s k i k i x s k i x s k i t 0 λ m q s k i i x s i t 20 μ p j 1 m t 1 λ j s j τ p q s ii j 1 m t 1 λ j q s ji l 1 p s x s il m l finally the marginal posterior pdf p s i z can be expressed by a truncated gaussian distribution 21 p s i z 1 2 πτ exp 1 2 s i μ 2 τ h s i 22 τ τ p τ l τ p τ l μ τ μ p τ p μ l τ l to summarize the above calculations the non negativity constrained release history contaminant plume and their uncertainty can be obtained as follows 1 set initial values as the unconstrained solution s cc 0 s uc t 1 s uc t m t t 2 draw a conditional realization s cc l 1 from s cc l at each time step by 23 s

step 2 until the calculation is converged l l s 4 calculate the best estimate and 95 confidence interval difference between the upper and lower limits of s cc and z cc from s cc l burn 1 s cc l s and z cc l burn 1 z cc l s the first l burn steps until the algorithm reaches convergence are discarded as a burn in period convergence is evaluated by tracking the mean values of likelihood and prior distribution as in michalak 2008 sampling from p s i z a truncated gaussian distribution was implemented based on johnson et al 1994 if the sampled value was calculated to be infinite because μ was too low negative and τ was narrow the result was set to zero 3 site description and physical model 3 1 background information about the gloucester landfill the gloucester landfill in ottawa ontario canada was a municipal and industrial landfill where hazardous wastes containing organic wastes were disposed of from 1969 to 1980 in a special waste compound swc along the western edge of the landfill that extended across approximately 3000 m2 the organic wastes were principally organic solvents e g chloroform carbon tetrachloride methanol acetone benzene and hexane soluble organic solvents such as 14dne caused widespread contamination in the aquifer above the top of the limestone bedrock at between 25 and 30 m deep fig 2 a e g jackson et al 1985 patterson et al 1985 jackson et al 1989 while there is very little information about the release history records show that approximately 1 ton of organic solvents 1 ton 1000 l aqueous solution was disposed of in may 1978 jackson et al 1985 the site sits on top of a complex sequence of quaternary fluvioglacial and coastal deposits fig 2 b that was classified into five units jackson et al 1985 in ascending order there were a limestone bedrock unit unit a a basal till unit up to 2 m in thickness unit b a thick confined outwash aquifer up to 25 m in thickness composed of interstratified and interfingering silts sands and poorly sorted gravels unit c a clayey silt and silt unit acting as an aquitard or a confining layer unit d and surface deposits of fine sands to gravels up to 10 m in thickness containing unconfined groundwater at several meters in depth unit e the contaminants laterally flowed down to the confined aquifer from the swc along the topography approximately from west to east fig 2 a macfarlane et al 1983 jackson et al 1985 of the contaminants in the waste there was particular concern about three compounds 14dne thf and dee because of their ability to migrate rapidly in aquifers lessage et al 1990 14dne exhibits the greatest mobility because of its low k ow and high solubility table 1 because 14dne can be regarded as a conservative tracer two previous studies estimated its release history three dimensionally using the minimum relative entropy mre approach woodbury et al 1998 and a geostatistical inversion with a non negativity constraint based on a metropolis hasting algorithm michalak and kitanidis 2002 however the estimations of plume distribution and the related uncertainty were out of scope of these studies here the plume distributions of the three contaminants and the associated uncertainties were quantified and assessed with comparing the estimated release history of 14dne with those from previous studies the estimation comprised three steps the first step was to estimate the release history of 14dne and compare the result with those from preceding studies that used the same flow and transport model next the retardation factors of thf and dee were specified by matching with the release peak of 14dne finally the three dimensional plume distributions and the associated uncertainties for the three contaminants were estimated 3 2 contaminant transport in groundwater contaminant transport is generally modeled using the advection dispersion equation for three dimensional contaminant transport in porous media with a steady uniform groundwater flow along the x axis the transport is described as 24 r f c t v x c x d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 λc where c is the concentration t is the time v x is the actual groundwater velocity d x d y and d z are the dispersion coefficients in the x longitudinal y transverse horizontal and z vertical directions respectively r f is the retardation factor and λ is the first order biochemical decay constant to facilitate comparison the contaminant transport model with a three dimensional analytical solution used in this study was the same as those used in the previous studies discussed earlier we assume that a contaminant is sourced in a rectangular area in the yz plane and transported from there in an aquifer the extent of aquifer is semi infinite infinite and finite with thickness b in the x y and z directions respectively the initial and boundary conditions of the solution are as follows c x y z 0 0 c 0 y z t s t y 0 y y 0 z 1 z z 2 0 otherwise 25 c y z t 0 c x z t 0 c z x y b t 0 c z x y 0 t 0 where z is the depth from the ground surface s t is the release history z 1 and z 2 are the top and bottom boundary depths of the source and y 0 is the half width of the source for a discretized time of the release history t 0 t t t is the measurement time the analytical solution of the jacobian matrix h is expressed as h x y z t t x z 2 z 1 4 b π d x 1 t t 1 5 exp x v x t t 2 4 d x t t λ r f

cos lπz b exp l 2 π 2 d z t t b 2 the values of the parameters in eq 26 used in the two previous studies discussed earlier derived from the analysis of reported data by jackson et al 1985 were used in this study table 2 the top boundary of the calculation domain was set to the ground surface because the water table the aquitard and the top of the bedrock were approximately parallel the top and bottom depths of the confined outwash aquifer were assigned to z 1 and z 2 respectively woodbury et al 1998 calculated the transport velocity v x on the basis of an analysis of the center of mass of the plume which was generally consistent with the reported values a borehole dilution survey in a single piezometer showed that the mean groundwater velocity in the target area was 0 07 m day while a pumping test showed it was 0 15 m day jackson et al 1985 1989 the dispersivity coefficients can be expressed as d x d y d z d m v x α x d m v x α y d m v x α z where d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient and α x α y and α z are the longitudinal transverse and vertical dispersivities respectively the values of the dispersivity coefficients were defined from the plume moments and by referring to classic theory domenico and schwartz 1990 and corresponded to the estimated values of α x α y 2 0 1 5 m by calibrating with the hydraulic head and concentration data gailey et al 1991 the λ value was set to 0 the start date of the special waste activities may 1 1969 was set to t 0 the release history was recovered until the beginning of the measurement period september 1982 or t 4870 days the following empirical relationship can be used to define r f 27 r f 1 ρ b k p ε k p f oc k oc where ρ b is the soil bulk density ε is the porosity 0 1 k p is the partitioning coefficient f oc is the fraction of organic carbon and k oc is the organic carbon partitioning coefficient related to the octanol water partitioning coefficient k ow derived from the study of the sorption of chlorinated benzenes for sediments with an f oc 0 001 schwarzenbach and westall 1981 28 log k oc 0 72 log k ow 0 49 the r f values were derived as shown in table 3 by setting ρ b 2000 kg m3 and ε 0 35 based on the values of 0 3 to 0 35 for the outwash aquifer jackson et al 1985 and using the k ow values of each contaminant table 2 the resulting values were the same as those of jackson et al 1985 because the r f of 14dne was close to 1 regardless of f oc the sorption of 14dne was not considered as in earlier studies woodbury et al 1998 michalak and kitanidis 2002 in contrast the r f values of thf and dee depended on f oc therefore we calculated the value of r f by reproducing the estimated peak of 14dne and verified it against a value range derived from the f oc 3 3 measurement and estimation of the contaminant plume we used the concentration data collected by jackson et al 1985 at that time the organic compounds in the groundwater were measured using bundle type multilevel samplers cherry et al 1983 with screens set at depth intervals of approximately 1 m nos 14 17 21 34 37 38 39 47 and 54 fig 2 or 4 m nos 12 18 33 40 52 and 56 along 15 observation wells the organic compounds in the groundwater samples were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry finnigan 4000 gc ms system from all the data 176 points measured from september to december 1982 were selected the blank was treated as zero as in jackson et al 1985 then the 1 m interval data were adjusted to the 4 m interval data by averaging the original data over each 4 m depth range to account for the variation in the sample location distributions and measurement time intervals the distributions of the 66 data points that resulted are shown in fig 3 the averaging did not significantly change the original depth profile trend fig 4 the measured concentration data were shown by the least significant digit of 0 1 μg l but jackson et al 1985 did not provide information about data precision assuming that this digit included uncertainty and the measurement errors were normally distributed the error variance was assigned by σ r 2 0 25 μg l 2 to correspond with the 95 confidence interval of 1 μg l michalak 2008 meanwhile the detection limit of 14dne using the conventional purge and trap coupled with gc ms was reported to range from 3 to 20 μg l because of the poor purge efficiency issacson et al 2006 mohr 2001 draper et al 2000 therefore we have also considered the large measurement error for 14dne in our discussion i e σ r 3 0 μg l assuming the detection limit was 10 μg l and this limit was equal to three times σ r loconto 2001 the time interval was one day the gibbs sampling was set to 5000 realizations and the first 100 realizations were regarded as the burn in period the release histories and plume distributions were calculated for the rectangular area covering x 0 300 m y 150 150 m as shown in fig 2 a 4 results 4 1 release history of 14dne for the recovered release history of 14dne the value of θ used in the cubic covariance was 1 3 10 3 mg2 l2 day3 the resulting release histories without a non negativity constraint and those constrained using the gibbs sampling are compared in fig 5 a and b it is worth noting that the peak corresponding to the large disposal in may 1978 was clearly reproduced by the non negativity constraint the peak concentration was much lower than the solubility limit 8 105 mg l yalkowsky et al 2010 it is also worth noting that the 95 confidence interval was almost equivalent to the best estimate and supports the accuracy of the inversion result in contrast the best estimate without the non negativity constraint contained unrealistic negative concentrations in addition the 95 confidence interval was much larger than the best estimate by a factor of two orders e g the peak concentration of the best estimate was 0 4 mg l and had a confidential interval of approximately 206 mg l which meant that the uncertainty was very large and the accuracy of estimates was low comparison of the recovered release histories showed that the proposed method was superior to the mre approach of woodbury et al 1998 that assumed gaussian or uniform prior distributions fig 5 c when assuming the gaussian prior the latter peak in the two estimated peaks corresponded to the large disposal in 1978 woodbury et al 1998 however the resulting release histories were strongly dependent on the prior distribution in contrast we were able to reproduce the large spill without any prior information which is an advantage of geostatistical inversion michalak and kitanidis 2002 the results presented in this paper differed from those presented by michalak and kitanidis 2002 even though the geostatistical inversion approach was used this is mainly because they also used the data from 1983 onwards the difference in measurement data results in a different setting of the covariance structure θ and the error σ r the groundwater flow and contaminant conditions may be changed after 1983 by the gtc purge well test in october 1983 jackson et al 1985 soil remediation from 1987 to 1989 and contaminant removals from the deep and shallow groundwater plume after april 1992 franz environmental inc 2007 therefore calculations using the data after 1983 under steady flow conditions can be considered misleading in addition michalak and kitanidis 2002 constrained the non negativity with the metropolis hasting algorithm an mcmc method the gibbs sampling is considered superior to the metoropolis hasting algorithm the random walk procedure containing the acceptance test because of its computational efficiency and shorter computation time if the posterior pdf for each time can be calculated using eq 21 in advance as in this study the constrained solution can be obtained efficiently using the gibbs sampling previously residual variance values of 22 5 μg l 2 woodbury et al 1998 and 12 3 μg l 2 michalak and kitanidis 2002 were reported only a rough comparison is possible because of the difference in the used data however the residual variance of our result was 1 07 μg l 2 which was approximately on the same scale as that of the error setting σ r 2 0 25 μg l 2 4 2 verification of the retardation factors of thf and dee the retardation factors of thf and dee estimated by accounting for the fraction of organic carbon table 2 were verified using the reproduced release peak of 14dne the release histories of thf and dee fig 6 were reproduced using the optimal θ of 1 8 10 3 and 2 5 10 3 mg2 l2 day3 the peaks of thf 25 mg l and dee 77 mg l are much lower than solubility limits of thf 1 0 106 mg l wishart et al 2007 and dee 6 9 104 mg l icsc 2017 the retardation factors were determined as 1 75 for thf and 1 8 for dee to reproduce the peak of 14dne caused by the large disposal in 1978 fig 5 b under the following settings from 1 1 to 1 4 for thf and from 1 3 to 1 8 for dee table 3 this comparison supports the suitability of the parameter set for dee but indicates that the retardation factor of thf was slightly overestimated this may reflect insufficient measurement locations which might have decreased the accuracy of the inversion result or co metabolic biodegradation of 14dne with thf kohlweyer et al 2000 vainberg et al 2006 sun et al 2011 which may have affected the shapes and concentrations of the 14dne and thf plumes 4 3 contaminant plume distributions of the three contaminants the plume distributions of the three contaminants were calculated fig 7 a from the release histories estimated using the non negativity constraint the accuracy of the estimations was checked using scatterplots of the absolute error between the calculated and measured concentrations fig 7 b the mean absolute error mae and the linear correlation coefficient r values of these concentrations table 4 with the non negativity constraint the maes of all the contaminants decreased considerably with decreases of 46 67 and 59 for 14dne thf and dee respectively and the r values increased to between 0 60 and 0 77 these results indicate a high reproduction accuracy and demonstrate the effectiveness of the non negativity constraint in addition the low uncertainties of these distributions can be confirmed from the 95 confidence intervals which were one or more orders lower than the best estimates common to the three contaminants fig 7 a the uncertainties for the three contaminants were relatively high around the middle of the study area probably because of the relatively high concentrations in that area associated with the large peak after 1978 and the sparse density of the measurement points the uncertainty distribution can be used to determine the number and location of additional measurements the disagreement in the measurements was probably caused by using the analytical solution for contaminant transport the absolute errors between the calculated and measured concentrations were large at around 1 10 3 mg l for thf and dee fig 7 b these data were collected from shallow depth z 4 to 12 m at sampling point no 34 fig 2 a which is located in the stratified low permeability zone of the confined aquifer unit c shown in fig 2 b such unit dependent differences in permeability were not considered in the analytical solution and so may have caused the overestimation this is considered in more detail in the discussion 5 discussion 5 1 effect of averaging the measurement concentrations as described earlier the original concentration data at the 176 points were averaged over a 4 m depth range to calculate the release history using the measured concentrations at 66 points to examine whether the averaging affected the calculation accuracy the release history of 14dne was calculated using the original data with the nonnegativity constraint the value of θ in the cubic covariance was 1 2 10 3 mg2 l2 day3 two release histories were estimated using the original and averaged data fig 8 while the release history based on the original data had a slightly larger peak and more uncertainty than the one based on the averaged data the distributions of the release histories were similar the residual variance of the result was 1 55 μg l 2 which is similar to that using averaged data 1 07 μg l 2 consequently this confirmed that the averaging had little effect on the release history and plume distribution estimations 5 2 effect of the large measurement error the effect of the measurement error caused by the poor purge efficiency was examined using a σ r value of 3 0 μg l for 14dne the value of θ in the cubic covariance was 4 9 10 2 mg2 l2 day3 the estimated release history with a large measurement error showed a wider peak concentration than the release history with a small measurement error fig 9 a but the plume distributions were similar regardless of the measurement error fig 9 b in which mae was 2 0 10 2 μg l and r was 0 76 the maximum uncertainty of the estimated plume distribution with the large measurement error was up to 1 9 times greater than that with the small measurement error however the high uncertainty area the middle of the study area was the same regardless of the measurement error and corresponding to a large release peak and a lack of measurement points 5 3 verification of the release histories and plume distributions the release histories and plume distributions of the three contaminants are examined in detail below a vertical cross section at y 0 m in the e w direction along the x axis was drawn for the three contaminants and overlain with the original not averaged measured concentrations fig 10 the calculated plume distributions were generally consistent with the measured concentrations any disagreements between the calculated and measured concentrations may have been caused by heterogeneity of the aquifer permeability the geological columnar section had more geological units and suggested interstratified low permeability zones in the aquifer unit c jackson et al 1985 because of this low permeability the measured concentrations were remarkably low in the area e g low thf and dee zones extended through the aquifer at an elevation of around 85 m in addition the groundwater flow direction was presumed to be heterogenous depending on the geological structure however a simple transport model with a one direction flow was adopted in this study to compare our results with those from the studies of woodbury et al 1998 and michalak and kitanidis 2002 the jacobian matrix in eqs 1 or 12 expresses the sensitivity of the concentration at each point and each time this can be calculated numerically by running a flow and transport model with a release of a unit concentration pulse therefore accurate three dimensional groundwater flow models that account for detailed geological structures are needed to improve the estimation accuracy instead of the analytical solution differences may also occur by simplifying the contaminant transport from the source swc to the aquifer unit c although the swc was at a depth of about 10 m we assumed that the source was uniformly distributed at the edge of the aquifer in the analytical solution this assumption originated from the fact that the aquitard unit d under the swc was locally discontinuous because of heterogenous lithofacies or excavation for waste disposal jackson et al 1985 this implies that most contaminants may have moved rapidly through the discontinuities in the aquitard thereby causing the peak after the large disposal in 1978 meanwhile the estimated release histories of thf and dee showed second peaks in 1981 fig 6 because of the high concentrations measured in the upper part of the aquifer at around e l 100 m near the swc although other large spills may have occurred in 1980 the estimated second peak may be considered a result of the slow transport of contaminants through the aquitard assuming that the hydraulic gradient i h was 0 002 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard k d was 7 9 10 6 m s and the porosity ρ d was 0 4 following jackson et al 1985 and the thickness of the aquitard h was 1 5 m the transport time calculated as h r f i h k d ρ d in the aquitard was estimated as 769 days for thf and 791 days for dee the transport time in the aquitard was approximately consistent with the time lags between the first and second peaks of the estimated release history which was 880 days for thf and 890 days for dee to improve the accuracy of the estimations the contaminant release from the swc needs to be modeled differences may also occur because of seasonal change in rainfall after the large disposal in may 1978 rainy seasons with rainfall amounting to approximately 100 mm month were recorded almost every year our steady flow assumption may be valid for long term contaminant transport therefore the effects of rainfall infiltration and seasonal changes in groundwater flow fields on the release condition settings amount and flow direction of contaminants from a source needs to be confirmed 6 conclusions the aim of this study was to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of a geostatistical approach that incorporated groundwater flow modeling to estimate the contaminant plume when the release history is unknown the approach was tested on groundwater contamination in the gloucester landfill the approach was effective as the accuracy of the estimation was improved by applying a non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling with the geostatistical approach and a non negativity constraint the three dimensional plume distributions were produced with adequate accuracy for the three organic solvents 14dne thf and dee with linear correlation coefficients between the estimation and measurement of 0 60 to 0 77 for the concentration data from multiple depths in addition the reconstructed release peak for 14dne that corresponded to the large disposal in 1978 was more correct than for the preceding studies without any prior information of the release history the reconstructed release histories for thf and dee also indicated the same peaks with retardation factors that were generally consistent with the estimation using fraction of organic carbon this study may be the first application to estimate three dimensional plume distributions and the associated uncertainties when the release history is unknown targeting multiple contaminants the proposed method can be applied widely to contaminated groundwater fields to increase the accuracy of the estimation the modeling of the groundwater flow and the hydrogeologic structure should be improved the accuracy of the predictions of future plume transport could be improved with precise estimation of the hydrogeological structure which would be useful when planning for remediation the hydrogeological structure could be estimated from transient measurements of groundwater concentrations for example the hydraulic parameters used in the analytical solution could be calibrated by sensitivity analysis with an objective function such as the reproducibility of measurement the ensemble kalman filter is one of the potential methods which can be also applied to a joint estimation of contaminant source and hydraulic conductivity e g chen et al 2021 geostatistic based hydraulic tomography using well hydraulic test data could be used to help account for heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity from limited data e g lee and kitanidis 2014 the estimations in this study could also be improved by considering spatial correlation of measurement data shlomi and michalak 2007 in addition to the temporal correlation of release history however the steady flow assumptions may not be valid if the transient change of groundwater flow increases e g by pumping wells in this case our method should be repeated with temporal measurement data to

1258,when assessing the risk from an underground environment that is contaminated by radioactive nuclides and hazardous chemicals and planning for remediation the contaminant plume distribution and the associated uncertainty from measured data should be estimated accurately while the release history of the contaminant plume may be unknown the extent of the plume caused by a known source and the associated uncertainty can be calculated inversely from the concentration data using a geostatistical method that accounts for the temporal correlation of its release history and groundwater flow modeling however the preceding geostatistical approaches have three drawbacks 1 no applications of the three dimensional plume estimation using concentration data from multiple depths in real situations 2 no constraints for the estimation of the plume distribution which can yield negative concentration and large uncertainties and 3 few applications to actual cases with multiple contaminants to address these problems the non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling was incorporated into the geostatistical method with groundwater flow modeling for contaminant plume estimation this method was then tested on groundwater contamination in the gloucester landfill in ontario canada using three dimensional contaminant transport model and concentration data from multiple depths the method was applied to three water soluble organic contaminants 1 4 dioxane tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the general agreement of the calculated plume distributions of the three contaminants with concentration data from 66 points in 1982 linear correlation coefficient of about 0 7 in particular the reproduced peak of 1 4 dioxane corresponding to the large disposal in 1978 was more accurate than the result of preceding minimum relative entropy based studies the same peak also appeared in the tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether distributions approximately within the range of the retardation factor derived from the fraction of organic carbon keywords contaminant plume estimation geostatistical inversion gibbs sampling groundwater contamination groundwater flow data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction over recent decades the underground environment in various areas worldwide has been contaminated by anthropogenic chemical radiological and microbiological substances there are numerous reports of contamination of groundwater by substances that migrate easily into groundwater examples include contamination by volatile organic compounds heavy metals and radionuclides such as 3h and 90sr in nuclear facilities including hanford washington usa sellafield united kingdom and chalk river canada oecd 2014 to assess the risk of groundwater contamination and support plans for remediating contaminated sites the hydrogeological structures and underlying physical processes that govern contaminant transport and the contaminant plume distribution must be correctly understood there are three main challenges when developing practical methods to estimate the extent and concentrations of actual contaminant plumes first the amount and location of measured concentration data may be limited because of temporal and budgetary constraints if there are enough data the plume distribution can be estimated by interpolation or extrapolation of the data using a spatial estimation method such as kriging to date several types of kriging such as ordinary and indicator kriging cokriging for multivariate data and spatio temporal kriging have been applied in various settings e g saby et al 2006 juang et al 2008 iskandar et al 2012 antunes and albuquerque 2013 boente et al 2017 dalla libera et al 2017 liang et al 2018 masoudi et al 2021 however these spatial estimation methods may not be suitable for accurately reproducing the plume distribution in groundwater because the monitoring wells are not always optimally sited to allow the delineation of plume structures formed by advection dispersion and sorption along with the groundwater flow shlomi and michalak 2007 therefore flow and transport modeling is indispensable for reproducing the plume distribution in a groundwater system second the contaminant source source location or release history for accidental contamination incidents is usually not identified and release history records are particularly rare for example when remediating nuclear sites in the past source locations have been detected by preliminary surveys or historical site assessments u s epa 2000 in drain lines sumps pipes and tanks and the transient release histories have been unknown in all cases oecd 2014 in such a situation either the plume cannot be estimated from only the flow and transport simulation or the uncertainty associated with the estimation will be large third risk assessments should include a quantitative evaluation of the uncertainty of the plume estimation the uncertainty of the estimated plume distribution can aid in determining the number and location of new measurement points snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 to overcome these issues a geostatistical approach that incorporated groundwater flow and transport modeling was proposed to estimate the distribution of a contaminant plume and the associated uncertainty shlomi and michalak 2007 this approach assumes that the source locations are known but the release history is unknown the plume distribution is calculated from the release history estimated by geostatistical inversion that accounts for its temporal covariance e g snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 if groundwater contamination is a result of multiple actions of several parties the reproduced release history can assist in determining how to divide the remediation cost among the responsible parties skaggs and kabala 1994 michalak 2002 michalak and kitanidis 2002 butera and tanda 2003 however there are three problems with the preceding geostatistical approaches 1 although actual contamination is three dimensional the preceding geostatistical approaches have so far been applied to estimate contamination and release histories in one dimension along depth profiles e g michalak and kitanidis 2003 or two dimensional aquifer modeled with one layer in which a homogeneous vertical contaminant distribution is assumed e g butera and tanda 2003 gyzl et al 2014 this problem is common to geostatistical and other stochastic approaches such as minimum relative entropy and backward probability tracking because most preceding studies e g colombo et al 2020 have generally been based on two dimensional aquifer models gomez hernandez and xu 2022 2 the concentrations that are produced from plume estimations can include negative values and large uncertainties because of a lack of constraints negative values frequently appear in practical applications where the problem is ill conditioned and has large errors while negative values can be avoided by transforming data with a power law box and cox 1964 e g snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 gyzl et al 2014 data transformation can change linear inversion problems to nonlinear and can yield highly asymmetric probability density functions for the estimated parameter values in the untransformed space that are unrealistic in some cases michalak and kitanidis 2003 alternative approaches include the markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods which use bayes rule to constrain the posterior probabilistic density function pdf michalak and kitanidis 2002 2003 2004a 2004b 2005 michalak 2008 michalak 2008 showed that an application of the non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling an mcmc method improved the accuracy and precision of the estimates of the arsenic release history in the north fork of the humboldt river the superiority of gibbs sampling over power transformation has been verified by a case study of the atmospheric inverse modeling of trace gas emissions miller et al 2014 such study demonstrated the great flexibility of the gibbs sampler in determining the shape of the posterior pdf and its computational efficiency so far however the gibbs sampling method has not been applied to estimate plumes in groundwater flow 3 although contamination is commonly caused by multiple contaminants most studies tackle only one contaminant such as 1 4 dioxane 14dne michalak and kitanidis 2002 and hexachlorocyclohexane gyzl et al 2014 michalak and kitanidis 2003 studies the release histories of two contaminants tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce but did not discuss the consistency between the results of the two contaminants therefore we are not sure if it is feasible to analyze multiple components in the same study to address these problems the non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling was incorporated into the geostatistical method with groundwater flow modeling for estimating the distribution of contaminant plume and the associated uncertainty the method was then tested on groundwater contamination in the gloucester landfill in ontario canada using three dimensional contaminant transport model and multiple concentration data in 1982 the method was applied to three water soluble organic contaminants 14dne tetrahydrofuran thf and diethyl ether dee the research flows from an estimation of the release history of a conservative tracer 14dne and its comparison with the known large disposal in 1978 reproduction of the estimated peak of 14dne by calculating the retardation factors of thf and dee and verifying the factors using fraction of organic carbon to three dimensional plume estimations of the three contaminants and their verification by comparing the obtained values with concentration data from 66 points 2 methods 2 1 geostatistical inversion the contaminant plumes were calculated with the inverse forward modeling method of shlomi and michalak 2007 which uses a known source location and a steady groundwater flow for the transport of contaminant materials the source intensity is estimated at a time t j j 1 m t using the measured concentration data z ℝ n 1 n dimensional real space at a sample location x i i 1 n and time t mes t m t assuming steady flow z can be related linearly to the release history s ℝ m t 1 as 1 z h s v where h ℝ n m t is the jacobian matrix and v ℝ n 1 is the measurement and model error this linear relationship is illustrated schematically in fig 1 a because the jacobian matrix can be defined in advance typically by simulating the groundwater flow the contaminant plume distribution can be calculated forward over an area by applying inverse analysis of the unknown release history s with limited data z and the linear system of eq 1 the release history can be estimated by geostatistical inversion methods as demonstrated earlier e g kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 kitanidis 1995 where s and v were assumed to be random vectors suppose that s is a multivariate gaussian distribution with a structural parameter θ 2 s x s β s ε ε n 0 q s θ where x s β s is the drift i e the expected value of s x s ℝ m t p s is a known matrix of basis functions β s ℝ p s 1 are p s unknown drift coefficients and q s θ ℝ m t m t is a covariance matrix of s on the basis of these settings the unknown release history is estimated using the following two steps in the first step the optimal θ is specified the posterior pdf p s z can be proportional to the product of the likelihood p z s and the prior pdf of p s as in bayes rule 3 p s z p z s p s assuming that v n 0 r where r ℝn n is an error covariance matrix of z p s and p z s can be expressed as 4 p s 1 2 π m t 2 q s 1 2 exp 1 2 s x s β s t q s 1 s x s β s 5 p z s 1 2 π n 2 r 1 2 exp 1 2 z h s t r 1 z h s the optimal structural parameter θ is estimated using a restricted maximum likelihood approach which maximize the following marginal likelihood l θ p z β s θ d β s p z p z s p s d s in which the unknown β s is eliminated by integrating this is equivalent to minimizing l θ the negative log of l θ 6 l θ 1 2 ln σ 1 2 ln x s t h t σ 1 h x s 1 2 z t ξ 1 z 7 σ h q s h t r 8 ξ σ 1 σ 1 h x s x s t h t σ 1 h x s 1 x s t h t σ 1 the optimal θ is calculated iteratively using the fisher scoring method kitanidis 1995 then the unknown release history s is estimated by maximizing the posterior pdf p s z the system to be solved is described as 9 σ h x s h x s t 0 λ s t m s h q s x s t where λ s ℝ m t n is a weight matrix and m s ℝ p s m t is a lagrange multiplier the form of eq 9 is equivalent to that of universal kriging or kriging with trend which is frequently used as a spatial estimator in geostatistics the best estimate and posterior covariance of s are described as follows 10 s λ s z 11 v s q s q s h t λ s t x s m s once s and v s are solved the estimated plume distribution over a study area z ℝ m 1 and its uncertainty v z can be solved 12 z h s 13 v z h v s h t where h ℝ n m is the jacobian matrix and m is the number of estimation points the steps for optimal estimation of the release histories and plume distributions are illustrated in fig 1 b in most cases the release history is unknown and the drift shape and or the covariance of s are difficult to identify and determine as in the present case study accordingly the simplest linear trend x s 1 t and a cubic generalized covariance q s t i t j θ θ t i t j 3 were used following kitanidis and lee 2014 this was done by assuming that the best s estimate is continuously differentiable and smooth that is equivalent to cubic spline interpolation dubrule 1984 while r contains measurement and model errors only the uncorrelated measurement error was considered simply as r σ r 2 i where σ r 2 is the variance of measurement errors and i ℝ n n is an identity matrix 2 2 non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling the non negativity release history can be achieved by constraining p s z to be non negative using gibbs sampling the sampling can be executed sequentially from the marginal one dimensional conditional distribution because the unconstrained pdf is explicitly derived by a product of multidimensional gaussian distributions as described in detail by michalak 2008 the marginal posterior pdf p s i z s can be expressed using bayes rule 14 p s i z s p z s i s p s i s h s i i 1 m t 15 h s i 1 1 2 0 s i 0 s i 0 s i 0 where s i means s t i and h s i is the heaviside function based on a multidimensional gaussian distribution of the likelihood of the measurements p z s in eq 5 the marginal likelihood p z s i s can be expressed as 16 p z s i s 1 2 π τ l exp 1 2 s i μ l τ l μ l a t b b t b τ l σ r 2 b t b 17 a j z j k 1 k i m t h jk s k b j h ji then the marginal prior pdf p s i s is defined as 18 p s i s 1 2 π τ p exp 1 2 s i μ p 2 τ p where μ p and τ p are obtained as the solution of the following system for s i 19 q s k i k i x s k i x s k i t 0 λ m q s k i i x s i t 20 μ p j 1 m t 1 λ j s j τ p q s ii j 1 m t 1 λ j q s ji l 1 p s x s il m l finally the marginal posterior pdf p s i z can be expressed by a truncated gaussian distribution 21 p s i z 1 2 πτ exp 1 2 s i μ 2 τ h s i 22 τ τ p τ l τ p τ l μ τ μ p τ p μ l τ l to summarize the above calculations the non negativity constrained release history contaminant plume and their uncertainty can be obtained as follows 1 set initial values as the unconstrained solution s cc 0 s uc t 1 s uc t m t t 2 draw a conditional realization s cc l 1 from s cc l at each time step by 23 s

distribution as in michalak 2008 sampling from p s i z a truncated gaussian distribution was implemented based on johnson et al 1994 if the sampled value was calculated to be infinite because μ was too low negative and τ was narrow the result was set to zero 3 site description and physical model 3 1 background information about the gloucester landfill the gloucester landfill in ottawa ontario canada was a municipal and industrial landfill where hazardous wastes containing organic wastes were disposed of from 1969 to 1980 in a special waste compound swc along the western edge of the landfill that extended across approximately 3000 m2 the organic wastes were principally organic solvents e g chloroform carbon tetrachloride methanol acetone benzene and hexane soluble organic solvents such as 14dne caused widespread contamination in the aquifer above the top of the limestone bedrock at between 25 and 30 m deep fig 2 a e g jackson et al 1985 patterson et al 1985 jackson et al 1989 while there is very little information about the release history records show that approximately 1 ton of organic solvents 1 ton 1000 l aqueous solution was disposed of in may 1978 jackson et al 1985 the site sits on top of a complex sequence of quaternary fluvioglacial and coastal deposits fig 2 b that was classified into five units jackson et al 1985 in ascending order there were a limestone bedrock unit unit a a basal till unit up to 2 m in thickness unit b a thick confined outwash aquifer up to 25 m in thickness composed of interstratified and interfingering silts sands and poorly sorted gravels unit c a clayey silt and silt unit acting as an aquitard or a confining layer unit d and surface deposits of fine sands to gravels up to 10 m in thickness containing unconfined groundwater at several meters in depth unit e the contaminants laterally flowed down to the confined aquifer from the swc along the topography approximately from west to east fig 2 a macfarlane et al 1983 jackson et al 1985 of the contaminants in the waste there was particular concern about three compounds 14dne thf and dee because of their ability to migrate rapidly in aquifers lessage et al 1990 14dne exhibits the greatest mobility because of its low k ow and high solubility table 1 because 14dne can be regarded as a conservative tracer two previous studies estimated its release history three dimensionally using the minimum relative entropy mre approach woodbury et al 1998 and a geostatistical inversion with a non negativity constraint based on a metropolis hasting algorithm michalak and kitanidis 2002 however the estimations of plume distribution and the related uncertainty were out of scope of these studies here the plume distributions of the three contaminants and the associated uncertainties were quantified and assessed with comparing the estimated release history of 14dne with those from previous studies the estimation comprised three steps the first step was to estimate the release history of 14dne and compare the result with those from preceding studies that used the same flow and transport model next the retardation factors of thf and dee were specified by matching with the release peak of 14dne finally the three dimensional plume distributions and the associated uncertainties for the three contaminants were estimated 3 2 contaminant transport in groundwater contaminant transport is generally modeled using the advection dispersion equation for three dimensional contaminant transport in porous media with a steady uniform groundwater flow along the x axis the transport is described as 24 r f c t v x c x d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 λc where c is the concentration t is the time v x is the actual groundwater velocity d x d y and d z are the dispersion coefficients in the x longitudinal y transverse horizontal and z vertical directions respectively r f is the retardation factor and λ is the first order biochemical decay constant to facilitate comparison the contaminant transport model with a three dimensional analytical solution used in this study was the same as those used in the previous studies discussed earlier we assume that a contaminant is sourced in a rectangular area in the yz plane and transported from there in an aquifer the extent of aquifer is semi infinite infinite and finite with thickness b in the x y and z directions respectively the initial and boundary conditions of the solution are as follows c x y z 0 0 c 0 y z t s t y 0 y y 0 z 1 z z 2 0 otherwise 25 c y z t 0 c x z t 0 c z x y b t 0 c z x y 0 t 0 where z is the depth from the ground surface s t is the release history z 1 and z 2 are the top and bottom boundary depths of the source and y 0 is the half width of the source for a discretized time of the release history t 0 t t t is the measurement time the analytical solution of the jacobian matrix h is expressed as h x y z t t x z 2 z 1 4 b π d x 1 t t 1 5 exp x v x t t 2 4 d x t t λ r f

cos lπz b exp l 2 π 2 d z t t b 2 the values of the parameters in eq 26 used in the two previous studies discussed earlier derived from the analysis of reported data by jackson et al 1985 were used in this study table 2 the top boundary of the calculation domain was set to the ground surface because the water table the aquitard and the top of the bedrock were approximately parallel the top and bottom depths of the confined outwash aquifer were assigned to z 1 and z 2 respectively woodbury et al 1998 calculated the transport velocity v x on the basis of an analysis of the center of mass of the plume which was generally consistent with the reported values a borehole dilution survey in a single piezometer showed that the mean groundwater velocity in the target area was 0 07 m day while a pumping test showed it was 0 15 m day jackson et al 1985 1989 the dispersivity coefficients can be expressed as d x d y d z d m v x α x d m v x α y d m v x α z where d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient and α x α y and α z are the longitudinal transverse and vertical dispersivities respectively the values of the dispersivity coefficients were defined from the plume moments and by referring to classic theory domenico and schwartz 1990 and corresponded to the estimated values of α x α y 2 0 1 5 m by calibrating with the hydraulic head and concentration data gailey et al 1991 the λ value was set to 0 the start date of the special waste activities may 1 1969 was set to t 0 the release history was recovered until the beginning of the measurement period september 1982 or t 4870 days the following empirical relationship can be used to define r f 27 r f 1 ρ b k p ε k p f oc k oc where ρ b is the soil bulk density ε is the porosity 0 1 k p is the partitioning coefficient f oc is the fraction of organic carbon and k oc is the organic carbon partitioning coefficient related to the octanol water partitioning coefficient k ow derived from the study of the sorption of chlorinated benzenes for sediments with an f oc 0 001 schwarzenbach and westall 1981 28 log k oc 0 72 log k ow 0 49 the r f values were derived as shown in table 3 by setting ρ b 2000 kg m3 and ε 0 35 based on the values of 0 3 to 0 35 for the outwash aquifer jackson et al 1985 and using the k ow values of each contaminant table 2 the resulting values were the same as those of jackson et al 1985 because the r f of 14dne was close to 1 regardless of f oc the sorption of 14dne was not considered as in earlier studies woodbury et al 1998 michalak and kitanidis 2002 in contrast the r f values of thf and dee depended on f oc therefore we calculated the value of r f by reproducing the estimated peak of 14dne and verified it against a value range derived from the f oc 3 3 measurement and estimation of the contaminant plume we used the concentration data collected by jackson et al 1985 at that time the organic compounds in the groundwater were measured using bundle type multilevel samplers cherry et al 1983 with screens set at depth intervals of approximately 1 m nos 14 17 21 34 37 38 39 47 and 54 fig 2 or 4 m nos 12 18 33 40 52 and 56 along 15 observation wells the organic compounds in the groundwater samples were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry finnigan 4000 gc ms system from all the data 176 points measured from september to december 1982 were selected the blank was treated as zero as in jackson et al 1985 then the 1 m interval data were adjusted to the 4 m interval data by averaging the original data over each 4 m depth range to account for the variation in the sample location distributions and measurement time intervals the distributions of the 66 data points that resulted are shown in fig 3 the averaging did not significantly change the original depth profile trend fig 4 the measured concentration data were shown by the least significant digit of 0 1 μg l but jackson et al 1985 did not provide information about data precision assuming that this digit included uncertainty and the measurement errors were normally distributed the error variance was assigned by σ r 2 0 25 μg l 2 to correspond with the 95 confidence interval of 1 μg l michalak 2008 meanwhile the detection limit of 14dne using the conventional purge and trap coupled with gc ms was reported to range from 3 to 20 μg l because of the poor purge efficiency issacson et al 2006 mohr 2001 draper et al 2000 therefore we have also considered the large measurement error for 14dne in our discussion i e σ r 3 0 μg l assuming the detection limit was 10 μg l and this limit was equal to three times σ r loconto 2001 the time interval was one day the gibbs sampling was set to 5000 realizations and the first 100 realizations were regarded as the burn in period the release histories and plume distributions were calculated for the rectangular area covering x 0 300 m y 150 150 m as shown in fig 2 a 4 results 4 1 release history of 14dne for the recovered release history of 14dne the value of θ used in the cubic covariance was 1 3 10 3 mg2 l2 day3 the resulting release histories without a non negativity constraint and those constrained using the gibbs sampling are compared in fig 5 a and b it is worth noting that the peak corresponding to the large disposal in may 1978 was clearly reproduced by the non negativity constraint the peak concentration was much lower than the solubility limit 8 105 mg l yalkowsky et al 2010 it is also worth noting that the 95 confidence interval was almost equivalent to the best estimate and supports the accuracy of the inversion result in contrast the best estimate without the non negativity constraint contained unrealistic negative concentrations in addition the 95 confidence interval was much larger than the best estimate by a factor of two orders e g the peak concentration of the best estimate was 0 4 mg l and had a confidential interval of approximately 206 mg l which meant that the uncertainty was very large and the accuracy of estimates was low comparison of the recovered release histories showed that the proposed method was superior to the mre approach of woodbury et al 1998 that assumed gaussian or uniform prior distributions fig 5 c when assuming the gaussian prior the latter peak in the two estimated peaks corresponded to the large disposal in 1978 woodbury et al 1998 however the resulting release histories were strongly dependent on the prior distribution in contrast we were able to reproduce the large spill without any prior information which is an advantage of geostatistical inversion michalak and kitanidis 2002 the results presented in this paper differed from those presented by michalak and kitanidis 2002 even though the geostatistical inversion approach was used this is mainly because they also used the data from 1983 onwards the difference in measurement data results in a different setting of the covariance structure θ and the error σ r the groundwater flow and contaminant conditions may be changed after 1983 by the gtc purge well test in october 1983 jackson et al 1985 soil remediation from 1987 to 1989 and contaminant removals from the deep and shallow groundwater plume after april 1992 franz environmental inc 2007 therefore calculations using the data after 1983 under steady flow conditions can be considered misleading in addition michalak and kitanidis 2002 constrained the non negativity with the metropolis hasting algorithm an mcmc method the gibbs sampling is considered superior to the metoropolis hasting algorithm the random walk procedure containing the acceptance test because of its computational efficiency and shorter computation time if the posterior pdf for each time can be calculated using eq 21 in advance as in this study the constrained solution can be obtained efficiently using the gibbs sampling previously residual variance values of 22 5 μg l 2 woodbury et al 1998 and 12 3 μg l 2 michalak and kitanidis 2002 were reported only a rough comparison is possible because of the difference in the used data however the residual variance of our result was 1 07 μg l 2 which was approximately on the same scale as that of the error setting σ r 2 0 25 μg l 2 4 2 verification of the retardation factors of thf and dee the retardation factors of thf and dee estimated by accounting for the fraction of organic carbon table 2 were verified using the reproduced release peak of 14dne the release histories of thf and dee fig 6 were reproduced using the optimal θ of 1 8 10 3 and 2 5 10 3 mg2 l2 day3 the peaks of thf 25 mg l and dee 77 mg l are much lower than solubility limits of thf 1 0 106 mg l wishart et al 2007 and dee 6 9 104 mg l icsc 2017 the retardation factors were determined as 1 75 for thf and 1 8 for dee to reproduce the peak of 14dne caused by the large disposal in 1978 fig 5 b under the following settings from 1 1 to 1 4 for thf and from 1 3 to 1 8 for dee table 3 this comparison supports the suitability of the parameter set for dee but indicates that the retardation factor of thf was slightly overestimated this may reflect insufficient measurement locations which might have decreased the accuracy of the inversion result or co metabolic biodegradation of 14dne with thf kohlweyer et al 2000 vainberg et al 2006 sun et al 2011 which may have affected the shapes and concentrations of the 14dne and thf plumes 4 3 contaminant plume distributions of the three contaminants the plume distributions of the three contaminants were calculated fig 7 a from the release histories estimated using the non negativity constraint the accuracy of the estimations was checked using scatterplots of the absolute error between the calculated and measured concentrations fig 7 b the mean absolute error mae and the linear correlation coefficient r values of these concentrations table 4 with the non negativity constraint the maes of all the contaminants decreased considerably with decreases of 46 67 and 59 for 14dne thf and dee respectively and the r values increased to between 0 60 and 0 77 these results indicate a high reproduction accuracy and demonstrate the effectiveness of the non negativity constraint in addition the low uncertainties of these distributions can be confirmed from the 95 confidence intervals which were one or more orders lower than the best estimates common to the three contaminants fig 7 a the uncertainties for the three contaminants were relatively high around the middle of the study area probably because of the relatively high concentrations in that area associated with the large peak after 1978 and the sparse density of the measurement points the uncertainty distribution can be used to determine the number and location of additional measurements the disagreement in the measurements was probably caused by using the analytical solution for contaminant transport the absolute errors between the calculated and measured concentrations were large at around 1 10 3 mg l for thf and dee fig 7 b these data were collected from shallow depth z 4 to 12 m at sampling point no 34 fig 2 a which is located in the stratified low permeability zone of the confined aquifer unit c shown in fig 2 b such unit dependent differences in permeability were not considered in the analytical solution and so may have caused the overestimation this is considered in more detail in the discussion 5 discussion 5 1 effect of averaging the measurement concentrations as described earlier the original concentration data at the 176 points were averaged over a 4 m depth range to calculate the release history using the measured concentrations at 66 points to examine whether the averaging affected the calculation accuracy the release history of 14dne was calculated using the original data with the nonnegativity constraint the value of θ in the cubic covariance was 1 2 10 3 mg2 l2 day3 two release histories were estimated using the original and averaged data fig 8 while the release history based on the original data had a slightly larger peak and more uncertainty than the one based on the averaged data the distributions of the release histories were similar the residual variance of the result was 1 55 μg l 2 which is similar to that using averaged data 1 07 μg l 2 consequently this confirmed that the averaging had little effect on the release history and plume distribution estimations 5 2 effect of the large measurement error the effect of the measurement error caused by the poor purge efficiency was examined using a σ r value of 3 0 μg l for 14dne the value of θ in the cubic covariance was 4 9 10 2 mg2 l2 day3 the estimated release history with a large measurement error showed a wider peak concentration than the release history with a small measurement error fig 9 a but the plume distributions were similar regardless of the measurement error fig 9 b in which mae was 2 0 10 2 μg l and r was 0 76 the maximum uncertainty of the estimated plume distribution with the large measurement error was up to 1 9 times greater than that with the small measurement error however the high uncertainty area the middle of the study area was the same regardless of the measurement error and corresponding to a large release peak and a lack of measurement points 5 3 verification of the release histories and plume distributions the release histories and plume distributions of the three contaminants are examined in detail below a vertical cross section at y 0 m in the e w direction along the x axis was drawn for the three contaminants and overlain with the original not averaged measured concentrations fig 10 the calculated plume distributions were generally consistent with the measured concentrations any disagreements between the calculated and measured concentrations may have been caused by heterogeneity of the aquifer permeability the geological columnar section had more geological units and suggested interstratified low permeability zones in the aquifer unit c jackson et al 1985 because of this low permeability the measured concentrations were remarkably low in the area e g low thf and dee zones extended through the aquifer at an elevation of around 85 m in addition the groundwater flow direction was presumed to be heterogenous depending on the geological structure however a simple transport model with a one direction flow was adopted in this study to compare our results with those from the studies of woodbury et al 1998 and michalak and kitanidis 2002 the jacobian matrix in eqs 1 or 12 expresses the sensitivity of the concentration at each point and each time this can be calculated numerically by running a flow and transport model with a release of a unit concentration pulse therefore accurate three dimensional groundwater flow models that account for detailed geological structures are needed to improve the estimation accuracy instead of the analytical solution differences may also occur by simplifying the contaminant transport from the source swc to the aquifer unit c although the swc was at a depth of about 10 m we assumed that the source was uniformly distributed at the edge of the aquifer in the analytical solution this assumption originated from the fact that the aquitard unit d under the swc was locally discontinuous because of heterogenous lithofacies or excavation for waste disposal jackson et al 1985 this implies that most contaminants may have moved rapidly through the discontinuities in the aquitard thereby causing the peak after the large disposal in 1978 meanwhile the estimated release histories of thf and dee showed second peaks in 1981 fig 6 because of the high concentrations measured in the upper part of the aquifer at around e l 100 m near the swc although other large spills may have occurred in 1980 the estimated second peak may be considered a result of the slow transport of contaminants through the aquitard assuming that the hydraulic gradient i h was 0 002 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard k d was 7 9 10 6 m s and the porosity ρ d was 0 4 following jackson et al 1985 and the thickness of the aquitard h was 1 5 m the transport time calculated as h r f i h k d ρ d in the aquitard was estimated as 769 days for thf and 791 days for dee the transport time in the aquitard was approximately consistent with the time lags between the first and second peaks of the estimated release history which was 880 days for thf and 890 days for dee to improve the accuracy of the estimations the contaminant release from the swc needs to be modeled differences may also occur because of seasonal change in rainfall after the large disposal in may 1978 rainy seasons with rainfall amounting to approximately 100 mm month were recorded almost every year our steady flow assumption may be valid for long term contaminant transport therefore the effects of rainfall infiltration and seasonal changes in groundwater flow fields on the release condition settings amount and flow direction of contaminants from a source needs to be confirmed 6 conclusions the aim of this study was to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of a geostatistical approach that incorporated groundwater flow modeling to estimate the contaminant plume when the release history is unknown the approach was tested on groundwater contamination in the gloucester landfill the approach was effective as the accuracy of the estimation was improved by applying a non negativity constraint using gibbs sampling with the geostatistical approach and a non negativity constraint the three dimensional plume distributions were produced with adequate accuracy for the three organic solvents 14dne thf and dee with linear correlation coefficients between the estimation and measurement of 0 60 to 0 77 for the concentration data from multiple depths in addition the reconstructed release peak for 14dne that corresponded to the large disposal in 1978 was more correct than for the preceding studies without any prior information of the release history the reconstructed release histories for thf and dee also indicated the same peaks with retardation factors that were generally consistent with the estimation using fraction of organic carbon this study may be the first application to estimate three dimensional plume distributions and the associated uncertainties when the release history is unknown targeting multiple contaminants the proposed method can be applied widely to contaminated groundwater fields to increase the accuracy of the estimation the modeling of the groundwater flow and the hydrogeologic structure should be improved the accuracy of the predictions of future plume transport could be improved with precise estimation of the hydrogeological structure which would be useful when planning for remediation the hydrogeological structure could be estimated from transient measurements of groundwater concentrations for example the hydraulic parameters used in the analytical solution could be calibrated by sensitivity analysis with an objective function such as the reproducibility of measurement the ensemble kalman filter is one of the potential methods which can be also applied to a joint estimation of contaminant source and hydraulic conductivity e g chen et al 2021 geostatistic based hydraulic tomography using well hydraulic test data could be used to help account for heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity from limited data e g lee and kitanidis 2014 the estimations in this study could also be improved by considering spatial correlation of measurement data shlomi and michalak 2007 in addition to the temporal correlation of release history however the steady flow assumptions may not be valid if the transient change of groundwater flow increases e g by pumping wells in this case our method should be repeated with temporal measurement data to estimate the plume distributions credit authorship contribution statement shizuka takai conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology validation visualization writing

1259,many studies have investigated the migration and entrapment processes of source zones from dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination under different conditions however the characterization of occupying area by source zone or source shape in water saturated aquifers is still rudimentarily considered in this study we demonstrated this issue 1 by providing a brief review of existing approaches for source shape consideration 2 by proposing an approach with simple shape parameters based on the non uniformity of source widths and 3 by providing exemplary applications of our proposed approach on shapes already published in previous research works our literature review suggested that the source zone in mathematical approaches is generally characterized as simple geometrical shapes arbitrary lines or rectangles or system defined parameters that contrast to complex and discontinuous shapes observed in the real world but the characterization of such complex shapes is still not possible with acceptable efforts therefore we proposed an approach to parameterize the source shape by considering the variation of width and midpoints over the depth of the entire source zone and formulate four parameters based on population statistics mean standard deviation to illustrate the suitability of our approach we applied it to the results of lab experiments and by analyzing these complex shapes we highlighted the potential for improving the characterization techniques of non uniformity of the source zones keywords dnapl source zone characterization shape analysis review source width source midpoint data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the quality of groundwater is being threatened globally due to many contaminated sites that are yet to be assessed only in eu countries 3 million potentially contaminated sites have been reported but have never been comprehensively assessed for their effect on water quality and soil contamination eea european environment agency 2014 non aqueous phase liquid napl and particularly dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl largely due to their unique chemical properties and longevity as contaminants in the subsurface have been of research interest for several decades schwille 1988 feenstra et al 1991 kueper and frind 1991 anderson et al 1992a cohen et al 1992 illangasekare et al 1995 glass and nicholl 1996 oostrom et al 1999 van valkenburg and annable 2002 gerhard and kueper 2003 dridi et al 2009 seyedabbasi et al 2012 luciano et al 2018 although there exists a large volume of information on characterization and remediation techniques for contaminated sites villaume 1985 poulsen and kueper 1992 kueper et al 1993 brewster et al 1995 wiedemeier et al 1999 dekker and abriola 2000 kram et al 2001b lemke et al 2004 oostrom et al 2007 stroo and ward 2010 orozco et al 2012 cassiani et al 2014 einarson et al 2018 the number of contaminated sites from dnapl causing potential impairment to groundwater quality and human health are still increasing and are without appropriate assessments eea european environment agency 2014 zarlenga et al 2016 fetter et al 2017 considering the large number of these sites and the higher cost involved with the assessment kram et al 2002 mcdade et al 2005 simpler assessment approaches must be developed than currently available characterization of source zone sz becomes important when both assessment and remediation are to be considered together for the management of contaminated sites falta et al 2005 mercer et al 2010 with dnapl being hydrophobic chemical properties such as saturation limits dissolution rates and chemical gradient at the source phase or adjacent plume phase became part of intensive research works from the late 80s to the present numerical simulation has been used as the standard tool especially for detailed assessments of contaminated sites gerhard et al 2014 essaid et al 2015 engelmann et al 2019a categorized numerical simulations for dnapl scenarios into three main stages in that study stage 1 referred to source migration models where dnapl is released and its migration leads to the sz formation this stage can be described by physics based multiphase flow models kueper and gerhard 1995 erning et al 2012 engelmann et al 2021 stage 2 refers to source dissolution models that are investigated by dnapl mass transfer from the sz to the aqueous phase sale and mcwhorter 2001 saenton et al 2002 parker and park 2004 christ et al 2006 2010 finally stage 3 represents plume response models that cover the dnapls downstream of the sz for estimating the extent of contaminant spread at the affected sites prommer et al 2002 falta et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 yadav et al 2014 literature review suggests that stages 1 and 2 typically consider in most cases descriptive parameters of the sz e g pressure saturation permeability dispersivity porosity etc to construct numerical models while stage 3 models often consider simplified shape parameters e g thickness times width of the sz in addition to the descriptive parameters numerical models generally require a large number of site information and thus are not always appropriate when a large number of sites are to be assessed freeze and mcwhorter 1997 analytical approaches provide an alternative to numerical plume response models with comparatively less site information used in them the use of analytical solutions requires certain simplifying assumptions most notably that source zones have regular shapes and the aquifer is mostly homogeneous and isotropic these solutions domenico 1987 anderson et al 1992b liedl et al 2005 generally present the steady state distribution of contaminants as 1 c x y z f s f c x y z where f s is a function that is expected to incorporate characteristic shape parameters that have a unique direct connection with the plume response of the source zone and f c x y z is a function representing the spread of contaminant along spaces x y and z many models e g ham et al 2004 chu et al 2005 liedl et al 2005 2011 cirpka and valocchi 2006 birla et al 2020 have used eq 1 to formulate their mathematical solutions for calculating plume extents e g the steady state maximum plume length l max in these models f s is merely a geometrical quantity that often represents a line or rectangular plane with a dimension of length however studies suggested f s to be more a sensitive quantity controlling the extent of the contamination anderson et al 1992b maier and grathwohl 2006 fure et al 2006 yadav et al 2014 this implies that a better estimate of this quantity or source shape can lead to a more accurate estimate of the extent of contamination thus improving the overall assessment of the sites f s is often considered to be of a very regular shape e g a rectangle see table 2 from the modeling perspective such use of regular source shapes has allowed to study sz processes e g dissolution acting on the plume migration this contrasts with irregular shapes generally observed at the contaminated sites poulsen and kueper 1992 parker et al 2003 einarson et al 2018 therefore it is very likely that the analytical solutions will estimate a higher level of uncertainties here a better quantification of source shape or proxy sz metrics will allow more effective solutions furthermore the use of analytical models can simplify the assessment from preliminary investigations to risk reduction measures of a large number of sites that are known to exist yadav et al 2021 the life stages of the dnapls sz have been studied extensively in laboratory experiments under varied aquifer systems and boundary conditions these studies identified significant aspects of flow properties density solubility interfacial tension etc and aquifer properties porosity grain size distribution temperature intrinsic permeability etc acting on the shape of the sz most of these studies overserved the irregularities of the source shape even in a very minimally heterogeneous medium but any functional method that may lead to the improvement of source shape quantification is still not known to our knowledge no field scale studies or methods have been proposed and validated on quantifying the shape parameter of sz to predict the extent of contaminant spread at the affected sites the conceptualization of the shape parameter is still considered very rudimentarily when plume extensions are calculated by mathematical or experimental approaches national research council 2005 this paper intends to provide a brief literature review on the approaches that have been considered in studying the shape of the sz then we propose an approach to parameterize the source shape by considering the variation of width and midpoints over the depth of the entire source zone and formulate four parameters based on population statistics mean standard deviation in this manner we give a framework to quantify the non uniformity of the source shape next we illustrate the suitability of the approach by analyzing the results of several lab experiments already published in previous research and finally we very briefly present the practicality of our approach 2 current knowledge of source shape quantification the general scenario of releases for dnapls into the soil system is that they first migrate downward through the unsaturated zone under gravitational force and soil capillarity then until the release volume is exhausted or intercepted by impervious layers in the unsaturated zone they penetrate the groundwater table dnapls denser than groundwater and mostly hydrophobic continue migrating through the saturated zone until they reach the aquifer bottom fig 1 the migration path depends on the complex interplay between dnapl and subsurface properties of both unsaturated and saturated zones within the saturated zone it can be exhausted as residual saturation or it can migrate laterally depending on the permeability of the soil in any case dnapls occupy an area in the saturated zone either in quasi or steady state and become a long term source of the contaminated plume pankow and cherry 1996 source zone geometries have been addressed as complex structures in modeling or laboratory assessments the characterization of the shape components pool ganglia blob is possible with numerical modeling if the information on flow and aquifer properties governing dnapl infiltration and entrapment mechanism is known zhang et al 2007 2008 with laboratory assessments the very precise positions of these components can be captured with different imaging methods e g werth et al 2010 however such precise information generally cannot be obtained from the field sites leading to significant inaccuracies in quantifying the sz dimensions trantham and durnford 1999 when field contamination scenarios are predicted simplified sz structures with simple geometrical shape line or rectangle including also simplified domain uniform flow and aquifer parameters are often used in the models domenico 1987 liedl et al 2005 2011 chu et al 2005 maier and grathwohl 2006 karanovic et al 2007 etc the use of simplified sz structures decreases the accuracy of model prediction birla et al 2020 engelmann et al 2019a to the authors best knowledge a detailed quantification method of the real life sz shape is not yet available which relies on direct estimation of the shape dimensions rather than inverse methods to get an overview an attempt is made here to categorically tabulate see table 1 3 the available information related to sz quantification the considered categories are 1 laboratory and field scale studies 2 analytical and empirical studies and 3 numerical studies it is to be noted that this study does not intend to provide a full review of sz quantification approaches but rather a brief demonstration of currently considered approaches to highlight the knowledge gap between real observation and mathematical simulation 2 1 laboratory field scale studies schwille 1988 was among the first to provide detailed laboratory scale investigations on dnapl migration in the study dyed dnapl was infiltrated in the 2d 3d tanks and columns filled with different types of porous media the migration pathways were analyzed with colored photographs many laboratory scale studies have followed the work of schwille 1988 to understand the dnapl migration behavior especially the controlling parameters that govern the infiltration and entrapment mechanism works succeeding schwille 1988 included variations in the experimental setup e g boundary conditions and more sophisticated methods to capture the dnapls migration process colored images of source shapes can be taken by digital camera engelmann et al 2019b 2021 electric impedance tomography chambers et al 2004 magnetic resonance imaging zhang et al 2002 2007 and others imaging methods the captured images are usually then analyzed in several ways to provide the original image marked o in table 1 with minor readjustments and the saturation image marked s in table 1 with more complex post processing techniques e g werth et al 2010 to recreate the original dimension of source shape according to eea european environment agency 2014 the following four steps need to be considered for the assessment of field sites 1 site identification 2 preliminary investigation 3 main site investigation and 4 implementation of risk reduction measures the requirement of sz characterization mainly comes into steps 2 and 3 where the contamination extents are mapped or approximated both source and plume phase to initiate step 4 step 2 generally begins with conventional baseline methods to site specific non invasive methods kästner et al 2012 baseline methods typically refer to sample collections and the following chemical evaluation by off site laboratory methods after acquiring sufficient information in step 3 more detailed investigation methods e g direct push methods dietrich and leven 2009 are applied to approximate the distribution e g of pool ganglia or blob of dnapl mass at both source and plume phase kram et al 2001a has compiled field methods with high potentials particularly for dnapls investigations and provided good comparisons of the available methods however available literature also suggests that very high uncertainties generally exist in approximating the mass distribution of sz in the field page et al 2007 table 1 lists aspects of sz consideration by few laboratory and field scale studies the notable feature of table 1 is the identification of source geometry as structure characterization and boundary delineation here the structure characterization simply refers to how the sz has been reported and the boundary delineation refers to how the sz has been demarcated from the background i e porous medium in that specific study literature works suggest that the lab scale focus has been on 2d saturated and homogeneous domains comparatively lesser works have used heterogeneous 2d domains where heterogeneity is defined as varying permeable layered systems the field scale studies have been performed mainly in heterogeneous and under saturated and or unsaturated domains also as mentioned earlier the shape of sz is accurately nearly and directly captured from lab scale studies while in field studies the shape is always approximated based on different invasive e g excavation or minimally non invasive indirect methods e g geophysical direct push or other approaches 2 2 analytical empirical studies analytical and empirical models have been often used as preliminary investigation techniques for different stages of dnapl contamination scenarios source migration depletion or dissolution and plume response in this study the focus is limited to the plume response models e g quantifying plume extents or maximum plume length l max these models are often simple algebraic expressions including dimensions of source shape e g width and depth see table 2 while applications of these models are quick and straightforward which is a major advantage their development is mainly based on overly simplified conditions such as homogeneous isotropic aquifers with simple reactive mechanisms chu et al 2005 liedl et al 2005 2011 cirpka and valocchi 2006 literature provides analytical models with various degrees of complexity the involved complexity can be the 3d domain with a 2d plane source geometry liedl et al 2011 or the 2d domain with a 1d line source geometry liedl et al 2005 empirical models which can also be simple algebraic expressions like analytical models determine the l max as a function of shape parameter by fitting to field data being a fitting dependent a major drawback of these models is that they cannot be generalized nevertheless these models provide many possibilities to overcome the restrictions of analytical models e g irregular source geometry hydrogeological stresses etc a recent work by birla et al 2020 used a hybrid concept a combination of empirical function and analytical model with the inclusion of recharge as a component of hydraulic stress and source geometry components this model was found to significantly improve the prediction of l max than done by the analytical models however concepts such as hybrid models or truly empirical models have only been used to characterize source zones in limited cases yadav et al 2021 table 2 lists few analytical and empirical models that use finite and simple representation of source geometries in the given plume models these models being less data intensive can be advantageous when site conditions and model constraints match 2 3 numerical studies numerical models are used for detailed investigation of the different stages of dnapl contamination these models can be conveniently grouped into two main categories 1 transport models t model in table 3 and 2 multiphase models mp models in table 3 transport models mainly simulate dissolution processes from sz stage 2 as defined in engelmann et al 2019a and plume response processes stage 3 these processes are mainly based on local equilibrium and kinetic or rate dependent nonequilibrium assumptions frind et al 1999 and largely depend on sz geometries dnapl dissolution properties and hydrodynamic subsurface characteristics engelmann et al 2019a large number of intensive studies have been carried out in the past decades on these types of models the goal of multiphase models is to simulate the source percolation and entrapment processes in the subsurface these processes are based on changes in pressure saturation permeability p s k relations of physical phases miller et al 1998 for the complete analysis of dnapl migration often specialized models are used where transport models t are coupled with multiphase models mp the recent advancements of computational capabilities have allowed for such coupled or mp t models lemke and abriola 2006 miles et al 2008 mclaren et al 2012 significantly more literature is available on transport models compared to the mp models the representation of sz in the transport models is often simplified because transport quantities advection and dispersion and reactive quantities e g sorption or degradation are considered more dominant over the processes at sz shape yadav et al 2014 however more accurate use of the sz shape is likely to improve the predictions of transport models soga et al 2004 but literature directly correlating the sz shape with plume response behavior is limited table 3 provides a very brief overview of different numerical modeling efforts on simulating napl migration the table shows that numerical models can simulate contamination problems that are more natural e g 3d heterogeneous aquifers undergoing different reactions in table 3 complex saturation contour refers to the source shape represented in non uniform distribution of pool ganglia blob while simple contour stands for any uniform and symmetrical geometrical shapes e g line rectangles circle also as shown in table 3 modeling efforts have not always been evaluated against field or laboratory data 2 4 summary tables 1 3 suggest a need for a standard approach for the quantification of source shape which can be simple but acceptable enough to underpin the non uniformity of the complex shape of sz the current approaches for characterizing the sz in analytical empirical models are as geometrical shape parameters width depth or in numerical multiphase models as descriptive parameters pressure saturation permeability dispersivity porosity solubility reaction rate etc few numerical plume response models attempted to quantify the sz as shape parameters except very limited studies used lab scale imaging approaches overall a proxy sz metric is required for underpinning the non uniform shapes while modeling plume responses in field sites in this study we suggested an approach to quantify these non uniform shapes by proposing simple proxy sz metrics however our approach does not intend to provide a final solution for a better estimation of plume lengths yet as it is beyond the scope of this paper it rather intends to emphasize the fact that the complexity of the geometrical shape of sz should be considered in an acceptable manner in the mathematical models so that a more reliable estimation of plume lengths can be achieved for the contaminated sites 3 formulation of an approach for source shape quantification as can be observed in tables 1 3 depth m and width w are the two parameters that are used to describe the 2d source zone sz in this study we assumed z as the penetration depth of the sz for dnapls where the aquifer can be contaminated across the entire thickness z can equal to aquifer depth i e m z however the quantification of source width or w is the more challenging one here a tempting approach for w could be to express it as w f z furthermore it is also realistic to assume that the vertical penetration of source is not always straight downward this could be considered by considering the deviation of the source midpoints dm as a function of depth or dm f z therefore considering several shape factors we presented an approach to quantify the 2d source shape using two observable primary parameters and the associated four additional parameters based on population statistics for lateral spreading see table 4 the statistical parameters in this approach complement the primary parameters and underpin the non uniform lateral extension of the source shape the application of the developed approach is illustrated in section 4 the following text elucidates the general concept of the approach depending on the mass released and the conditions of the underlying subsurface the migration of dnapl into aquifers can follow from a simple pattern to several complex patterns fig 2 visualizes a few possible hypothetical scenarios with the aid of parameters defined in table 4 in fig 2 the complexity of the shape pattern increases from scenario 2i to scenario 2vi in the following manner a in the simplest scenario of 2i the measured width w z green line remains constant const from the released location to the end of penetration i e there is no expansion contraction over the depth z thus the average of measured widths a w remains the same as the released width r bold black line on top here r represents a finite line release in which dnapl infiltrates into aquifers see fig 1 since there is no variation of w z the standard deviation of measured widths equals to zero or s w 0 scenario 2i with a known z and constant w gives the most simple and symmetrical rectangle shape that has been used in the modeling works see table 2 but such existence can rather be exceptional in the field b scenarios 2ii and 2iii also have symmetrical shapes similar to scenario 2i except here w z varies over z i e w z const and therefore a w r and s w 0 an attribute of scenarios 2ii and 2iii also for scenario 2i is the red vertical line showing no measured deviations of source midpoints dm z here dm z 0 means that midpoints of the source body do not deviate from the c r line x 0 along with source depth z the c r line refers to the horizontal position at the midpoint of r represented by the black dotted line in fig 2 thus 2ii and 2iii still assume that the direction of migration is only downward although the source widths w z can vary infinitely this leads to c r a dm s dm 0 where a dm is the average of midpoint deviations and s dm is the standard deviation of midpoint deviations c in addition to w z dm z allows further quantification of lateral migration of the source zone for example scenarios 2iv and 2v are comparable to the 2i as w z const a w r and s w 0 are true for these scenarios but dm z 0 in scenario 2iv leads to a non regular shape compared to that of scenario 2i dm z 0 renders the meandering pattern of source shape as can be observed in scenario 2iv however the upper and lower dm z in 2iv cancel out each other and make a dm 0 but s dm 0 resulting in rather a unique case a more complex pattern appears when dm z 0 and both a dm 0 s dm 0 are true like in scenario 2v d figs 2 i v despite being differently quantified still represents symmetric or simple arbitrary shapes the actual sz is very unlikely to have such shapes in contrast scenario 2vi considers a non symmetric and complex source shape that is likely more realistic in the field this shape is characterized by considering both primary parameters as variables i e w z const and dm z 0 all additional shape parameters a w s w a dm s dm are considered as non zero values and underpin the lateral variabilities of source shape fig 3 presents exemplary distributions of w z and dm z in relative frequency histograms based on arbitrarily chosen values for scenario 2i and 2vi the purpose is only to illustrate that the proposed shape parameters are able to quantify the degree of variation between simplified sz and complex sz scenarios in section 4 3 more demonstrations of such distributions are given quantitatively using six heterogenous lab scale source shapes from the selected literature in fig 3 we used a w to normalize the primary parameter w z dm z values because the shape variability can be better understandable in such a manner fig 3a shows that the normalized widths w z a w calculated from measured widths w z for scenario 2i are always equal to 1 0 referring to no lateral variation of source widths along with the depth similarly fig 3b shows the characteristics for dm z 0 for scenario 2i when no leftward or rightward variation of source midpoints from the c r line is observed referring to vertical straight downward penetration of the source the opposite cases w z a w 1 and dm z a w 0 can be represented depending on shape s variation by any distributions similar to fig 3c and d respectively the distribution of course will be different for different complex source zones depending on the complexity and heterogeneity 4 application of the proposed approach 4 1 data for the evaluation lab scale experiments have mostly used high resolution imaging for the analysis of dnapl experimentations see table 1 six images of source shape see fig 4 from the literature have been selected for the analysis in this work the selected images represent the results of dnapl experimentations and they all provide complex and heterogeneous 2d dnapl source shapes in fully water saturated porous medium two phase system without explaining much on shape quantification approaches next a very brief description of images is provided that will clarify the target evaluation the study by bob et al 2008 called bob in fig 4a provides the image of tetrachloroethylene pce migration for natural sand fractions homogeneous see table 1 in their experimental 2d tanks the undyed dnapl source shape was acquired using a thermoelectrically air cooled charge coupled ccd camera fig 4a left which was then post processed to provide the final saturation image fig 4a right two separate source shapes named here as luc1 and luc2 are considered from one entire source zone of luciano et al 2010 the two areas of interest represented by green dotted lines in fig 4b right separate source planes for luc1 right and luc2 left shapes the purpose here is to demonstrate that the proposed shape parameters of this study have the ability to capture the presence of low permeable layers and most importantly to quantify the degree and nature of lateral spreading originating from such layers luc1 demonstrates in a manner unhindered migration and represents a homogeneous condition while luc2 demonstrates impeded migration and represents a heterogeneous condition due to the presence of a low permeable layer fig 4b left interestingly a notable lateral expansion of shape can be seen on the left of luc1 shape fig 4b right area of interest leftward suggesting a presence of a low permeable layer that is not visible in plain sight eng1 eng2 and eng3 fig 4c 4e obtained from a recent work by engelmann et al 2021 show three repeated experiments of dnapl source migration in homogeneous natural sand fractions they provide mass balance corrected saturation distributions in a logarithm scale with volume balance deviations 5 07 although the images provided improved saturation distributions in general and served well to meet their research goal they caused limitations on calculating shape parameters considered in this study nevertheless engs images are considered here for analysis as they performed repetitive experiments with precisely the same initial conditions it is important to mention that all selected images are migrating snapshots of the early staged source zone the objective is to quantify the shape of sz such that it is fairly distributed over the source plane it is because analytical empirical models often uses simplified shape such as lines or rectangle for characterizing the sz in their models see table 2 a quantification method that can improve the consideration of simple to complex shapes is expected to provide better transport simulations e g better mass dissolution also field studies e g parker et al 2003 showed that local depression in the aquifer aquitard interface may cause thicker dnapl accumulation which remains even in the later stages of the contaminated sites and allows distributed sz over the depth in the study luc1 2 images are acquired at the snap time t 2020 s after the release of dnapl at t 0 s similarly snap time t 100 s is selected for eng1 3 the distance of percolation of the source depends on the combined effect of the surface of the porous media angular versus circular and the grain sizes among other factors lucs used circular glass beads with finer fractions of 0 4 0 8 mm while engs used angular natural sands with coarser fractions of 1 0 2 0 mm in fig 4 at the given time the sources travel vertically 300 mm and 170 mm from the release point to the aquifer bottom approximately for luc1 and eng1 respectively therefore different snap time is selected between lucs and engs for the bob information on snap time t is not available and therefore only one image satisfying the desired condition is analyzed without considering the temporal factor luciano et al 2010 and engelmann et al 2021 provides snapshots also at later times of the source migration but then the distribution of the source zone is mainly at the bottom of the aquifer and the resolution of saturation images is not sufficient for analyzing shapes using the methods see sec 4 2 of this study 4 2 methods for preparing the images for analysis and characterizing the shape parameters the available images provided in fig 4 are not readily useful for the analysis the adopted analyses here are based on measuring the shape quantities directly from images therefore all images is processed such that 1 any form of horizontal or vertical distortion stretching is avoided while extracting of the image from the original literature and 2 unvarying steps i e consistencies are maintained are followed while preparing those images the text below describes the methods adopted for preparing the bob image for the analysis identical steps were used for preparing other images see appendix a in the first step both the original and processed saturation images are cropped from the respective literature bob et al 2008 in this case saturation image provides color based demarcation between water saturated porous media white background and dnapl source area colored background the colored demarcation aids the transferring of shape dimensions to the proposed shape parameter provided in table 4 uniformity with image processing steps e g on the units of measurement is maintained an open source scalable vector graphics software inkscape v1 0 https www inkscape org is used to ensure uniformity for image processing and analyses inkscape s cartesian coordinate system is set up to use millimeters mm as the unit for the length the images luc1 2 eng1 3 that are not in that mm scale are converted to the mm scale using the inkscape s conversion interface appendix fig a1 a5 the second step is then to quantify primary parameters w z dm z of the source shape from the cropped image for that horizontal transects lines each 2 mm apart are drawn extending over the entire source area not shown in fig 5 using the inkscape interface the transects are clipped off at the interfaces between colored contour plot the source and white background the water saturated medium transects that remain inside the source area are only considered fig 5a in the analysis then three control points two endpoints and the midpoint x l z l x r z r x m z m where z l z r z m are assigned on each transect line here x and z represent the horizontal and vertical axis coordinates respectively and the subscripts l r and m represent the left right and mid points respectively the coordinates of the control points are available as tabulated data from the inkscape interface by using these three control points the shape of the source zone can be quantified and plotted shown in fig 5b from the available data the length of transects or the lateral spreads w z of the source is easily obtained from w z x r x l at any given depth the values of x m provide the quantity dm z based on the reference line c r as shown in fig 5b the first transect is placed in the xz plane such that its midpoint x m z m is superposed at x z 0 0 this transect expresses w z 0 and is also referred to as a release width r an imaginary line passing through its midpoints is introduced as the reference line c r x 0 now by letting the remaining transects 56 lines in the bob image placed below r at 2 mm apart from each other vertically we get a w z series w z 2 w z 4 w z 6 w z 112 their midpoints coincide with the c r line here all dm z 0 is considered hypothetically and will result in a symmetrical shaped source zone not shown in fig 5 until this point only observed quantities of w z of the source are considered to obtain an asymmetrical and complex shaped source zone a more realistic case the observed quantities of dm z have to be used as the midpoints x m z m of transects are known an estimate of the actual dm z line can be easily found using their distances from the c r line dm z can take either positive or negative values or be equal to zero for example dm z 110 equals 9 07 mm which means that the midpoint is located 9 07 mm to the left of the c r line thus considering actual quantities of w z and dm w will generate fig 5b that recreates the originally cropped source shape fig 5a fig 5b now provides both the qualitative information of the source zone from original literature and the quantitative information allowing the parameterization of the variability of complex source shape since w z represents positive quantities and dm z represents positive or negative quantities or zero population statistics such as the average a w a dm and the standard deviation s w s dm can easily be derived thus careful preparation of images and quantification of primary parameters from those images allows finding the proposed additional parameters a w s w a dm s dm see table 4 to quantify the variabilities of the shape the values of primary parameters w z dm z are normalized by a w the average width notable variations can be seen in fig 5c and d for the normalized case i e w z a w and dm z a w in fig 5c the area between line x 0 and the green dotted line corresponds to a conventional approach for shape consideration where it is assumed to be a simple rectangle with constant width of a w in contrast the green line shows the percentage variation of w z compared with the conventional approach fig 5d shows the normalized actual deviations red line and normalized average deviation red dotted line of source midpoints from the c r line in both cases s w and s dm black dotted line also normalized by a w give the ranges of the variability of the source shape 4 3 parameterizing source zones from considered images table 5 provides the values of shape parameters for all the considered images in this work an additional statistical parameter coefficient of variation cv s w a w is introduced in the table the purpose of cv is to highlight the variability of source widths w z regardless of the scale of the images however cv does not take negative observations in its distribution hald 1952 since dm z values can be both positive and negative a cv value from dm z observations cannot be presented it is because calculating mean values from negative distances a dm and using it for comparing dispersions of s dm for different images will give no meaningful information depths z and release widths r are also given in the tables to aid the discussion about the approach for shape parameterization of this study the values of primary shape parameters w z dm z are provided as electronic supplementary material s1 in appendix b fig 6 provides the relative frequency histograms for w z a w left column and dm z a w right column while the cv values focus on the magnitude of variability of the source s lateral extension the goal of the left green histograms is to show the w z distributions without considering the individual scale of those source zones similar to fig 3 the black dotted c r lines are added in the right red histograms to show the leftward negative and rightward positive distribution of dm z from the midpoint of release width r 5 discussion 5 1 discussions of the individual studies bob has the smallest shape area among all analyzed images see z and a w values in table 5 however the cv value refers to a notable variation of lateral migration it gives the second highest variability when compared with other images the distribution of w z plotted on the left green in fig 6 as relative frequency terms explain this further the histogram shows a non gaussian distribution or u distribution pattern for bob where the majority of transects lengths w z fall into extreme values 18 belongs to below than 0 5 a w and 18 above than 1 5 a w the positive value of a dm table 6 represents the overall rightward shifting of source midpoints after being released and s dm provides a range of the shifting for dm z additionally the histogram at right red shows the distribution of normalized source midpoints deviations around the c r line x 0 line these deviations of shape can also be shown in fig 5c and d where normalized shape parameters are also plotted over the depth of the source the difference between luc1 and luc2 is due to the presence of an impermeable layer see fig 4b bottom layer on their migration pathways apart from z values the impediment can also be characterized by a w s w a dm and s dm values the presence of the bottom layer causes higher capillary pressure and flow resistance at the left edge of the top layer and therefore allows more dnapl to flow rightward and to be released freely from the right edge the presence of a higher volume of dnapl at the right side can be indicated by observing parameter values for luc1 2 assuming more migrated volume generally causes bigger expansion average and variation standard deviation of source widths at a given space and time luc1 a w s w luc2 a w s w therefore the cv characterizes more variability and mobility of lateral migration for luc1 than luc2 both luc1 and luc2 migrated rightward as a dm is positive the smaller a dm for luc1 may apparently suggest smaller variation but when the s dm is considered together with a dm it shows that luc1 has more variation of the source midpoints than luc2 see appendix fig a1d and a2d this can be better explained by a histogram of dm z a w in fig 6 here 47 and 37 of midpoints are located positively and negatively around the c r line respectively for luc1 in contrast the majority of midpoints 62 are negatively located for luc2 however the bin ranges i e 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 for both cases suggest the midpoints are close to the c r line the histogram of w z a w also elucidates the source shape characteristics further for luc1 and luc2 the distribution of normalized widths is grouped very close to a w for both cases luc1 has two peaks 1 a higher peak with 33 of w z alone in the range of 1 0 1 1 suggesting the source migrates majorly downward with source widths close to a unity a w and 2 a smaller peak with 9 of w z in the range 1 3 1 4 indicating the presence of unexpected lateral migration or pool formation that probably originated from the invisible capillary barrier the lateral migration can be observed readily at the left of luc1 from fig 4b see also fig a1 luc2 also has a secondary peak 20 of w z at 1 2 1 3 which indicates the expected lateral migration due to the visible and intentionally placed bottom left capillary barrier however the difference between the smaller and higher peak for luc2 is not as sharp as that is found for luc1 by observing the peak values and their differences an inference can be made about the nature of the capillary barrier present on the migration pathway thus the main reason to separate the entire source zone into luc1 and luc2 is to investigate the ability of the current approach for quantifying the sz considering capillary barriers the cv values of all three eng images show high w z variabilities with eng1 being the highest and eng2 the lowest however eng2 has a very high a w value mainly because of the vertical fingering at the right see fig a4a in appendix a eng3 is comparatively the smallest shape with the largest r value this suggests migration is impeded here presence of high capillary pressure in shape allowing dnapl to be accumulated over the invisible capillary barrier this accumulation can be understood with the elevated saturation value from fig 4e saturation image this partly explains that eng1 has the maximum penetration and eng3 has the minimum although they both have similar a w values to explain further the migration of eng3 is much slower rather the saturation content is increasing while eng1 is expanding vertically and reducing its saturation over the depth however a significant limitation discussed in section 5 of this approach can be observed from the very small r value of eng1 the source literature does not mention any presence of gradient flow water from any direction or visible impermeable layering in the experimental setup nevertheless patterns of negatively located source midpoints are significantly observed in the histogram of dm z a w in fig 6 resulting in negative a dm values for all eng images eng3 shows the highest variation of midpoints with a dm and s dm values this can be seen in fig a5d and also in the histogram of eng3 where the distribution of normalized midpoints 0 03 reaches the maximum bin range 0 6 0 5 of variation eng1 also shows such a maximum range of distribution but with comparatively fewer frequencies 0 01 histograms of w z a w suggest that among all eng images eng2 approximately follows the gaussian distribution here one fourth of w z is located very close to 0 8 0 9 with other frequencies near this range on the contrary both eng1 and eng3 show rather so call edge peak distributions glen 2015 of w z where a set of outliers are located at extreme ranges 22 and 14 below 0 5 x a w for eng1 and eng3 respectively these extremes originate from the limitation of the approach which is discussed later same as for the r value observed for eng1 5 2 comparative discussions of considered studies fig 6 and table 5 present the range of variations of source widths w z and source midpoints dm z the discussion on individual studies already demonstrates the suitability of the suggested approach to underpin the complex source shapes very plausibly with this information a quantitative and comparative discussions are possible the cv values varied over from 19 for luc2 to a maximum of 50 for eng1 bob has the smallest shape likely because of the volume and boundary condition of its release and pressure saturation characteristics of packing nevertheless a high degree of variability is observed from the cv value thus the cv or ratio of s w to a w adequately quantifies the variations of w z irrespective of the scale of images and conditions mentioned above bob and eng3 have similar z values but their release volume differs significantly 2 ml for bob compared to 20 ml for eng3 this can be demonstrated with the maximum saturation level exceeding well above 0 2 yellow to orange for eng3 in fig 4e but for the bob the maximum saturation does not exceed over 0 2 fig 4a however a similar penetration depth between bob and eng3 can be explained by the higher a w value referring that eng3 tends to expand more laterally than vertically the a dm values generally show that bob and lucs migrate rightward while all the engs migrate leftward after release however for the normalized by a w bob and eng3 show the high variations for midpoints dm z among the analyzed shapes fig 6 right column the sample size six images used in this study is rather very small therefore exact conclusions on frequency distribution may not be very appropriate however luc1 luc2 and eng2 i e three out of six analyzed images indicate toward the gaussian distribution in the relative frequency histogram of w z a w approximately 59 64 and 47 of w z for luc1 luc2 and eng2 respectively fall within the range of 0 8 1 1 three consecutive bins at the middle suggesting their inclination toward the unit source width in contrast bob eng1 and eng3 the other three analyzed shapes do not follow gaussian like distribution from the histogram of dm z a w in fig 6 it is observed that the midpoints apparently tend to deviate more for engs and bob than for lucs all measured dm z are grouped close to the c r line for lucs while they are more widely distributed for engs negatively located and bob positively located the reason for these observations could be that lucs experiments used glass beads while engs and bob used natural sand fractions in their experimental setup the difference in packing materials and their capillary pressure saturation characteristics allowed easy downward migration for dnapl for glass beads while hindered complex and unpredictable migration for sand fractions this behavior can also be observed by comparing fig 5d and fig a1d a5d overall the presentation of histograms fig 6 in this study only explores the quantitative potentials of the proposed approach to quantify the complexity of source shapes and demands further analyses with more source images 5 3 limitations of the approach despite the advantage i e ability to get simplified information from complex realistic source zone the shape parameters defined in this work have a number of limitations and they need to be discussed the most important limitation is that a continuous demarcation line for a source shape is required this explains the small r value for eng1 and small w z values for many transects observed for engs unlike bob and lucs where a continuous boundary line defines the source shape in terms of saturation contour plot engs use a modified image processing and analysis framework to convert the original images into saturation images this representation leads to a very discontinuous distribution of source shape it causes the transects to underestimate the presence of the dnapl source zone in many locations and to be clipped off inaccurately fig a3a a5a table s1 this also explains the oscillation pattern of the dm z line observed in engs shape fig a3d a5d another drawback of this approach is that the r is considered from the value of the first transect at a given snap time the objective of using r is to represent the hypothetical release width of the source body and to highlight the variabilities of source widths w z and midpoints dm z from a finite reference line however it needs to be mentioned that r is not the actual release width reported in the original literature in their experimental setups dnapl releases were initiated as point release within the saturated domain we hypothetically assumed that the first transect acts as a spatial extent or line release like in fig 1 where dnapl has entered into the saturated zone and is allowed to percolate until reaching the aquifer bottom but at the chosen snapshot eng1 migrates downward relatively fast leaving the tailing body of the source at the release location z 0 this caused the small value of r table 5 and smaller upper transects w z table s1 for eng1 5 4 consequences of the approach for modeling purpose and site characterization to this point the suitability of the shape parameters to underpin and quantify the dimensions of complex source shapes has been discussed the consequence of our approach or how this approach can be used further to improve plume estimation needs to be discussed analytical solutions generally overestimate the plume size over what is observed in the field sites it can be improved for example it is very reasonable to assume that the discrepancy between over estimation and actual plume size will reduce if a source shape that corresponds to a w is considered as input in the transport equation additionally considering adm further in those solutions will result in an improved estimation of plume dimension than using a simplified shape e g rectangular patches which is mostly the current practice in analytical models however transport solutions with the inclusion of a dm have to be developed the quantification methods in this work can also improve numerical solutions for plume response models stage 3 see section 1 also in this case the source shape quantities e g a dm must be included as model input parameters moreover more exhaustive analyses e g monte carlo simulation can be made using the proposed shape parameter and they can be combined with analytical or numerical solutions the s w and s dm give ranges of variation of a w and a dm respectively using the range values random source shapes can be generated and the corresponding plumes can be simulated to approximate the most suitable plume extent that fits with experimental data there exist a wide range of geophysical methods ground penetrating radar spectral induced polarization electrical impedance tomography etc and direct push methods laser induced fluorescence raman spectroscopy membrane interface probe optical image profiler electrical conductivity logging etc that can make snapshots of the source zone from the field sites using the image preparation methods section 4 2 on these snapshots the values for shape parameters w z and dm z can be easily obtained and finally an estimation of the contaminant spreads from plume response models can be possible with a certain level of compromise these are only a few possible ways to improve plume investigation in modeling and site characterization using our suggested source metrics more exhaustive research on the utilization will certainly improve the consideration of shape characterization but they go beyond the scope of this paper 6 conclusion and future works this work reassesses the current consideration of source shape quantification techniques for dnapl contamination first by reviewing the literature and then proposing a simple approach to address the lateral migration of complex source shapes the new approach is based on a quantitative description using the parameters given in table 4 the application of the approach on the results of different lab scale experiments demonstrated its suitability as very plausible with this information a quantitative and comparative discussion is provided the approach can be extended further and used to better understand source shape characterization the concept can also be extended for varying penetration depth but these variabilities both lateral width and penetration depth of source shape would be challenging to determine in real field cases in particular the field methods need to be explored and developed to measure the shape parameters another significant challenge is realizing the deviation of source midpoints in available modeling tools for plume estimation mathematical approaches need to be developed or modified to account for the deviations of midpoints and variable widths more exhaustive analyses e g monte carlo simulation of source width or other robust numerical approaches also need to be used to resolve the challenges associated with source shape generation and

1259,many studies have investigated the migration and entrapment processes of source zones from dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination under different conditions however the characterization of occupying area by source zone or source shape in water saturated aquifers is still rudimentarily considered in this study we demonstrated this issue 1 by providing a brief review of existing approaches for source shape consideration 2 by proposing an approach with simple shape parameters based on the non uniformity of source widths and 3 by providing exemplary applications of our proposed approach on shapes already published in previous research works our literature review suggested that the source zone in mathematical approaches is generally characterized as simple geometrical shapes arbitrary lines or rectangles or system defined parameters that contrast to complex and discontinuous shapes observed in the real world but the characterization of such complex shapes is still not possible with acceptable efforts therefore we proposed an approach to parameterize the source shape by considering the variation of width and midpoints over the depth of the entire source zone and formulate four parameters based on population statistics mean standard deviation to illustrate the suitability of our approach we applied it to the results of lab experiments and by analyzing these complex shapes we highlighted the potential for improving the characterization techniques of non uniformity of the source zones keywords dnapl source zone characterization shape

2010 with dnapl being hydrophobic chemical properties such as saturation limits dissolution rates and chemical gradient at the source phase or adjacent plume phase became part of intensive research works from the late 80s to the present numerical simulation has been used as the standard tool especially for detailed assessments of contaminated sites gerhard et al 2014 essaid et al 2015 engelmann et al 2019a categorized numerical simulations for dnapl scenarios into three main stages in that study stage 1 referred to source migration models where dnapl is released and its migration leads to the sz formation this stage can be described by physics based multiphase flow models kueper and gerhard 1995 erning et al 2012 engelmann et al 2021 stage 2 refers to source dissolution models that are investigated by dnapl mass transfer from the sz to the aqueous phase sale and mcwhorter 2001 saenton et al 2002 parker and park 2004 christ et al 2006 2010 finally stage 3 represents plume response models that cover the dnapls downstream of the sz for estimating the extent of contaminant spread at the affected sites prommer et al 2002 falta et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 yadav et al 2014 literature review suggests that stages 1 and 2 typically consider in most cases descriptive parameters of the sz e g pressure saturation permeability dispersivity porosity etc to construct numerical models while stage 3 models often consider simplified shape parameters e g thickness times width of the sz in addition to the descriptive parameters numerical models generally require a large number of site information and thus are not always appropriate when a large number of sites are to be assessed freeze and mcwhorter 1997 analytical approaches provide an alternative to numerical plume response models with comparatively less site information used in them the use of analytical solutions requires certain simplifying assumptions most notably that source zones have regular shapes and the aquifer is mostly homogeneous and isotropic these solutions domenico 1987 anderson et al 1992b liedl et al 2005 generally present the steady state distribution of contaminants as 1 c x y z f s f c x y z where f s is a function that is expected to incorporate characteristic shape parameters that have a unique direct connection with the plume response of the source zone and f c x y z is a function representing the spread of contaminant along spaces x y and z many models e g ham et al 2004 chu et al 2005 liedl et al 2005 2011 cirpka and valocchi 2006 birla et al 2020 have used eq 1 to formulate their mathematical solutions for calculating plume extents e g the steady state maximum plume length l max in these models f s is merely a geometrical quantity that often represents a line or rectangular plane with a dimension of length however studies suggested f s to be more a sensitive quantity controlling the extent of the contamination anderson et al 1992b maier and grathwohl 2006 fure et al 2006 yadav et al 2014 this implies that a better estimate of this quantity or source shape can lead to a more accurate estimate of the extent of contamination thus improving the overall assessment of the sites f s is often considered to be of a very regular shape e g a rectangle see table 2 from the modeling perspective such use of regular source shapes has allowed to study sz processes e g dissolution acting on the plume migration this contrasts with irregular shapes generally observed at the contaminated sites poulsen and kueper 1992 parker et al 2003 einarson et al 2018 therefore it is very likely that the analytical solutions will estimate a higher level of uncertainties here a better quantification of source shape or proxy sz metrics will allow more effective solutions furthermore the use of analytical models can simplify the assessment from preliminary investigations to risk reduction measures of a large number of sites that are known to exist yadav et al 2021 the life stages of the dnapls sz have been studied extensively in laboratory experiments under varied aquifer systems and boundary conditions these studies identified significant aspects of flow properties density solubility interfacial tension etc and aquifer properties porosity grain size distribution temperature intrinsic permeability etc acting on the shape of the sz most of these studies overserved the irregularities of the source shape even in a very minimally heterogeneous medium but any functional method that may lead to the improvement of source shape quantification is still not known to our knowledge no field scale studies or methods have been proposed and validated on quantifying the shape parameter of sz to predict the extent of contaminant spread at the affected sites the conceptualization of the shape parameter is still considered very rudimentarily when plume extensions are calculated by mathematical or experimental approaches national research council 2005 this paper intends to provide a brief literature review on the approaches that have been considered in studying the shape of the sz then we propose an approach to parameterize the source shape by considering the variation of width and midpoints over the depth of the entire source zone and formulate four parameters based on population statistics mean standard deviation in this manner we give a framework to quantify the non uniformity of the source shape next we illustrate the suitability of the approach by analyzing the results of several lab experiments already published in previous research and finally we very briefly present the practicality of our approach 2 current knowledge of source shape quantification the general scenario of releases for dnapls into the soil system is that they first migrate downward through the unsaturated zone under gravitational force and soil capillarity then until the release volume is exhausted or intercepted by impervious layers in the unsaturated zone they penetrate the groundwater table dnapls denser than groundwater and mostly hydrophobic continue migrating through the saturated zone until they reach the aquifer bottom fig 1 the migration path depends on the complex interplay between dnapl and subsurface properties of both unsaturated and saturated zones within the saturated zone it can be exhausted as residual saturation or it can migrate laterally depending on the permeability of the soil in any case dnapls occupy an area in the saturated zone either in quasi or steady state and become a long term source of the contaminated plume pankow and cherry 1996 source zone geometries have been addressed as complex structures in modeling or laboratory assessments the characterization of the shape components pool ganglia blob is possible with numerical modeling if the information on flow and aquifer properties governing dnapl infiltration and entrapment mechanism is known zhang et al 2007 2008 with laboratory assessments the very precise positions of these components can be captured with different imaging methods e g werth et al 2010 however such precise information generally cannot be obtained from the field sites leading to significant inaccuracies in quantifying the sz dimensions trantham and durnford 1999 when field contamination scenarios are predicted simplified sz structures with simple geometrical shape line or rectangle including also simplified domain uniform flow and aquifer parameters are often used in the models domenico 1987 liedl et al 2005 2011 chu et al 2005 maier and grathwohl 2006 karanovic et al 2007 etc the use of simplified sz structures decreases the accuracy of model prediction birla et al 2020 engelmann et al 2019a to the authors best knowledge a detailed quantification method of the real life sz shape is not yet available which relies on direct estimation of the shape dimensions rather than inverse methods to get an overview an attempt is made here to categorically tabulate see table 1 3 the available information related to sz quantification the considered categories are 1 laboratory and field scale studies 2 analytical and empirical studies and 3 numerical studies it is to be noted that this study does not intend to provide a full review of sz quantification approaches but rather a brief demonstration of currently considered approaches to highlight the knowledge gap between real observation and mathematical simulation 2 1 laboratory field scale studies schwille 1988 was among the first to provide detailed laboratory scale investigations on dnapl migration in the study dyed dnapl was infiltrated in the 2d 3d tanks and columns filled with different types of porous media the migration pathways were analyzed with colored photographs many laboratory scale studies have followed the work of schwille 1988 to understand the dnapl migration behavior especially the controlling parameters that govern the infiltration and entrapment mechanism works succeeding schwille 1988 included variations in the experimental setup e g boundary conditions and more sophisticated methods to capture the dnapls migration process colored images of source shapes can be taken by digital camera engelmann et al 2019b 2021 electric impedance tomography chambers et al 2004 magnetic resonance imaging zhang et al 2002 2007 and others imaging methods the captured images are usually then analyzed in several ways to provide the original image marked o in table 1 with minor readjustments and the saturation image marked s in table 1 with more complex post processing techniques e g werth et al 2010 to recreate the original dimension of source shape according to eea european environment agency 2014 the following four steps need to be considered for the assessment of field sites 1 site identification 2 preliminary investigation 3 main site investigation and 4 implementation of risk reduction measures the requirement of sz characterization mainly comes into steps 2 and 3 where the contamination extents are mapped or approximated both source and plume phase to initiate step 4 step 2 generally begins with conventional baseline methods to site specific non invasive methods kästner et al 2012 baseline methods typically refer to sample collections and the following chemical evaluation by off site laboratory methods after acquiring sufficient information in step 3 more detailed investigation methods e g direct push methods dietrich and leven 2009 are applied to approximate the distribution e g of pool ganglia or blob of dnapl mass at both source and plume phase kram et al 2001a has compiled field methods with high potentials particularly for dnapls investigations and provided good comparisons of the available methods however available literature also suggests that very high uncertainties generally exist in approximating the mass distribution of sz in the field page et al 2007 table 1 lists aspects of sz consideration by few laboratory and field scale studies the notable feature of table 1 is the identification of source geometry as structure characterization and boundary delineation here the structure characterization simply refers to how the sz has been reported and the boundary delineation refers to how the sz has been demarcated from the background i e porous medium in that specific study literature works suggest that the lab scale focus has been on 2d saturated and homogeneous domains comparatively lesser works have used heterogeneous 2d domains where heterogeneity is defined as varying permeable layered systems the field scale studies have been performed mainly in heterogeneous and under saturated and or unsaturated domains also as mentioned earlier the shape of sz is accurately nearly and directly captured from lab scale studies while in field studies the shape is always approximated based on different invasive e g excavation or minimally non invasive indirect methods e g geophysical direct push or other approaches 2 2 analytical empirical studies analytical and empirical models have been often used as preliminary investigation techniques for different stages of dnapl contamination scenarios source migration depletion or dissolution and plume response in this study the focus is limited to the plume response models e g quantifying plume extents or maximum plume length l max these models are often simple algebraic expressions including dimensions of source shape e g width and depth see table 2 while applications of these models are quick and straightforward which is a major advantage their development is mainly based on overly simplified conditions such as homogeneous isotropic aquifers with simple reactive mechanisms chu et al 2005 liedl et al 2005 2011 cirpka and valocchi 2006 literature provides analytical models with various degrees of complexity the involved complexity can be the 3d domain with a 2d plane source geometry liedl et al 2011 or the 2d domain with a 1d line source geometry liedl et al 2005 empirical models which can also be simple algebraic expressions like analytical models determine the l max as a function of shape parameter by fitting to field data being a fitting dependent a major drawback of these models is that they cannot be generalized nevertheless these models provide many possibilities to overcome the restrictions of analytical models e g irregular source geometry hydrogeological stresses etc a recent work by birla et al 2020 used a hybrid concept a combination of empirical function and analytical model with the inclusion of recharge as a component of hydraulic stress and source geometry components this model was found to significantly improve the prediction of l max than done by the analytical models however concepts such as hybrid models or truly empirical models have only been used to characterize source zones in limited cases yadav et al 2021 table 2 lists few analytical and empirical models that use finite and simple representation of source geometries in the given plume models these models being less data intensive can be advantageous when site conditions and model constraints match 2 3 numerical studies numerical models are used for detailed investigation of the different stages of dnapl contamination these models can be conveniently grouped into two main categories 1 transport models t model in table 3 and 2 multiphase models mp models in table 3 transport models mainly simulate dissolution processes from sz stage 2 as defined in engelmann et al 2019a and plume response processes stage 3 these processes are mainly based on local equilibrium and kinetic or rate dependent nonequilibrium assumptions frind et al 1999 and largely depend on sz geometries dnapl dissolution properties and hydrodynamic subsurface characteristics engelmann et al 2019a large number of intensive studies have been carried out in the past decades on these types of models the goal of multiphase models is to simulate the source percolation and entrapment processes in the subsurface these processes are based on changes in pressure saturation permeability p s k relations of physical phases miller et al 1998 for the complete analysis of dnapl migration often specialized models are used where transport models t are coupled with multiphase models mp the recent advancements of computational capabilities have allowed for such coupled or mp t models lemke and abriola 2006 miles et al 2008 mclaren et al 2012 significantly more literature is available on transport models compared to the mp models the representation of sz in the transport models is often simplified because transport quantities advection and dispersion and reactive quantities e g sorption or degradation are considered more dominant over the processes at sz shape yadav et al 2014 however more accurate use of the sz shape is likely to improve the predictions of transport models soga et al 2004 but literature directly correlating the sz shape with plume response behavior is limited table 3 provides a very brief overview of different numerical modeling efforts on simulating napl migration the table shows that numerical models can simulate contamination problems that are more natural e g 3d heterogeneous aquifers undergoing different reactions in table 3 complex saturation contour refers to the source shape represented in non uniform distribution of pool ganglia blob while simple contour stands for any uniform and symmetrical geometrical shapes e g line rectangles circle also as shown in table 3 modeling efforts have not always been evaluated against field or laboratory data 2 4 summary tables 1 3 suggest a need for a standard approach for the quantification of source shape which can be simple but acceptable enough to underpin the non uniformity of the complex shape of sz the current approaches for characterizing the sz in analytical empirical models are as geometrical shape parameters width depth or in numerical multiphase models as descriptive parameters pressure saturation permeability dispersivity porosity solubility reaction rate etc few numerical plume response models attempted to quantify the sz as shape parameters except very limited studies used lab scale imaging approaches overall a proxy sz metric is required for underpinning the non uniform shapes while modeling plume responses in field sites in this study we suggested an approach to quantify these non uniform shapes by proposing simple proxy sz metrics however our approach does not intend to provide a final solution for a better estimation of plume lengths yet as it is beyond the scope of this paper it rather intends to emphasize the fact that the complexity of the geometrical shape of sz should be considered in an acceptable manner in the mathematical models so that a more reliable estimation of plume lengths can be achieved for the contaminated sites 3 formulation of an approach for source shape quantification as can be observed in tables 1 3 depth m and width w are the two parameters that are used to describe the 2d source zone sz in this study we assumed z as the penetration depth of the sz for dnapls where the aquifer can be contaminated across the entire thickness z can equal to aquifer depth i e m z however the quantification of source width or w is the more challenging one here a tempting approach for w could be to express it as w f z furthermore it is also realistic to assume that the vertical penetration of source is not always straight downward this could be considered by considering the deviation of the source midpoints dm as a function of depth or dm f z therefore considering several shape factors we presented an approach to quantify the 2d source shape using two observable primary parameters and the associated four additional parameters based on population statistics for lateral spreading see table 4 the statistical parameters in this approach complement the primary parameters and underpin the non uniform lateral extension of the source shape the application of the developed approach is illustrated in section 4 the following text elucidates the general concept of the approach depending on the mass released and the conditions of the underlying subsurface the migration of dnapl into aquifers can follow from a simple pattern to several complex patterns fig 2 visualizes a few possible hypothetical scenarios with the aid of parameters defined in table 4 in fig 2 the complexity of the shape pattern increases from scenario 2i to scenario 2vi in the following manner a in the simplest scenario of 2i the measured width w z green line remains constant const from the released location to the end of penetration i e there is no expansion contraction over the depth z thus the average of measured widths a w remains the same as the released width r bold black line on top here r represents a finite line release in which dnapl infiltrates into aquifers see fig 1 since there is no variation of w z the standard deviation of measured widths equals to zero or s w 0 scenario 2i with a known z and constant w gives the most simple and symmetrical rectangle shape that has been used in the modeling works see table 2 but such existence can rather be exceptional in the field b scenarios 2ii and 2iii also have symmetrical shapes similar to scenario 2i except here w z varies over z i e w z const and therefore a w r and s w 0 an attribute of scenarios 2ii and 2iii also for scenario 2i is the red vertical line showing no measured deviations of source midpoints dm z here dm z 0 means that midpoints of the source body do not deviate from the c r line x 0 along with source depth z the c r line refers to the horizontal position at the midpoint of r represented by the black dotted line in fig 2 thus 2ii and 2iii still assume that the direction of migration is only downward although the source widths w z can vary infinitely this leads to c r a dm s dm 0 where a dm is the average of midpoint deviations and s dm is the standard deviation of midpoint deviations c in addition to w z dm z allows further quantification of lateral migration of the source zone for example scenarios 2iv and 2v are comparable to the 2i as w z const a w r and s w 0 are true for these scenarios but dm z 0 in scenario 2iv leads to a non regular shape compared to that of scenario 2i dm z 0 renders the meandering pattern of source shape as can be observed in scenario 2iv however the upper and lower dm z in 2iv cancel out each other and make a dm 0 but s dm 0 resulting in rather a unique case a more complex pattern appears when dm z 0 and both a dm 0 s dm 0 are true like in scenario 2v d figs 2 i v despite being differently quantified still represents symmetric or simple arbitrary shapes the actual sz is very unlikely to have such shapes in contrast scenario 2vi considers a non symmetric and complex source shape that is likely more realistic in the field this shape is characterized by considering both primary parameters as variables i e w z const and dm z 0 all additional shape parameters a w s w a dm s dm are considered as non zero values and underpin the lateral variabilities of source shape fig 3 presents exemplary distributions of w z and dm z in relative frequency histograms based on arbitrarily chosen values for scenario 2i and 2vi the purpose is only to illustrate that the proposed shape parameters are able to quantify the degree of variation between simplified sz and complex sz scenarios in section 4 3 more demonstrations of such distributions are given quantitatively using six heterogenous lab scale source shapes from the selected literature in fig 3 we used a w to normalize the primary parameter w z dm z values because the shape variability can be better understandable in such a manner fig 3a shows that the normalized widths w z a w calculated from measured widths w z for scenario 2i are always equal to 1 0 referring to no lateral variation of source widths along with the depth similarly fig 3b shows the characteristics for dm z 0 for scenario 2i when no leftward or rightward variation of source midpoints from the c r line is observed referring to vertical straight downward penetration of the source the opposite cases w z a w 1 and dm z a w 0 can be represented depending on shape s variation by any distributions similar to fig 3c and d respectively the distribution of course will be different for different complex source zones depending on the complexity and heterogeneity 4 application of the proposed approach 4 1 data for the evaluation lab scale experiments have mostly used high resolution imaging for the analysis of dnapl experimentations see table 1 six images of source shape see fig 4 from the literature have been selected for the analysis in this work the selected images represent the results of dnapl experimentations and they all provide complex and heterogeneous 2d dnapl source shapes in fully water saturated porous medium two phase system without explaining much on shape quantification approaches next a very brief description of images is provided that will clarify the target evaluation the study by bob et al 2008 called bob in fig 4a provides the image of tetrachloroethylene pce migration for natural sand fractions homogeneous see table 1 in their experimental 2d tanks the undyed dnapl source shape was acquired using a thermoelectrically air cooled charge coupled ccd camera fig 4a left which was then post processed to provide the final saturation image fig 4a right two separate source shapes named here as luc1 and luc2 are considered from one entire source zone of luciano et al 2010 the two areas of interest represented by green dotted lines in fig 4b right separate source planes for luc1 right and luc2 left shapes the purpose here is to demonstrate that the proposed shape parameters of this study have the ability to capture the presence of low permeable layers and most importantly to quantify the degree and nature of lateral spreading originating from such layers luc1 demonstrates in a manner unhindered migration and represents a homogeneous condition while luc2 demonstrates impeded migration and represents a heterogeneous condition due to the presence of a low permeable layer fig 4b left interestingly a notable lateral expansion of shape can be seen on the left of luc1 shape fig 4b right area of interest leftward suggesting a presence of a low permeable layer that is not visible in plain sight eng1 eng2 and eng3 fig 4c 4e obtained from a recent work by engelmann et al 2021 show three repeated experiments of dnapl source migration in homogeneous natural sand fractions they provide mass balance corrected saturation distributions in a logarithm scale with volume balance deviations 5 07 although the images provided improved saturation distributions in general and served well to meet their research goal they caused limitations on calculating shape parameters considered in this study nevertheless engs images are considered here for analysis as they performed repetitive experiments with precisely the same initial conditions it is important to mention that all selected images are migrating snapshots of the early staged source zone the objective is to quantify the shape of sz such that it is fairly distributed over the source plane it is because analytical empirical models often uses simplified shape such as lines or rectangle for characterizing the sz in their models see table 2 a quantification method that can improve the consideration of simple to complex shapes is expected to provide better transport simulations e g better mass dissolution also field studies e g parker et al 2003 showed that local depression in the aquifer aquitard interface may cause thicker dnapl accumulation which remains even in the later stages of the contaminated sites and allows distributed sz over the depth in the study luc1 2 images are acquired at the snap time t 2020 s after the release of dnapl at t 0 s similarly snap time t 100 s is selected for eng1 3 the distance of percolation of the source depends on the combined effect of the surface of the porous media angular versus circular and the grain sizes among other factors lucs used circular glass beads with finer fractions of 0 4 0 8 mm while engs used angular natural sands with coarser fractions of 1 0 2 0 mm in fig 4 at the given time the sources travel vertically 300 mm and 170 mm from the release point to the aquifer bottom approximately for luc1 and eng1 respectively therefore different snap time is selected between lucs and engs for the bob information on snap time t is not available and therefore only one image satisfying the desired condition is analyzed without considering the temporal factor luciano et al 2010 and engelmann et al 2021 provides snapshots also at later times of the source migration but then the distribution of the source zone is mainly at the bottom of the aquifer and the resolution of saturation images is not sufficient for analyzing shapes using the methods see sec 4 2 of this study 4 2 methods for preparing the images for analysis and characterizing the shape parameters the available images provided in fig 4 are not readily useful for the analysis the adopted analyses here are based on measuring the shape quantities directly from images therefore all images is processed such that 1 any form of horizontal or vertical distortion stretching is avoided while extracting of the image from the original literature and 2 unvarying steps i e consistencies are maintained are followed while preparing those images the text below describes the methods adopted for preparing the bob image for the analysis identical steps were used for preparing other images see appendix a in the first step both the original and processed saturation images are cropped from the respective literature bob et al 2008 in this case saturation image provides color based demarcation between water saturated porous media white background and dnapl source area colored background the colored demarcation aids the transferring of shape dimensions to the proposed shape parameter provided in table 4 uniformity with image processing steps e g on the units of measurement is maintained an open source scalable vector graphics software inkscape v1 0 https www inkscape org is used to ensure uniformity for image processing and analyses inkscape s cartesian coordinate system is set up to use millimeters mm as the unit for the length the images luc1 2 eng1 3 that are not in that mm scale are converted to the mm scale using the inkscape s conversion interface appendix fig a1 a5 the second step is then to quantify primary parameters w z dm z of the source shape from the cropped image for that horizontal transects lines each 2 mm apart are drawn extending over the entire source area not shown in fig 5 using the inkscape interface the transects are clipped off at the interfaces between colored contour plot the source and white background the water saturated medium transects that remain inside the source area are only considered fig 5a in the analysis then three control points two endpoints and the midpoint x l z l x r z r x m z m where z l z r z m are assigned on each transect line here x and z represent the horizontal and vertical axis coordinates respectively and the subscripts l r and m represent the left right and mid points respectively the coordinates of the control points are available as tabulated data from the inkscape interface by using these three control points the shape of the source zone can be quantified and plotted shown in fig 5b from the available data the length of transects or the lateral spreads w z of the source is easily obtained from w z x r x l at any given depth the values of x m provide the quantity dm z based on the reference line c r as shown in fig 5b the first transect is placed in the xz plane such that its midpoint x m z m is superposed at x z 0 0 this transect expresses w z 0 and is also referred to as a release width r an imaginary line passing through its midpoints is introduced as the reference line c r x 0 now by letting the remaining transects 56 lines in the bob image placed below r at 2 mm apart from each other vertically we get a w z series w z 2 w z 4 w z 6 w z 112 their midpoints coincide with the c r line here all dm z 0 is considered hypothetically and will result in a symmetrical shaped source zone not shown in fig 5 until this point only observed quantities of w z of the source are considered to obtain an asymmetrical and complex shaped source zone a more realistic case the observed quantities of dm z have to be used as the midpoints x m z m of transects are known an estimate of the actual dm z line can be easily found using their distances from the c r line dm z can take either positive or negative values or be equal to zero for example dm z 110 equals 9 07 mm which means that the midpoint is located 9 07 mm to the left of the c r line thus considering actual quantities of w z and dm w will generate fig 5b that recreates the originally cropped source shape fig 5a fig 5b now provides both the qualitative information of the source zone from original literature and the quantitative information allowing the parameterization of the variability of complex source shape since w z represents positive quantities and dm z represents positive or negative quantities or zero population statistics such as the average a w a dm and the standard deviation s w s dm can easily be derived thus careful preparation of images and quantification of primary parameters from those images allows finding the proposed additional parameters a w s w a dm s dm see table 4 to quantify the variabilities of the shape the values of primary parameters w z dm z are normalized by a w the average width notable variations can be seen in fig 5c and d for the normalized case i e w z a w and dm z a w in fig 5c the area between line x 0 and the green dotted line corresponds to a conventional approach for shape consideration where it is assumed to be a simple rectangle with constant width of a w in contrast the green line shows the percentage variation of w z compared with the conventional approach fig 5d shows the normalized actual deviations red line and normalized average deviation red dotted line of source midpoints from the c r line in both cases s w and s dm black dotted line also normalized by a w give the ranges of the variability of the source shape 4 3 parameterizing source zones from considered images table 5 provides the values of shape parameters for all the considered images in this work an additional statistical parameter coefficient of variation cv s w a w is introduced in the table the purpose of cv is to highlight the variability of source widths w z regardless of the scale of the images however cv does not take negative observations in its distribution hald 1952 since dm z values can be both positive and negative a cv value from dm z observations cannot be presented it is because calculating mean values from negative distances a dm and using it for comparing dispersions of s dm for different images will give no meaningful information depths z and release widths r are also given in the tables to aid the discussion about the approach for shape parameterization of this study the values of primary shape parameters w z dm z are provided as electronic supplementary material s1 in appendix b fig 6 provides the relative frequency histograms for w z a w left column and dm z a w right column while the cv values focus on the magnitude of variability of the source s lateral extension the goal of the left green histograms is to show the w z distributions without considering the individual scale of those source zones similar to fig 3 the black dotted c r lines are added in the right red histograms to show the leftward negative and rightward positive distribution of dm z from the midpoint of release width r 5 discussion 5 1 discussions of the individual studies bob has the smallest shape area among all analyzed images see z and a w values in table 5 however the cv value refers to a notable variation of lateral migration it gives the second highest variability when compared with other images the distribution of w z plotted on the left green in fig 6 as relative frequency terms explain this further the histogram shows a non gaussian distribution or u distribution pattern for bob where the majority of transects lengths w z fall into extreme values 18 belongs to below than 0 5 a w and 18 above than 1 5 a w the positive value of a dm table 6 represents the overall rightward shifting of source midpoints after being released and s dm provides a range of the shifting for dm z additionally the histogram at right red shows the distribution of normalized source midpoints deviations around the c r line x 0 line these deviations of shape can also be shown in fig 5c and d where normalized shape parameters are also plotted over the depth of the source the difference between luc1 and luc2 is due to the presence of an impermeable layer see fig 4b bottom layer on their migration pathways apart from z values the impediment can also be characterized by a w s w a dm and s dm values the presence of the bottom layer causes higher capillary pressure and flow resistance at the left edge of the top layer and therefore allows more dnapl to flow rightward and to be released freely from the right edge the presence of a higher volume of dnapl at the right side can be indicated by observing parameter values for luc1 2 assuming more migrated volume generally causes bigger expansion average and variation standard deviation of source widths at a given space and time luc1 a w s w luc2 a w s w therefore the cv characterizes more variability and mobility of lateral migration for luc1 than luc2 both luc1 and luc2 migrated rightward as a dm is positive the smaller a dm for luc1 may apparently suggest smaller variation but when the s dm is considered together with a dm it shows that luc1 has more variation of the source midpoints than luc2 see appendix fig a1d and a2d this can be better explained by a histogram of dm z a w in fig 6 here 47 and 37 of midpoints are located positively and negatively around the c r line respectively for luc1 in contrast the majority of midpoints 62 are negatively located for luc2 however the bin ranges i e 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 for both cases suggest the midpoints are close to the c r line the histogram of w z a w also elucidates the source shape characteristics further for luc1 and luc2 the distribution of normalized widths is grouped very close to a w for both cases luc1 has two peaks 1 a higher peak with 33 of w z alone in the range of 1 0 1 1 suggesting the source migrates majorly downward with source widths close to a unity a w and 2 a smaller peak with 9 of w z in the range 1 3 1 4 indicating the presence of unexpected lateral migration or pool formation that probably originated from the invisible capillary barrier the lateral migration can be observed readily at the left of luc1 from fig 4b see also fig a1 luc2 also has a secondary peak 20 of w z at 1 2 1 3 which indicates the expected lateral migration due to the visible and intentionally placed bottom left capillary barrier however the difference between the smaller and higher peak for luc2 is not as sharp as that is found for luc1 by observing the peak values and their differences an inference can be made about the nature of the capillary barrier present on the migration pathway thus the main reason to separate the entire source zone into luc1 and luc2 is to investigate the ability of the current approach for quantifying the sz considering capillary barriers the cv values of all three eng images show high w z variabilities with eng1 being the highest and eng2 the lowest however eng2 has a very high a w value mainly because of the vertical fingering at the right see fig a4a in appendix a eng3 is comparatively the smallest shape with the largest r value this suggests migration is impeded here presence of high capillary pressure in shape allowing dnapl to be accumulated over the invisible capillary barrier this accumulation can be understood with the elevated saturation value from fig 4e saturation image this partly explains that eng1 has the maximum penetration and eng3 has the minimum although they both have similar a w values to explain further the migration of eng3 is much slower rather the saturation content is increasing while eng1 is expanding vertically and reducing its saturation over the depth however a significant limitation discussed in section 5 of this approach can be observed from the very small r value of eng1 the source literature does not mention any presence of gradient flow water from any direction or visible impermeable layering in the experimental setup nevertheless patterns of negatively located source midpoints are significantly observed in the histogram of dm z a w in fig 6 resulting in negative a dm values for all eng images eng3 shows the highest variation of midpoints with a dm and s dm values this can be seen in fig a5d and also in the histogram of eng3 where the distribution of normalized midpoints 0 03 reaches the maximum bin range 0 6 0 5 of variation eng1 also shows such a maximum range of distribution but with comparatively fewer frequencies 0 01 histograms of w z a w suggest that among all eng images eng2 approximately follows the gaussian distribution here one fourth of w z is located very close to 0 8 0 9 with other frequencies near this range on the contrary both eng1 and eng3 show rather so call edge peak distributions glen 2015 of w z where a set of outliers are located at extreme ranges 22 and 14 below 0 5 x a w for eng1 and eng3 respectively these extremes originate from the limitation of the approach which is discussed later same as for the r value observed for eng1 5 2 comparative discussions of considered studies fig 6 and table 5 present the range of variations of source widths w z and source midpoints dm z the discussion on individual studies already demonstrates the suitability of the suggested approach to underpin the complex source shapes very plausibly with this information a quantitative and comparative discussions are possible the cv values varied over from 19 for luc2 to a maximum of 50 for eng1 bob has the smallest shape likely because of the volume and boundary condition of its release and pressure saturation characteristics of packing nevertheless a high degree of variability is observed from the cv value thus the cv or ratio of s w to a w adequately quantifies the variations of w z irrespective of the scale of images and conditions mentioned above bob and eng3 have similar z values but their release volume differs significantly 2 ml for bob compared to 20 ml for eng3 this can be demonstrated with the maximum saturation level exceeding well above 0 2 yellow to orange for eng3 in fig 4e but for the bob the maximum saturation does not exceed over 0 2 fig 4a however a similar penetration depth between bob and eng3 can be explained by the higher a w value referring that eng3 tends to expand more laterally than vertically the a dm values generally show that bob and lucs migrate rightward while all the engs migrate leftward after release however for the normalized by a w bob and eng3 show the high variations for midpoints dm z among the analyzed shapes fig 6 right column the sample size six images used in this study is rather very small therefore exact conclusions on frequency distribution may not be very appropriate however luc1 luc2 and eng2 i e three out of six analyzed images indicate toward the gaussian distribution in the relative frequency histogram of w z a w approximately 59 64 and 47 of w z for luc1 luc2 and eng2 respectively fall within the range of 0 8 1 1 three consecutive bins at the middle suggesting their inclination toward the unit source width in contrast bob eng1 and eng3 the other three analyzed shapes do not follow gaussian like distribution from the histogram of dm z a w in fig 6 it is observed that the midpoints apparently tend to deviate more for engs and bob than for lucs all measured dm z are grouped close to the c r line for lucs while they are more widely distributed for engs negatively located and bob positively located the reason for these observations could be that lucs experiments used glass beads while engs and bob used natural sand fractions in their experimental setup the difference in packing materials and their capillary pressure saturation characteristics allowed easy downward migration for dnapl for glass beads while hindered complex and unpredictable migration for sand fractions this behavior can also be observed by comparing fig 5d and fig a1d a5d overall the presentation of histograms fig 6 in this study only explores the quantitative potentials of the proposed approach to quantify the complexity of source shapes and demands further analyses with more source images 5 3 limitations of the approach despite the advantage i e ability to get simplified information from complex realistic source zone the shape parameters defined in this work have a number of limitations and they need to be discussed the most important limitation is that a continuous demarcation line for a source shape is required this explains the small r value for eng1 and small w z values for many transects observed for engs unlike bob and lucs where a continuous boundary line defines the source shape in terms of saturation contour plot engs use a modified image processing and analysis framework to convert the original images into saturation images this representation leads to a very discontinuous distribution of source shape it causes the transects to underestimate the presence of the dnapl source zone in many locations and to be clipped off inaccurately fig a3a a5a table s1 this also explains the oscillation pattern of the dm z line observed in engs shape fig a3d a5d another drawback of this approach is that the r is considered from the value of the first transect at a given snap time the objective of using r is to represent the hypothetical release width of the source body and to highlight the variabilities of source widths w z and midpoints dm z from a finite reference line however it needs to be mentioned that r is not the actual release width reported in the original literature in their experimental setups dnapl releases were initiated as point release within the saturated domain we hypothetically assumed that the first transect acts as a spatial extent or line release like in fig 1 where dnapl has entered into the saturated zone and is allowed to percolate until reaching the aquifer bottom but at the chosen snapshot eng1 migrates downward relatively fast leaving the tailing body of the source at the release location z 0 this caused the small value of r table 5 and smaller upper transects w z table s1 for eng1 5 4 consequences of the approach for modeling purpose and site characterization to this point the suitability of the shape parameters to underpin and quantify the dimensions of complex source shapes has been discussed the consequence of our approach or how this approach can be used further to improve plume estimation needs to be discussed analytical solutions generally overestimate the plume size over what is observed in the field sites it can be improved for example it is very reasonable to assume that the discrepancy between over estimation and actual plume size will reduce if a source shape that corresponds to a w is considered as input in the transport equation additionally considering adm further in those solutions will result in an improved estimation of plume dimension than using a simplified shape e g rectangular patches which is mostly the current practice in analytical models however transport solutions with the inclusion of a dm have to be developed the quantification methods in this work can also improve numerical solutions for plume response models stage 3 see section 1 also in this case the source shape quantities e g a dm must be included as model input parameters moreover more exhaustive analyses e g monte carlo simulation can be made using the proposed shape parameter and they can be combined with analytical or numerical solutions the s w and s dm give ranges of variation of a w and a dm respectively using the range values random source shapes can be generated and the corresponding plumes can be simulated to approximate the most suitable plume extent that fits with experimental data there exist a wide range of geophysical methods ground penetrating radar spectral induced polarization electrical impedance tomography etc and direct push methods laser induced fluorescence raman spectroscopy membrane interface probe optical image profiler electrical conductivity logging etc that can make snapshots of the source zone from the field sites using the image preparation methods section 4 2 on these snapshots the values for shape parameters w z and dm z can be easily obtained and finally an estimation of the contaminant spreads from plume response models can be possible with a certain level of compromise these are only a few possible ways to improve plume investigation in modeling and site characterization using our suggested source metrics more exhaustive research on the utilization will certainly improve the consideration of shape characterization but they go beyond the scope of this paper 6 conclusion and future works this work reassesses the current consideration of source shape quantification techniques for dnapl contamination first by reviewing the literature and then proposing a simple approach to address the lateral migration of complex source shapes the new approach is based on a quantitative description using the parameters given in table 4 the application of the approach on the results of different lab scale experiments demonstrated its suitability as very plausible with this information a quantitative and comparative discussion is provided the approach can be extended further and used to better understand source shape characterization the concept can also be extended for varying penetration depth but these variabilities both lateral width and penetration depth of source shape would be challenging to determine in real field cases in particular the field methods need to be explored and developed to measure the shape parameters another significant challenge is realizing the deviation of source midpoints in available modeling tools for plume estimation mathematical approaches need to be developed or modified to account for the deviations of midpoints and variable widths more exhaustive analyses e g monte carlo simulation of source width or other robust numerical approaches also need to be used to resolve the challenges associated with source shape generation and
