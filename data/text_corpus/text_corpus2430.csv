bonds on the surface of biologically synthesised zobn fig 3 the elevated peaks of uv visible spectrum indicate that the formation of zobn between 340 and 400 nm fig 4 joshi and chhabra 2019 joshi et al 2019a joshi and prakash 2019 3 1 2 fesem and edx field emission scanning electron microscope works with the high energy s electrons and used to observe the morphological characteristics of nanomaterials and these electrons are released from a field emission source the objects are scanned with electrons under high vacuum and electronic signals recorded by detector after emission of electrons from objects joshi et al 2019b joshi and prakash 2019 the fesem images of zobn are represented in fig 5 and the particles of zobn are visible in small cluster forms with poly crystallinity energy dispersive x ray edx with fesem is used in the chemical analysis of nanomaterials joshi et al 2019a and the edx spectrum and chemical composition of zobn are shown in fig 6 and table 1 3 1 3 powder xrd powder x rays diffraction method is highly compact and advanced technique and based on diffraction of x rays from crystals of nanomaterials the diffraction pattern is obtained from the plot intensity versus diffracted angle 2Î¸ this pattern is also known as diffractogram interactions between incident x rays beam and reflected x rays by constructive interferences follow bragg s law and this law is related to spacing between space lattice planes wavelength of x rays and incident angle ramola et al 2019 joshi et al 2019a joshi and chhabra 2019 the xrd pattern of biologically synthesised zobn is represented in fig 7 and some few peaks are different in this pattern from the xrd pattern of pure zinc oxide nanoparticles these clusters of peaks are due to the use of more amounts of leaves extract and reducing the calcination time during synthesis it results the introduction of many extra organic as well as inorganic components in crystal system of zinc oxide from the leaves extract of shorea robusta the characteristic peaks obtained at 31 60 100 34 40 022 36 20 101 47 60 102 56 80 110 62 80 103 and 680 112 are supporting crystallinity of zobn swee yong et al 2012 culity 1987 sathyavathi et al 2010 3 2 adsorption study 3 2 1 effect of contact time ph and dosage the effect of contact time in adsorption process is very helpful in determination of rate of adsorption and other kinetic parameters experimental data of adsorption are indicating that the adsorption efficiency of metal ions increases with the increase of contact time but after a certain time the rate of adsorption becomes constant it is due to the occupation of all binding groups by heavy metal ions joshi et al 2019c the adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions are found as 25 5 and 8 9 at initial contact time 10 min and increasing very regularly to 41 9 and 31 9 at contact time 50 min fig 8 a the maximum adsorption efficiency of pb2 and cd2 ions is found 52 5 and 38 5 at 70 min and then become constant the ph of working solutions is very important parameter to achieve a remarkable adsorption efficiency of heavy metal ions the point of zero charge for pb2 and cd2 ions has been observed at near to ph 4 below this ph adsorption is found minimum joshi et al 2019b zinc ions can also be released into the working solution at lower acidic ph it can also be a remarkable factor to decrease the adsorption potential of zobn whereas at higher acidic ph the released zn2 ions will again reabsorbed due to availability of free or less protolysed or sufficient negative charges onto adsorbent further all binding or active sites become positively charged at lower acidic ph and it results repulsion between active sites and metal ions but at higher acidic ph about all active sites are available for the interactions with metal ions and possibly it causes higher rate of adsorption joshi et al 2018 the adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions are found 6 8 and 4 1 at ph 2 and increases to 32 1 and 21 7 at ph 4 the removal efficiencies 92 9 and 89 9 for pb2 and cd2 ions are found at ph 6 fig 8b the number of binding groups increases with the increase of amount of adsorbent and it improves the adsorption efficiency joshi and bahuguna 2018 in this section we have varied the amount of adsorbent from 0 1 to 1 g at initial dosage 0 1 g of zobn adsorption efficiencies have been recorded 3 5 and 2 1 for pb2 and cd2 ions and increased to 21 9 and 18 9 at 0 5 g further adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions increases significantly up to 35 8 and 29 9 at 0 8 g of zobn maximum efficiencies of adsorption are found as 41 4 and 34 9 at maximum dosage of zobn fig 9 a 3 2 2 effect of temperature and concentration in general the adsorption of metal ion increases with rise of temperature but after a specific temperature it becomes constant due to further dissolution of adsorbed metal ions from adsorbent into working solution adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions were initially found 30 9 and 20 8 at 10 c and increased very regularly to 45 1 and 34 7 after that adsorption becomes constant joshi et al 2018 joshi and bahuguna 2018 fig 9b the adsorption efficiencies of metal ions decrease very sharply with the increase of concentration of metal ions in working solutions but amount of metal ion adsorbates increase it is due to generation of a motive force with variation of concentrations as the initial metal ion concentration joshi and bahuguna 2018 joshi et al 2011 initially adsorption efficiency 31 1 and 24 8 have been recorded for pb2 and cd2 ions at concentration 10 mg l and decreased to 12 0 and 8 6 at 50 mg l of metal ion concentrations fig 10 3 3 kinetics of adsorption adsorption kinetics is helpful in the determination of rate of adsorption of metal ions onto surfaces of adsorbents and mechanism of adsorption therefore data of adsorption of pb2 and cd2 ions were tested with pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particles diffusion models 3 3 1 pseudo first order and intra particle diffusion a mathematical form of pseudo first order kinetic model chen 2015 boulaiche et al 2019 is shown as below ln q q t ln q k 1 t q and qt are the amount of metal ions adsorbed mg g at equilibrium and time t min respectively the constant k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 rate constants k1 for pb2 and cd2 ions have been calculated as 0 011 and 0 010 min 1 fig 11 a respectively regression values indicated that pb2 ions followed more pseudo first order kinetics than cd2 ions table 2 a good correlation of this model for both metal ions indicates that sorption is occurring exclusively onto one site per ion boulaiche et al 2019 kinetics related to rate of diffusion from working solution of waste water to adsorbent is usually demonstrated by intra particle diffusion model lalitha et al 2009 renugadevi et al 2011 diffusion constant kd of pb2 and cd2 ions is calculated by using following kinetic expression q k d t 1 2 i for pb2 and cd2 ions kd have been evaluated as 0 41 and 0 28 mg g min1 2 from the plot q vs t1 2 fig 11b the values of i for both metal ions are found not equal to zero it clearly reveals that intra particle diffusion is not rate limiting step table 2 3 3 2 pseudo second order kinetics and elovich models a linear expression for pseudo second order kinetics ho and mckay 1999 can be written as t q t 1 k 2 q t q the constant k2 represents pseudo second order rate constant g mg min and its values for pb2 and cd2 ions evaluated as 5 62 and 9 38 g mg min from the curve t qt vs t fig 11c with high regression value r2 0 969 pb2 follows pseudo second order model more than cd2 ions table 2 the characteristics of adsorbent desorption constant and rate of chemisorption were demonstrated by using following elovich equation chien and clayton 1980 patil et al 2011 8 q c d ln t the constant c and d are related to initial rate of adsorption mg g min and desorption g mg constant the values of c and d are found as 0 99 2 81 mg g min and 1 27 1 49 g mg for pb2 and cd2 ions table 2 from these values we can say that the desorption constant of cd2 ions is more than pb2 ions 3 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms help in the explanation of process of distribution of metal ions adsorbates between solid and liquid phases the data of equilibrium have been tested with langmuir freundlich temkin and dubbin radushkevich isotherm models the parameters of isotherm models are generally used in the determination of adsorption capacity of adsorbents and suitability of adsorption under batch system 3 4 1 langmuir and freundlich isotherm langmuir isotherm explains the adsorption of metal ions on to the surface of adsorbents contain regularly arranged and definite number of active sites joshi and bahuguna 2018 joshi et al 2011 a mathematical expression for this model is shown as below c e q e 1 k l x c e k l where k1 and x represents langmuir equilibrium constant l g and theoretical monolayer saturation capacity ce and qe are related to equilibrium metal ion concentration mg l and amount of metal ion adsorbate per gram of adsorbent mg g the values of k1 and x evaluated for pb2 ions are 7 19 l g and 0 92 and for and cd2 ions are 12 01 l g and 0 03 from the plot ce qe vs qe fig 12 a value of regression indicates that cd2 ions follows langmuir isotherm model more than pb2 ions table 2 the characteristic dimensionless factor of langmuir isotherm model is represented by rl and defined as below r l 1 1 xc 0 the calculated values of rl for pb2 and cd2 ions are found less than one in all cases it also confirms the suitability of langmuir isotherm model to the adsorption of pb2 and cd2 ions on to the surface of zobn freundlich isotherm bhandari et al 2012 is concerned with the adsorption of metal ions on the heterogeneous surface of adsorbent mathematically this model is defined as below log q e log k f 1 n log c e constant kf mg g and n are freundlich adsorption constant and adsorption intensity values of kf and 1 n are found as 2 42 2 11 mg g and 0 22 0 15 for pb2 and cd2 ions respectively from curve log qe vs log qe fig 12b the values of 1 n 1 and r2 table 2 are indicating that the favourable adsorption of metal ions on zobn 3 4 2 temkin and dubbin radushkevich isotherm temkin isotherm explains bhandari et al 2012 joshi et al 2019b the relationship between adsorbed metal ions and regular linear decrease of heat of adsorption a linear form of temkin model is represented as below q e x y ln c e where x and y are the capacity of adsorption l g and temkin constant their values for pb2 and cd2 ions are evaluated from the curve qe vs ln ce fig 12c and table 3 the value of regression r2 is indicating that the temkin isotherm model is best fitted to pb2 ions table 2 dubinin radushkevich isotherm hu and zhang 2019 is applibale to explain the adsorption mechanisms w r t gaussian energy distribution

order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and elovich kinetic models and langmuir freundlich temkin and dubbin radushkevich isotherm models the adsorption or removal efficiency was calculated by using following expression adsorption or removal efficiency c0 ce x 100 c0 c0 and ce are the metal ion concentrations before and after the adsorption in mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of zobn 3 1 1 ftir and uv visible the broad ir peaks obtained at 3411 cm 1 1571 cm 1 1422 cm 1 1076 cm 1 and 676 cm 1 are indicating the presence of o h co cc c c and zn o or zn c bonds on the surface of biologically synthesised zobn fig 3 the elevated peaks of uv visible spectrum indicate that the formation of zobn between 340 and 400 nm fig 4 joshi and chhabra 2019 joshi et al 2019a joshi and prakash 2019 3 1 2 fesem and edx field emission scanning electron microscope works with the high energy s electrons and used to observe the morphological characteristics of nanomaterials and these electrons are released from a field emission source the objects are scanned with electrons under high vacuum and electronic signals recorded by detector after emission of electrons from objects joshi et al 2019b joshi and prakash 2019 the fesem images of zobn are represented in fig 5 and the particles of zobn are visible in small cluster forms with poly crystallinity energy dispersive x ray edx with fesem is used in the chemical analysis of nanomaterials joshi et al 2019a and the edx spectrum and chemical composition of zobn are shown in fig 6 and table 1 3 1 3 powder xrd powder x rays diffraction method is highly compact and advanced technique and based on diffraction of x rays from crystals of nanomaterials the diffraction pattern is obtained from the plot intensity versus diffracted angle 2Î¸ this pattern is also known as diffractogram interactions between incident x rays beam and reflected x rays by constructive interferences follow bragg s law and this law is related to spacing between space lattice planes wavelength of x rays and incident angle ramola et al 2019 joshi et al 2019a joshi and chhabra 2019 the xrd pattern of biologically synthesised zobn is represented in fig 7 and some few peaks are different in this pattern from the xrd pattern of pure zinc oxide nanoparticles these clusters of peaks are due to the use of more amounts of leaves extract and reducing the calcination time during synthesis it results the introduction of many extra organic as well as inorganic components in crystal system of zinc oxide from the leaves extract of shorea robusta the characteristic peaks obtained at 31 60 100 34 40 022 36 20 101 47 60 102 56 80 110 62 80 103 and 680 112 are supporting crystallinity of zobn swee yong et al 2012 culity 1987 sathyavathi et al 2010 3 2 adsorption study 3 2 1 effect of contact time ph and dosage the effect of contact time in adsorption process is very helpful in determination of rate of adsorption and other kinetic parameters experimental data of adsorption are indicating that the adsorption efficiency of metal ions increases with the increase of contact time but after a certain time the rate of adsorption becomes constant it is due to the occupation of all binding groups by heavy metal ions joshi et al 2019c the adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions are found as 25 5 and 8 9 at initial contact time 10 min and increasing very regularly to 41 9 and 31 9 at contact time 50 min fig 8 a the maximum adsorption efficiency of pb2 and cd2 ions is found 52 5 and 38 5 at 70 min and then become constant the ph of working solutions is very important parameter to achieve a remarkable adsorption efficiency of heavy metal ions the point of zero charge for pb2 and cd2 ions has been observed at near to ph 4 below this ph adsorption is found minimum joshi et al 2019b zinc ions can also be released into the working solution at lower acidic ph it can also be a remarkable factor to decrease the adsorption potential of zobn whereas at higher acidic ph the released zn2 ions will again reabsorbed due to availability of free or less protolysed or sufficient negative charges onto adsorbent further all binding or active sites become positively charged at lower acidic ph and it results repulsion between active sites and metal ions but at higher acidic ph about all active sites are available for the interactions with metal ions and possibly it causes higher rate of adsorption joshi et al 2018 the adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions are found 6 8 and 4 1 at ph 2 and increases to 32 1 and 21 7 at ph 4 the removal efficiencies 92 9 and 89 9 for pb2 and cd2 ions are found at ph 6 fig 8b the number of binding groups increases with the increase of amount of adsorbent and it improves the adsorption efficiency joshi and bahuguna 2018 in this section we have varied the amount of adsorbent from 0 1 to 1 g at initial dosage 0 1 g of zobn adsorption efficiencies have been recorded 3 5 and 2 1 for pb2 and cd2 ions and increased to 21 9 and 18 9 at 0 5 g further adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions increases significantly up to 35 8 and 29 9 at 0 8 g of zobn maximum efficiencies of adsorption are found as 41 4 and 34 9 at maximum dosage of zobn fig 9 a 3 2 2 effect of temperature and concentration in general the adsorption of metal ion increases with rise of temperature but after a specific temperature it becomes constant due to further dissolution of adsorbed metal ions from adsorbent into working solution adsorption efficiencies of pb2 and cd2 ions were initially found 30 9 and 20 8 at 10 c and increased very regularly to 45 1 and 34 7 after that adsorption becomes constant joshi et al 2018 joshi and bahuguna 2018 fig 9b the adsorption efficiencies of metal ions decrease very sharply with the increase of concentration of metal ions in working solutions but amount of metal ion adsorbates increase it is due to generation of a motive force with variation of concentrations as the initial metal ion concentration joshi and bahuguna 2018 joshi et al 2011 initially adsorption efficiency 31 1 and 24 8 have been recorded for pb2 and cd2 ions at concentration 10 mg l and decreased to 12 0 and 8 6 at 50 mg l of metal ion concentrations fig 10 3 3 kinetics of adsorption adsorption kinetics is helpful in the determination of rate of adsorption of metal ions onto surfaces of adsorbents and mechanism of adsorption therefore data of adsorption of pb2 and cd2 ions were tested with pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particles diffusion models 3 3 1 pseudo first order and intra particle diffusion a mathematical form of pseudo first order kinetic model chen 2015 boulaiche et al 2019 is shown as below ln q q t ln q k 1 t q and qt are the amount of metal ions adsorbed mg g at equilibrium and time t min respectively the constant k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 rate constants k1 for pb2 and cd2 ions have been calculated as 0 011 and 0 010 min 1 fig 11 a respectively regression values indicated that pb2 ions followed more pseudo first order kinetics than cd2 ions table 2 a good correlation of this model for both metal ions indicates that sorption is occurring exclusively onto one site per ion boulaiche et al 2019 kinetics related to rate of diffusion from working solution of waste water to adsorbent is usually demonstrated by intra particle diffusion model lalitha et al 2009 renugadevi et al 2011 diffusion constant kd of pb2 and cd2 ions is calculated by using following kinetic expression q k d t 1 2 i for pb2 and cd2 ions kd have been evaluated as 0 41 and 0 28 mg g min1 2 from the plot q vs t1 2 fig 11b the values of i for both metal ions are found not equal to zero it clearly reveals that intra particle diffusion is not rate limiting step table 2 3 3 2 pseudo second order kinetics and elovich models a linear expression for pseudo second order kinetics ho and mckay 1999 can be written as t q t 1 k 2 q t q the constant k2 represents pseudo second order rate constant g mg min and its values for pb2 and cd2 ions evaluated as 5 62 and 9 38 g mg min from the curve t qt vs t fig 11c with high regression value r2 0 969 pb2 follows pseudo second order model more than cd2 ions table 2 the characteristics of adsorbent desorption constant and rate of chemisorption were demonstrated by using following elovich equation chien and clayton 1980 patil et al 2011 8 q c d ln t the constant c and d are related to initial rate of adsorption mg g min and desorption g mg constant the values of c and d are found as 0 99 2 81 mg g min and 1 27 1 49 g mg for pb2 and cd2 ions table 2 from these values we can say that the desorption constant of cd2 ions is more than pb2 ions 3 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms help in the explanation of process of distribution of metal ions adsorbates between solid and liquid phases the data of equilibrium have been tested with langmuir freundlich temkin and dubbin radushkevich isotherm models the parameters of isotherm models are generally used in the determination of adsorption capacity of adsorbents and suitability of adsorption under batch system 3 4 1 langmuir and freundlich isotherm langmuir isotherm explains the adsorption of metal ions on to the surface of adsorbents contain regularly arranged and definite number of active sites joshi and bahuguna 2018 joshi et al 2011 a mathematical expression for this model is shown as below c e q e 1 k l x c e k l where k1 and x represents langmuir equilibrium constant l g and theoretical monolayer saturation capacity ce and qe are related to equilibrium metal ion concentration mg l and amount of metal ion adsorbate per gram of adsorbent mg g the values of k1 and x evaluated for pb2 ions are 7 19 l g and 0 92 and for and cd2 ions are 12 01 l g and 0 03 from the plot ce qe vs qe fig 12 a value of regression indicates that cd2 ions follows langmuir isotherm model more than pb2 ions table 2 the characteristic dimensionless factor of langmuir isotherm model is represented by rl and defined as below r l 1 1 xc 0 the calculated values of rl for pb2 and cd2 ions are found less than one in all cases it also confirms the suitability of langmuir isotherm model to the adsorption of pb2 and cd2 ions on to the surface of zobn freundlich isotherm bhandari et al 2012 is concerned with the adsorption of metal ions on the heterogeneous surface of adsorbent mathematically this model is defined as below log q e log k f 1 n log c e constant kf mg g and n are freundlich adsorption constant and adsorption intensity values of kf and 1 n are found as 2 42 2 11 mg g and 0 22 0 15 for pb2 and cd2 ions respectively from curve log qe vs log qe fig 12b the values of 1 n 1 and r2 table 2 are indicating that the favourable adsorption of metal ions on zobn 3 4 2 temkin and dubbin radushkevich isotherm temkin isotherm explains bhandari et al 2012 joshi et al 2019b the relationship between adsorbed metal ions and regular linear decrease of heat of adsorption a linear form of temkin model is represented as below q e x y ln c e where x and y are the capacity of adsorption l g and temkin constant their values for pb2 and cd2 ions are evaluated from the curve qe vs ln ce fig 12c and table 3 the value of regression r2 is indicating

12151,due to the decrease in groundwater quality as a result of irregular exploration of groundwater resources the recognition of areas for obtaining groundwater suitable for drinking has become an important and significant topic in this study two multi criteria decision making mcdm methods were compared to determine suitable areas for drinking water harvest ahp and fahp also ten parameters were used for the decision criteria applied sodium calcium magnesium nitrate tds so4 electrical conductivity ec chloride cl drawdown s and transmissivity coefficient their values were calculated using ahp and fahp based on the influence of the value of each parameter on the raster layer all raster layers in the gis were merged into two final layers by comparison the final layer of the fahp is more in conformity with reality as compared with the ultimate layer of ahp graphical abstract image 1 keywords analytic hierarchy process ahp fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp gis geographic information system drinking water harvest dwh 1 introduction groundwater has been considered valuable due to its flow towards surface water and being able to meet human requirements such as drinking agriculture and industry the significance of safe drinking water and influence of different factors have made the location of drinking water an importance topic the location of suitable areas for drinking water harvest using modern scientific methods can prevent the stupendous costs of digging wells also the use of modern methods can help determine suitable locations in comprehensive areas within a short time each parameter has different effects on location and as such it is necessary to calculate their weights based on their degrees of significance for this purpose ahp and fahp methods were used and their results were compared 1 1 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp the analytic hierarchy process ahp is designed to structure a decision process in a scenario affected by multiple independent factors in the analysis a complex problem can be divided in to several sub problems that are organized according to hierarchical levels where each level denotes a set of criteria or attributes related to each sub problem the top level of the hierarchy denotes the goal of the problem and the intermediate levels denote the factors of the respective upper levels meanwhile the bottom level contains the alternative or actions considered when achieving the goal ahp permits factors to be compared with the importance of individual factors being relative to their effects on the problem solution and the priority list of the considered alternative to be reached saaty 1980 2003 saaty and vargas 1990 the analysis is based on three fundamental principles breaking down the problem pairwise comparison of the various alternatives and synthesis of the preferences the first step of the analysis consists of subdividing the decision making problem into several levels in such a way that they form a hierarchy with unidirectional hierarchical relationships between levels the decomposition is carried out from the top to the bottom starting from the objective and going on to the criteria and sub criteria and then to the final alternatives as soon as the hierarchy is constructed the decision elements are compared pairwise in terms of their importance for their control criterion particularly decision makers dms are asked to respond to a series of pairwise comparisons in which two elements at a time are compared in terms of their contribution to their specific upper level criteria the values of relative importance are determined on a 9 point scale the so called saaty s fundamental scale the numerical judgments established at each level of the hierarchy make up pair matrixes after comparison matrixes are created the relative weights of the elements of each level with respect to an element in the adjacent upper level are computed as the components of the normalized eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of their comparison matrix therefore it can be said that the eigenvector method yields a natural measure of consistency the consistency index ci is defined as saaty 1980 1 c i Î» m a x n n 1 where Î» m a x is the maximum eigenvalue and n is the number of factors in the judgment matrix accordingly saaty 1980 defined the consistency ratio cr as 2 c r c i r i where ri is the consistency index of a randomly generated reciprocal matrix from the 9 point scale with forced reciprocals to overcome all these shortcomings fahp was developed for solving hierarchical problems decision makers usually find that it is more confident to give interval judgments than fixed value judgments this is because he she is usually unable to define his her preference explicitly about the fuzzy nature of the comparison process kahraman et al 2003a b this study proposes the use of fahp for determining the weights of the main criteria numerous fuzzy ahp methods and applications have been proposed by various researchers in the literature chang et al 2003 developed a methodology for performance evaluation of airports they used the gray statistics method in selecting the criteria and fahp method in determining criteria weights finally they adopted fuzzy synthetic and topsis approach for the ranking of airport performance the fahp method is used to determine weightings for the evaluation criteria among decision makers mikhailov and tsvetinov 2004 focused on the constraints that have to be considered within fahp they used constrained fahp in project selection kahraman et al 2004 used the fahp for comparing several catering firms in turkey the means of the triangular fuzzy numbers produced by the customers and experts for each comparison were successfully used in the pair wise comparison matrices tang and beynon 2005 used the fahp method for the application and development of a capital investment study they attempted to select the type of fleet car that need to be adopted by a car rental company tolga et al 2005 provided an analytical tool to evaluate project risks under incomplete and vague information they used fahp to evaluate the riskiness of an information technology project of a turkish company ayag and ozdemir 2006 proposed an intelligent approach based on fahp for evaluating machine tool alternatives first they used fahp to weight the alternatives under multiple attributes and thereafter carried out a benefit cost ratio analysis using both the fahp score and the procurement cost of each alternative ertugrul and karakasoglu 2006 anane et al 2012 ranked suitable sites for irrigation with tww using fuzzy ahp based on gis where the nabeul hammamet aquifer catchment tunisia was selected as the target area they believe that the model is relatively simple and is extendable worldwide several influential parameters were identified considering simultaneously technical social economical and environmental aspects they were grouped into five main criteria namely land suitability for irrigation resources conflicts cost effectiveness social acceptance and environmental impact using gis geographical layers were obtained for the sub criteria leading to mapping and ranking of suitable sites for tww irrigation the results showed that the total suitable area covers 11 426 ha which represents 31 of the total nabeul hammamet aquifer watershed mokarram and sathyamoorthy 2016 were used to study the relationship between drinking water quality based on content of inorganic components and landform classes in the south of firozabad west of fars province iran by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process ahp in the study they determined that without measurement of water sample characteristics we can determine water quality by landform classes mosase et al 2017 compared the accuracy of ahp and fahp methods in determining the appropriate location of rwh in south east district of botswana and eventually concluded that even though ahp is widely used in the decision analysis it is not capable of modeling the uncertainties inherent in the criteria and the confidence of the decision maker maddahi et al 2017 used fuzzy multi criteria decision making technique integrated with the gis to assess suitable areas for rice cultivation in amol district iran abdel rahman alshabib 2016 used ahp and gis to select potential sites for water harvesting sites in azraq basin jordan maina and raude 2016 to assess the suitability of the land for rainwater harvesting using geographic techniques their components included runoff altitude lines and slope that used soil texture and land use to obtain runoff they used a sensitivity analysis to weight the criteria dabiri et al 2016 determined site of rain water harvesting rwh using four main criteria including physiographic rain full vegetation and soil factors at the second stage standardized and weighted factors based on ahp and finally each layer was multiplied by its weight their results showed that the most important factor for site selection of rwh is slope but the importance of elevation classes factor was greater than the slope factor in the pitting method in comparison with farrowing method hussein et al 2015 use gis and rs for selection of rain water harvesting sites in kirkuk iraq the methods were integrated with the ahp method to evaluate the parameters that significantly contribute to rwh site selection they use thematic layers such as runoff depth slope drainage and land use the main objective of the present study was to compare the two methods ahp and fahp in order to determine suitable area to pump groundwater for drinking however to the best of our knowledge this is the first study carried out in this regard 2 material and methods 2 1 study area birjand s aquifer is one of the sub basins of loot wilderness it is the most important plain in southern khorana in the east of iran and it is situated 480 km away from the south of mashhad city with 32 34 than 33 8 northern latitude and 58 41 than 59 44 eastern longitude it has a zone area of about 3435 km2 of which 980 km2 is plain and the rest is mountain 2 2 data in order to determine the best places for pumping drinking water already existing data of quality parameters collected from 18 wells and 5 qanats in this plain were used the locations of these wells are shown in fig 1 2 3 interpolation of decision criteria in gis using different methods of interpolation the decision criteria of point data were interpolated in the entire plain the rmse index was used for assessing the best method of interpolation 2 4 designing of fuzzy layers after the interpolation and preparation of raster layers of criteria these layers were transformed to fuzzy layers using fuzzy membership functions thus several samples of these functions are shown in fig 2 in these functions based on the raw data collection criteria the value between 0 and 1 was given to each member using the shuller index table scale for drinking water the value procedure type decrease increase decrease increase or increase decrease of each criterion was determined suitable fuzzy function for creating fuzzy layers of criteria were selected based on the value procedure type of each criterion arezoomand omidi langrudi et al 2016 2 4 1 application of ahp hierarchical structure the final objective is broken down into several levels frame questionnaire and collection of expert s opinion about significance of criteria using saatys 9 point scale table creation of pair wise comparison matrix table 1 the matrices were analyzed for consistency the priority of the elements was compared by the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors 5 r w Î» m a x w where w is the weight vector of matrix r and Î» max is the largest eigenvalue of r the consistency property of the matrix is then checked to ensure the consistency of judgments in the pairwise comparison the consistency index ci and consistency ratio cr are defined as follows the average consistency index of the randomly generated pair wise comparison matrix of similar size are shown in table 2 if the consistency test is not passed the original values in the pair wise comparison matrix must be revised by the decision maker 2 4 2 application of the fahp 1 creation of fuzzy pair wise comparison matrix 2 the scores of the pair wise comparisons were transformed into variables which were represented by positive triangular fuzzy numbers as listed in table 3 lu et al 2009 in this method the decision maker can express pair wise comparison of elements in each level with triangular fuzzy numbers the triangular fuzzy number a b c is shown in fig 2 3 based on the lambda max method proposed by csutora and buckley 2001 fuzzy weights of the decision elements were calculated using the following procedures application of Î± cut let Î± 1 to obtain the positive matrix of the decision maker k r b k and let Î± 0 to obtain the lower bound and upper bound positive matrices of the decision maker k r a k and r c k 6 Î± 1 r b k r i j b k Î± 0 r a k r i j a k r c k r i j c k based on the weight calculation procedure proposed in ahp the weight matrix is calculated as 7 w b k w i b k w a k w i a k w c k w i c k i 1 2 n in order to minimize the fuzziness of the weight two constants m a k and m c k were chosen as follows 8 m a k m i n w i b k w i a k 1 i n m c k m a x w i b k w i c k 1 i n the upper and lower bounds of the weight are defined as 9 w ia k m a k w i a k w i c k m c k w i c k the upper and lower bound weight matrices are 10 w a k w i a k w c k w i c k i 1 2 n by combining w a k w b k and w c k the fuzzy weight matrix for decision maker k can be obtained and is defined as 11 w i k w i a k w i b k w i c k i 1 2 n 5 integrating the opinions of decision makers a geometric average was applied to combine the fuzzy weights of different decision makers 12 w k 1 k w i k 1 k where w is the combined fuzzy weight of the decision element i of k decision makers w i k is the fuzzy weight of the decision element i of the decision maker k and k is the number of decision makers 6 defuzzification based on the equation proposed by chen 2000 a proximity coefficient was defined to obtain the ranking order of the decision elements the proximity coefficient is defined as follows 13 c c i d w i 0 d w i 1 d w i 0 i 1 2 n 0 c c i 1 14 d w i 0 1 3 w i a 0 2 w i b 0 2 w i c 0 2 15 d w i 1 1 3 w i a 1 2 w i b 1 2 w i c 1 2 where d w i 0 and d w i 1 are the distance measurements between two fuzzy numbers table 4 2 5 chi square Ï2 test based on the differences between the weights obtained from the different methods chi square Ï2 test was carried out to examine if there is any difference between the results obtained using the ahp and fahp methods the maps obtained using the aforementioned methods show five classes of priority locations the map obtained using ahp comprised of 9454 pixels in the class of priority one while the map obtained using fuzzy ahp comprised of 5832 pixels in the class of priority one in the chi square test the maps were assessed by comparing the number of pixels of aquifer in each priority class using the ahp and fuzzy ahp the chi square test for examining the independence of the two variables begins with a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis the null hypothesis states that there is no relationship between the variables the alternative hypothesis indicates the existence of some relationship between the variables dowdy et al 2004 here in this case the null and alternative hypotheses are defined as null hypothesis h0 the results of both methods ahp and fahp are similar and proximate alternative hypothesis h1 the results of both methods ahp and fahp have a meaningful difference the chi square statistic value can be calculated using the following formula dowdy et al 2004 16 x 2 i o i e i 2 e i where oi is the observed value here in this case o is equal to the vector which indicates the number of pixels in each class of the ahp map and ei is the expected value here e is equal to the vector and indicates the number of pixels in each priority class of the map related to fahp 3 results and discussion map making is always one of the most important steps in any research the results showed that kriging method was determined as the best method of interpolation owing to its least rmse content the interpolation of decision index using this method is shown in table 5 khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 the main purpose of this study was to determine a suitable area for harvesting drinking water using ahp and fahp methods and by comparing both methods the results obtained from the determination of a suitable location using the mentioned methods are thus explained with the influence of the calculated fuzzy and classic weights table 5 sequence in fuzzy layers and common raster layers the real values of surface plain pixels were obtained thereafter the common raster layers with common algebraic sum and the fuzzy layers with fuzzy algebraic sum were combined and thus the final water drinking harvest maps were created as shown in figs 2 and 3 in each of the two methods the final maps were classified into five levels weak average rather good good very good using the natural breaks jenks method in this method the frequency graph of each pixel is plotted cumulatively and then determined the value of classes range number based on the fracture diagrams in the final map of ahp 25 3 28 7 23 8 18 3 and 4 3 aquifer and in the final map of fahp 14 8 20 8 30 4 26 5 and 7 45 of aquifer were classified in sequence as weak average rather good good and very good classes respectively as shown in figs 3 and 4 the best areas for harvesting drinking water in the final map of ahp is located almost in the center and to the west of the aquifer while the ultimate map of fahp shows results that are almost contrary to that of ahp in the final map of fahp the best points for harvesting drinking water are specified in the eastern areas of the aquifer and as it proceeds to the western areas the pixels decreased in value figs 5 and 6 show the location of drinking water wells that exist in this plain and can be used to compare the delicacy of these methods in locating suitable areas for harvesting drinking water as shown in the figures the location of these wells are more compatible with the final map of fahp as compared with the final map of ahp results showed that the more of the drinking wells for fahp method located in very good zone the obtained chi square value was 4867 3 which is far higher than the critical Ï2 value indicating that the null hypothesis must be rejected and the alternative hypothesis should be accepted thus the Ï2test in this case showed that there is a meaningful difference between the results of the two methods ahp and fahp the reason for this difference can be attributed to the use of fuzzy layers criteria in the fahp method and the use of typical layers in the ahp method for example the fuzzy layers of criteria such as t and s table 6 recorded the highest weight in the east and central regions had good condition but their typical layers had no suitable condition in the eastern part of the aquifer but towards the central areas of the aquifer their conditions were better analysis of the ahp method showed that pixels with the most raw content of each decision parameter were the best pixels and this is a problem because with this logic the best pixels even in decreased criteria are pixels that have the most raw content of each decision parameter for example nitrate and drawdown are decrease criteria because their contents could decrease further the value of an area while in the ahp method the points with more nitrate or drawdown are the best in the fahp method this weakness can be removed using fuzzy membership functions these functions give the most values to points with the least raw content in decrease criteria therefore this method is closer to reality figs 7 and 8 if the null hypothesis is correct then o e for each class and Ï2 0 therefore the results of both methods ahp and fahp are similar and proximate if the alternative hypothesis is correct then o e and the overall value of the test is large if the obtained value is small then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected to determine whether the obtained value is small or large some items should be considered one of such items is the degree of freedom df which in this case is the number of priority classes in each map 5 minus one multiplied by the number of examining maps 2 minus one 5 1 2 1 4 significance level is another item of distribution which should be selected in the study traditionally researchers use the 0 05 level which is sometimes referred to as the 5 significance level in this study the same level was chosen as it provides a good reference point for the final judgment from the table of Ï2 distribution the critical Ï2 value can be determined when the significance level and the degree of freedom are known in this case with 4 degrees of freedom and 0 05 levels of significance for the critical Ï2 value a total of 9 488 is extracted from the distribution table if the Ï2 value obtained from the test is higher than the critical Ï2 value then the null hypothesis is rejected and if the Ï2 value of the test is reported as smaller than the critical Ï2 value the null hypothesis of no relationship between the variables cannot be rejected dowdy et al 2004 the number of pixels in each priority class of the maps required for performing the chi square test are shown in table 6 the

12151,due to the decrease in groundwater quality as a result of irregular exploration of groundwater resources the recognition of areas for obtaining groundwater suitable for drinking has become an important and significant topic in this study two multi criteria decision making mcdm methods were compared to determine suitable areas for drinking water harvest ahp and fahp also ten parameters were used for the decision criteria applied sodium calcium magnesium nitrate tds so4 electrical conductivity ec chloride cl drawdown s and transmissivity coefficient their values were calculated using ahp and fahp based on the influence of the value of each parameter on the raster layer all raster layers in the gis were merged into two final layers by comparison the final layer of the fahp is more in conformity with reality as compared with the ultimate layer of ahp graphical abstract image 1 keywords analytic hierarchy process ahp fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp gis geographic information system drinking water harvest dwh 1 introduction groundwater has been considered valuable due to its flow towards surface water and being able to meet human requirements such as drinking agriculture and industry the significance of safe drinking water and influence of different factors have made the location of drinking water an importance topic the location of suitable areas for drinking water harvest using modern scientific methods can prevent the stupendous costs of digging wells also the use of modern methods can help determine suitable locations in comprehensive areas within a short time each parameter has different effects on location and as such it is necessary to calculate their weights based on their degrees of significance for this purpose ahp and fahp methods were used and their results were compared 1 1 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp the analytic hierarchy process ahp is designed to structure a decision process in a scenario affected by multiple independent factors in the analysis a complex problem can be divided in to several sub problems that are organized according to hierarchical levels where each level denotes a set of criteria or attributes related to each sub problem the top level of the hierarchy denotes the goal of the problem and the intermediate levels denote the factors of the respective upper levels meanwhile the bottom level contains the alternative or actions considered when achieving the goal ahp permits factors to be compared with the importance of individual factors being relative to their effects on the problem solution and the priority list of the considered alternative to be reached saaty 1980 2003 saaty and vargas 1990 the analysis is based on three fundamental principles breaking down the problem pairwise comparison of the various alternatives and synthesis of the preferences the first step of the analysis consists of subdividing the decision making problem into several levels in such a way that they form a hierarchy with unidirectional hierarchical relationships between levels the decomposition is carried out from the top to the bottom starting from the objective and going on to the criteria and sub criteria and then to the final alternatives as soon as the hierarchy is constructed the decision elements are compared pairwise in terms of their importance for their control criterion particularly decision makers dms are asked to respond to a series of pairwise comparisons in which two elements at a time are compared in terms of their contribution to their specific upper level criteria the values of relative importance are determined on a 9 point scale the so called saaty s fundamental scale the numerical judgments established at each level of the hierarchy make up pair matrixes after comparison matrixes are created the relative weights of the elements of each level with respect to an element in the adjacent upper level are computed as the components of the normalized eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of their comparison matrix therefore it can be said that the eigenvector method yields a natural measure of consistency the consistency index ci is defined as saaty 1980 1 c i Î» m a x n n 1 where Î» m a x is the maximum eigenvalue and n is the number of factors in the judgment matrix accordingly saaty 1980 defined the consistency ratio cr as 2 c r c i r i where ri is the consistency index of a randomly generated reciprocal matrix from the 9 point scale with forced reciprocals to overcome all these shortcomings fahp was developed for solving hierarchical problems decision makers usually find that it is more confident to give interval judgments than fixed value judgments this is because he she is usually unable to define his her preference explicitly about the fuzzy nature of the comparison process kahraman et al 2003a b this study proposes the use of fahp for determining the weights of the main criteria numerous fuzzy ahp methods and applications have been proposed by various researchers in the literature chang et al 2003 developed a methodology for performance evaluation of airports they used the gray statistics method in selecting the criteria and fahp method in determining criteria weights finally they adopted fuzzy synthetic and topsis approach for the ranking of airport performance the fahp method is used to determine weightings for the evaluation criteria among decision makers mikhailov and tsvetinov 2004 focused on the constraints that have to be considered within fahp they used constrained fahp in project selection kahraman et al 2004 used the fahp for comparing several catering firms in turkey the means of the triangular fuzzy numbers produced by the customers and experts for each comparison were successfully used in the pair wise comparison matrices tang and beynon 2005 used the fahp method for the application and development of a capital investment study they attempted to select the type of fleet car that need to be adopted by a car rental company tolga et al 2005 provided an analytical tool to evaluate project risks under incomplete and vague information they used fahp to evaluate the riskiness of an information technology project of a turkish company ayag and ozdemir 2006 proposed an intelligent approach based on fahp for evaluating machine tool alternatives first they used fahp to weight the alternatives under multiple attributes and thereafter carried out a benefit cost ratio analysis using both the fahp score and the procurement cost of each alternative ertugrul and karakasoglu 2006 anane et al 2012 ranked suitable sites for irrigation with tww using fuzzy ahp based on gis where the nabeul hammamet aquifer catchment tunisia was selected as the target area they believe that the model is relatively simple and is extendable worldwide several influential parameters were identified considering simultaneously technical social economical and environmental aspects they were grouped into five main criteria namely land suitability for irrigation resources conflicts cost effectiveness social acceptance and environmental impact using gis geographical layers were obtained for the sub criteria leading to mapping and ranking of suitable sites for tww irrigation the results showed that the total suitable area covers 11 426 ha which represents 31 of the total nabeul hammamet aquifer watershed mokarram and sathyamoorthy 2016 were used to study the relationship between drinking water quality based on content of inorganic components and landform classes in the south of firozabad west of fars province iran by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process ahp in the study they determined that without measurement of water sample characteristics we can determine water quality by landform classes mosase et al 2017 compared the accuracy of ahp and fahp methods in determining the appropriate location of rwh in south east district of botswana and eventually concluded that even though ahp is widely used in the decision analysis it is not capable of modeling the uncertainties inherent in the criteria and the confidence of the decision maker maddahi et al 2017 used fuzzy multi criteria decision making technique integrated with the gis to assess suitable areas for rice cultivation in amol district iran abdel rahman alshabib 2016 used ahp and gis to select potential sites for water harvesting sites in azraq basin jordan maina and raude 2016 to assess the suitability of the land for rainwater harvesting using geographic techniques their components included runoff altitude lines and slope that used soil texture and land use to obtain runoff they used a sensitivity analysis to weight the criteria dabiri et al 2016 determined site of rain water harvesting rwh using four main criteria including physiographic rain full vegetation and soil factors at the second stage standardized and weighted factors based on ahp and finally each layer was multiplied by its weight their results showed that the most important factor for site selection of rwh is slope but the importance of elevation classes factor was greater than the slope factor in the pitting method in comparison with farrowing method hussein et al 2015 use gis and rs for selection of rain water harvesting sites in kirkuk iraq the methods were integrated with the ahp method to evaluate the parameters that significantly contribute to rwh site selection they use thematic layers such as runoff depth slope drainage and land use the main objective of the present study was to compare the two methods ahp and fahp in order to determine suitable area to pump groundwater for drinking however to the best of our knowledge this is the first study carried out in this regard 2 material and methods 2 1 study area birjand s aquifer is one of the sub basins of loot wilderness it is the most important plain in southern khorana in the east of iran and it is situated 480 km away from the south of mashhad city with 32 34 than 33 8 northern latitude and 58 41 than 59 44 eastern longitude it has a zone area of about 3435 km2 of which 980 km2 is plain and the rest is mountain 2 2 data in order to determine the best places for pumping drinking water already existing data of quality parameters collected from 18 wells and 5 qanats in this plain were used the locations of these wells are shown in fig 1 2 3 interpolation of decision criteria in gis using different methods of interpolation the decision criteria of point data were interpolated in the entire plain the rmse index was used for assessing the best method of interpolation 2 4 designing of fuzzy layers after the interpolation and preparation of raster layers of criteria these layers were transformed to fuzzy layers using fuzzy membership functions thus several samples of these functions are shown in fig 2 in these functions based on the raw data collection criteria the value between 0 and 1 was given to each member using the shuller index table scale for drinking water the value procedure type decrease increase decrease increase or increase decrease of each criterion was determined suitable fuzzy function for creating fuzzy layers of criteria were selected based on the value procedure type of each criterion arezoomand omidi langrudi et al 2016 2 4 1 application of ahp hierarchical structure the final objective is broken down into several levels frame questionnaire and collection of expert s opinion about significance of criteria using saatys 9 point scale table creation of pair wise comparison matrix table 1 the matrices were analyzed for consistency the priority of the elements was compared by the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors 5 r w Î» m a x w where w is the weight vector of matrix r and Î» max is the largest eigenvalue of r the consistency property of the matrix is then checked to ensure the consistency of judgments in the pairwise comparison the consistency index ci and consistency ratio cr are defined as follows the average consistency index of the randomly generated pair wise comparison matrix of similar size are shown in table 2 if the consistency test is not passed the original values in the pair wise comparison matrix must be revised by the decision maker 2 4 2 application of the fahp 1 creation of fuzzy pair wise comparison matrix 2 the scores of the pair wise comparisons were transformed into variables which were represented by positive triangular fuzzy numbers as listed in table 3 lu et al 2009 in this method the decision maker can express pair wise comparison of elements in each level with triangular fuzzy numbers the triangular fuzzy number a b c is shown in fig 2 3 based on the lambda max method proposed by csutora and buckley 2001 fuzzy weights of the decision elements were calculated using the following procedures application of Î± cut let Î± 1 to obtain the positive matrix of the decision maker k r b k and let Î± 0 to obtain the lower bound and upper bound positive matrices of the decision maker k r a k and r c k 6 Î± 1 r b k r i j b k Î± 0 r a k r i j a k r c k r i j c k based on the weight calculation procedure proposed in ahp the weight matrix is calculated as 7 w b k w i b k w a k w i a k w c k w i c k i 1 2 n in order to minimize the fuzziness of the weight two constants m a k and m c k were chosen as follows 8 m a k m i n w i b k w i a k 1 i n m c k m a x w i b k w i c k 1 i n the upper and lower bounds of the weight are defined as 9 w ia k m a k w i a k w i c k m c k w i c k the upper and lower bound weight matrices are 10 w a k w i a k w c k w i c k i 1 2 n by combining w a k w b k and w c k the fuzzy weight matrix for decision maker k can be obtained and is defined as 11 w i k w i a k w i b k w i c k i 1 2 n 5 integrating the opinions of decision makers a geometric average was applied to combine the fuzzy weights of different decision makers 12 w k 1 k w i k 1 k where w is the combined fuzzy weight of the decision element i of k decision makers w i k is the fuzzy weight of the decision element i of the decision maker k and k is the number of decision makers 6 defuzzification based on the equation proposed by chen 2000 a proximity coefficient was defined to obtain the ranking order of the decision elements the proximity coefficient is defined as follows 13 c c i d w i 0 d w i 1 d w i 0 i 1 2 n 0 c c i 1 14 d w i 0 1 3 w i a 0 2 w i b 0 2 w i c 0 2 15 d w i 1 1 3 w i a 1 2 w i b 1 2 w i c 1 2 where d w i 0 and d w i 1 are the distance measurements between two fuzzy numbers table 4 2 5 chi square Ï2 test based on the differences between the weights obtained from the different methods chi square Ï2 test was carried out to examine if there is any difference between the results obtained using the ahp and fahp methods the maps obtained using the aforementioned methods show five classes of priority locations the map obtained using ahp comprised of 9454 pixels in the class of priority one while the map obtained using fuzzy ahp comprised of 5832 pixels in the class of priority one in the chi square test the maps were assessed by comparing the number of pixels of aquifer in each priority class using the ahp and fuzzy ahp the chi square test for examining the independence of the two variables begins with a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis the null hypothesis states that there is no relationship between the variables the alternative hypothesis indicates the existence of some relationship between the variables dowdy et al 2004 here in this case the null and alternative hypotheses are defined as null hypothesis h0 the results of both methods ahp and fahp are similar and proximate alternative hypothesis h1 the results of both methods ahp and fahp have a meaningful difference the chi square statistic value can be calculated using the following formula dowdy et al 2004 16 x 2 i o i e i 2 e i where oi is the observed value here in this case o is equal to the vector which indicates the number of pixels in each class of the ahp map and ei is the expected value here e is equal to the vector and indicates the number of pixels in each priority class of the map related to fahp 3 results and discussion map making is always one of the most important steps in any research the results showed that kriging method was determined as the best method of interpolation owing to its least rmse content the interpolation of decision index using this method is shown in table 5 khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 the main purpose of this study was to determine a suitable area for harvesting drinking water using ahp and fahp methods and by comparing both methods the results obtained from the determination of a suitable location using the mentioned methods are thus explained with the influence of the calculated fuzzy and classic weights table 5 sequence in fuzzy layers and common raster layers the real values of surface plain pixels were obtained thereafter the common raster layers with common algebraic sum and the fuzzy layers with fuzzy algebraic sum were combined and thus the final water drinking harvest maps were created as shown in figs 2 and 3 in each of the two methods the final maps were classified into five levels weak average rather good good very good using the natural breaks jenks method in this method the frequency graph of each pixel is plotted cumulatively and then determined the value of classes range number based on the fracture diagrams in the final map of ahp 25 3 28 7 23 8 18 3 and 4 3 aquifer and in the final map of fahp 14 8 20 8 30 4 26 5 and 7 45 of aquifer were classified in sequence as weak average rather good good and very good classes respectively as shown in figs 3 and 4 the best areas for harvesting drinking water in the final map of ahp is located almost in the center and to the west of the aquifer while the ultimate map of fahp shows results that are almost contrary to that of ahp in the final map of fahp the best points for harvesting drinking water are specified in the eastern areas of the aquifer and as it proceeds to the western areas the pixels decreased in value figs 5 and 6 show the location of drinking water wells that exist in this plain and can be used to compare the delicacy of these methods in locating suitable areas for harvesting drinking water as shown in the figures the location of these wells are more compatible with the final map of fahp as compared with the final map of ahp results showed that the more of the drinking wells for fahp method located in very good zone the obtained chi square value was 4867 3 which is far higher than the critical Ï2 value indicating that the null hypothesis must be rejected and the alternative hypothesis should be accepted thus the Ï2test in this case showed that there is a meaningful difference between the results of the two methods ahp and fahp the reason for this difference can be attributed to the use of fuzzy layers criteria in the fahp method and the use of typical layers in the ahp method for example the fuzzy layers of criteria such as t and s table 6 recorded the highest weight in the east and central regions had good condition but their typical layers had no suitable condition in the eastern part of the aquifer but towards the central areas of the aquifer their conditions were better analysis of the ahp method showed that pixels with the most raw content of each decision parameter were the best pixels and this is a problem because with this logic the best pixels even in decreased criteria are pixels that have the most raw content of each decision parameter for example nitrate and drawdown are decrease criteria because their contents could decrease further the value of an area while in the ahp method the points with more nitrate or drawdown are the best in the fahp method this weakness can be removed using fuzzy membership functions these functions give the most values to points with the least raw content in decrease criteria therefore this method is closer to reality figs 7 and 8 if the null hypothesis is correct then o e for each class and Ï2 0 therefore the results of both methods ahp and fahp are similar and proximate if the alternative hypothesis is correct then o e and the overall value of the test is large if the obtained value is small then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected to determine whether the obtained value is small or large some items should be considered one of such items is the degree of freedom df which in this case is the number of priority classes in each map 5 minus one multiplied by the number of examining maps 2 minus one 5 1 2 1 4 significance level is another item of distribution which should be selected in the study traditionally researchers use the 0 05 level which is sometimes referred to as the 5 significance level in this study the same level was chosen as it provides a good reference point for the final judgment from the table of Ï2 distribution the critical Ï2 value can be determined when the significance level and the degree of freedom are known in this case with 4 degrees of freedom and 0 05 levels of significance for the critical Ï2 value a total of 9 488 is extracted from the distribution table if the Ï2 value obtained from the test is higher than the critical Ï2 value then the null hypothesis is rejected and if the Ï2 value of the test is reported as smaller than the critical Ï2 value the null hypothesis of no relationship between the variables cannot be rejected dowdy et al 2004 the number of pixels in each priority class of the maps required for performing the chi square test are shown in table 6 the percentages of real wells in various classes of ahp and fahp are shown in table 7 16 of the wells were not in any of the classes 4 conclusions this study was carried out to determine suitable areas for the harvesting of drinking water using two processes ahp and fahp in birjand aquifer in this research na ca mg so4 tds ec cl drawdown and t elements were used as the decision criteria these parameters were interpolated in the entire birjand plain using the kriging method in gis raster layers were transformed into fuzzy layers using fuzzy membership functions the common weights and fuzzy weights of the criteria were calculated in sequence using the ahp and fahp methods and thereafter with the influence of the calculated weights in the layers mentioned above the ultimate maps were created these maps were classified into five levels by comparison of these maps the real condition of the zone indicated that the ultimate map of the fahp was more delicate in location in ultimate layer of fahp 33 3 of drinking water wells were sitting in a very good class while in the ultimate layer of ahp none of the wells were sitting in a very good class and more than 54 of these wells were in a weak class indicating that fahp is more in conformity with reality than ahp appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia

12152,nowadays fuzzy logic has been successfully employed to handle the environmental issues due to inflexible classifications and interpretative difficulties of crisp data involved in the classic water quality index wqi employment of fuzzy logic in water resources problems has been repeatedly recommended for decision support in ecological assessment as a mixed ability method it can both provide balance in suitable and unsuitable observations which results in incompatible outcomes and can interpret social economic and biological effects as membership functions of linguistic terms accordingly this study aims at evaluating the karun river water quality based on mamdani fuzzy approach using developing a fuzzy water quality index fwqi a hierarchical approach was conducted to avoid curse of dimensionality in fuzzy rules and to take the relationships between parameters in to account as well 21 parameters in the form of physicochemical chemical biological and heavy metal fuzzy groups were processed based on trapezoidal membership functions and the rulesets for considering the relationships between parameters a global fwqi of 36 78 2 17 has been estimated based on 2010 to 2015 data while the assessment with nsfwqi and ccmewqi indices scored 41 8 1 33 and 33 65 2 87 respectively based on anova test changes in global fwqi were not significant in sampling stations moreover results show degradation of the water quality from upstream to downstream of the karun watershed these results put forward an argument in necessity of regeneration of the karun water quality to improve ecological conditions in the region graphical abstract image 1 keywords monitoring fuzzy logic water quality index karun river 1 introduction the survival of river ecosystems depends on both certain dangerous substances resulting in the expansion of anthropogenic activities and their impacts on trophic chains ocampo duque et al 2006 the pollutants in the natural water are expanded and diversified due to receiving municipal and industrial wastewater and surface runoff from agricultural land liu and zou 2012 mahmoudi et al 2018 therefore assigning the indicators of water quality monitoring in order to protect the river and prevent from further deterioration are necessary forio et al 2017 indicators should be both scientifically sound and easy for the public to comprehend and consider different aspect of water quality liou et al 2003 the traditional water quality index wqi is obtained by the general indices and weighting to each of water quality parameters in spite of its simplicity wqi cannot be reliable due to inclusion of limited variables and crisp weight assignment dahiya et al 2007 lermontov et al 2009 assigning constant weights to the parameters in wqi results in inflexibility in evaluating of water quality condition for different seasons temperatures annual rainfalls and surface runoffs dahiya et al 2007 on the other hand in addition of ignoring toxic pollutants ocampo duque et al 2006 uncertainty and subjectivity of the wqi weights decrease its accuracy in evaluating water quality chang et al 2001 azarnivand 2017 therefore an advanced classification method is required to resolve the problems in the wqi approach gharibi et al 2012b the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi provides a broad overview of environmental performance accessible to both managers and the general public marvin et al 2004 as such it simplifies the reporting of water quality data however ccme wqi loses its sufficiency when there is a lack of information on interactions between effective variables in the index formulation most importantly it is not described as portable approach in different environments ccme 2001 fuzzy logic can integrate significant parameters of water quality and classify environmental factors of random phenomena to understandable and transparent subsets for the public and experts and provide a much appreciated formalism accounting for inherent uncertainty of non linear information mahapatra et al 2011 gharibi et al 2012a vadiati et al 2016 the ability to combine quantitative and qualitative data gives it a big advantage over other indices as the description of ecological complexity would be similar to the real world marchini et al 2009 fuzzy models allow for non linear relations of the input variables and connect them to the output by using if then rules lermontov et al 2009 they convert expert judgment defined as linguistic terms into a mathematical framework based on fuzzy laws marchini et al 2009 recently the fuzzy logic has been widely studied for the assessment of nature water resources quality and environmental concerns hosseini moghari et al 2015 for example ocampo duque et al 2006 integrated the weighting and fuzzy inference system with respect to twenty seven parameters of physicochemical indicators in the ebro river according to their results the comparison of fuzzy wqi and crisp wqis showed greater consistency in regional environmental standards for water quality wang et al 2014 offered a promising approach to evaluate water quality in the three gorges reservoir area and tseng wen river based on addressing the intervals of each grade in water quality index as opposed to a point value used in traditional evaluation also hosseini moghari et al 2015 confirmed the solidity of fwqi for evaluating the potability of 17 wells in saveh plain iran according to the nine physicochemical parameters ph total dissolved solids tds cl so4 hco3 k na ca and mg classified in three groups they reported that 35 of the wells were suitable for meeting the target of drinking water quality standards vadiati et al 2016 incorporated the groundwater quality index the water quality index and the ground water quality index to evaluate groundwater quality the standard limit of groundwater quality index was used for the fuzzification of output parameters as opposed to expert knowledge this method could maximize the accuracy of groundwater quality therefore fuzzy logic can be used as a feasible tool to improve the evaluation of ecosystem properties dealing with the uncertainty in decision making in the area of water quality management dahiya et al 2007 wang et al 2014 a number of studies have been applied to estimate the hydrographic surveys of the karun river in iran by the fuzzy logic for example semiromi et al 2011 developed fwqi for measuring the water quality of the karun river considering do tds turbidity nitrate fc and ph as parameters mahmoodabadi and arshad 2018 used the characteristic of the neuro fuzzy based model to connect input data with target data based on the 48 year trend of chemical variables in this river the novelty of this study is to incorporate different water quality related parameters into the assessment process in order to provide a new insight into the river quality management the evaluation of spatial and temporal variations step by step description of the fuzzy quality index condition and the impacts of parameters on human health are detailed and compared with other traditional indices for this purpose both popular water quality parameters and considerably important toxic heavy metals were analyzed according to their interdependence due to the flexible categorization among the linguistic terms it is possible to examine the behavior of parameters at different levels of categorization this approach may be globally used as an integrated tool for water quality assessment and management by local authorities the flowchart of the process for the fuzzy evaluation was provided in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources the karun river with the area of 65 230 km2 and the length of 950 km is the largest river located in southern part of iran it originates from the zard kuh mountains and passes through the city of ahvaz the capital of khuzestan province the karun river is employed as a resource of hydroelectric power generation irrigation to over 280 000 ha potable water supply of several cities in the basin and as an important commercial waterway for the transport of petroleum to the persian gulf domestic agricultural and industrial wastewater discharged into karun without appropriate treatment cause severe pollution and damage to the ecosystems for the current assessment five sampling stations gotvand shushtar gargar mollasani ahvaz and darkhuein stations were selected during 2010 2015 fig 2 according to the nature

which resulted from the lack of predictability and understanding of issues fuzzy inference integrates several parameters into the modeling through which decisions are made on the basis of fuzzy logic dahiya et al 2007 fuzzification process is designed to express the observed real data in the form of linguistic terms using suitable membership function in order that a complex system is described in a simple manner icaga 2007 muhammetoglu and yardimci 2006 this process typically comprises membership functions fuzzy set operations and inference rules each element in the universe of discourse can be linked to the output space through the membership values Î¼ which is ranged between 0 and 1 ocampo duque et al 2006 the membership of each fuzzy set is specified by the type of curves they give the belongingness to the sets based on degree or weighting dahiya et al 2007 if fuzzy set a is subset of x the membership function of x in fuzzy set a Î¼a x will defined by 1 a x Î¼ a x x x Î¼ a x 0 1 trapezoidal membership functions were intended to normalize the crisp inputs as stated by the expert perception and permissible limits table 1 since multiplicity of the parameters have been led to increase in inference rules in order to avoid complexity using hierarchical approach four groups were considered as inputs of the fuzzy model number of fuzzy subsets has been determined using range of the water quality parameters in the river and traditional water quality index categorizations and standards as well for more precise controls in making the accuracy decisions of the expert five membership functions were considered for output of fuzzy model the trapezoidal membership functions low medium and high were designed for fuzzy inputs five linguistic fuzzy subsets very low low medium high and very high were defined for the output as an example three membership functions for the bod parameter are described in equations 2 4 fig 3 shows the membership functions considered for

based on the generalization and the justification of the operators the and operator intersects the two input fuzzy sets by equation 5 when two input subsets are united by the union operation it makes a new subset through equation 6 5 Î¼ c x min Î¼ a x Î¼ b x 6 Î¼ c x max Î¼ a x Î¼ b x the sets are processed as lingual through the fuzzy rules lermontov et al 2009 in other words it is called a classification process of the water quality according to the experts perception in the form of rules dahiya et al 2007 the rules are the way in which the inputs and the output of the system are connected mahapatra et al 2011 and leads to a fuzzy decision through fuzzy operators dahiya et al 2007 this study uses mamdani fuzzy algorithm one of the common inference systems derived from the

much high sensitivity to variations in the amount of various input parameters a global fwqi of 36 78 2 17 has been estimated based on 2010 to 2015 data the assessment with nsfwqi and ccmewqi indices has been 41 8 1 33 and 33 65 2 87 respectively it seems the nsfwqi was less strict than the other indexes so that it usually shows constant values as it is shown in box heights classifiying as marginal in a non fuzzy environment this may be due to the lack of consideration of heavy metals and the limited monitored variables included in the index this accordingly causes the lower sensitivity of nsfwqi to variations in parameter values in all cases fwqi gives in appropriate water quality condition in the karun therefore it is noted that fwqi index is more stringent than the nsfwqi index our results are in line with the results from other researchers ocampo duque et al 2006 gharibi et al 2012a lermontov et al 2009 however ccmewqi was the most strict the fwqi and nsfwqi this index considers the percentage of the tests not meeting objectives the standard levels thus the concentrations values are placed in same classes irrespective of how far they have been from or close to the standard level icaga 2007 this results is decreased in the degree of accuracy in this sense it is found that high fecal coliform concentrations mainly resulted in very large excursions over the objective 100 mp n 100 ml and consequently lower index values resulted among the intrinsic problems in the development of the ccmewqi the range of exceedence which strongly affects the final score requires more attention saffran 2001 generally the rules of fuzzy inference system consider the interrelations between the multiple parameters based on an expert judgment therefore the final result is not strongly affected by the variations a parameter lermontov et al 2009 according to fig 8 an understandable water quality index originates from fuzzy process is obtained compared to the other indices therefore it can be concluded that the fis model can be able to adequately describe the observed condition 4 conclusion the results obtained by the fwqi confirmed incorporation of all initial parameters and their relationships in the context of fuzzy inference system can make a strong system to evaluate water quality whilst nsfwqi and ccmewqi employ a formula which similarly evaluate water quality without considering the interrelations between the multiple parameters and uncertainty weight assignment fuzzy methodology can thus be suitable for the non linearity subjectivity and complexity of the causal correlations among variables to avoid curse of dimensionality taking a hierarchical approach parameters were divided into four indicator groups it was accordingly founded that

12152,nowadays fuzzy logic has been successfully employed to handle the environmental issues due to inflexible classifications and interpretative difficulties of crisp data involved in the classic water quality index wqi employment of fuzzy logic in water resources problems has been repeatedly recommended for decision support in ecological assessment as a mixed ability method it can both provide balance in suitable and unsuitable observations which results in incompatible outcomes and can interpret social economic and biological effects as membership functions of linguistic terms accordingly this study aims at evaluating the karun river water quality based on mamdani fuzzy approach using developing a fuzzy water quality index fwqi a hierarchical approach was conducted to avoid curse of dimensionality in fuzzy rules and to take the relationships between parameters in to account as well 21 parameters in the form of physicochemical chemical biological and heavy metal fuzzy groups were processed based on trapezoidal membership functions and the rulesets for considering the relationships between parameters a global fwqi of 36 78 2 17 has been estimated based on 2010 to 2015 data while the assessment with nsfwqi and ccmewqi indices scored 41 8 1 33 and 33 65 2 87 respectively based on anova test changes in global fwqi were not significant in sampling stations moreover results show degradation of the water quality from upstream to downstream of the karun watershed these results put forward an argument in necessity of regeneration of the karun water quality to improve ecological conditions in the region graphical abstract image 1 keywords monitoring fuzzy logic water quality index karun river 1 introduction the survival of river ecosystems depends on both certain dangerous substances resulting in the expansion of anthropogenic activities and their impacts on trophic chains ocampo duque et al 2006 the pollutants in the natural water are expanded and diversified due to receiving municipal and industrial wastewater and surface runoff from agricultural land liu and zou 2012 mahmoudi et al 2018 therefore assigning the indicators of water quality monitoring in order to protect the river and prevent from further deterioration are necessary forio et al 2017 indicators should be both scientifically sound and easy for the public to comprehend and consider different aspect of water quality liou et al 2003 the traditional water quality index wqi is obtained by the general indices and weighting to each of water quality parameters in spite of its simplicity wqi cannot be reliable due to inclusion of limited variables and crisp weight assignment dahiya et al 2007 lermontov et al 2009 assigning constant weights to the parameters in wqi results in inflexibility in evaluating of water quality condition for different seasons temperatures annual rainfalls and surface runoffs dahiya et al 2007 on the other hand in addition of ignoring toxic pollutants ocampo duque et al 2006 uncertainty and subjectivity of the wqi weights decrease its accuracy in evaluating water quality chang et al 2001 azarnivand 2017 therefore an advanced classification method is required to resolve the problems in the wqi approach gharibi et al 2012b the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi provides a broad overview of environmental performance accessible to both managers and the general public marvin et al 2004 as such it simplifies the reporting of water quality data however ccme wqi loses its sufficiency when there is a lack of information on interactions between effective variables in the index formulation most importantly it is not described as portable approach in different environments ccme 2001 fuzzy logic can integrate significant parameters of water quality and classify environmental factors of random phenomena to understandable and transparent subsets for the public and experts and provide a much appreciated formalism accounting for inherent uncertainty of non linear information mahapatra et al 2011 gharibi et al 2012a vadiati et al 2016 the ability to combine quantitative and qualitative data gives it a big advantage over other indices as the description of ecological complexity would be similar to the real world marchini et al 2009 fuzzy models allow for non linear relations of the input variables and connect them to the output by using if then rules lermontov et al 2009 they convert expert judgment defined as linguistic terms into a mathematical framework based on fuzzy laws marchini et al 2009 recently the fuzzy logic has been widely studied for the assessment of nature water resources quality and environmental concerns hosseini moghari et al 2015 for example ocampo duque et al 2006 integrated the weighting and fuzzy inference system with respect to twenty seven parameters of physicochemical indicators in the ebro river according to their results the comparison of fuzzy wqi and crisp wqis showed greater consistency in regional environmental standards for water quality wang et al 2014 offered a promising approach to evaluate water quality in the three gorges reservoir area and tseng wen river based on addressing the intervals of each grade in water quality index as opposed to a point value used in traditional evaluation also hosseini moghari et al 2015 confirmed the solidity of fwqi for evaluating the potability of 17 wells in saveh plain iran according to the nine physicochemical parameters ph total dissolved solids tds cl so4 hco3 k na ca and mg classified in three groups they reported that 35 of the wells were suitable for meeting the target of drinking water quality standards vadiati et al 2016 incorporated the groundwater quality index the water quality index and the ground water quality index to evaluate groundwater quality the standard limit of groundwater quality index was used for the fuzzification of output parameters as opposed to expert knowledge this method could maximize the accuracy of groundwater quality therefore fuzzy logic can be used as a feasible tool to improve the evaluation of ecosystem properties dealing with the uncertainty in decision making in the area of water quality management dahiya et al 2007 wang et al 2014 a number of studies have been applied to estimate the hydrographic surveys of the karun river in iran by the fuzzy logic for example semiromi et al 2011 developed fwqi for measuring the water quality of the karun river considering do tds turbidity nitrate fc and ph as parameters mahmoodabadi and arshad 2018 used the characteristic of the neuro fuzzy based model to connect input data with target data based on the 48 year trend of chemical variables in this river the novelty of this study is to incorporate different water quality related parameters into the assessment process in order to provide a new insight into the river quality management the evaluation of spatial and temporal variations step by step description of the fuzzy quality index condition and the impacts of parameters on human health are detailed and compared with other traditional indices for this purpose both popular water quality parameters and considerably important toxic heavy metals were analyzed according to their interdependence due to the flexible categorization among the linguistic terms it is possible to examine the behavior of parameters at different levels of categorization this approach may be globally used as an integrated tool for water quality assessment and management by local authorities the flowchart of the process for the fuzzy evaluation was provided in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources the karun river with the area of 65 230 km2 and the length of 950 km is the largest river located in southern part of iran it originates from the zard kuh mountains and passes through the city of ahvaz the capital of khuzestan province the karun river is employed as a resource of hydroelectric power generation irrigation to over 280 000 ha potable water supply of several cities in the basin and as an important commercial waterway for the transport of petroleum to the persian gulf domestic agricultural and industrial wastewater discharged into karun without appropriate treatment cause severe pollution and damage to the ecosystems for the current assessment five sampling stations gotvand shushtar gargar mollasani ahvaz and darkhuein stations were selected during 2010 2015 fig 2 according to the nature of parameters four groups of the water quality variables were considered as the following subsets 1 physical tem ph ec 2 biological bod5 do fc 3 chemical ca mg na no3 po4 so4 cl hco 3 parameters and 4 heavy metals zn mn fe cd cr pb hg 2 2 fuzzy set theory in river quality assessment fuzzy set mathematics theory was introduced by zadeh 1965 to describe the more imprecise or incomplete information which resulted from the lack of predictability and understanding of issues fuzzy inference integrates several parameters into the modeling through which decisions are made on the basis of fuzzy logic dahiya et al 2007 fuzzification process is designed to express the observed real data in the form of linguistic terms using suitable membership function in order that a complex system is described in a simple manner icaga 2007 muhammetoglu and yardimci 2006 this process typically comprises membership functions fuzzy set operations and inference rules each element in the universe of discourse can be linked to the output space through the membership values Î¼ which is ranged between 0 and 1 ocampo duque et al 2006 the membership of each fuzzy set is specified by the type of curves they give the belongingness to the sets based on degree or weighting dahiya et al 2007 if fuzzy set a is subset of x the membership function of x in fuzzy set a Î¼a x will defined by 1 a x Î¼ a x x x Î¼ a x 0 1 trapezoidal membership functions were intended to normalize the crisp inputs as stated by the expert perception and permissible limits table 1 since multiplicity of the parameters have been led to increase in inference rules in order to avoid complexity using hierarchical approach four groups were considered as inputs of the fuzzy model number of fuzzy subsets has been determined using range of the water quality parameters in the river and traditional water quality index categorizations and standards as well for more precise controls in making the accuracy decisions of the expert five membership functions were considered for output of fuzzy model the trapezoidal membership functions low medium and high were designed for fuzzy inputs five linguistic fuzzy subsets very low low medium high and very high were defined for the output as an example three membership functions for the bod parameter are described in equations 2 4 fig 3 shows the membership functions considered for fuzzification of the some inputs and output 2 low Î¼ b o d 1 i f x 2 5 3 5 x 3 5 2 5 i f x 2 5 3 5 0 i f x 3 5 3 medium Î¼ bod 0 i f x 2 5 x 2 5 3 5 2 5 i f x 2 5 3 5 1 i f x 3 5 4 5 x 5 4 i f x 4 5 0

based on the generalization and the justification of the operators the and operator intersects the two input fuzzy sets by equation 5 when two input subsets are united by the union operation it makes a new subset through equation 6 5 Î¼ c x min Î¼ a x Î¼ b x 6 Î¼ c x max Î¼ a x Î¼ b x the sets are processed as lingual through the fuzzy rules lermontov et al 2009 in other words it is called a

is also vulnerable to all sorts of contaminations due to natural causes or various anthropogenic activities such as agricultural domestic and industrial sharma 2001 one of the major concerns regarding the contamination of groundwater is the precipitation and accumulation of heavy metals natural sources of heavy metals may include weathering and erosion of bed rocks and ore deposits chakraborti et

presence of iron results in a reddish colour and undesirable odour kulkarni 2016 fe ii is colourless in the dissolved form but in contact with air it is converted into the insoluble fe iii form

or require high energy for their operation thereby reducing their affordability for low income households chaturvedi and dave 2012 adsorptive filtration has been considered a promising alternative to different conventional iron removal mechanisms sharma et al 2001 during adsorptive filtration the fe ii present in anaerobic groundwater is adsorbed on to the surface of filter media resulting in a higher treatment process efficiency in the presence of oxygen the fe ii gets oxidised forming a new surface of adsorption on the filter media the process is also the dominant iron removal mechanism in dry filters and subsurface iron filters sharma 2001 various studies have been conducted on adsorptive filtration based on iron oxide coated sand as the filter media sharma 2001 sharma et al 2002

riemsdijk 2007 larese casanova and scherer 2007 buamah et al 2009 sharma et al 2002 it is known that dissolved oxygen do is adsorbed by fe iii precipitates wang et al 1996 davydov et al 1998 it is also known that fe ii can be adsorbed onto ferric hydr oxide hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2007 larese casanova and scherer 2007 buamah et al 2009 sharma et al 2002 also it has been reported that the fe iii fe ii system often acts as an electron carrier and hence oxidation of fe ii in the adsorbed phase might get enhanced in the presence of fe iii precipitates stumm and sulzberger 1992 thus the surface of fe iii precipitates may have a catalytic effect on the oxidation of fe ii morgan and lahav 2007 stumm and lee 1961 there are reports that claim that ferric hydr oxide catalyses fe ii oxidation morgan and lahav 2007 tamura et al 1976 while it has also been reported that fe ii oxidation above ph 6 may lead to the formation of mixed fe ii iii hydroxides and the fe ii in these intermediates is only very slowly oxidised if at all feitknecht and keller 1950 stumm and lee 1961 hiemstra and riemsdijk 2007 report that at ph 7 fe ii adsorbed on fe iii precipitates remains as fe ii and at ph 7 5 it becomes fe iii however the electron remains on the surface of precipitates and depending upon conditions it can easily revert to fe ii buamah et al 2009 have reported results of an experiment where it was observed that fe ii oxidation in the presence of iron oxide in a column was incomplete even after excess do was provided barnes et al 2009 also reported that certain fractions of fe ii remained adsorbed as fe ii and did not oxidize to fe iii thus contradicting reports exist about the rate of heterogeneous oxidation of fe ii again this mechanism is only applicable if iron is present in the fe2 form in water in the present study the use of sand as the filter media was completely eliminated as it only provides a surface for adsorption the adsorption mechanism proposed in this study involved direct adsorption of fe ii from the groundwater onto the ferric hydroxide precipitate its conversion to fe iii and its subsequent hydrolysis to ferric hydroxide forming a new surface for further adsorption thus there was no need to frequently replace or maintain the media and no backwashing process was required this underscores the cost effectiveness of the proposed method the study also investigated the effect of various parameters such as ph adsorbent dosage contact time and competitive ions on the adsorption mechanism and adsorption kinetics based on the studies conducted a new adsorption unit that could find field application was also proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials various chemicals used their purpose and concentration range used in the study are depicted in table 1 2 2 preparation of adsorbent 15 g of fecl3 was dissolved in 1 l of distilled water to get fecl3 solution into which 20 ml of ammonia solution was added to initiate the precipitation of fe oh 3 the adsorbent was filtered using whatman grade 42 filter paper after washing it thoroughly with distilled water such that its ph was maintained around 7 2 3 experimental the concentration of fe ii in the solution during the experiments mentioned in this study was determined by the phenanthroline method apha 2012 using a spectrophotometer type 1069 systronics india in all the experiments anaerobic conditions were maintained with nitrogen purging each experiment was conducted in triplicates and average values were plotted in the graphs 2 3 1 effect of contact time 100 ml of 20 mg l fe ii solution taken in a 500 ml glass beaker was contacted with 5 g ferric hydroxide adsorbent operating a magnetic stirrer at moderate speed the experiment was carried out as a batch process by varying contact time as 1min 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 25 min and 30 min 2 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage batch experiments were conducted by contacting 100 ml of 20 mg l iron ii solution taken in a 500 ml glass beaker with varying adsorbent dosages 5 g 10 g 15 g 20 g 25 g and 30 g for 15 min contact time operating a magnetic stirrer at moderate speed 2 3 3 effect of ph the effect of ph was analysed by contacting 1 l of 20 mg l of fe ii solution at varying ph with 15 g of adsorbent operating a magnetic stirrer at moderate speed the batch experiments were conducted at a ph range varying from 5 to 7 for a contact period of 15 min the ph range specified was prepared using 0 02n h2so4 and 0 02n naoh 2 3 4 effect of competitive ions the chemicals used and the concentration of fe ii solution and different competitive ions introduced into the test solution is depicted in table 1 the different competitive ions under study were calcium sulphate chloride manganese and fluoride the test solution was 20 mg l fe ii solution into which varying concentrations of competitive ions were introduced batch adsorption experiments were performed by contacting 10 g of ferric hydroxide adsorbent and 100 ml of test solution taken in a 500 ml glass beaker the experiment was carried out for a contact time of 10 min by operating a magnetic stirrer at moderate speed the procedure was repeated for different concentrations of competitive ions in the test solution 2 3 5 adsorption kinetic study the kinetics of adsorption was experimented by contacting 5 g of ferric hydroxide with 1 l of fe ii solution of different initial concentrations 1 mg l 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l the experiments were performed in a laboratory jar test apparatus for a period of 60 min at 50 rpm the time intervals at which the final fe ii concentration analysed were 5 15 30 45 and 60 min the final fe ii concentration at different time intervals was then analysed by spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of contact time fig 1 shows the variation of fe ii removal efficiency with increasing contact time as the contact time increases the removal efficiency also increases at 15 min contact time the fe ii removal efficiency obtained for 20 mg l initial concentration was 100 and the variation in contact time from 1 min to 30 min resulted in the increase of fe ii removal efficiency by 5 thus contact time emerged as a dominating factor in the adsorption process and variation in contact time positively influenced the performance of the process 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the variation of fe ii removal efficiency with the adsorbent dosage is shown in fig 2 from the figure it is clear that adsorbent amount positively influenced the performance of the process as the adsorbent dosage increased from 5 g to 30 g the fe ii removal efficiency increased by 10 and at 15 g adsorbent dosage the fe ii removal efficiency reached 100 the increase in fe ii adsorption capacity was due to the formation of adsorption group in the adsorption process sharma 2001 thus weight of adsorbent can also be considered as one of the dominating factors on the performance of the process 3 3 effect of ph as the ph increased from 5 to 7 the fe ii removal efficiency by the adsorption process also increased to double the initial value the variation of fe ii removal efficiency with ph by the adsorption process is depicted in fig 3 at ph 7 86 of iron removal efficiency was obtained whereas further increase in ph initiated the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii and subsequent formation of ferric hydroxide at acidic ph fe iii reduces to fe ii hendrich et al 2012 there by reducing the removal efficiency also under alkaline ph conditions fe ii conversion to ferric hydroxide is anticipated immediately after its preparation at higher ph the precipitate settles down even before it could pass through the ferric hydroxide flocs contained in the adsorption unit hence the precipitation was found to work effectively within the narrow ph range of 6 5 and 7 3 4 effect of competitive ions the ions present in groundwater may compete with each other for adsorption sites and thereby enhance decrease or even inhibit adsorption sites which affects the overall efficiency of adsorptive iron removal sharma 2001 the presence of competitive ions can affect the rate at which adsorption sites are formed in the water the effects of different competitive ions present in the groundwater on adsorptive removal mechanism are described in the following sections 3 4 1 effect of calcium an elevated ca2 concentration slightly inhibited the adsorption of fe ii onto ferric hydroxide sludge the iron removal efficiency reduction was 11 when the ca2 concentration increased from 0 to 200 mg l the effects of calcium ions in groundwater on adsorptive removal mechanism is depicted in fig 4 the reduction in fe ii efficiency may be due to two reasons the competition of divalent ions fe2 and ca2 for the adsorption sites sharma 2001 and the ca2 concentration being higher than the fe2 concentration in all cases thus the presence of calcium ions in groundwater could inhibit the adsorptive iron removal efficiency and hence the present technology may show lower efficiency if the groundwater has high hardness 3 4 2 effect of sulphate the variation of iron removal efficiency with sulphate dosage is as shown in fig 4 the iron removal efficiency increased by 3 as the sulphate concentration increased from 40 mg l to 160 mg l thus variation in sulphate ion concentration did not significantly impact the iron removal efficiency the slight increase in iron adsorption with an increase in sulphate concentration may be due to the coulambic interaction between the oxide surface and sulphate ions this resulted in a more negatively charged oxide surface and thus adsorption of iron onto the oxide surface occurred more efficiently smith 1999 3 4 3 effect of chloride as the chloride concentration increased from 0 mg l to 200 mg l the iron adsorption showed no significant reduction the variation of iron removal efficiency with chloride dosage is shown in fig 4 the chloride ions being monovalent may have formed fe ii chloride complexes and got adsorbed onto the oxide surface similar to uncomplexed cu ii ions chesna and kim 2014 thus chloride ions did not influence the removal efficiency of adsorptive iron removal 3 4 4 effect of manganese the variation of iron removal efficiency with manganese dosage is as shown in fig 5 with increasing manganese ii concentration from 0 mg l to 3 mg l the removal efficiency of fe ii was observed to reduce by 4 indicating competition from mn ii ions on adsorption onto the negatively charged iron oxide adsorption sites pierce and moore 1980 1982 takeno 2005 3 4 5 effect of fluoride the variation of iron removal efficiency with fluoride dosage is illustrated in fig 5 the effect of fluoride was not evident and the mean iron removal efficiency continued to be 94 a slight increase in the iron removal efficiency was observed at 1 mg l which may be due to the columbic effect by fluoride ions making the oxide sites more negatively charged bhatnagar et al 2011 3 4 6 adsorption kinetic study the mechanisms of the adsorption process such as mass transfer and chemical reaction have been examined using a suitable kinetic model that analyses the rate data the correlation coefficient r 2 values close or equal to 1 indicated the conformity between experimental data and the model predicted values and a model with high r 2 value successfully described the kinetics of iron ii adsorption al meshragi et al 2008 by incorporating the experimental data in different models such as first and second order and pseudo second order the graphs were plotted for each model from the plots the pseudo second order model with relatively high r 2 value described the kinetics of iron ii adsorption on to ferric hydroxide surface the pseudo second order equation is expressed as t q t 1 h 1 q e where h kq e 2 mg g 1min 1 can be regarded as the initial adsorption rate as t 0 and k is the rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption g mg 1min 1 also q t and q e mg g are the amounts adsorbed onto the adsorbent at time t and at equilibrium if pseudo second order kinetics are applicable the plot of t q t against t should give a linear relationship from which q e k and h can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot and there is no need to know any parameter beforehand for adsorption system following the pseudo second order kinetics the adsorbate was assumed to get adsorbed onto the surface sites and the rate limiting step was taken to be the chemical adsorption involving valency forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between the adsorbent and sorbate ho and mckay 1999 again the pseudo second order equation for estimating q e values was least sensitive to the influence of random experimental errors kumar 2006 the plot obtained for pseudo second order model for initial fe ii concentration of 1 mg l 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l at 5 g adsorbent were as shown in fig 6 from the plots it was evident that the adsorption kinetics followed pseudo second order the plots giver 2 value 0 96 which gives conformity between experimental data and the model predicted values the pseudo second order relies on the assumption that chemisorption may be the rate limiting step and a chemical bond is formed between the adsorption site and the metal ion kirthika and kumar 2009 the adsorption of ferrous ions onto adsorbent was due to a chemical reaction which resulted in the formation of the feo group hence it agreed well with the assumption of pseudo second order kinetics the adsorption parameters such as q e k and h value obtained for different initial fe ii concentration is given in table 2 the pseudo second order kinetic analysis reveals that rate constants k were in the range of 1 38 3 g mg min as the initial concentration increased the k value reduced this was because as concentration increased adsorption sites decreased as a result of which k value declined again the initial adsorption rates h decreased with increase in the initial fe ii concentration the lower the concentration of metal ions in the solution the faster ferrous ions could be bonded to the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent nnaji et al 2013 the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e remained nearly constant for all the concentration values this could be attributed to the fact that as the process continued more adsorption sites were formed by chemisorption and resulted in the removal of fe ii from water regardless of initial concentration in general the adsorption reaction proceeds as more adsorption sites feo group form on the surface of adsorbent 3 4 7 kinetics of oxidation of fe ii adsorbed on fe iii the fe ii oxidation equation given by stumm and lee 1961 is mentioned below d f e i i d t k f e i i d o o h 2 it is clear from the equation that fe ii concentration do and ph govern the overall fe ii oxidation rate the above mentioned equation is mostly used to model homogeneous fe ii oxidation i e oxidation occurring in the aqueous phase further it may be mentioned that fe ii oxidation can also occur in the heterogeneous phase tamura et al 1976 further it may be pointed out that most of the literature for estimating oxidation rate have used fe ii concentrations up to 10 mg l stumm and lee 1961 sung and morgan 1980 davison and seed 1983 most of the literature deals with the initial oxidation phase of fe ii and for short duration as most of the fe ii oxidation data at around ph 7 have been reported only up to 10 60 min stumm and lee 1961 ghosh et al 1966 tamura et al 1976 though homogenous reaction rate information is available scanty information is available for heterogeneous fe ii oxidation rate in the present study an attempt was made to analyse the fe ii oxidation rate in the presence of fe iii and the results were presented in table 3 residual aq fe ii was obtained using kinetic rate constants of sung and morgan 1980 and these values were compared to aq fe ii experimental in the 15 30 and 60 min reaction time samples in table 3 data indicated that at shorter duration and lower concentration 15 min and 1 mg l the experimental values agreed with the calculated values however at longer duration 30 min and 60 min for higher iron concentrations of 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l significant difference was observed between the experimental and calculated values thus it is apparent that the rate equation could not predict fe ii oxidation reasonably well which might be due to the limitation of considering only homogeneous oxidation hence in the presence of fe iii the fe ii oxidation may also occur as heterogeneous oxidation on the surface of iron hydroxide from the data presented in table 3 there is ample evidence that the adsorbed fe ii seemingly got oxidised at a slower rate when no other competitive ions were present thus catalytic oxidation of fe ii in the heterogeneous phase as reported earlier tamura et al 1976 morgan and lahav 2007 may not be inferred for this system due to the adsorbed fe ii remaining unoxidised on the surface of fe iii ftir spectroscopy was carried out to verify the presence of fe ii adsorbed on ferric hydroxide ftir spectra obtained as shown in figs s1 and s2 were compared with available literature on similar systems subsequently the peaks obtained at 3235 3420 cm 1 were attributed to the oh stretch 2650 2700 cm 1 to the fe oh bond 1700 50 cm 1 to the oh bend i e h2o and 930 cm 1 to the fe o bond myneni et al 1998a b sun and doner 1996 jia et al 2007 goldberg 2002 goldberg and johnston 2001 manning et al 1998 thus as no specific bond of fe ii and fe iii was observed its presence on the surface of hydrated ferric oxide hfo could not be conclusively proved either it was oxidised before our analysis or existed in too low a concentration to be definitively observed however none of these points can be stated conclusively and therefore further detailed studies need to be undertaken 3 4 8 modelling of an fe ii removal adsorption unit an adsorption unit was developed as a batch reactor and the schematic diagram of the unit is depicted in fig 7 the lab scale batch setup design consists of two tanks one for mixing the adsorbent and the other for storage after treatment both tanks are placed one above the other as shown in fig 8 it has been designed for the treatment of 20 l of water as a batch the incoming water from the reservoir is taken to tank 1 where the water is allowed to mix with the adsorbent and decanted after adsorption the water is taken to tank 2 for storage a motor mechanism with 50 rpm has been provided for mixing the adsorbent and the incoming water the performance of the iron removal unit was evaluated by modelling the adsorption unit based on the kinetic study conducted earlier an optimum time of adsorption was found out for different fe ii concentrations on the basis of the kinetic study conducted the results obtained from modelling of the new adsorption unit are shown in table 4 the results obtained show that for 1000 g of adsorbent in 20 l of water to be treated the outlet concentrations obtained were below 0 3 mg l for 1 2 5 and 5 mg l of inlet fe ii concentration this indicated that the model describes the kinetics of the adsorption under consideration thus by increasing the time of adsorption various concentrations of fe ii can be reduced to a level expected on the basis of adsorption kinetic study 3 4 9 recommendations for field application the lab scale batch mode adsorption unit modeled based on the kinetic study proved to be efficient in fe ii removal the only limitation observed during the operation was improper settling of adsorbent after 2 or 3 rounds of operation this was rectified in the setup by passing the water through a filter cloth of 200 Î¼m pore size before storage the overall performance of the batch setup was satisfactory and proved to be efficient and cost effective compared to the other advanced mechanisms used the recommendations of the new adsorption unit for field application are listed below incorporating a multi layered sand filter reduces the time required for settling of flocs and provides additional filtration mechanism instead of providing a rotary mechanism for mixing of adsorbent the incorporation of aeration provides both mixing as well as removal mechanism advantages the outlet from the sludge decanting mechanism can be utilised as feo source for many industries 4 conclusion the proposed method of adsorption mechanism showed remarkable efficiency in the removal of fe ii from water contact time and adsorbent dosage had a positive influence on the adsorption mechanism in the narrow ph range between 6 5 and 7 the adsorbent worked effectively during the adsorption process also the effect of competitive ions on the adsorption mechanism suggested that fe ii adsorption from hard groundwaters may be less efficient due to the presence of ca2 and mn2 ions which inhibited the adsorptive iron removal efficiency ions such as sulphate chloride and flouride did not affect the iron adsorption based on the kinetic study adsorptive removal of fe ii was concluded to follow pseudo second order kinetics which relied on the assumption of chemisorption as the removal mechanism based on the kinetic study the adsorption reaction will proceed as more adsorption sites feo group form on the surface of the adsorbent the adsorption unit proposed in this work has potential to be one of the efficient methods for fe ii removal from groundwater when developed on a larger scale for field

varying from 5 to 7 for a contact period of 15 min the ph range specified was prepared using 0 02n h2so4 and 0 02n naoh 2 3 4 effect of competitive ions the chemicals used and the concentration of fe ii solution and different competitive ions introduced into the test solution is depicted in table 1 the different competitive ions under study were calcium sulphate chloride manganese and fluoride the test solution was 20 mg l fe ii solution into which varying concentrations of competitive ions were introduced batch adsorption experiments were performed by contacting 10 g of ferric hydroxide adsorbent and 100 ml of test solution taken in a 500 ml glass beaker the experiment was carried out for a contact time of 10 min by operating a magnetic stirrer at moderate speed the procedure was repeated for different concentrations of competitive ions in the test solution 2 3 5 adsorption kinetic study the kinetics of adsorption was experimented by contacting 5 g of ferric hydroxide with 1 l of fe ii solution of different initial concentrations 1 mg l 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l the experiments were performed in a laboratory jar test apparatus for a period of 60 min at 50 rpm the time intervals at which the final fe ii concentration analysed were 5 15 30 45 and 60 min the final fe ii concentration at different time intervals was then analysed by spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of contact time fig 1 shows the variation of fe ii removal efficiency with increasing contact time as the contact time increases the removal efficiency also increases at 15 min contact time the fe ii removal efficiency obtained for 20 mg l initial concentration was 100 and the variation in contact time from 1 min to 30 min resulted in the increase of fe ii removal efficiency by 5 thus contact time emerged as a dominating factor in the adsorption process and variation in contact time positively influenced the performance of the process 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the variation of fe ii removal efficiency with the adsorbent dosage is shown in fig 2 from the figure it is clear that adsorbent amount positively influenced the performance of the process as the adsorbent dosage increased from 5 g to 30 g the fe ii removal efficiency increased by 10 and at 15 g adsorbent dosage the fe ii removal efficiency reached 100 the increase in fe ii adsorption capacity was due to the formation of adsorption group in the adsorption process sharma 2001 thus weight of adsorbent can also be considered as one of the dominating factors on the performance of the process 3 3 effect of ph as the ph increased from 5 to 7 the fe ii removal efficiency by the adsorption process also increased to double the initial value the variation of fe ii removal efficiency with ph by the adsorption process is depicted in fig 3 at ph 7 86 of iron removal efficiency was obtained whereas further increase in ph initiated the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii and subsequent formation of ferric hydroxide at acidic ph fe iii reduces to fe ii hendrich et al 2012 there by reducing the removal efficiency also under alkaline ph conditions fe ii conversion to ferric hydroxide is anticipated immediately after its preparation at higher ph the precipitate settles down even before it could pass through the ferric hydroxide flocs contained in the adsorption unit hence the precipitation was found to work effectively within the narrow ph range of 6 5 and 7 3 4 effect of competitive ions the ions present in groundwater may compete with each other for adsorption sites and thereby enhance decrease or even inhibit adsorption sites which affects the overall efficiency of adsorptive iron removal sharma 2001 the presence of competitive ions can affect the rate at which adsorption sites are formed in the water the effects of different competitive ions present in the groundwater on adsorptive removal mechanism are described in the following sections 3 4 1 effect of calcium an elevated ca2 concentration slightly inhibited the adsorption of fe ii onto ferric hydroxide sludge the iron removal efficiency reduction was 11 when the ca2 concentration increased from 0 to 200 mg l the effects of calcium ions in groundwater on adsorptive removal mechanism is depicted in fig 4 the reduction in fe ii efficiency may be due to two reasons the competition of divalent ions fe2 and ca2 for the adsorption sites sharma 2001 and the ca2 concentration being higher than the fe2 concentration in all cases thus the presence of calcium ions in groundwater could inhibit the adsorptive iron removal efficiency and hence the present technology may show lower efficiency if the groundwater has high hardness 3 4 2 effect of sulphate the variation of iron removal efficiency with sulphate dosage is as shown in fig 4 the iron removal efficiency increased by 3 as the sulphate concentration increased from 40 mg l to 160 mg l thus variation in sulphate ion concentration did not significantly impact the iron removal efficiency the slight increase in iron adsorption with an increase in sulphate concentration may be due to the coulambic interaction between the oxide surface and sulphate ions this resulted in a more negatively charged oxide surface and thus adsorption of iron onto the oxide surface occurred more efficiently smith 1999 3 4 3 effect of chloride as the chloride concentration increased from 0 mg l to 200 mg l the iron adsorption showed no significant reduction the variation of iron removal efficiency with chloride dosage is shown in fig 4 the chloride ions being monovalent may have formed fe ii chloride complexes and got adsorbed onto the oxide surface similar to uncomplexed cu ii ions chesna and kim 2014 thus chloride ions did not influence the removal efficiency of adsorptive iron removal 3 4 4 effect of manganese the variation of iron removal efficiency with manganese dosage is as shown in fig 5 with increasing manganese ii concentration from 0 mg l to 3 mg l the removal efficiency of fe ii was observed to reduce by 4 indicating competition from mn ii ions on adsorption onto the negatively charged iron oxide adsorption sites pierce and moore 1980 1982 takeno 2005 3 4 5 effect of fluoride the variation of iron removal efficiency with fluoride dosage is illustrated in fig 5 the effect of fluoride was not evident and the mean iron removal efficiency continued to be 94 a slight increase in the iron removal efficiency was observed at 1 mg l which may be due to the columbic effect by fluoride ions making the oxide sites more negatively charged bhatnagar et al 2011 3 4 6 adsorption kinetic study the mechanisms of the adsorption process such as mass transfer and chemical reaction have been examined using a suitable kinetic model that analyses the rate data the correlation coefficient r 2 values close or equal to 1 indicated the conformity between experimental data and the model predicted values and a model with high r 2 value successfully described the kinetics of iron ii adsorption al meshragi et al 2008 by incorporating the experimental data in different models such as first and second order and pseudo second order the graphs were plotted for each model from the plots the pseudo second order model with relatively high r 2 value described the kinetics of iron ii adsorption on to ferric hydroxide surface the pseudo second order equation is expressed as t q t 1 h 1 q e where h kq e 2 mg g 1min 1 can be regarded as the initial adsorption rate as t 0 and k is the rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption g mg 1min 1 also q t and q e mg g are the amounts adsorbed onto the adsorbent at time t and at equilibrium if pseudo second order kinetics are applicable the plot of t q t against t should give a linear relationship from which q e k and h can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot and there is no need to know any parameter beforehand for adsorption system following the pseudo second order kinetics the adsorbate was assumed to get adsorbed onto the surface sites and the rate limiting step was taken to be the chemical adsorption involving valency forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between the adsorbent and sorbate ho and mckay 1999 again the pseudo second order equation for estimating q e values was least sensitive to the influence of random experimental errors kumar 2006 the plot obtained for pseudo second order model for initial fe ii concentration of 1 mg l 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l at 5 g adsorbent were as shown in fig 6 from the plots it was evident that the adsorption kinetics followed pseudo second order the plots giver 2 value 0 96 which gives conformity between experimental data and the model predicted values the pseudo second order relies on the assumption that chemisorption may be the rate limiting step and a chemical bond is formed between the adsorption site and the metal ion kirthika and kumar 2009 the adsorption of ferrous ions onto adsorbent was due to a chemical reaction which resulted in the formation of the feo group hence it agreed well with the assumption of pseudo second order kinetics the adsorption parameters such as q e k and h value obtained for different initial fe ii concentration is given in table 2 the pseudo second order kinetic analysis reveals that rate constants k were in the range of 1 38 3 g mg min as the initial concentration increased the k value reduced this was because as concentration increased adsorption sites decreased as a result of which k value declined again the initial adsorption rates h decreased with increase in the initial fe ii concentration the lower the concentration of metal ions in the solution the faster ferrous ions could be bonded to the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent nnaji et al 2013 the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e remained nearly constant for all the concentration values this could be attributed to the fact that as the process continued more adsorption sites were formed by chemisorption and resulted in the removal of fe ii from water regardless of initial concentration in general the adsorption reaction proceeds as more adsorption sites feo group form on the surface of adsorbent 3 4 7 kinetics of oxidation of fe ii adsorbed on fe iii the fe ii oxidation equation given by stumm and lee 1961 is mentioned below d f e i i d t k f e i i d o o h 2 it is clear from the equation that fe ii concentration do and ph govern the overall fe ii oxidation rate the above mentioned equation is mostly used to model homogeneous fe ii oxidation i e oxidation occurring in the aqueous phase further it may be mentioned that fe ii oxidation can also occur in the heterogeneous phase tamura et al 1976 further it may be pointed out that most of the literature for estimating oxidation rate have used fe ii concentrations up to 10 mg l stumm and lee 1961 sung and morgan 1980 davison and seed 1983 most of the literature deals with the initial oxidation phase of fe ii and for short duration as most of the fe ii oxidation data at around ph 7 have been reported only up to 10 60 min stumm and lee 1961 ghosh et al 1966 tamura et al 1976 though homogenous reaction rate information is available scanty information is available for heterogeneous fe ii oxidation rate in the present study an attempt was made to analyse the fe ii oxidation rate in the presence of fe iii and the results were presented in table 3 residual aq fe ii was obtained using kinetic rate constants of sung and morgan 1980 and these values were compared to aq fe ii experimental in the 15 30 and 60 min reaction time samples in table 3 data indicated that at shorter duration and lower concentration 15 min and 1 mg l the experimental values agreed with the calculated values however at longer duration 30 min and 60 min for higher iron concentrations of 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l significant difference was observed between the experimental and calculated values thus it is apparent that the rate equation could not predict fe ii oxidation reasonably well which might be due to the limitation of considering only homogeneous oxidation hence in the presence of fe iii the fe ii oxidation may also occur as heterogeneous oxidation on the surface of iron hydroxide from the data presented in table 3 there is ample evidence that the adsorbed fe ii seemingly got oxidised at a slower rate when no other competitive ions were present thus catalytic oxidation of fe ii in the heterogeneous phase as reported earlier tamura et al 1976 morgan and lahav 2007 may not be inferred for this system due to the adsorbed fe ii remaining unoxidised on the surface of fe iii ftir spectroscopy was carried out to verify the presence of fe ii adsorbed on ferric hydroxide ftir spectra obtained as shown in figs s1 and s2 were compared with available literature on similar systems subsequently the peaks obtained at 3235 3420 cm 1 were attributed to the oh stretch 2650 2700 cm 1 to the fe oh bond 1700 50 cm 1 to the oh bend i e h2o and 930 cm 1 to the fe o bond myneni et al 1998a b sun and doner 1996 jia et al 2007 goldberg 2002 goldberg and johnston 2001 manning et al 1998 thus as no specific bond of fe ii and fe iii was observed its presence on the surface of hydrated ferric oxide hfo could not be conclusively proved either it was oxidised before our analysis or existed in too low a concentration to be definitively observed however none of these points can be stated conclusively and therefore further detailed studies need to be undertaken 3 4 8 modelling of an fe ii removal adsorption unit an adsorption unit was developed as a batch reactor and the schematic diagram of the unit is depicted in fig 7 the lab scale batch setup design consists of two tanks one for mixing the adsorbent and the other for storage after treatment both tanks are placed one above the other as shown in fig 8 it has been designed for the treatment of 20 l of water as a batch the incoming water from the reservoir is taken to tank 1 where the water is allowed to mix with the adsorbent and decanted after adsorption the water is taken to tank 2 for storage a motor mechanism with 50 rpm has been provided for mixing the adsorbent and the incoming water the performance of the iron removal unit was evaluated by modelling the adsorption unit based on the kinetic study conducted earlier an optimum time of adsorption was found out for different fe ii concentrations on the basis of the kinetic study conducted the results obtained from modelling of the new adsorption unit are shown in table 4 the results obtained show that for 1000 g of adsorbent in 20 l of water to be treated the outlet concentrations obtained were below 0 3 mg l for 1 2 5 and 5 mg l of inlet fe ii concentration this indicated that the model describes the kinetics of the adsorption under consideration thus by increasing the time of adsorption various concentrations of fe ii can be reduced to a level expected on the basis of adsorption kinetic study 3 4 9 recommendations for field application the lab scale batch mode adsorption unit modeled based on the kinetic study proved to be efficient in fe ii removal the only limitation observed during the operation was improper settling of adsorbent after 2 or 3 rounds of operation this was rectified in the setup by passing the water through a filter cloth of 200 Î¼m pore size before storage the overall performance of the batch setup was satisfactory and proved to be efficient and cost effective compared to the other advanced mechanisms used the recommendations of the new adsorption unit for field application are listed below incorporating a multi layered sand filter reduces the time required for settling of flocs and provides additional filtration mechanism instead of providing a rotary mechanism for mixing of adsorbent the incorporation of aeration provides both mixing as well as removal mechanism advantages the outlet from the sludge decanting mechanism can be utilised as feo source for many industries 4 conclusion the proposed method of adsorption mechanism showed remarkable efficiency in the removal of fe ii from water contact time and adsorbent dosage had a positive influence on the adsorption mechanism in the narrow ph range between 6 5 and 7 the adsorbent worked effectively during the adsorption process also the effect of competitive ions on the adsorption mechanism suggested that fe ii adsorption from hard groundwaters may be less efficient due to the presence of ca2 and mn2 ions which inhibited the adsorptive iron removal efficiency ions such as sulphate chloride and flouride did not affect the iron adsorption based on the kinetic study adsorptive removal of fe ii was concluded to follow pseudo second order kinetics which relied on the assumption of chemisorption as the removal mechanism based on the kinetic study the adsorption reaction will proceed as more adsorption sites feo group form on the surface of the adsorbent the adsorption unit proposed in this work has potential to be one of the efficient methods for fe ii removal from groundwater when developed on a larger scale for field

fe zn pb cu zn and mn concentration in drinking water comprising of 12 mechanized boreholes mbh and 44 hand dug wells hdw in atonsu a suburb of kumasi ghana were assessed carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risk assessments sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for children and adults were carried out using monte carlo simulations technique the results showed that the chemical

exposure pathways for both adults and children indicated that the most important factors in the risk model are 1 the amount of the heavy metal consumed 2 exposure duration and 3 ingestion rate to protect public health reduction of the metal s concentrations proper construction of the wells to prevent runoff seepage and comprehensive water quality monitoring program are recommended to avoid minimise the potential risk to the population graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater heavy metals risk assessment sensitivity analysis ghana 1 introduction groundwater is and will keep being a significant source of potable water for most rural and urban dwellers globally in sub saharan africa access to potable water supply is still a major challenge and groundwater drawn from boreholes and protected hand dug wells are the main improved water sources in most rural and peri urban settlements foster et al 2006 in ghana 62 of urban and 71 of rural communities depend on groundwater as their essential source of drinking water obiri danso et al 2009 boreholes and hand dug wells have become a major source of water for households and modern industrial use particularly in territories and spots that do not get water from the local water supply company ghana water company limited gwcl in view of the recognized well being and economic effects associated with drinking contaminated water the quality of groundwater meant for domestic and industrial consumption must be constantly monitored for sustainable groundwater security and management strategies sathees et al 2013 heavy metals are naturally occurring elements and are present in varying concentrations in all ecosystems they are found in elemental forms and in a variety of chemical compounds human activities have drastically changed the biochemical cycle and balance of some heavy metals according to nriagu and pacyna 1995 and alaee et al 2003 between 1850 and 1990 the productions of pb cu and zn have increased tenfold as a result of human activities the main anthropogenic sources of heavy metals are mining and industrial activities like foundries smelters combustion of fossil fuel and gasoline and waste incinerators in recent times trace or heavy metal contamination in groundwater has been a major source of concern on local regional and global scales based on their concentration levels and toxicity they can cause serious health and environmental hazards this concern is highlighted in several scientific studies on as contamination of groundwater in bangladesh alam et al 2003 and cd pb cu and zn contamination of groundwater and vegetables in europe asia and africa hadzi et al 2018 miller et al 2004 zietz et al 2003 anawar et al 2002 with its related human health issues anthropogenic activities like improper disposal of waste have been found culpable for the elevation of heavy metal concentrations in groundwater saleem et al 2015 however heavy metals are also found naturally in the earth s crust exposure to high concentrations of heavy metals like fe and mn in drinking water usually imparts aesthetic mutations to some consumers while metals such as as cr pb can cause serious health problems including diarrhoea dermatitis nausea liver and kidney damage as well as respiratory problems hadzi et al 2018 to reduce the impact of heavy metals on human health and the environment there has been a significant development of cost effective technologies for removing heavy metals in drinking water and waste water such as zn senthil kumar et al 2012 pb senthil kumar et al 2013 and cr yaashikaa et al 2019 femina carolin et al 2017 provides an extensive literature review on heavy metal removal technologies in drinking water and waste water atonsu is one of the major peri urban territories in the kumasi metropolis in the ashanti region of ghana abdul razak 2012 the territory is part of the wetland zone within the ashanti region as with all wetland areas the water table here is very shallow and groundwater can be assessed few meters below the surface abdul razak 2012 the majority of the masses living in this zone depend on hand dug wells springs and boreholes these sources of water are relatively affordable when contrasted with penetrated wells which are sunk to more profound depths the proliferation of hand dug wells is expected due to the deficient and irregular supply of water from gwcl the inhabitants of atonsu do not fetch water directly from the boreholes or hand dug wells but rather pump the water into their houses through a pipe distribution system there is limited literature on heavy metal contamination in the atonsu area however several studies have been carried out in other parts of ghana which have indicated increased concentrations of heavy metals and other contaminants in groundwater surface water and sediments in peri urban areas cobbina et al 2013 obiri 2007 obiri et al 2010 armah et al 2011 the extent and degree of heavy metal contamination reported in different parts of the country vary depending on geology and the anthropogenic activities mining industry improper waste disposal and heavy vehicular traffic occurring in the area despite the existence of several data on trace metal contamination in ghana most of the studies focused on their compliance with who 2004 acceptable limits without addressing the potential human health risk to children teens and adults who are exposed to these metals via drinking water using comprehensive risk assessment models health risk assessment models provide a systematic form of quantitative and semi quantitative descriptions of the potential human or environmental health effect attributed to exposure to contaminants in drinking water the conventional approach is usually based on a single or deterministic value of the input parameters concentrations of the contaminant ingestion rate body weight contact frequency and duration parameters to compute the risk the approach provides a numeral value for average scenarios of the risk it may over or under estimate the actual risk because uncertainty factors are not considered lonati and zanoni 2012 the probabilistic approach using the monte carlo simulation provides a more realistic risk assessment that accounts for different kinds of uncertainties sensitivity to different exposure pathways and the effects of various intervention scenarios fallahzadeh et al 2018 augustsson and berger 2014 morisset et al 2013 the probabilistic approach using the monte carlo simulation regards all the input parameters for calculating the risk as distributions or random variables to obtain a wide range of outcomes a risk or hazard quotient hq after repeated simulations usually 10 000 or more zhang et al 2017 yousefi et al 2018 the final outcome of a given risk is obtained in a form of a probability distribution this method has been used in various studies to assess the risk of pollutants in drinking water zhang et al 2017 fallahzadeh et al 2018 lonati et al 2007 the main purpose of the study was to assess the spatial distribution of heavy metal contamination in drinking water and their potential human health risk oral ingestion and dermal exposure within the atonsu community through a quantitative health risk assessment model the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis due to exposure to heavy metals were also evaluated the results of the water quality analysis were buttressed by collecting data on cases of water borne diseases diarrhoeal diseases suspected cholera and typhoid fever within the community from the kumasi south hospital the hart adventist hospital and christ the king hospital the outcome and findings of this study can serve as a baseline data and provide information on human health risk associated with the consumption of heavy metal contaminated drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area atonsu is a peri urban community in the kumasi metropolis in the ashanti region of ghana africa the study area is located between 6 37 40 n and 6 40 0 n and 1 34 20 w and 1 37 0 w as shown in fig 1 it has a population of about 8790 the area lies in the transitional forest zone specifically within the moist semi deciduous south east ecological zone and is characterised by a wet sub equatorial climate ghana statistical service 2014 the kumasi metropolis lies within the plateau of the south west physical region which ranges from 250 to 300 m above sea level the topography is undulating the area lies within the birimian super group which is a major part of the paleo proterozoic terrain of ghana underlain by supra crustal and intrusive rocks which display a characteristic pattern of ne trending parallel approximately evenly spaced volcanic belts called volcano plutonic group and intervening sedimentary basins called the sedimentary volcano sedimentary group geological map of ghana 2009 the metropolis is traversed by a major river owabi and streams like subin wiwi sisai aboabo and nsuben ghana statistical service 2014 2 2 water sample collection preparation and treatment water samples were collected from fifty six 56 point sources comprising twelve 12 mechanized boreholes mbh and forty four 44 hand dug wells hdw as shown in fig 1 500 ml of each sample was collected into plastic bottles prewashed with a 1 1 concentrated nitric acid and distilled water solution and eventually rinsed with only distilled water sample bottles were labeled with unique codes and date of collection for easy identification the samples were collected in duplicates after every fifth sample sample bottles were acidified to ph 2 with concentrated hno3 before being transported to the laboratory the container was rinsed three times with water from the well of interest before samples were collected from each point source in situ measurement of ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds temperature salinity and the geographical coordinates were done all water samples were then kept in an ice chest containing ice bricks at a temperature below 5 c and transported to the ghana atomic energy commission gaec laboratory at the laboratory the samples were kept in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to analysis naveedullah et al 2014 2 3 digestion analysis of water samples and quality control acid digestion of the samples was performed using a commercial high pressure laboratory microwave oven milestone ethos 1600 microwave lab station sorisole italy this equipment has ten 100 ml tetrafluoro methoxy tfm tubes operating at a frequency of 50

mÏ cm was used as blank dilution and preparation of solutions where required the trace metals were analysed using a fast sequential atomic absorption spectrometer varian aa240fs the equipment was first calibrated with standards and the lamps optimized then the water samples were aspirated through the capillary tube of the atomic absorption spectrometer aas and the concentrations and absorbance of heavy metals were displayed on the monitor to underscore the reliability of the analytical method quality control qc and blank samples were acid digested and subsequently analysed for the heavy metals of interest through the same procedure brady et al 2014 the samples were further analysed in triplicates and after every 5 samples a calibration standard was used to check the response and efficiency of the instrument alongside the blank which was constantly used to check for contamination reproducibility and recovery tests were conducted using a multi element reference standard standard agilent technologies multi element reference standard 2a as the unknown the percentage recovery obtained for the standard ranged from 99 2 to 105 8 this suggests that the error linked with the analysis is negligible hence the results are reliable 2 4 health risk assessment and risk characterization the major routes for heavy metal entry into the human body are 1 direct ingestion of substrate particles ding 2 inhalation of suspended particles through the mouth and nose dinh and 3 dermal absorption of elements in particles stuck to exposed skin dder de miguel et al 2007 for this research health risk assessment of heavy metals in drinking water were estimated using the oral ingestion and dermal absorption scenarios for receivers adults and children based on the usepa 2002 risk assessment methodology inhalation as an entry way was excluded from the assessment because of unavailable toxicological data such as inhalation reference dose and transfer efficiency from water to air in either database or published literature zhang et al 2017 2 5 exposure models the questionnaires administered helped to highlight the parameters needed for the risk assessment of the heavy metals in the water it also gathered information regarding the treatment usage and general quality of the water the exposure doses in water through ingestion and dermal contact was computed using equations 1

level of risk on the health of humans table 2 2 7 monte carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis health risk assessments are usually accompanied with high uncertainties especially when single point values are used to estimate risk for a given population to cater for uncertainty and variability analysis input values were described with probabilistic distributions and subject it through a monte carlo simulation with hypercube sampling method in 100 000 iterations this process was applied in order to separate uncertainty from variability to minimise their influences on the risk assessment estimates priorities were given to the values obtained from the study area obtained from the questionnaires administered the sensitivity analysis was also performed to identify the input parameters which have significant impact on the model output in this study the monte carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis were done in microsoft excel with in built risk software palisade corporation version 7 4 all input parameters are shown in table 3 2 8 data and statistical analysis a total of 150 questionnaires were administered and 145 respondents completed their questionnaires giving a response success rate of 96 67 some additional data needed for some of the input parameters were obtained from nearby hospitals after obtaining ethical clearance from the committee on human research publications and ethics chrpe school of medical sciences knust kumasi the risk 7 5 software with add on to excel was constructed in microsoft excel and used to estimate the probability of health risk and sensitivity analysis the software subjected the input data to the monte carlo simulation of 100 000 iterations with hypercube sampling for probability of health risk and sensitivity analysis in order to account for the variability and uncertainty in the model parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry table 4 presents a statistical overview of the hydro chemical data of hdw and mbh in the study area the hdw had ph being slightly acidic to slightly basic and ranging from 5 31 to 8 10 while the mbh ph ranged from 5 58 to 7 4 the chemical composition of the hdw and mbh varies over a wide range both in salinity and ionic composition but lowly mineralized with tds 600 mg l and 100 mg l respectively table 4 the ec and tds of the hdw ranged from 92 Î¼s cm to 1065 Î¼s cm with an average of 371 Î¼s cm and 51 mg l to 586 mg l with an average of 204 mg l respectively all water samples are relatively fresh with tds 1000 mg l salinity of the hdw range from 0 00 ppt to 0 50 ppt with an average of 0 10 ppt while all the mbh recorded salinity of 0 ppt fig 2 shows spatial distribution of ec and tds in both mbh and hdw tds is a measure of the total ionic concentrations of dissolved minerals in water natural groundwater contains mineral ions which dissolve slowly in soil particles sediments and rocks as the water moves along mineral surfaces in the pores or fractured zones within the aquifer other dissolved solids are from precipitation water or river water that recharges the aquifer others are also influenced by human activities or other forms of pollution which can affect the concentrations of tds in water samples danr and nrsc 2003 the observed low ec tds and salinity of the mbh was due to the fact that all the mbh were fitted with desalinization systems for private home use the dominant cation for both hdw and mbh is na with mean concentration of 38 97 mg l and 12 74 mg l respectively this is followed by ca2 with mean concentration of 13 84 mg l and 5 40 mg l and then by k and mg2 which have mean concentrations of 2 97 and 5 40 and 0 20 and 0 06 mg l respectively however all the cations are below their respective guideline who and gsa guideline values the cation dominance is in the order of ca2 na k mg2 the dominant anion in both hdw and mbh is hco3 having mean concentration 65 70 and 37 33 mg l respectively followed by cl with mean concentrations of 28 72 and 5 49 respectively so4 2 and po4 3 were generally low however in the high no3 concentrations were recorded in most of the hdw with about 21 above the guideline value of 50 mg l who 2004 this could be due to the shallow nature of the hdw and poor construction without concrete lining this allows for contamination from sources such as waste from livestock operations septic tank or drained field effluent and crop fertilizers 3 2 concentrations of the heavy metals the results of the heavy metal concentrations in borehole and the hand dug wells are presented in table 4 the mean concentrations of the heavy metals are generally low when compared with the various guideline values table 4 co cr cu and cd were below the detection limit of the instrument used for the analysis mn zn and fe showed appreciable levels in some wells however all the values were below their respective guideline values pb recorded the highest concentrations in both the hand dug wells and the mechanized boreholes ranging from 0 001 to 0 04 mg l and 0 001 0 02 mg l with mean values of 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the primary sources of lead in most drinking water sources is the piping system dust soil containing lead and from anthropogenic activities metal scrap dealers blacksmith land fill sites and improper disposal of waste there is no piping system in the area and all the samples were taken from open hand dug wells with poor sanitary conditions and drainage system hence the likely source of the pb could be from the atmospheric dust soil and run off from metal scrap dealers blacksmith and land fill sites fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of zn pb fe and mn in the study area 3 3 human health risk assessment 150 questionnaires were administered in the study area the questionnaire was structured into five sections personal data age weight height bio data of water source consumption and storage water quality treatment and maintenance health risk demographic and socio economic data table 5 shows the input parameters used for the risk assessment model obtained from the questionnaires the exposure frequency was assumed to be 365 days year since all the respondents had not travelled out of the zone during holidays and were always available using the exposure frequency of 365 days year also helped to estimate the worst case scenario risk in the current study both carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks were used to assess the human health risks due to exposure to heavy metals through ingestion and dermal contact table 5 shows the cdi though ingestion and dermal exposure pathways for carcinogenic and non carcinogenic metals for adults and children the heavy metals cdi varied widely among the different categories of population under study as well as for the scenarios from table 5 the amount of cdi of heavy metals through ingestion is much higher than the amount of heavy metals taken through dermal contact considering the mean values for the cdi the dermal exposure pathway recorded generally a three or more orders of magnitude lower than the oral ingestion for both adults and children in the study area table 5 therefore ingestion is considered to be the primary exposure route of heavy metal concentrations within the study area for both adult and children based on the usepa 2004 hazard quotient hq values greater than 1 for any toxicant of interest can pose a health risk to consumers and measures must be put in place to reduce the concentrations from table 5 the hq values for dermal route exposure were below unity for both adults and children for fe mn and zn this indicates that there is minimal risk to human health when contact with the water is through the skin however hq for oral route exposure was greater than 1 for fe and mn in both adults and children given that the hq value is higher than 1 for adults and children the health of this group is highly at risk table 5 shows the hazard index hi a summation of all the hqs hqing hqderm for the individual metals hi for adult has fe and mn having values greater than 1 that is 1 351and 6 484 respectively whilst zn had a value of 0 362 which is within the acceptable limits on the other hand hi for children had mn and fe greater than 1 with values of 6 274 and 1 306 respectively the degree of risk posed is in the order of mn fe zn for non carcinogenic risk for both adult and children since the communities depend on these water sources for drinking reducing and controlling the concentration of fe and mn is necessary to minimise the potential health implication of consuming excess mn and fe such as stomach upset nausea vomiting diarrhoea irregular heartbeat and low blood pressure at the moment the most common and cheap ways to remove heavy metals from drinking water include activated carbon and ion exchange fu and wang 2011 in the case of carcinogenic health risk using pb all the samples for both adults and children had hq 1 indicating no potential health risk hi for carcinogenic risk for adult and children were all below unity and this means their concentrations found in the water do not pose any health risk to consumers with values of 0 911 and 0 882 respectively 3 4 sensitivity analysis the spearman s correlation coefficient was used to analyse the sensitivity of the parameters used in the risk assessment fig 4 shows the relationship between body weight exposure duration ingestion rate and the concentrations of the heavy metals the sensitivity analysis was carried out to easily identify the relevant variables contributing to the risk estimates in the model for both adults and children the monte carlo simulation was used to help minimise the uncertainty of calculations in the risk assessment figures obtained directly from the field were given the highest priority whenever appropriate to reduce the assessment uncertainty caused by distribution factors like water ingestion rate body weight concentration of metal in water exposure duration exposure frequency and exposure time the sensitivity analysis for adult and children through oral exposure indicates that risk is very sensitive and has a strong to very strong positive correlation to exposure duration and concentration of the metals itself fig 4 the sensitivity analysis for contact through dermal exposure for both adults and children also show a strong positive correlation to exposure duration and concentration of the metals ingestion rate also showed a positive but weak correlation to exposure in both adults and children body weight however showed an inverse and weak correlation to risk this means that the weight of an individual has no direct influence on the concentration of metals the body can accumulate and therefore does not influence risk the sensitivity analysis result indicates that the cw and ir variables for oral ingestion can be used to decrease the risk of ingesting these heavy metals in the study area thus reducing the heavy metal concentration in the drinking water exposure duration and ingestion rate can help mitigate the non carcinogenic risk for the studied population 3 5 assumptions uncertainty and limitations associated with the model several studies have established an exposure response relationship between the level duration of exposure to heavy metals and the occurrence of heavy metals poisoning anawar et al 2002 obiri et al 2010 however the quantitative relationship between intake and risk is still not confirmed due to uncertainties associated with the prevalence of heavy metal poisoning and drinking of heavy metals contaminated water the monte carlo simulations greatly enhanced the health risk assessment due to the quantification of the uncertainties however the sensitivity analysis showed that other uncertainties could still not be accounted for in some of the input parameters of the model that affected the risk assessment for examples the amount of the heavy metal consumed by the individual is an important factor in the risk estimate in our estimation we assume that heavy metal in drinking water is the only source of daily heavy metal intake however several studies have proved that heavy metals vegetables cereals root crops dust particles soil etc can pose significant health risk hence our assumptions could lead to uncertainties of heavy metals exposure and underestimation of the risk therefore future studies on risk assessment should consider taking more data from each exposure pathways to reduce the uncertainty in the risk estimate 3 6 recommendations for groundwater management prevention and control of heavy metals contamination based on the field observations and analysis carried out we recommend the following for the prevention and control of the potential risk of heavy metals contaminations boreholes and hand wells with high metals concentrations should be treated before drinking there should be a comprehensive audit and water quality assessment of all drinking water sources in the area chemical bacteriological and heavy metal future studies on risk assessment should include inhalation exposure to improve on the estimate the hand dug wells should be properly lined and the onsite sanitations around the wells should be taken seriously to prevent runoff entering the wells the data generated from project implementing agencies and ngos together with all other available data should be made available to the district assemblies to guide future groundwater management strategies there should be a strong advocacy health education and public awareness on the effect of heavy metals contamination in drinking water on human health 4 conclusion the concentration carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risk of cr cd fe zn pb cu zn and mn in drinking water 12 boreholes and 44 hand dug wells in atonsu a suburb of kumasi ghana is presented in this study the results showed that the chemical composition of the groundwater samples varies over a wide range both in salinity and ionic composition but lowly mineralized with tds 1000 mg l all the measured parameters were below their respective guideline values however high no3 concentrations were recorded in most of the hdw with about 21 above the guideline value of 50 mg l co cr cu and cd were below the detection limit of the instrument used for the analysis mn and zn showed appreciable levels in some wells but below their respective guideline limits however 88 63 and 83 33 of the hand dug wells and boreholes had pb above the guideline values respectively although other sources could be accounting for the presence of the heavy metals in water anthropogenic activities are suspected to be the principal contributor the non carcinogenic hazard index hi for adult and children with respect to fe and mn were greater than 1 indicating some level of risk however the carcinogenic hi with respect to pb is 1 a sensitivity analysis for the oral and dermal exposure pathways for both adults and children indicated that the most important factors in risk model are the amount of the heavy metal consumed exposure duration and ingestion rate the current study therefore provides further insights on heavy metal contamination in drinking water and its potential effect on human health at atonsu it is therefore imperative to take measures to reduce the heavy metals in some of the wells properly construct the wells to avoid run off seepage and also implement a comprehensive monitoring of the water quality to avoid the potential risk to the

minimise the potential risk to the population graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater heavy metals risk assessment sensitivity analysis ghana 1 introduction groundwater is and will keep being a significant source of potable water for most rural and urban dwellers globally in sub saharan africa access to potable water supply is still a major challenge and groundwater drawn from boreholes and protected hand dug wells are the main improved water sources in most rural and peri urban settlements foster et al 2006 in ghana 62 of urban and 71 of rural communities depend on groundwater as their essential source of drinking water obiri danso et al 2009 boreholes and hand dug wells have become a major source of water for households and modern industrial use particularly in territories and spots that do not get water from the local water supply company ghana water company limited gwcl in view of the recognized well being and economic effects associated with drinking contaminated water the quality of groundwater meant for domestic and industrial consumption must be constantly monitored for sustainable groundwater security and management strategies sathees et al 2013 heavy metals are naturally occurring elements and are present in varying concentrations in all ecosystems they are found in elemental forms and in a variety of chemical compounds human activities have drastically changed the biochemical cycle and balance of some heavy metals according to nriagu and pacyna 1995 and alaee et al 2003 between 1850 and 1990 the productions of pb cu and zn have increased tenfold as a result of human activities the main anthropogenic sources of heavy metals are mining and industrial activities like foundries smelters combustion of fossil fuel and gasoline and waste incinerators in recent times trace or heavy metal contamination in groundwater has been a major source of concern on local regional and global scales based on their concentration levels and toxicity they can cause serious health and environmental hazards this concern is highlighted in several scientific studies on as contamination of groundwater in bangladesh alam et al 2003 and cd pb cu and zn contamination of groundwater and vegetables in europe asia and africa hadzi et al 2018 miller et al 2004 zietz et al 2003 anawar et al 2002 with its related human health issues anthropogenic activities like improper disposal of waste have been found culpable for the elevation of heavy metal concentrations in groundwater saleem et al 2015 however heavy metals are also found naturally in the earth s crust exposure to high concentrations of heavy metals like fe and mn in drinking water usually imparts aesthetic mutations to some consumers while metals such as as cr pb can cause serious health problems including diarrhoea dermatitis nausea liver and kidney damage as well as respiratory problems hadzi et al 2018 to reduce the impact of heavy metals on human health and the environment there has been a significant development of cost effective technologies for removing heavy metals in drinking water and waste water such as zn senthil kumar et al 2012 pb senthil kumar et al 2013 and cr yaashikaa et al 2019 femina carolin et al 2017 provides an extensive literature review on heavy metal removal technologies in drinking water and waste water atonsu is one of the major peri urban territories in the kumasi metropolis in the ashanti region of ghana abdul razak 2012 the territory is part of the wetland zone within the ashanti region as with all wetland areas the water table here is very shallow and groundwater can be assessed few meters below the surface abdul razak 2012 the majority of the masses living in this zone depend on hand dug wells springs and boreholes these sources of water are relatively affordable when contrasted with penetrated wells which are sunk to more profound depths the proliferation of hand dug wells is expected due to the deficient and irregular supply of water from gwcl the inhabitants of atonsu do not fetch water directly from the boreholes or hand dug wells but rather pump the water into their houses through a pipe distribution system there is limited literature on heavy metal contamination in the atonsu area however several studies have been carried out in other parts of ghana which have indicated increased concentrations of heavy metals and other contaminants in groundwater surface water and sediments in peri urban areas cobbina et al 2013 obiri 2007 obiri et al 2010 armah et al 2011 the extent and degree of heavy metal contamination reported in different parts of the country vary depending on geology and the anthropogenic activities mining industry improper waste disposal and heavy vehicular traffic occurring in the area despite the existence of several data on trace metal contamination in ghana most of the studies focused on their compliance with who 2004 acceptable limits without addressing the potential human health risk to children teens and adults who are exposed to these metals via drinking water using comprehensive risk assessment models health risk assessment models provide a systematic form of quantitative and semi quantitative descriptions of the potential human or environmental health effect attributed to exposure to contaminants in drinking water the conventional approach is usually based on a single or deterministic value of the input parameters concentrations of the contaminant ingestion rate body weight contact frequency and duration parameters to compute the risk the approach provides a numeral value for average scenarios of the risk it may over or under estimate the actual risk because uncertainty factors are not considered lonati and zanoni 2012 the probabilistic approach using the monte carlo simulation provides a more realistic risk assessment that accounts for different kinds of uncertainties sensitivity to different exposure pathways and the effects of various intervention scenarios fallahzadeh et al 2018 augustsson and berger 2014 morisset et al 2013 the probabilistic approach using the monte carlo simulation regards all the input parameters for calculating the risk as distributions or random variables to obtain a wide range of outcomes a risk or hazard quotient hq after repeated simulations usually 10 000 or more zhang et al 2017 yousefi et al 2018 the final outcome of a given risk is obtained in a form of a probability distribution this method has been used in various studies to assess the risk of pollutants in drinking water zhang et al 2017 fallahzadeh et al 2018 lonati et al 2007 the main purpose of the study was to assess the spatial distribution of heavy metal contamination in drinking water and their potential human health risk oral ingestion and dermal exposure within the atonsu community through a quantitative health risk assessment model the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis due to exposure to heavy metals were also evaluated the results of the water quality analysis were buttressed by collecting data on cases of water borne diseases diarrhoeal diseases suspected cholera and typhoid fever within the community from the kumasi south hospital the hart adventist hospital and christ the king hospital the outcome and findings of this study can serve as a baseline data and provide information on human health risk associated with the consumption of heavy metal contaminated drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area atonsu is a peri urban community in the kumasi metropolis in the ashanti region of ghana africa the study area is located between 6 37 40 n and 6 40 0 n and 1 34 20 w and 1 37 0 w as shown in fig 1 it has a population of about 8790 the area lies in the transitional forest zone specifically within the moist semi deciduous south east ecological zone and is characterised by a wet sub equatorial climate ghana statistical service 2014 the kumasi metropolis lies within the plateau of the south west physical region which ranges from 250 to 300 m above sea level the topography is undulating the area lies within the birimian super group which is a major part of the paleo proterozoic terrain of ghana underlain by supra crustal and intrusive rocks which display a characteristic pattern of ne trending parallel approximately evenly spaced volcanic belts called volcano plutonic group and intervening sedimentary basins called the sedimentary volcano sedimentary group geological map of ghana 2009 the metropolis is traversed by a major river owabi and streams like subin wiwi sisai aboabo and nsuben ghana statistical service 2014 2 2 water sample collection preparation and treatment water samples were collected from fifty six 56 point sources comprising twelve 12 mechanized boreholes mbh and forty four 44 hand dug wells hdw as shown in fig 1 500 ml of each sample was collected into plastic bottles prewashed with a 1 1 concentrated nitric acid and distilled water solution and eventually rinsed with only distilled water sample bottles were labeled with unique codes and date of collection for easy identification the samples were collected in duplicates after every fifth sample sample bottles were acidified to ph 2 with concentrated hno3 before being transported to the laboratory the container was rinsed three times with water from the well of interest before samples were collected from each point source in situ measurement of ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds temperature salinity and the geographical coordinates were done all water samples were then kept in an ice chest containing ice bricks at a temperature below 5 c and transported to the ghana atomic energy commission gaec laboratory at the laboratory the samples were kept in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to analysis naveedullah et al 2014 2 3 digestion analysis of water samples and quality control acid digestion of the samples was performed using a commercial high pressure laboratory microwave oven milestone ethos 1600 microwave lab station sorisole italy this equipment has ten 100 ml tetrafluoro methoxy tfm tubes operating at a frequency of 50 hz with an energy input of 2200 w analytical grade chemicals and reagents were used for digesting the samples hcl 35 m v hno3 69 m v and hclo4 71 73 m v high purity deionised water resistivity 18 2 mÏ cm was used as blank dilution and preparation of solutions where required the trace metals were analysed using a fast sequential atomic absorption spectrometer varian aa240fs the equipment was first calibrated with standards and the lamps optimized then the water samples were aspirated through the capillary tube of the atomic absorption spectrometer aas and the concentrations and absorbance of heavy metals were displayed on the monitor to underscore the reliability of the analytical method quality control qc and blank samples were acid digested and subsequently analysed for the heavy metals of interest through the same procedure brady et al 2014 the samples were further analysed in triplicates and after every 5 samples a calibration standard was used to check the response and efficiency of the instrument alongside the blank which was constantly used to check for contamination reproducibility and recovery tests were conducted using a multi element reference standard standard agilent technologies multi element reference standard 2a as the unknown the percentage recovery obtained for the standard ranged from 99 2 to 105 8 this suggests that the error linked with the analysis is negligible hence the results are reliable 2 4 health risk assessment and risk characterization the major routes for heavy metal entry into the human body are 1 direct ingestion of substrate particles ding 2 inhalation of suspended particles through the mouth and nose dinh and 3 dermal absorption of elements in particles stuck to exposed skin dder de miguel et al 2007 for this research health risk assessment of heavy metals in drinking water were estimated using the oral ingestion and dermal absorption scenarios for receivers adults and children based on the usepa 2002 risk assessment methodology inhalation as an entry way was excluded from the assessment because of unavailable toxicological data such as inhalation reference dose and transfer efficiency from water to air in either database or published literature zhang et al 2017 2 5 exposure models the questionnaires administered helped to highlight the parameters needed for the risk assessment of the heavy metals in the water it also gathered information regarding the treatment usage and general quality of the water the exposure doses in water through ingestion and dermal contact was computed using equations 1

associated with individual carcinogenic heavy metals 5 r i s k s f i c d i i 6 r t o t a l i 1 n s f i c d i i the classification based on man et al 2010 and fryer et al 2006 were used to assess the level of risk on the health of humans table 2 2 7 monte carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis health risk assessments are usually accompanied with high uncertainties especially when single point values are used to estimate risk for a given population to cater for uncertainty and variability analysis input values were described with probabilistic distributions and subject it through a monte carlo simulation with hypercube sampling method in 100 000 iterations this process was applied in order to separate uncertainty from variability to minimise their influences on the risk assessment estimates priorities were given to the values obtained from the study area obtained from the questionnaires administered the sensitivity analysis was also performed to identify the input parameters which have significant impact on the model output in this study the monte carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis were done in microsoft excel with in built risk software palisade corporation version 7 4 all input parameters are shown in table 3 2 8 data and statistical analysis a total of 150 questionnaires were administered and 145 respondents completed their questionnaires giving a response success rate of 96 67 some additional data needed for some of the input parameters were obtained from nearby hospitals after obtaining ethical clearance from the committee on human research publications and ethics chrpe school of medical sciences knust kumasi the risk 7 5 software with add on to excel was constructed in microsoft excel and used to estimate the probability of health risk and sensitivity analysis the software subjected the input data to the monte carlo simulation of 100 000 iterations with hypercube sampling for probability of health risk and sensitivity analysis in order to account for the variability and uncertainty in the model parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry table 4 presents a statistical overview of the hydro chemical data of hdw and mbh in the study area the hdw had ph being slightly acidic to slightly basic and ranging from 5 31 to 8 10 while the mbh ph ranged from 5 58 to 7 4 the chemical composition of the hdw and mbh varies over a wide range both in salinity and ionic composition but lowly mineralized with tds 600 mg l and 100 mg l respectively table 4 the ec and tds of the hdw ranged from 92 Î¼s cm to 1065 Î¼s cm with an average of 371 Î¼s cm and 51 mg l to 586 mg l with an average of 204 mg l respectively all water samples are relatively fresh with tds 1000 mg l salinity of the hdw range from 0 00 ppt to 0 50 ppt with an average of 0 10 ppt while all the mbh recorded salinity of 0 ppt fig 2 shows spatial distribution of ec and tds in both mbh and hdw tds is a measure of the total ionic concentrations of dissolved minerals in water natural groundwater contains mineral ions which dissolve slowly in soil particles sediments and rocks as the water moves along mineral surfaces in the pores or fractured zones within the aquifer other dissolved solids are from precipitation water or river water that recharges the aquifer others are also influenced by human activities or other forms of pollution which can affect the concentrations of tds in water samples danr and nrsc 2003 the observed low ec tds and salinity of the mbh was due to the fact that all the mbh were fitted with desalinization systems for private home use the dominant cation for both hdw and mbh is na with mean concentration of 38 97 mg l and 12 74 mg l respectively this is followed by ca2 with mean concentration of 13 84 mg l and 5 40 mg l and then by k and mg2 which have mean concentrations of 2 97 and 5 40 and 0 20 and 0 06 mg l respectively however all the cations are below their respective guideline who and gsa guideline values the cation dominance is in the order of ca2 na k mg2 the dominant anion in both hdw and mbh is hco3 having mean concentration 65 70 and 37 33 mg l respectively followed by cl with mean concentrations of 28 72 and 5 49 respectively so4 2 and po4 3 were generally low however in the high no3 concentrations were recorded in most of the hdw with about 21 above the guideline value of 50 mg l who 2004 this could be due to the shallow nature of the hdw and poor construction without concrete lining this allows for contamination from sources such as waste from livestock operations septic tank or drained field effluent and crop fertilizers 3 2 concentrations of the heavy metals the results of the heavy metal concentrations in borehole and the hand dug wells are presented in table 4 the mean concentrations of the heavy metals are generally low when compared with the various guideline values table 4 co cr cu and cd were below the detection limit of the instrument used for the analysis mn zn and fe showed appreciable levels in some wells however all the values were below their respective guideline values pb recorded the highest concentrations in both the hand dug wells and the mechanized boreholes ranging from 0 001 to 0 04 mg l and 0 001 0 02 mg l with mean values of 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the primary sources of lead in most drinking water sources is the piping system dust soil containing lead and from anthropogenic activities metal scrap dealers blacksmith land fill sites and improper disposal of waste there is no piping system in the area and all the samples were taken from open hand dug wells with poor sanitary conditions and drainage system hence the likely source of the pb could be from the atmospheric dust soil and run off from metal scrap dealers blacksmith and land fill sites fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of zn pb fe and mn in the study area 3 3 human health risk assessment 150 questionnaires were administered in the study area the questionnaire was structured into five sections personal data age weight height bio data of water source consumption and storage water quality treatment and maintenance health risk demographic and socio economic data table 5 shows the input parameters used for the risk assessment model obtained from the questionnaires the exposure frequency was assumed to be 365 days year since all the respondents had not travelled out of the zone during holidays and were always available using the exposure frequency of 365 days year also helped to estimate the worst case scenario risk in the current study both carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks were used to assess the human health risks due to exposure to heavy metals through ingestion and dermal contact table 5 shows the cdi though ingestion and dermal exposure pathways for carcinogenic and non carcinogenic metals for adults and children the heavy metals cdi varied widely among the different categories of population under study as well as for the scenarios from table 5 the amount of cdi of heavy metals through ingestion is much higher than the amount of heavy metals taken through dermal contact considering the mean values for the cdi the dermal exposure pathway recorded generally a three or more orders of magnitude lower than the oral ingestion for both adults and children in the study area table 5 therefore ingestion is considered to be the primary exposure route of heavy metal concentrations within the study area for both adult and children based on the usepa 2004 hazard quotient hq values greater than 1 for any toxicant of interest can pose a health risk to consumers and measures must be put in place to reduce the concentrations from table 5 the hq values for dermal route exposure were below unity for both adults and children for fe mn and zn this indicates that there is minimal risk to human health when contact with the water is through the skin however hq for oral route exposure was greater than 1 for fe and mn in both adults and children given that the hq value is higher than 1 for adults and children the health of this group is highly at risk table 5 shows the hazard index hi a summation of all the hqs hqing hqderm for the individual metals hi for adult has fe and mn having values greater than 1 that is 1 351and 6 484 respectively whilst zn had a value of 0 362 which is within the acceptable limits on the other hand hi for children had mn and fe greater than 1 with values of 6 274 and 1 306 respectively the degree of risk posed is in the order of mn fe zn for non carcinogenic risk for both adult and children since the communities depend on these water sources for drinking reducing and controlling the concentration of fe and mn is necessary to minimise the potential health implication of consuming excess mn and fe such as stomach upset nausea vomiting diarrhoea irregular heartbeat and low blood pressure at the moment the most common and cheap ways to remove heavy metals from drinking water include activated carbon and ion exchange fu and wang 2011 in the case of carcinogenic health risk using pb all the samples for both adults and children had hq 1 indicating no potential health risk hi for carcinogenic risk for adult and children were all below unity and this means their concentrations found in the water do not pose any health risk to consumers with values of 0 911 and 0 882 respectively 3 4 sensitivity analysis the spearman s correlation coefficient was used to analyse the sensitivity of the parameters used in the risk assessment fig 4 shows the relationship between body weight exposure duration ingestion rate and the concentrations of the heavy metals the sensitivity analysis was carried out to easily identify the relevant variables contributing to the risk estimates in the model for both adults and children the monte carlo simulation was used to help minimise the uncertainty of calculations in the risk assessment figures obtained directly from the field were given the highest priority whenever appropriate to reduce the assessment uncertainty caused by distribution factors like water ingestion rate body weight concentration of metal in water exposure duration exposure frequency and exposure time the sensitivity analysis for adult and children through oral exposure indicates that risk is very sensitive and has a strong to very strong positive correlation to exposure duration and concentration of the metals itself fig 4 the sensitivity analysis for contact through dermal exposure for both adults and children also show a strong positive correlation to exposure duration and concentration of the metals ingestion rate also showed a positive but weak correlation to exposure in both adults and children body weight however showed an inverse and weak correlation to risk this means that the weight of an individual has no direct influence on the concentration of metals the body can accumulate and therefore does not influence risk the sensitivity analysis result indicates that the cw and ir variables for oral ingestion can be used to decrease the risk of ingesting these heavy metals in the study area thus reducing the heavy metal concentration in the drinking water exposure duration and ingestion rate can help mitigate the non carcinogenic risk for the studied population 3 5 assumptions uncertainty and limitations associated with the model several studies have established an exposure response relationship between the level duration of exposure to heavy metals and the occurrence of heavy metals poisoning anawar et al 2002 obiri et al 2010 however the quantitative relationship between intake and risk is still not confirmed due to uncertainties associated with the prevalence of heavy metal poisoning and drinking of heavy metals contaminated water the monte carlo simulations greatly enhanced the health risk assessment due to the quantification of the uncertainties however the sensitivity analysis showed that other uncertainties could still not be accounted for in some of the input parameters of the model that affected the risk assessment for examples the amount of the heavy metal consumed by the individual is an important factor in the risk estimate in our estimation we assume that heavy metal in drinking water is the only source of daily heavy metal intake however several studies have proved that heavy metals vegetables cereals root crops dust particles soil etc can pose significant health risk hence our assumptions could lead to uncertainties of heavy metals exposure and underestimation of the risk therefore future studies on risk assessment should consider taking more data from each exposure pathways to reduce the uncertainty in the risk estimate 3 6 recommendations for groundwater management prevention and control of heavy metals contamination based on the field observations and analysis carried out we recommend the following for the prevention and control of the potential risk of heavy metals contaminations boreholes and hand wells with high metals concentrations should be treated before drinking there should be a comprehensive audit and water quality assessment of all drinking water sources in the area chemical bacteriological and heavy metal future studies on risk assessment should include inhalation exposure to improve on the estimate the hand dug wells should be properly lined and the onsite sanitations around the wells should be taken seriously to prevent runoff entering the wells the data generated from project implementing agencies and ngos together with all other available data should be made available to the district assemblies to guide future groundwater management strategies there should be a strong advocacy health education and public awareness on the effect of heavy metals contamination in drinking water on human health 4 conclusion the concentration carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risk of cr cd fe zn pb cu zn and mn in drinking water 12 boreholes and 44 hand dug wells in atonsu a suburb of kumasi ghana is presented in this study the results showed that the chemical composition of the groundwater samples varies over a wide range both in salinity and ionic composition but lowly mineralized with tds 1000 mg l all the measured parameters were below their respective guideline values however high no3 concentrations were recorded in most of the hdw with about 21 above the guideline value of 50 mg l co cr cu and cd were below the detection limit of the instrument used for the analysis mn and zn showed appreciable levels in some wells but below their respective guideline limits however 88 63 and 83 33 of the hand dug wells and boreholes had pb above the guideline values respectively although other sources could be accounting for the presence of the heavy metals in water anthropogenic activities are suspected to be the principal contributor the non carcinogenic hazard index hi for adult and children with respect to fe and mn were greater than 1 indicating some level of risk however the carcinogenic hi with respect to pb is 1 a sensitivity analysis for the oral and dermal exposure pathways for both adults and children indicated that the most important factors in risk model are the amount of the heavy metal consumed exposure duration and ingestion rate the current study therefore provides further insights on heavy metal contamination in drinking water and its potential effect on human health at atonsu it is therefore imperative to take measures to reduce the heavy metals in some of the wells properly construct the wells to avoid run off seepage and also implement a comprehensive monitoring of the water quality to avoid the potential risk to the
