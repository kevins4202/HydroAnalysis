16230,methylated arsenic species are ubiquitous in the environment and resistant to removal by conventional treatment technologies this study addressed this challenge based on the examination of the removal of dimethylarsinic acid dma in a system that combines zerovalent iron zvi and powdered activated carbon pac the removal of dma in the zvi pac system was compared to that by coagulation adsorption electrochemical and fenton oxidations and other conventional methods while only the electrochemical oxidation using a pbo2 sb sno2 ti anode allowed removing up to 60 dma at several hours long treatment times the removal of dma in the zvi pac system containing 10 g l zvi and 2 5 g l pac with an initial ph of 2 0 was 95 for a 30 min reaction time specific roles of pac zvi and its oxidation products in dma removal were examined based on the spectroscopic data and quantum chemical modeling for the dma fe ii and dma fe iii systems these methods demonstrated the formation of moderately strong dma fe ii and dma fe iii complexation these results and relevant kinetic data were interpreted to indicate that the removal of dma is governed by the rapid generation of fe2 ions released as a result of accelerated zvi corrosion in the galvanic zvi pac microcells and ensuing formation of dma fe2 complexes that are readily adsorbed by pac graphical abstract image graphical

trimethylarsine oxide tmao are of considerable concern due to their ubiquity in the environment agency 2002 anderson and bruland 1991 banerjee et al 1999 braman and foreback 1973 huang et al 2009 pinel raffaitin et al 2007 ponthieu et al 2007 solo gabriele et al 2003 watanabe and hirano 2013 while methylated as species are less toxic than their inorganic counterparts their adverse effects are significant kenyon and hughes 2001 petrick et al 2001 yamanaka et al 1990 mma dma tmao and related as species are generated via the methylation of inorganic arsenic carried out by bacteria fungi and other organisms in addition methylated arsenic species have been introduced into the environment since the 1970s or earlier due to their use in agriculture bednar et al 2002 cullen and reimer 1989 and oil shale pyrolysis cramer et al 1988 fish et al 1982 compared to a large body of research demonstrating that many conventional treatment methods successfully remove inorganic arsenic species only a few methods have been shown to be reasonably suitable for the removal of mma dma and related compounds for instance adsorption precipitation on hydrous oxides and mineral substrates combined with pre oxidation are effective for as v and as iii removal bordoloi et al 2013 cheng et al 1994 hering et al 1997 meng et al 2000 zhang et al 2013 but these methods are less efficient in the removal of methylated arsenic compounds increased methyl substitution results in the suppression of the adsorption of arsenic species and higher rates of their release from the absorbents guo et al 2007 hu et al 2015 lafferty and loeppert 2005 shimizu et al 2010 oxidative processes including hydrothermal treatment maeda et al 2010 nakajima et al 2010 photocatalysis nakajima et al 2005 tielian et al 2007 xu et al 2008 and γ radiolysis xu et al 2007 have been used to convert methylated arsenic species to as v following which the arsenic can be removed by adsorption or coprecipitation treatment practical applicability of these methods is limited by their energy intensity and resultant operational costs zero valence iron treatment zvi was reported to be reasonably successful for mma but less successful for dma cheng et al 2005 zvi pac coupled systems in which the electrochemical oxidation corrosion of zvi is galvanically enhanced by its contact with carbon zvi pac corrosion is an alternative technology that has been shown to be an efficient low cost approach for treatment of various wastewaters including those containing inorganic as species fan et al 2009 jia et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 in these systems the galvanic coupling of carbon with iron accelerates the oxidation of zvi with the resultant formation of fe2 ions and transfer of the electrons from liberated from zvi to the suitable electron acceptors van der zee et al 2003 the generated fe2 ions may also be oxidized to fe3 species and form reactive fe ii fe iii solids such as green rusts genuchten et al 2019 jönsson and sherman 2008 su and puls 2004 in sum zvi pac corrosion processes can be a basis for a treatment technology that combines redox transformations with adsorption precipitation in one reactor liu et al 2013 xinzheng et al 2011 to the best of our knowledge no research has so far been carried out to examine the performance of coupled zvi pac systems in removing methylated arsenic from aquatic systems this study was accordingly focused on 1 the exploration of the feasibility of treatment of methylated arsenic species exemplified by dma in zvi pac corrosion processes 2 determination of the nature of interactions between dma and fe species formed in the zvi pac systems and 3 elucidation of the overall reaction mechanisms responsible for the removal of dma in the presence of both zvi and activated carbon 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials all reagents were of analytical or high purity grade and used as received without further purification dimethylarsinic acid dma 98 and reduced zerovalent iron powder zvi 25 μm average grain size were purchased from meryer chemical technology co ltd china powder activated carbon pac 150 μm average grain size sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o ferric trichloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o were purchased from aladdin industrial corporation chemicals and materials used for the dma removal tests using conventional technologies are listed in the section s1 in the supplementary information si section 2 2 measurements of dma removal in zvi pac experiments zvi pac experiments were performed in a 100 ml glass flask the flask was filled with 50 ml of simulated wastewater containing dma at total as concentration of ca 1500 μg l and 5 g l na2so4 background salt a requisite amount of zvi and pac with varying concentration ratios was simultaneously placed into the flask the solution was stirred at 750 rpm to ensure complete mixing initial ph of the solution was varied from 2 to 10 by adding requisite amounts of hcl or naoh stock solutions the treated solution was sampled at predetermined time intervals and filtered using a 0 22 μm syringe membrane filter prior to further analyses 2 3 dma removal by conventional technologies to examine potential advantages of the zvi pac corrosion approach in dma removal commonly used treatment technologies including coagulation electro coagulation pac adsorption fenton oxidation electrochemical oxidation ec oxidation active chlorine oxidation ac and permanganate oxidation were employed in control experiments dma solutions used in these experiments had a 1500 mg l as concentration other conditions used in these experiments that utilized the conventional methods mentioned above except the electrochemical oxidation are given in section s2 in the si electrochemical oxidation experiments were performed using a pbo2 sb sno2 ti electrode 2 ⅹ 3 cm2 and stainless steel 2 ⅹ 3 cm2 as anode and cathode respectively the pbo2 sb sno2 ti electrode was prepared using the procedure described in liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b the test solution used in the electrochemical experiments contained 1500 mg l dma as arsenic and 5 g l na2so4 background electrolyte a constant 30 ma cm2 current density was supplied to the cell 2 4 analyses ph measurements were done using two ph metrohm electrodes and a ag agcl glass reference metrohm electrode with a salt bridge total as concentrations were determined with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms icap qc thermo fisher usa operated in the helium collision mode used to avoid interferences from arcl which has the same mass to charge ratio of as m z 75 prior to the icp ms measurements the samples were diluted by 100 times and acidified with 5 hno3 arsenic standards ranging from 0 to 200 mg l were used for calibration of the icp ms instrument rhodium nitrate 5 mg l was used as an internal standard for icp ms 2 5 characterization of dma interactions with fe2 and fe3 ions spectrophotometric titrations carried out to examine interactions between dma with fe2 and fe3 ions were performed using a photolab 6600 uv vis spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette 2 6 quantum chemical calculations quantum chemical calculations were performed in the framework of the b3lyp becke 1993 lee et al 1988 density functional method with the atomic basis set 6 311 g d p using the gaussian16 program package frisch et al 2016 all computations were carried out with full geometry optimization of the species under study without any symmetry constrains solvent effects were taken into account using the polarized continuum model pcm cossi et al 2003 in this approach the metal cations fe2 or fe3 together with six water molecules of its first hydration shell were considered to form a single species a supermolecule which was treated quantum mechanically and effects of its environment were taken into account using the pcm model the geometry optimization was followed by calculations of the vibrational spectra in the harmonic approximation without any scaling factors the absence of imaginary values in the frequency spectrum of normal modes was deemed to confirm that the obtained structures correspond to the minimum on the total potential energy surface further details of the calculations to determine the total gibbs free energies at 298 15 k temperature and 1 atm pressure of the reactants and products relevant to this study are given in the section s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 dma removal by conventional technologies results of the experiments on the removal of dma using the conventional methods are shown in figs s1 s7 the operating conditions and maximal dma removals achieved in these experiments are summarized in the table 1 it shows that coagulation with fecl3 electrocoagulation pac adsorption fenton oxidation oxidation with active chlorine and permanganate removed 20 of dma this confirms that dma is not amenable to being removed by coagulants and oxidants that are suitable for as iii and as v treatment and that dma is not easily demethylated by the examined homogeneous oxidation methods fig s7 shows that ca 60 dma was removed after 120 min electrochemical oxidation followed by the fecl3 coagulation although this indicates that occurrence of a higher yield of as v in the case of the ec oxidation of dma compared with that by fenton and permanganate oxidations the large current 30 ma cm2 employed in this experiment and the long treatment time 120 min result in high operational costs and general impracticality of this approach 3 2 removal performance of dma in zvi pac systems fig 1 a and b show the results of zvi pac treatment of dma for a 30 min contact time zvi concentrations varying from 0 5 to 20 g l in the absence of pac and presence 2 5 g l of pac respectively the initial ph of all the solution was 2 0 in contrast with the negligible dma removal in the cases of pac adsorption and coagulation electro coagulation the addition of zvi in the absence of pac resulted in the removal of 4 to 57 dma as the zvi concentration increased from 0 5 to 20 g l addition of 2 5 g l pac caused the dma removal to accelerate resulting in 8 to 96 dma removal at zvi concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 20 g l molar ratio of zvi pac 0 04 to 1 7 these results suggested that dma removal via coupled zvi pac corrosion is a promising approach for dma remediation and that zvi plays a critical role in the dma removal in the zvi pac system fig 2 shows that the removal of as in the presence of 10 g l zvi and 2 5 g l pac decreased from ca 96 to 9 as the initial ph of the solution increased from 2 0 to 6 0 practically no dma was removed at ph 8 0 and 10 these results may be interpreted to indicate that the dma removal in the zvi pac system is strongly affected by the presence of fe2 ions and possibly other species e g fe iii species produced as a result of oxidation of zvi at low phs as discussed in more detail below the notable enhancement of dma removal in the zvi pac system while per se pac does not remove dma fig s3 can be ascribed to the presence of numerous micro galvanic cells formed as a result of contacts between the zvi and pac grains prior studies have also shown that carbon can play the role of a redox mediator which accelerates the transfer of electrons from the electron donors to the acceptors van der zee et al 2003 in the zvi pac system zvi is anodically polarized and oxidized to fe2 the generation of fe2 can therefore be strongly enhanced by pac the virtually complete suppression of the removal of dma at increasing phs indicate that the oxidative generation of fe2 ions in the zvi pac system is mediated by the enhanced consumption of the h ions which is in turn accelerated by to the anodic polarization of the zvi by pac particles the occurrence of this mechanism is illustrated by the data shown in fig 2b that compares the evolution of ph in the system containing 10 g l zvi and varying pac concentrations the figure demonstrates that in the presence of 2 5 g l pac the system ph increases much more rapidly than that in the absence of pac this clearly supports the notion that the galvanic connection between pac and zvi particles accelerates the oxidation of zvi by h ions and thus it enhances the formation of the zvi oxidation products which at low phs are dominated by fe2 ions fe3 ions can also be formed as a result of zvi oxidation by protons dissolved oxygen and ros species katsoyiannis et al 2008 keenan and sedlak 2008 but the levels of fe3 in the reducing conditions imposed by the relatively high zvi concentrations are likely to be lower than those of fe2 ions in principle the generation of hydrogen gas formed via the oxidation of zvi by h ions may play a role in the removal of dma in the fe c system and the issue of hydrogen gas evolution in the removal of inorganic forms arsenic has been examined in prior research melitas et al 2002 bang et al 2005 however two factors indicate that the evolution of h2 gas is unlikely to be important for the removal of dma in the fe c system firstly the evolution of hydrogen gas is likely to be more prominent in the presence of the zvi phase only without the carbon phase since the fe c galvanic coupling induced a positive anodic shift of the electrochemical potential of the fe phase in contact with the carbon phase thus resulting in a higher rate of zvi oxidation but suppressing the evolution of hydrogen gas despite this the removal of dma in the presence of zvi only was much lower than that observed for the fe c system secondly the evolution of hydrogen gas takes place at low phs when the concentration of h ions is sufficiently high but the ph increased much more rapidly in the fe c system compared to the presence of zvi only fig 2 these data indicate that the role of h2 gas generation is likely to be of minor importance for the removal of dma in the fe c system 3 3 roles of fe ii species in dma removal the limited removal of dma documented in the cases of fenton oxidation and the electrochemical treatment figs s4 and s7 implies that dma removal is not controlled by its oxidative demethylation by oh radicals this is in agreement with the data of prior research that has demonstrated that the dma demethylation proceeds slowly and requires harsh oxidative conditions maeda et al 2010 nakajima et al 2005 nakajima et al 2010 tielian et al 2007 xu et al 2007 xu et al 2008 the data of the fecl3 coagulation and electro coagulation experiments figs s1 and s2 in which ferrihydrite was produced also showed that these solid phase of ferric hydroxide have little capacity to bind dma this indicates that in itself adsorption precipitation is not the dominant mechanisms for dma removal in the zvi pac system to ascertain the nature of the processes governing the removal of dma in the fe c system the roles of free fe2 ions were explored further fig 3 shows the results of using pac and a fe2 introduced as feso4 instead of zvi to remove dma from solutions at different ph values over 60 dma except in the absence of pac were removed within 30 min in the fe2 pac system most of the dma removal took place during the first 5 min of the reaction given the fast removal of dma in the fe2 pac system it is reasonable to hypothesize that dma forms complexes with fe2 ions which then are removed by precipitation adsorption pac appears to have another role in the removal of dma in the fe2 pac systems fig 3a shows that in the fe2 pac system the dma removal was only 12 within 30 min in the absence of pac while its removal reached 63 as the pac concentration increased to 1 g l and then remained around 69 with the further increase of pac concentrations we accordingly hypothesized that as opposed to free dma the fe2 dma complexes could be removed from the solution by adsorption onto the pac this may involve the formation of surface complexes similar to those observed for dma interaction with ferric oxyhydroxides tofan lazar and al abadleh 2012 interactions between dma and fe pac system components may also have some similarities to those observed in the case of removal inorganic forms of arsenic by activated carbon with embedded zvi or impregnated with fe2 salts zhu et al 2009 chang et al 2010 the actual mechanisms of such interactions pertinent to the dma fe pac system need to be ascertained in more detail in further research the preferential adsorption of the fe2 dma complexes onto pac was confirmed by the analysis of zvi and pac solids the used zvi and pac solids were separated by a magnet and then dissolved in 5 hno3 solution to measure the total as concentration the result showed that 83 1 3 of the retained dma arsenic was found in the pac while only ca 1 0 07 was associated with the zvi phase the contribution of fe3 to dma removal was investigated in the fe3 pac system fig s8 compared the dma removal in the system containing 0 005 m fe2 or fe3 in the absence and presence 2 5 g l of pac dma removal in the fe2 pac system was much lower than that in the fe3 pac system particularly at higher ph ca 70 for fe2 pac system while 20 for fe3 pac system which suggests that fe3 dma complexes formation is unlikely to be as important as that of the fe2 dma complexes this is indicated by several factors firstly the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 requires the presence of sufficiently strong oxidants dissolved oxygen ros which are largely absent in the fe c systems which were dominated by the strongly reducing zvi phase secondly based on the data on the deprotonation coefficients of the fe3 ion its pk values are 2 2 3 9 7 9 and 8 0 according to benjamin 2014 fe3 hydroxocomplexes constitute ca 40 of soluble fe3 species at ph 2 0 and close to 100 for ph 3 in contrast the formation of hydroxocomplexes of fe2 takes place only at ph 9 and the solubility of ferrous iron species is not limited at ph 7 3 4 formation of fe2 and fe3 complexes with dma the data presented in the preceding sections indicate that the enhanced removal of dma in the fe c system is likely to be mediated by the galvanically stimulated oxidation of the zvi phase followed by the formation of fe2 dma complexes and their enhanced retention by the carbon phase while the formation fe3 dma complexes may be less important in this system exploration of interactions between fe3 ions and dma is also of fundamental importance to quantify the extent and significance of such interactions absorbance spectra of solutions containing fe2 fe3 ions and varying dma concentrations were measured because fe3 ions form hydroxocomplexes at ph 3 while fe2 ions can be rapidly oxidized by oxygen the ph of the fe2 and fe3 containing solutions was kept at 3 in most cases measurements of the absorbance spectra of dma in the absence of fe2 and fe3 ions shows that dma exhibited strong absorbance only for wavelengths 220 nm fig s9 ph variations did not cause any changes of dma absorbance as demonstrated by the correlations between the concentration of dma and its absorbance at 205 nm at phs varying from 2 0 to 7 0 fig s9e examination of the absorbance spectra of 0 02 m solution of fe2 at ph 2 0 showed that increases of dma concentration from 0 to 0 1 m caused the band associated with free fe2 ions to undergo consistent changes fig 4 a in the absence of dma the maximum of the band was located at 310 nm increases of the dma concentration caused the band to shift to lower wavelengths to form a relatively intense feature located in the range of wavelength 260 to 300 nm the presence of an isosbestic point at 307 nm indicates that the addition of dma is accompanied by the transition from the dominance of free fe2 ions to fe2 dma complexes this point is demonstrated additionally by the changes of absorbance of fe2 dma solutions at wavelengths 270 280 and 330 nm fig s10 the wavelengths of 270 and 280 nm are located in the range of wavelength corresponding to the increases of absorbance caused by the formation of fe2 dma complex while the wavelength of 330 nm is indicative to the depletion of free fe2 ions the plateauing of these absorbances at dma concentrations ca 0 02 m indicates that the system is dominated by fe2 dma complex in these conditions fe2 dma complexation was examined based on the interpretation of the spectrophotometric data shown in fig 4 and those presented in the si section fig s11 dma was assumed to form both fe2 dma and fe2 dma2 complexes as explained in section s4 in the si because the concentration of free fe2 ions in the aquatic system with dissolved oxygen depends on solution ph the total concentration of fe2 in these reactions were modified according to the speciation balance of fe ii speciation at varying phs performed by visual minteq fig s12 their formation constants were varied to achieve a close fit between the experimental and model data the modeling was carried out with matlab program that took into account reactions eqs s3 24 section s4 the matlab program used to perform model fitting is presented in the section s5 results of these calculations shown in fig 5 demonstrate that the logarithms of the apparent formation constant of the fe2 dma complex were 2 6 and 3 1 at ph 1 4 and ph 2 respectively the introduction of the fe2 dma 2 complex in the data fitting did not result in a noticeable improvement in the fit curves compared with the assumption of the presence of the fe2 dma complex only given that the formation constant of fe2 dma complexes is low it can be concluded that for realistic dma concentrations fe2 dma complexes are likely to control the speciation of dma and ultimately its removal only in the presence of locally high fe2 concentrations this condition may be observed at the surfaces of the zvi phase and pac particles coupled with it that are oxidized by the protons and dissolved oxygen at low phs thus the binding of dma by fe2 ions is likely to play a significant role in the removal of dma by the surface reactions induced by the galvanic coupling in the zvi pac systems because fe3 ions also can form during the zvi pac treatment absorbance spectra of fe3 dma system were measured as well these measurements showed that increases of dma concentration caused pronounced changes of the absorbance of fe3 ions fig 4b the shown spectra exhibit a notable shift to lower wavelength with the emergence of an isosbestic point at ca 350 nm this trend is similar to that observed for fe2 dma complexation fig 4a fig s10b shows the changes of absorbance of fe3 dma solutions at wavelength 285 300 and 350 nm which are indictive of the formation of fe3 dma complex and consumption of free fe3 ions consistent changes of the absorbance spectra of the fe3 dma system were also observed at higher phs fig s13 processing of these spectroscopic data for the fe3 dma system resulted in a close fit between the experimental and modeling data fig s14 logk1 of the fe3 dma was determined to be 1 8 at ph 1 9 and increased to 2 4 at ph 2 2 these formation constants are lower than those for the fe2 dma complex 3 1 at ph 2 0 3 5 quantum chemical modeling of interactions of dma with fe2 and fe3 ions quantum chemical modeling was carried out to further explore the structural and thermodynamic aspects of fe2 dma and fe3 dma complexation fig 6 a c show the optimized structures of the fe h2o 6 2 aqua complex the molecule of dma hooas ch3 2 and its deprotonated form dma ooas ch3 2 fig 6d and e shows the optimized structures of the fe2 dma and fe2 dma complexes these structures are denoted as a and b respectively the formation of structures a and b can be represented by reactions 1 and 2 in table 2 complexation according to these reactions is expected to take place in a sufficiently acidic ph range e g ph 6 when the dma speciation is dominated by its protonated form and the fe2 ion is not hydrolyzed calculations of the gibbs free energy δg0 of reactions 1 3 give the values of 30 7 21 6 and 111 kj mol respectively the negative δg0 values indicate a significant thermodynamic probability of all three reactions qualitatively this indicates that the complexation of fe2 ions with dma is possible both at low ph values with the participation of the undissociated form of the molecule and at higher phs when the deprotonated dma form acts as a ligand fig s15 shows the optimized structures of aqua complex of fe3 ions and its mono and di hydroxo complexes results of these calculations are summarized in table 2 reactions 4 to 6 a characteristic feature of the structures shown in fig s16 is that the oxygen atom of the dma ligand replaces one of the water molecules of the inner sphere of fe3 and additional stabilization is achieved due to the formation of the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of the dma ligand and a water molecule in the aqua complex fig s16a or hydroxyl groups in the mono and di hydroxo complexes of the fe3 ion fig s16b and c the structures of the fe3 dma complexes formed via the engagement of ligand dma metal ligand ratio 1 1 are shown in figs s17 and s18 their formation reactions and corresponding changes of the gibbs energy are given in reactions 7 12 it is noteworthy that when dma anion enters the inner hydration shell of the fe3 aqua complex it cleaves a proton from of the water molecules and undergoes protonation to form a dma molecule fig s17a the structure formed in this case is identical to the structure in fig s16b which is obtained by reaction 5 figs s19 and s20 show the structures of the complexes in which the dma anion acts as a monodentate and bidentate ligand respectively at a metal ligand ratio of 1 2 reactions 13 18 in table 2 the quantum chemical data confirm the thermodynamic possibility of fe2 dma and fe3 dma complexation and shown the structural features of these complexes these data point to the importance of the little explored aspect of the environmental chemistry of methylated arsenic species notably their activity of complexation with metal ions effects of these interaction on the fate and transport of methylated as species and their removal in engineered systems these issues will be addressed in more detail in further studies from the discussion above a three step reaction sequence can be proposed to explain the high efficiency removal of dma in the zvi pac corrosion system fig 7 in this sequence zvi is initially oxidized by the protons at low phs this process is accelerated by the presence of micro galvanic cells formed as a result of contacts between the zvi and pac particles the zvi pac galvanic coupling produces locally high concentrations of free fe2 ions generated at the zvi surface these ions bind with dma to form fe2 dma complexes which diffuse into the pores of pac and thus be removed with pac 4 conclusions this study presents an innovative approach to remove dma from aquatic systems the level of dma removal by the galvanically coupled zvi and pac phases far exceeds that observed in the case of conventional water treatment methods the spectroscopic and quantum chemical data show that dma removal in the zvi pac system is likely to proceed via the generation of high concentrations of fe2 ions localized at the zvi surface the specific role of the galvanic coupling between the zvi and pac grains it that it enhances zvi oxidation and fe2 release the fe2 ions released from zvi grains interact readily dma forming fe2 dma complexes that are readily retained by pac these results highlight the importance of fe2 and fe3 interactions with dma and methylated as species in environmental systems and effects of such interactions on the treatability of streams contaminated with organo arsenic compounds the proposed approach offers a viable option to remove dma and possibly other methylated arsenic species from landfill leachates wastewater and other challenging matrices as mentioned above the removal of dma by the zvi pac process is superior to that of the conventional technologies zvi and pac are cost

16230,methylated arsenic species are ubiquitous in the environment and resistant to removal by conventional treatment technologies this study addressed this challenge based on the examination of the removal of dimethylarsinic acid dma in a system that combines zerovalent iron zvi and powdered activated carbon pac the removal of dma in the zvi pac system was compared to that by coagulation adsorption electrochemical and fenton oxidations and other conventional methods while only the electrochemical oxidation using a pbo2 sb sno2 ti anode allowed removing up to 60 dma at several hours long treatment times the removal of dma in the zvi pac system containing 10 g l zvi and 2 5 g l pac with an initial ph of 2 0 was 95 for a 30 min reaction time specific roles of pac zvi and its oxidation products in dma removal were examined based on the spectroscopic data and quantum chemical modeling for the dma fe ii and dma fe iii systems these methods demonstrated the formation of moderately strong dma fe ii and dma fe iii complexation these results and relevant kinetic data were interpreted to indicate that the removal of dma is governed by the rapid generation of fe2 ions

aquatic systems this study was accordingly focused on 1 the exploration of the feasibility of treatment of methylated arsenic species exemplified by dma in zvi pac corrosion processes 2 determination of the nature of interactions between dma and fe species formed in the zvi pac systems and 3 elucidation of the overall reaction mechanisms responsible for the removal of dma in the presence of both zvi and activated carbon 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials all reagents were of analytical or high purity grade and used as received without further purification dimethylarsinic acid

dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o ferric trichloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o were purchased from aladdin industrial corporation chemicals and materials used for the dma removal tests using conventional technologies are listed in the section s1 in the supplementary information si section 2 2 measurements of dma removal in zvi pac experiments zvi pac experiments were performed in a 100 ml glass flask the flask was filled with 50 ml of simulated wastewater containing dma at total as concentration of ca 1500 μg l and 5 g l na2so4 background salt a requisite amount of zvi and pac with varying concentration ratios was simultaneously placed into the flask the solution was stirred at 750 rpm to ensure complete mixing initial ph of the solution was varied from 2 to 10 by adding requisite amounts of hcl or naoh stock solutions the treated solution was sampled at predetermined time intervals and filtered using a 0 22 μm syringe membrane filter prior to further analyses 2 3 dma removal by conventional technologies to examine potential advantages of the zvi pac corrosion approach in dma removal commonly used treatment technologies including coagulation electro coagulation pac adsorption fenton oxidation electrochemical oxidation ec oxidation active chlorine oxidation ac and permanganate oxidation were employed in control experiments dma solutions used in these experiments had a 1500 mg l as concentration other conditions used in these experiments that utilized the conventional methods mentioned above except the electrochemical oxidation are given in section s2 in the si electrochemical oxidation experiments were performed using a pbo2 sb sno2 ti electrode 2 ⅹ 3 cm2 and stainless steel 2 ⅹ 3 cm2 as anode and cathode respectively the pbo2 sb sno2 ti electrode was prepared using the procedure described in liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b the test solution used in the electrochemical experiments contained 1500 mg l dma as arsenic and 5 g l na2so4 background electrolyte a constant 30 ma cm2 current density was supplied to the cell 2 4 analyses ph measurements were done using two ph metrohm electrodes and a ag agcl glass reference metrohm electrode with a salt bridge total as concentrations were determined with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms icap qc thermo fisher usa operated in the helium collision mode used to avoid interferences from arcl which has the same mass to charge ratio of as m z 75 prior to the icp ms measurements the samples were diluted by 100 times and acidified with 5 hno3 arsenic standards ranging from 0 to 200 mg l were used for calibration of the icp ms instrument rhodium nitrate 5 mg l was used as an internal standard for icp ms 2 5 characterization of dma interactions with fe2 and fe3 ions spectrophotometric titrations carried out to examine interactions between dma with fe2 and fe3 ions were performed using a photolab 6600 uv vis spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette 2 6 quantum chemical calculations quantum chemical calculations were performed in the framework of the b3lyp becke 1993 lee et al 1988 density functional method with the atomic basis set 6 311 g d p using the gaussian16 program package frisch et al 2016 all computations were carried out with full geometry optimization of the species under study without any symmetry constrains solvent effects were taken into account using the polarized continuum model pcm cossi et al 2003 in this approach the metal cations fe2 or fe3 together with six water molecules of its first hydration shell were considered to form a single species a supermolecule which was treated quantum mechanically and effects of its environment were taken into account using the pcm model the geometry optimization was followed by calculations of the vibrational spectra in the harmonic approximation without any scaling factors the absence of imaginary values in the frequency spectrum of normal modes was deemed to confirm that the obtained structures correspond to the minimum on the total potential energy surface further details of the calculations to determine the total gibbs free energies at 298 15 k temperature and 1 atm pressure of the reactants and products relevant to this study are given in the section s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 dma removal by conventional technologies results of the experiments on the removal of dma using the conventional methods are shown in figs s1 s7 the operating conditions and maximal dma removals achieved in these experiments are summarized in the table 1 it shows that coagulation with fecl3 electrocoagulation pac adsorption fenton oxidation oxidation with active chlorine and permanganate removed 20 of dma this confirms that dma is not amenable to being removed by coagulants and oxidants that are suitable for as iii and as v treatment and that dma is not easily demethylated by the examined homogeneous oxidation methods fig s7 shows that ca 60 dma was removed after 120 min electrochemical oxidation followed by the fecl3 coagulation although this indicates that occurrence of a higher yield of as v in the case of the ec oxidation of dma compared with that by fenton and permanganate oxidations the large current 30 ma cm2 employed in this experiment and the long treatment time 120 min result in high operational costs and general impracticality of this approach 3 2 removal performance of dma in zvi pac systems fig 1 a and b show the results of zvi pac treatment of dma for a 30 min contact time zvi concentrations varying from 0 5 to 20 g l in the absence of pac and presence 2 5 g l of pac respectively the initial ph of all the solution was 2 0 in contrast with the negligible dma removal in the cases of pac adsorption and coagulation electro coagulation the addition of zvi in the absence of pac resulted in the removal of 4 to 57 dma as the zvi concentration increased from 0 5 to 20 g l addition of 2 5 g l pac caused the dma removal to accelerate resulting in 8 to 96 dma removal at zvi concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 20 g l molar ratio of zvi pac 0 04 to 1 7 these results suggested that dma removal via coupled zvi pac corrosion is a promising approach for dma remediation and that zvi plays a critical role in the dma removal in the zvi pac system fig 2 shows that the removal of as in the presence of 10 g l zvi and 2 5 g l pac decreased from ca 96 to 9 as the initial ph of the solution increased from 2 0 to 6 0 practically no dma was removed at ph 8 0 and 10 these results may be interpreted to indicate that the dma removal in the zvi pac system is strongly affected by the presence of fe2 ions and possibly other species e g fe iii species produced as a result of oxidation of zvi at low phs as discussed in more detail below the notable enhancement of dma removal in the zvi pac system while per se pac does not remove dma fig s3 can be ascribed to the presence of numerous micro galvanic cells formed as a result of contacts between the zvi and pac grains prior studies have also shown that carbon can play the role of a redox mediator which accelerates the transfer of electrons from the electron donors to the acceptors van der zee et al 2003 in the zvi pac system zvi is anodically polarized and oxidized to fe2 the generation of fe2 can therefore be strongly enhanced by pac the virtually complete suppression of the removal of dma at increasing phs indicate that the oxidative generation of fe2 ions in the zvi pac system is mediated by the enhanced consumption of the h ions which is in turn accelerated by to the anodic polarization of the zvi by pac particles the occurrence of this mechanism is illustrated by the data shown in fig 2b that compares the evolution of ph in the system containing 10 g l zvi and varying pac concentrations the figure demonstrates that in the presence of 2 5 g l pac the system ph increases much more rapidly than that in the absence of pac this clearly supports the notion that the galvanic connection between pac and zvi particles accelerates the oxidation of zvi by h ions and thus it enhances the formation of the zvi oxidation products which at low phs are dominated by fe2 ions fe3 ions can also be formed as a result of zvi oxidation by protons dissolved oxygen and ros species katsoyiannis et al 2008 keenan and sedlak 2008 but the levels of fe3 in the reducing conditions imposed by the relatively high zvi concentrations are likely to be lower than those of fe2 ions in principle the generation of hydrogen gas formed via the oxidation of zvi by h ions may play a role in the removal of dma in the fe c system and the issue of hydrogen gas evolution in the removal of inorganic forms arsenic has been examined in prior research melitas et al 2002 bang et al 2005 however two factors indicate that the evolution of h2 gas is unlikely to be important for the removal of dma in the fe c system firstly the evolution of hydrogen gas is likely to be more prominent in the presence of the zvi phase only without the carbon phase since the fe c galvanic coupling induced a positive anodic shift of the electrochemical potential of the fe phase in contact with the carbon phase thus resulting in a higher rate of zvi oxidation but suppressing the evolution of hydrogen gas despite this the removal of dma in the presence of zvi only was much lower than that observed for the fe c system secondly the evolution of hydrogen gas takes place at low phs when the concentration of h ions is sufficiently high but the ph increased much more rapidly in the fe c system compared to the presence of zvi only fig 2 these data indicate that the role of h2 gas generation is likely to be of minor importance for the removal of dma in the fe c system 3 3 roles of fe ii species in dma removal the limited removal of dma documented in the cases of fenton oxidation and the electrochemical treatment figs s4 and s7 implies that dma removal is not controlled by its oxidative demethylation by oh radicals this is in agreement with the data of prior research that has demonstrated that the dma demethylation proceeds slowly and requires harsh oxidative conditions maeda et al 2010 nakajima et al 2005 nakajima et al 2010 tielian et al 2007 xu et al 2007 xu et al 2008 the data of the fecl3 coagulation and electro coagulation experiments figs s1 and s2 in which ferrihydrite was produced also showed that these solid phase of ferric hydroxide have little capacity to bind dma this indicates that in itself adsorption precipitation is not the dominant mechanisms for dma removal in the zvi pac system to ascertain the nature of the processes governing the removal of dma in the fe c system the roles of free fe2 ions were explored further fig 3 shows the results of using pac and a fe2 introduced as feso4 instead of zvi to remove dma from solutions at different ph values over 60 dma except in the absence of pac were removed within 30 min in the fe2 pac system most of the dma removal took place during the first 5 min of the reaction given the fast removal of dma in the fe2 pac system it is reasonable to hypothesize that dma forms complexes with fe2 ions which then are removed by precipitation adsorption pac appears to have another role in the removal of dma in the fe2 pac systems fig 3a shows that in the fe2 pac system the dma removal was only 12 within 30 min in the absence of pac while its removal reached 63 as the pac concentration increased to 1 g l and then remained around 69 with the further increase of pac concentrations we accordingly hypothesized that as opposed to free dma the fe2 dma complexes could be removed from the solution by adsorption onto the pac this may involve the formation of surface complexes similar to those observed for dma interaction with ferric oxyhydroxides tofan lazar and al abadleh 2012 interactions between dma and fe pac system components may also have some similarities to those observed in the case of removal inorganic forms of arsenic by activated carbon with embedded zvi or impregnated with fe2 salts zhu et al 2009 chang et al 2010 the actual mechanisms of such interactions pertinent to the dma fe pac system need to be ascertained in more detail in further research the preferential adsorption of the fe2 dma complexes onto pac was confirmed by the analysis of zvi and pac solids the used zvi and pac solids were separated by a magnet and then dissolved in 5 hno3 solution to measure the total as concentration the result showed that 83 1 3 of the retained dma arsenic was found in the pac while only ca 1 0 07 was associated with the zvi phase the contribution of fe3 to dma removal was investigated in the fe3 pac system fig s8 compared the dma removal in the system containing 0 005 m fe2 or fe3 in the absence and presence 2 5 g l of pac dma removal in the fe2 pac system was much lower than that in the fe3 pac system particularly at higher ph ca 70 for fe2 pac system while 20 for fe3 pac system which suggests that fe3 dma complexes formation is unlikely to be as important as that of the fe2 dma complexes this is indicated by several factors firstly the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 requires the presence of sufficiently strong oxidants dissolved oxygen ros which are largely absent in the fe c systems which were dominated by the strongly reducing zvi phase secondly based on the data on the deprotonation coefficients of the fe3 ion its pk values are 2 2 3 9 7 9 and 8 0 according to benjamin 2014 fe3 hydroxocomplexes constitute ca 40 of soluble fe3 species at ph 2 0 and close to 100 for ph 3 in contrast the formation of hydroxocomplexes of fe2 takes place only at ph 9 and the solubility of ferrous iron species is not limited at ph 7 3 4 formation of fe2 and fe3 complexes with dma the data presented in the preceding sections indicate that the enhanced removal of dma in the fe c system is likely to be mediated by the galvanically stimulated oxidation of the zvi phase followed by the formation of fe2 dma complexes and their enhanced retention by the carbon phase while the formation fe3 dma complexes may be less important in this system exploration of interactions between fe3 ions and dma is also of fundamental importance to quantify the extent and significance of such interactions absorbance spectra of solutions containing fe2 fe3 ions and varying dma concentrations were measured because fe3 ions form hydroxocomplexes at ph 3 while fe2 ions can be rapidly oxidized by oxygen the ph of the fe2 and fe3 containing solutions was kept at 3 in most cases measurements of the absorbance spectra of dma in the absence of fe2 and fe3 ions shows that dma exhibited strong absorbance only for wavelengths 220 nm fig s9 ph variations did not cause any changes of dma absorbance as demonstrated by the correlations between the concentration of dma and its absorbance at 205 nm at phs varying from 2 0 to 7 0 fig s9e examination of the absorbance spectra of 0 02 m solution of fe2 at ph 2 0 showed that increases of dma concentration from 0 to 0 1 m caused the band associated with free fe2 ions to undergo consistent changes fig 4 a in the absence of dma the maximum of the band was located at 310 nm increases of the dma concentration caused the band to shift to lower wavelengths to form a relatively intense feature located in the range of wavelength 260 to 300 nm the presence of an isosbestic point at 307 nm indicates that the addition of dma is accompanied by the transition from the dominance of free fe2 ions to fe2 dma complexes this point is demonstrated additionally by the changes of absorbance of fe2 dma solutions at wavelengths 270 280 and 330 nm fig s10 the wavelengths of 270 and 280 nm are located in the range of wavelength corresponding to the increases of absorbance caused by the formation of fe2 dma complex while the wavelength of 330 nm is indicative to the depletion of free fe2 ions the plateauing of these absorbances at dma concentrations ca 0 02 m indicates that the system is dominated by fe2 dma complex in these conditions fe2 dma complexation was examined based on the interpretation of the spectrophotometric data shown in fig 4 and those presented in the si section fig s11 dma was assumed to form both fe2 dma and fe2 dma2 complexes as explained in section s4 in the si because the concentration of free fe2 ions in the aquatic system with dissolved oxygen depends on solution ph the total concentration of fe2 in these reactions were modified according to the speciation balance of fe ii speciation at varying phs performed by visual minteq fig s12 their formation constants were varied to achieve a close fit between the experimental and model data the modeling was carried out with matlab program that took into account reactions eqs s3 24 section s4 the matlab program used to perform model fitting is presented in the section s5 results of these calculations shown in fig 5 demonstrate that the logarithms of the apparent formation constant of the fe2 dma complex were 2 6 and 3 1 at ph 1 4 and ph 2 respectively the introduction of the fe2 dma 2 complex in the data fitting did not result in a noticeable improvement in the fit curves compared with the assumption of the presence of the fe2 dma complex only given that the formation constant of fe2 dma complexes is low it can be concluded that for realistic dma concentrations fe2 dma complexes are likely to control the speciation of dma and ultimately its removal only in the presence of locally high fe2 concentrations this condition may be observed at the surfaces of the zvi phase and pac particles coupled with it that are oxidized by the protons and dissolved oxygen at low phs thus the binding of dma by fe2 ions is likely to play a significant role in the removal of dma by the surface reactions induced by the galvanic coupling in the zvi pac systems because fe3 ions also can form during the zvi pac treatment absorbance spectra of fe3 dma system were measured as well these measurements showed that increases of dma concentration caused pronounced changes of the absorbance of fe3 ions fig 4b the shown spectra exhibit a notable shift to lower wavelength with the emergence of an isosbestic point at ca 350 nm this trend is similar to that observed for fe2 dma complexation fig 4a fig s10b shows the changes of absorbance of fe3 dma solutions at wavelength 285 300 and 350 nm which are indictive of the formation of fe3 dma complex and consumption of free fe3 ions consistent changes of the absorbance spectra of the fe3 dma system were also observed at higher phs fig s13 processing of these spectroscopic data for the fe3 dma system resulted in a close fit between the experimental and modeling data fig s14 logk1 of the fe3 dma was determined to be 1 8 at ph 1 9 and increased to 2 4 at ph 2 2 these formation constants are lower than those for the fe2 dma complex 3 1 at ph 2 0 3 5 quantum chemical modeling of interactions of dma with fe2 and fe3 ions quantum chemical modeling was carried out to further explore the structural and thermodynamic aspects of fe2 dma and fe3 dma complexation fig 6 a c show the optimized structures of the fe h2o 6 2 aqua complex the molecule of dma hooas ch3 2 and its deprotonated form dma ooas ch3 2 fig 6d and e shows the optimized structures of the fe2 dma and fe2 dma complexes these structures are denoted as a and b respectively the formation of structures a and b can be represented by reactions 1 and 2 in table 2 complexation according to these reactions is expected to take place in a sufficiently acidic ph range e g ph 6 when the dma speciation is dominated by its protonated form and the fe2 ion is not hydrolyzed calculations of the gibbs free energy δg0 of reactions 1 3 give the values of 30 7 21 6 and 111 kj mol respectively the negative δg0 values indicate a significant thermodynamic probability of all three reactions qualitatively this indicates that the complexation of fe2 ions with dma is possible both at low ph values with the participation of the undissociated form of the molecule and at higher phs when the deprotonated dma form acts as a ligand fig s15 shows the optimized structures of aqua complex of fe3 ions and its mono and di hydroxo complexes results of these calculations are summarized in table 2 reactions 4 to 6 a characteristic feature of the structures shown in fig s16 is that the oxygen atom of the dma ligand replaces one of the water molecules of the inner sphere of fe3 and additional stabilization is achieved due to the formation of the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of the dma ligand and a water molecule in the aqua complex fig s16a or hydroxyl groups in the mono and di hydroxo complexes of the fe3 ion fig s16b and c the structures of the fe3 dma complexes formed via the engagement of ligand dma metal ligand ratio 1 1 are shown in figs s17 and s18 their formation reactions and corresponding changes of the gibbs energy are given in reactions 7 12 it is noteworthy that when dma anion enters the inner hydration shell of the fe3 aqua complex it cleaves a proton from of the water molecules and undergoes protonation to form a dma molecule fig s17a the structure formed in this case is identical to the structure in fig s16b which is obtained by reaction 5 figs s19 and s20 show the structures of the complexes in which the dma anion acts as a monodentate and bidentate ligand respectively at a metal ligand ratio of 1 2 reactions 13 18 in table 2 the quantum chemical data confirm the thermodynamic possibility of fe2 dma and fe3 dma complexation and shown the structural features of these complexes these data point to the importance of the little explored aspect of the environmental chemistry of methylated arsenic species notably their activity of complexation with metal ions effects of these interaction on the fate and transport of methylated as species and their removal in engineered systems these issues will be addressed in more detail in further studies from the discussion above a three step reaction sequence can be proposed to explain the high efficiency removal of dma in the zvi pac corrosion system fig 7 in this sequence zvi is initially oxidized by the protons at low phs this process is accelerated by the presence of micro galvanic cells formed as a result of contacts between the zvi and pac particles the zvi pac galvanic coupling produces locally high concentrations of free fe2 ions generated at the zvi surface these ions bind with dma to form fe2 dma complexes which diffuse into the pores of pac and thus be removed with pac 4 conclusions this study presents an innovative approach to remove dma from aquatic systems the level of dma removal by the galvanically coupled zvi and pac phases far exceeds that observed in the case of conventional water treatment methods the spectroscopic and quantum chemical data show that dma removal in the zvi pac system is likely to proceed via the generation of high concentrations of fe2 ions localized at the zvi surface the specific role of the galvanic coupling between the zvi and pac grains it that it enhances zvi oxidation and fe2 release the fe2 ions released from zvi grains interact readily dma forming fe2 dma complexes that are readily retained by pac these results highlight the importance of fe2 and fe3 interactions with dma and methylated as species in environmental systems and effects of such interactions on the treatability of streams contaminated with organo arsenic compounds the proposed approach offers a viable option to remove dma and possibly other methylated arsenic species from landfill leachates wastewater and other challenging matrices as mentioned above the removal of dma by the zvi pac process is superior to that of the conventional technologies zvi and pac are cost

103 gc 50 ml even for us cdc n1 rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays consequently when sars cov 2 rna concentrations are expected to be low it may be necessary to improve the positive detection rates of

standard reference materials and clinical samples e g nasopharyngeal swabs saliva urine and rectal swabs seeded with the reference material the authors demonstrated that at low viral concentrations 1 to 10 gc µl not all assays yielded positive results thus suggesting that some assays may be more prone to false negative errors than others vogels et al 2020 most notably the rdrp reverse primer had mismatches with the reference material that were attributed to evolution of the virus causing low analytical sensitivity while the alod is a useful assessment of the analytical sensitivity of sars cov

for wastewater surveillance the analytical sensitivity of methods must also account for the efficiency of the various processing steps including primary concentration loss through nucleic acid extraction and inhibition of reverse transcription or pcr amplification together the rt qpcr dpcr alod and the process recovery efficiency loss of target through all sample processing steps determine the process limit of detection plod which has not yet been well characterized for any method used to concentrate sars cov 2 rna from wastewater frequently assumed process recoveries e g 100 and empirically determined alods are combined to produce idealized estimates of the plod ahmed et al 2021b but empirical determination of the plod itself is vital for a robust characterization of the surveillance method a recent study evaluated four different sars cov 2 rt qpcr detection assays us cdc n1 china cdc n ccdc n n sarbeco and e sarbeco for the accurate and reliable quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater zhang et al 2022 the authors recommended the ccdc n assay for its high sensitivity and reproducibility when analysing plasmid control material plasmid seeded wastewater and real wastewater samples while the us cdc n1 assay demonstrated high sensitivity in their ambient wastewater samples it showed poor reproducibility and linearity at low concentrations against their plasmid seeded samples zhang et al 2022 however the generalizability of such findings is constrained by several limitations the rt qpcr cycling parameters were the same for all assays and deviations from the optimized assay specific cycling parameters may have affected the sensitivity of one assay compared to another furthermore plasmid control materials rather than sars cov 2 virions were seeded by zhang et al 2022 into rna extracted from wastewater to determine the spiked mocks limit of detection using seeded wastewater the use of plasmid control materials which are double stranded dna for sars cov 2 single stranded rna virus has well documented limitations including heterogeneity in pcr efficiencies and non linearity for rt qpcr experiments bivins et al 2021a the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the plods of five rt qpcr assays and one rt dpcr assay for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater inclusive of the processing workflow efficiency this was achieved by seeding a dilution series of known concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 virions into wastewater followed by primary concentration nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr rt dpcr analysis using each assay in addition to determining the plod the quantitative data from the seeding experiments were also used to assess the variation in sars cov 2 rna copy number along the dilution gradient in conjunction with these experiments the effect of variable seeding levels of sars cov 2 in wastewater on recovery efficiency of each assay was also examined using 36 different wastewater samples 2

and rt dpcr alods to determine rt qpcr and rt dpcr assay limit of detection alod gamma irradiated sars cov 2 were diluted 6 105 to 0 6 gc reaction and analyzed using rt qpcr and rt dpcr at each dilution 15 replicates were analyzed the 95 alod was defined by fitting an exponential survival model to the proportion of pcr replicates positive at each step along the gradient verbyla et al 2016 2 9 quality control to minimize rt qpcr and rt dpcr contamination nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr dpcr set up were performed in separate laboratories a sample negative control was included during the concentration process an extraction negative control was also included during nucleic acid extraction to account for any contamination during extraction all sample and extraction negative controls were negative for the analyzed targets 2 10 data analysis for rt qpcr and rt dpcr the alod is defined as the minimum gc number with a 95 probability of detection and determined as previously described verbyla et al 2016 for rt qpcr samples were considered positive sars cov 2 detected if amplification was observed in at least one of the three replicates within 45 cycles samples were considered quantifiable if amplification was observed in all three replicates with concentrations above the alod for rt dpcr samples were considered positive if there was at least one positive partition following the merging of nano wells from two replicate wells samples were considered quantifiable by rt dpcr if the concentrations were above the alod and the average number of partitions was 11 000 per sample well for rt qpcr and rt dpcr the plod is defined as the minimum gc number with a 95 probability of detection incorporating the loss of sars cov 2 through sample concentration and rna extraction and determined as previously described stokdyk et al 2016 verbyla et al 2016 the plod was estimated for each assay using two probability models that predict the proportion of positive amplification within 45 cycles the exponential survival model and the beta poisson model verbyla et al 2016 for comparison the cumulative gaussian model bivins et al 2021b stokdyk et al 2016 was also used to estimate the 50 and 95 detection probabilities maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters were obtained by finding parameter values that minimized the deviance based on the positive and total number of replicates analyzed at the different concentrations of seeded sars cov 2 since the exponential model is a special case of the beta poisson model haas et al 2014 a chi squared test was performed to determine if the fit provided by the beta poisson model was worth the extra degree of freedom for the seeded levels that yielded a 100 detection rate the variation in the estimated sars cov 2 rna gc number for each assay was assessed via the coefficient of variation cv the sars cov 2 recovery efficiency for all rt qpcr and rt dpcr was calculated based on the gc quantified as follows recovery efficiency gc recovered in concentrated wastewater gc seeded 100 at each concentration step with a 100 detection rate differences in recovery efficiency between assays were assessed by the kruskal wallis h test with dunn s post hoc test kruskal and wallis 1952 dunn 1964 differences in recovery efficiency between concentration steps for each assay were assessed by the mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 statistical significance was defined as p 0 05 3 results 3 1 assay performance and relevant qa qc a 260 280 nm absorbance ratio of nucleic acid 1 80 for wastewater rna from all samples was considered acceptable rna quality supplementary table st2 sambrook et al 1989 the rt qpcr standard curves prepared from gamma irradiated sars cov 2 had a linear dynamic range of quantification from 6 105 to 6 gc reaction 1 2 105 to 1 2 gc µl the slopes of the standard curves ranged between 3 31 ccdc n and 3 48 e sarbeco table 1 the ranges for amplification efficiencies 94 0 to 100 and y intercepts 36 3 us cdc n1 to 39 8 e sarbeco were within the prescribed range of miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the correlation coefficients r 2 ranged from 0 98 ccdc n to 0 99 e sarbeco the alods for the rt qpcr assays were between 9 50 and 48 1 gc reaction being the lowest for the us cdc n1 and greatest for e sarbeco assays respectively table 1 the rt dpcr alod was 3 30 gc reaction for the us cdc n1 assay all method extraction and rt qpcr rt dpcr negative controls were negative all positive controls or standard curves amplified in each pcr run for the us cdc n1 rt dpcr the number of partitions ranged from 11 522 25 417 with a mean of 21 148 and a sd of 3 437 pcr inhibition was not identified in any rna samples based on the seeded gc of mhv all within 2 cq values of the reference cq value supplementary table st3 3 2 rt qpcr detection and plod values for sars cov 2 seeded wastewater samples sars cov 2 rna was detected in all wastewater samples by all six assay replicates rt qpcr and rt dpcr when seeding was 2 32 105 n 9 samples and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml n 9 samples table 2 at the lower seeding titer of 2 32 103 gc 50 ml n 9 samples among the rt qpcr assays ccdc n provided detection in 9 9 100 wastewater samples while us cdc n1 detected 8 9 88 9 ccdc orf1ab 7 9 77 8 e sarbeco 6 9 66 7 and us cdc n2 1 of 9 samples 11 1 respectively at the lowest seeding level of 2 32 102 gc 50 ml n 9 samples us cdc n1 was the most sensitive assay providing detection in 6 9 66 7 samples followed by ccdc n with 3 9 33 3 then both us cdc n2 and ccdc orf1ab with detection in 1 9 11 1 samples and the e sarbeco assay which failed to produce any amplification zero detection at lowest seed detection rates by both the us cdc n1 rt qpcr and us cdc n1 rt dpcr were the same for all serially diluted samples three rt qpcr and two rt dpcr replicates were analyzed for each wastewater samples at seeding levels 2 32 105 and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml all rt qpcr and rt dpcr replicates yielded positive amplifications however inconsistent amplification occurred among rt qpcr and rt dpcr replicates at seeding levels 2 32 103 and 2 32 102 gc 50 ml among the five rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 replicates positivity was greater than other assays between the us cdc n1 rt qpcr and rt dpcr rt dpcr replicates positivity rates were slightly better than rt qpcr overall the us cdc n1 rt qpcr and the us cdc n1 rt dpcr assays outperformed other assays cdc n2 and e sarbeco were the least sensitive and this was most evident at the lower seeding dilution for all six rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays the exponential survival model effectively estimated the probabilities of sars cov 2 detection considering the entire methodological process table 3 verbyla et al 2016 any improvements in fit provided by the beta poisson model were not worth the extra degree of freedom as indicated by chi squared tests p values were all 0 05 among the rt qpcr assays and considering the definition of plod as the 95 probability of detection the lowest plod value was 3 954 gc 50 ml for us cdc n1 assay followed by 6 651 gc 50 ml for ccdc n plod values of us cdc n2 and e sarbeco were much greater than other assays us cdc n1 rt dpcr exhibited the lowest limits of detection ranging from 33 4 5 probability of detection to 1 952 95 probability of detection gc 50 ml we also determined the 50 and 95 probabilities of detection of sars cov 2 rna for all six rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays using the cumulative gaussian model table 3 bivins et al 2021b among the rt qpcr assays the lowest 95 plod value estimated by the cumulative gaussian model was again the us cdc n1 assay 3 621 gc 50 ml followed by ccdc orf1ab 3 948 gc 50 ml the plod values of us cdc n2 and e sarbeco were much greater than they were for other assays us cdc n1 rt dpcr exhibited the lowest limits of detection 448 50 probability of detection to 2 970 95 probability of detection gc 50 ml 3 3 variation in quantification for all rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays sars cov 2 rna was only quantifiable at seeding values 2 32 104 gc 50 ml wastewater as shown in table 4 the us cdc n2 rt qpcr assay demonstrated the largest variation in quantifiable samples with cvs of 89 and 147 at 2 32 105 gc 50 ml and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml respectively as shown in fig 1 the cv of the rt qpcr assays for ccdc n 50 52 ccdc orf1ab 51 40 and e sarbeco 44 59 were similar to that of the us cdc n1 rt dpcr assay 52 54 at each of the higher seeding levels besides the us cdc n2 rt qpcr assay previously mentioned the greatest increase in the cv between the two higher seeding levels was observed for the us cdc n1 rt qpcr 47 to 76 interestingly for the ccdc orf1ab rt qpcr the cv decreased from 51 to 40 suggesting improved quantitative precision as the seeded level decreased for all others the precision decreased with decreasing seeding level as is expected no assay yielded quantitative results when wastewater was seeded with 2 32 103 gc 50 or 2 32 102 gc 50 ml 3 4 recovery efficiency as summarized in table 5 the mean recoveries for rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays ranged from 3 63 ccdc n to 41 2 e sarbeco at 2 32 105 gc 50 ml to 2 77 ccdc n to 23 8 e sarbeco at 2 32 104 gc 50 ml at both these higher seeding levels the ccdc n assay demonstrated the lowest mean recovery and the e sarbeco assay demonstrated the highest as shown in fig 2 the largest variation in recovery efficiency was found for the us cdc n2 rt qpcr with a cv of 85 1 at 2 32 105 and 130 at 2 32 104 gc 50 ml while mean recoveries did vary statistically significant differences were only observed between the e sarbeco rt qpcr assay and the us cdc n1 p 0 028 us cdc n2 p 0 024 ccdc n p 0 0001 and rt dpcr n1 p 0 0003 assays at the higher seeding level and the e sarbeco rt qpcr and the us cdc n2 p 0 002 ccdc n p 0 0001 ccdc orf1ab p 0 026 and rt dpcr n1 p 0 0003 at the lower seeding level mean recovery efficiency significantly increased with increasing seed level for the us cdc n2 rt qpcr assay p 0 011 ccdc orf1ab p 0 008 and e sarbeco p 0 040 the us cdc n1 rt qpcr assay ccdc n assay and us cdc n1 rt dpcr assay recovery efficiencies remained similar between the two seeding levels aside from the e sarbeco rt qpcr assay the mean recovery efficiencies were most often below 10 across all assays and seeding levels 4 discussion many wastewater sars cov 2 surveillance studies have provided alod values by serially diluting standard materials and assaying the dilution series with various rt qpcr assays ahmed et al 2021b gerrity et al 2021 randazzo et al 2020 chavarria miró et al 2021 assuming a poisson model for the distribution of target gc into pcr reactions the theoretical 95 probability of detection is approximately 3 gene copies per pcr reaction ln 1 0 95 bustin et al 2009 but the models and methods used to determine alods and their estimated values vary widely between studies even among wastewater surveillance studies for sars cov 2 rna bivins et al 2021a for example during wastewater surveillance in virginia using droplet dpcr ddpcr gonzalez et al 2020 determined alods using 60 probability of detection n1 14 6 gc reaction while in northern indiana bivins et al 2021b using the same ddpcr platform estimated the alod using 95 probability of detection n1 3 3 gc reaction alods reported in the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature have ranged from 1 gc reaction gerrity et al 2021 to 50 gc reaction randazzo et al 2020 up to as high as 100 gc reaction chavarria miró et al 2021 however it should be noted that the control materials and statistical methods used to estimate the alods are not consistent from one study to another in the current study we have determined the alod for each rt qpcr dpcr assay using an exponential survival model verbyla et al 2016 the exponential survival model deviates from the poisson by incorporating a probability r that when the target is present describes the probability of survival of the target throughout the entire analytical workflow poisson assumes r 1 0 to be successfully detected so the estimated alod increases above the poisson by the inverse of r ln 1 0 95 r the observed alods of the rt qpcr assays suggest that the survival probabilities deviate from 1 with the us cdc n1 assay demonstrating the highest survival probability 3 9 5 0 32 and e sarbeco demonstrating the lowest 3 48 1 0 06 conversely the rt dpcr us cdc n1 assay probability of survival of 0 91 3 3 3 was the closest to 1 these results suggest that for the rt qpcr assays there are sources of error that reduce the detection probability even when a copy of the target has a high probability of having been added to the reaction well according to the poisson distribution the sources of error could include inhibition associated with the matrix or inefficiency of the pcr reaction in amplifying the control material in the current study rna extracted from gamma irradiated sars cov 2 was used as the control material so inhibition is expected to be minimal since the alods were measured over two days with minimal freeze thawing the degradation of rna during this time frame is also expected to be minimal while the alod provides information on the lowest number of gc than can be reliably detected by the rt qpcr assays when analyzing pure culture plasmid or other materials it does not incorporate the target genome loss in the sample matrix by primary and secondary concentration and nucleic acid extraction for clinical samples the results of pure reverse transcribed rna transcript standards and seeded samples were different for ccdc n and ccdc orf1ab vogels et al 2020 this indicates that the comparison of rt qpcr assays should be performed for relevant matrices such as clinical and wastewater samples the plod is the matrix relevant limit of detection incorporating the inefficiencies of the entire workflow determination of plod is not common practice in research literature especially for wastewater samples but has been conducted for microbial source tracking marker genes pathogens and indicator viruses in surface and drinking water samples stokdyk et al 2016 symonds et al 2016 staley et al 2012 verbyla et al 2016 ahmed et al 2018 in this study we determined plod values of sars cov 2 rna by seeding known concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples using five different rt qpcr and one rt dpcr assays to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the sars cov 2 plod for wastewater and provides insights on the analytical limitations for trace detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater for plod determination we used 36 different wastewater samples collected from 36 wwtps representing varying wastewater characteristics for seeding values 2 32 105 and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml all 18 wastewater samples and pcr replicates were positive by each assay rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays suggesting at these seeding levels detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater may be quite straightforward using the combination of adsorption extraction and the power water rneasy kit however with seeding values 2 32 103 and 2 32 102 gc 50 ml detection rates decreased with the lowest detection rates observed at the seeding level of 2 32 102 gc at these two seeding levels consistent amplification was not observed by all rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays interestingly the us cdc n1 assay outperformed other assays regarding detection sensitivity the superior performance of the us cdc n1 assays compared to other assays has been reported in research literature ahmed et al 2022 chavarria miró et al 2021 feng et al 2021 pecson et al 2021 pérez cataluña et al 2021 our findings also corroborate with a recent study that suggested us cdc n1 is suitable for screening sars cov 2 in wastewater with low covid 19 prevalence zhang et al 2022 the performance of us cdc n1 rt qpcr and rt dpcr were similar however rt dpcr yielded more positive replicates than rt qpcr the increased sensitivity of rt dpcr for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater compared to rt qpcr has also been reported ahmed et al 2022 ciesielski et al 2021 graham et al 2020 these findings clearly suggest that sub sampling error is occurring when the seeding level of sars cov 2 rna is 2 32 103 gc 50 ml wastewater ahmed et al 2021b which could introduce false negative errors in rna detection taylor et al 2019 furthermore factors such as stochastic amplification measurement uncertainty variability in virus concentration and rna extraction methods inefficient rt qpcr and stochastic levels of inhibitors could affect the plod and the reproducibility of results if the objective of the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance is early detection of covid 19 cases in a community then the factors mentioned above and associated variabilities should be carefully considered by analytical laboratories and public health units every amplification whether it is reproducible between replicates or not or even with a cq value 40 should be considered as a potential positive given appropriate negative results in all negative controls and reported to the relevant agencies for a virus such as sars cov 2 which is highly contagious it may be better to be overly cautious to effectively manage outbreaks the results of this study also highlight the importance of modelling detection limits in pcr based methods as probabilities rather than fixed limits this approach has been described previously to determine the alod verbyla et al 2016 forootan et al 2017 but we have now applied it to determine the plod considering the loss of sars cov 2 rna throughout the sample concentration and analysis process and the observation that the survival of the target during the pcr process is frequently less than 100 using a modelling approach can help determine a laboratory s probability of detecting the target when the concentrations are very low for example in this present study we found that sars cov 2 is detected using the us cdc n1 rt qpcr assay with a probability of 50 when the concentration is 915 gc 50 ml of wastewater therefore if the concentration is 915 gc 50 ml then processing 50 ml samples in triplicate would increase the probability of detection in at least one of the field triplicates to 87 5 1 0 53 0 875 from a public health perspective it is important to be able to detect the virus at concentrations below the 95 plod however laboratories may not be able to simply increase the volume of sample concentrated e g due to filter clogging or increasing likelihood of inhibition thus another way to improve the positive predictive value of wastewater surveillance would be to analyze field replicates which would increase the probability of amplification in at least one replicate developing a probability of detection model would allow a wastewater surveillance team to weigh the costs and benefits of adding field replicates to the standard operating procedure characterizing the sources of variation in sars cov 2 rna measurements in wastewater and fully reporting the associated uncertainty is also an important component of effective wastewater surveillance for public health applications mcclary gutierrez et al 2021a mcclary gutierrez et al 2021b the acceptable variation in pcr based quantification systems has been formalized as the limit of quantification aloq however allowable variation is debated with proposed cv threshold values from 25 to 35 klymus et al 2020 kralik and ricchi 2017 forootan et al 2017 for wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 rna the intrinsic and workflow derived variability remains largely uncharacterized due to limited method replication and the relationship between an aloq derived via control materials and idealized matrices and actual wastewater samples remains uncertain mcclary gutierrez et al 2021a medema et al 2020b in the current study we have characterized the variation through the entire sampling workflow by seeding sars cov 2 rna into wastewater from different wwtps with replication of both filters and rt qpcr dpcr reactions for all assays and measurement platforms sars cov 2 rna was quantifiable only when seeded levels were 2 32 104 gc 50 ml wastewater the us cdc n2 rt qpcr demonstrated the greatest variation with cvs of 89 and 147 at 2 32 105 gc and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml wastewater respectively the remaining rt qpcr assays demonstrated cvs ranging from 40 to 60 across both quantifiable seeding levels which was comparable with that demonstrated by the us cdc n1 rt dpcr the cvs of the us cdc n1 rt dpcr at the two seeding levels in the current study 54 52 were greater than those reported for filter replicates during wastewater surveillance in wisconsin usa 24 to 29 but it is unclear whether the results are comparable since increased variation would be expected at lower sars cov 2 rna concentrations feng et al 2021 furthermore differences in wastewater characteristics and analysis of exogenous and endogenous sars cov 2 introduce heterogeneity between studies during an inter laboratory comparison of 36 sampling methods recovery corrected sars cov 2 rna 10th and 90th percentile measurements spanned 2 3 log10 gc across all methods that yielded quantifiable results pecson et al 2021 a smaller methods comparison in canada found that across laboratories and methods seeded sars cov 2 and human coronavirus strain 229e concentrations were within 1 log10 gc of one another chik et al 2021 a wastewater surveillance interlaboratory study conducted at three wwtps in utah reported 10th percentile to 90th percentile measurements spanning roughly 0 6 log10 gc weidhaas et al 2021 in the current study we observed 10th to 90th percentiles spanning 0 47 to 0 99 log10 gene copies at the 2 32 105 gc 50 ml seeding level and 0 42 to 2 33 log10 gene copies at the 2 32 105 gc 50 ml seeding level while the variation of sars cov 2 rna measurements in the current study seems to be in reasonable agreement with those previously reported direct comparisons are precluded by uncertainty regarding the similarity of the endogenous and seeded sars cov 2 rna concentration in the wastewater used in the studies nonetheless our robust study design which included replication of both filters and rt qpcr rt dpcr reactions and wastewater samples from multiple wwtps indicates that after accounting for process inefficiencies the variation in measured sars cov 2 rna may exceed standards typically considered acceptable for limits of quantification since we seeded known concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples we were able to calculate the full process recovery efficiency loss of sars cov 2 through concentration and extraction methods used in this study using different assays and platforms we calculated recovery efficiency for 2 32 105 and 2 32 104 seeding levels because all wastewater samples and associated rt qpcr replicates were quantifiable using all rt qpcr assays the mean recovery efficiencies for all assays were greater for 2 32 105 seeding levels than 2 32 104 suggesting the concentrations of sars cov 2 present in wastewater influence method recovery the greater the concentration the greater the recovery and downstream detection rates similar results have been reported in a recent study where greater recovery was observed for bacteriophage phi 6 surrogate with the highest seed compared to the lowest seed levels sangsanont et al 2022 this is not unexpected considering we used wastewater samples from different wwtps with variable suspended solids tss 670 to 825 mg l while most of the recovery assessment studies used a single or a limited number of bulk wastewater samples ahmed et al 2020d feng et al 2021 observed a significant difference in recovery of bcov between the wwtps with some wwtps having more consistent recovery rates 0 21 to 3 0 than others 0 89 to 28 0 however relatively consistent recoveries were obtained for sars cov 2 using the us cdc n1 both rt qpcr and rt dpcr ccdc n and ccdc orf1 assays the variations in recovery efficiencies were greater for us cdc n2 and e sarbeco assays suggesting these assays alone may not be sensitive enough to detect trace concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater and should be used in combination with other assays this is most likely due to the lower alod of these two assays compared to the others however other factors such as wastewater characteristics rt qpcr efficiency and y intercepts and standard curve materials also introduce variability between assays based on the recovery data obtained in this study we recommend recovery assessment via the most consistent assay if possible using a dpcr platform the recovery efficiency presented in this study should be interpreted with care because measuring the actual concentrations of sars cov 2 in seeding stock is not straightforward kantor et al 2021 importantly the findings of the current study are based on seeding wastewater with gamma irradiated sars cov 2 the behavior of an exogenous control such as the one used in the current study compared to an endogenous sars cov 2 shed into wastewater via infected individuals remains uncharacterized 5 conclusions of the six assays evaluated the us cdc n1 rt dpcr followed by its rt qpcr assay was most sensitive regardless of the statistical model or seeding concentrations used to determine the alod and plod associated with the ae concentration method the us cdc n2 and e sarbeco assays were the least sensitive especially with decreasing seeding concentrations when evaluated alone alod and as a part of the ae concentration process plod trends in sars cov 2 rna recovery efficiency mirrored the analytical sensitivities with recovery efficiencies being less variable for us cdc n1 rt dpcr and rt qpcr and most variable for us cdc n2 rt qpcr and e sarbeco rt qpcr the greater the sars cov 2 rna concentration in a wastewater sample the greater the recovery and downstream detection probability when sars cov 2 rna seeding levels were 2 32 103 gc 50 ml inconsistent amplification was observed and detection rates decreased for all assays thus when sars cov 2 rna concentrations are expected to be low in wastewater it may be necessary to improve the positive predictive value of wastewater surveillance by analyzing additional field and rt pcr replicates comparing the behavior of endogenous sars cov 2 rna compared to various exogeneous controls such as the seeded sars cov 2 in the current study remains a critical research need for

16231,effective wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 rna requires the rigorous characterization of the limit of detection resulting from the entire sampling process the process limit of detection plod yet to date no studies have gone beyond quantifying the assay limit of detection alod for rt qpcr or rt dpcr assays while the alod is the lowest number of gene copies gc associated with a 95 probability of detection in a single pcr reaction the plod represents the sensitivity of the method after considering the efficiency of all processing steps e g sample handling concentration nucleic acid extraction and pcr assays to determine the number of gc in the wastewater sample matrix with a specific probability of detection the primary objective of this study was to estimate the plod resulting from the combination of primary concentration and extraction with six sars cov 2 assays five rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 and n2 china cdc n and orf1ab ccdc n and ccdc orf1ab and e sarbeco rt qpcr and one rt dpcr assay us cdc n1 rt dpcr using two models exponential survival and cumulative gaussian an adsorption extraction ae concentration method i e virus adsorption on membrane and the rna extraction from the membrane was used to concentrate gamma irradiated sars cov 2 seeded into 36 wastewater samples overall the us cdc n1 rt dpcr and rt qpcr assays had the lowest alods 10 gc reaction and plods 3 954 gc 50 ml 95 probability of detection regardless of the seeding level and model used nevertheless consistent amplification and detection rates decreased when seeding levels were 2 32 103 gc 50 ml even for us cdc n1 rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays consequently when sars cov 2 rna concentrations are expected to be low it may be necessary to improve the positive detection rates of wastewater surveillance by analyzing additional field and rt pcr replicates to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the sars cov 2 plod for wastewater and provides important

et al 2020a prado et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 bertrand et al 2021 gibas et al 2021 navarro et al 2021 westhaus et al 2021 given the complexities of such workflows there are many factors that may contribute to false negative and erroneous results wastewater negative despite the presence of covid 19 in the relevant population which are thoroughly discussed in several review articles ahmed et al 2020b medema et al 2020b michael kordatou et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021a bivins et al 2021a interpreting discordant results is further complicated by the many rt pcr assays in use multiple assays have been developed targeting various nucleic acid sequences of sars cov 2 specific to the nucleocapsid n envelope protein e rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp open reading frame one orf1 membrane protein m and surface protein s genes li et al 2020 while these assays were developed for clinical testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples they are also being used for wastewater surveillance bertrand et al 2021 bivins et al 2021b gibas et al 2021 navarro et al 2021 westhaus et al 2021 several studies have examined the analytical sensitivity as measured by the assay limit of detection alod of various rt qpcr assays primarily for clinical testing for example iglói et al 2020 compared 13 commercially available real time rt pcr assays using sars cov 2 cell cultured virus stock analytical sensitivity of assays in the different kits varied between 3 3 to 330 rna gene copies gc reaction muenchhof et al 2020 compared 11 different rt qpcr assays used in seven diagnostic laboratories in germany using an rna sample extracted from one sars cov 2 positive stool sample serially diluted rna sub samples were shared with participating laboratories to determine sensitivity most rt qpcr assays for sars cov 2 examined in their study successfully detected 5 gc reaction reflecting a high sensitivity a reduced sensitivity was noted for the original rdrp assay from charité institute of virology charité which may have impacted the confirmation of some covid 19 cases in the early weeks of the pandemic a study by vogels et al 2020 compared the performance of nine primer probe combinations targeting several genes i e e n orf1 rdrp recommended by the world health organization e g those developed by the china cdc us cdc charité corman et al 2020 and hong kong university this comparison was performed with standard reference materials and clinical samples e g nasopharyngeal swabs saliva urine and rectal swabs seeded with the reference material the authors demonstrated that at low viral concentrations 1 to 10 gc µl not all assays yielded positive results thus suggesting that some assays may be more prone to false negative errors than others vogels et al 2020 most notably the rdrp reverse primer had mismatches with the reference material that were attributed to evolution of the virus causing low analytical sensitivity while the alod is a useful assessment of the analytical sensitivity of sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays the alod values of various sars cov 2 assays during wastewater surveillance have ranged between 1 to 100 gc reaction gerrity et al 2021 randazzo et al 2020 chavarria miró et al 2021 for wastewater surveillance the analytical sensitivity of methods must also account for the efficiency of the various processing steps including primary concentration loss through nucleic acid extraction and inhibition of reverse transcription or pcr amplification together the rt qpcr dpcr alod and the process recovery efficiency loss of target through all sample processing steps determine the process limit of detection plod which has not yet been well characterized for any method used to concentrate sars cov 2 rna from wastewater frequently assumed process recoveries e g 100 and empirically determined alods are combined to produce idealized estimates of the plod ahmed et al 2021b but empirical determination of the plod itself is vital for a robust characterization of the surveillance method a recent study evaluated four different sars cov 2 rt qpcr detection assays us cdc n1 china cdc n ccdc n n sarbeco and e sarbeco for the accurate and reliable quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater zhang et al 2022 the authors recommended the ccdc n assay for its high sensitivity and reproducibility when analysing plasmid control material plasmid seeded wastewater and real wastewater samples while the us cdc n1 assay demonstrated high sensitivity in their ambient wastewater samples it showed poor reproducibility and linearity at low concentrations against their plasmid seeded samples zhang et al 2022 however the generalizability of such findings is constrained by several limitations the rt qpcr cycling parameters were the same for all assays and deviations from the optimized assay specific cycling parameters may have affected the sensitivity of one assay compared to another furthermore plasmid control materials rather than sars cov 2 virions were seeded by zhang et al 2022 into rna extracted from wastewater to determine the spiked mocks limit of detection using seeded wastewater the use of plasmid control materials which are double stranded dna for sars cov 2 single stranded rna virus has well documented limitations including heterogeneity in pcr efficiencies and non linearity for rt qpcr experiments bivins et al 2021a the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the plods of five rt qpcr assays and one rt dpcr assay for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater inclusive of the processing workflow efficiency this was achieved by seeding a dilution series of known concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 virions into wastewater followed by primary concentration nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr rt dpcr analysis using each assay in addition to determining the plod the quantitative data from the seeding experiments were also used to assess the variation in sars cov 2 rna copy number along the dilution gradient in conjunction with these experiments the effect of variable seeding levels of sars cov 2 in wastewater on recovery efficiency of each assay was also examined using 36 different wastewater samples 2

and rt dpcr alods to determine rt qpcr and rt dpcr assay limit of detection alod gamma irradiated sars cov 2 were diluted 6 105 to 0 6 gc reaction and analyzed using rt qpcr and rt dpcr at each dilution 15 replicates were analyzed the 95 alod was defined by fitting an exponential survival model to the proportion of pcr replicates positive at each step along the gradient verbyla et al 2016 2 9 quality control to minimize rt qpcr and rt dpcr contamination nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr dpcr set up were performed in separate laboratories a sample negative control was included during the concentration process an extraction negative control was also included during nucleic acid extraction to account for any contamination during extraction all sample and extraction negative controls were negative for the analyzed targets 2 10 data analysis for rt qpcr and rt dpcr the alod is defined as the minimum gc number with a 95 probability of detection and determined as previously described verbyla et al 2016 for rt qpcr samples were considered positive sars cov 2 detected if amplification was observed in at least one of the three replicates within 45 cycles samples were considered quantifiable if amplification was observed in all three replicates with concentrations above the alod for rt dpcr samples were considered positive if there was at least one positive partition following the merging of nano wells from two replicate wells samples were considered quantifiable by rt dpcr if the concentrations were above the alod and the average number of partitions was 11 000 per sample well for rt qpcr and rt dpcr the plod is defined as the minimum gc number with a 95 probability of detection incorporating the loss of sars cov 2 through sample concentration and rna extraction and determined as previously described stokdyk et al 2016 verbyla et al 2016 the plod was estimated for each assay using two probability models that predict the proportion of positive amplification within 45 cycles the exponential survival model and the beta poisson model verbyla et al 2016 for comparison the cumulative gaussian model bivins et al 2021b stokdyk et al 2016 was also used to estimate the 50 and 95 detection probabilities maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters were obtained by finding parameter values that minimized the deviance based on the positive and total number of replicates analyzed at the different concentrations of seeded sars cov 2 since the exponential model is a special case of the beta poisson model haas et al 2014 a chi squared test was performed to determine if the fit provided by the beta poisson model was worth the extra degree of freedom for the seeded levels that yielded a 100 detection rate the variation in the estimated sars cov 2 rna gc number for each assay was assessed via the coefficient of variation cv the sars cov 2 recovery efficiency for all rt qpcr and rt dpcr was calculated based on the gc quantified as follows recovery efficiency gc recovered in concentrated wastewater gc seeded 100 at each concentration step with a 100 detection rate differences in recovery efficiency between assays were assessed by the kruskal wallis h test with dunn s post hoc test kruskal and wallis 1952 dunn 1964 differences in recovery efficiency between concentration steps for each assay were assessed by the mann whitney u test

sarbeco the alods for the rt qpcr assays were between 9 50 and 48 1 gc reaction being the lowest for the us cdc n1 and greatest for e sarbeco assays respectively table 1 the rt dpcr alod was 3 30 gc reaction for the us cdc n1 assay all method extraction and rt qpcr rt dpcr negative controls were negative all positive controls or standard curves amplified in each pcr run for the us cdc n1 rt dpcr the number of partitions ranged from 11 522 25 417 with a mean of 21 148 and a sd of 3 437 pcr inhibition was not identified in any rna samples based on the seeded gc of mhv all within 2 cq values of the reference cq value supplementary table st3 3 2 rt qpcr detection and plod values for sars cov 2 seeded wastewater samples sars cov 2 rna was detected in all wastewater samples by all six assay replicates rt qpcr and rt dpcr when seeding was 2 32 105 n 9 samples and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml n 9 samples table 2 at the lower seeding titer of 2 32 103 gc 50 ml n 9 samples among the rt qpcr assays ccdc

of 2 32 102 gc 50 ml n 9 samples us cdc n1 was the most sensitive assay providing detection in 6 9 66 7 samples followed by ccdc n with 3 9 33 3 then both us cdc n2 and ccdc orf1ab with detection in 1 9 11 1 samples and the e sarbeco assay which failed to produce any amplification zero detection at lowest seed detection rates by both the us cdc n1 rt qpcr and us cdc n1 rt dpcr were the same for all serially diluted samples three rt qpcr and two rt dpcr replicates were analyzed for each wastewater samples at seeding levels 2 32 105 and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml all rt qpcr and rt dpcr replicates yielded positive amplifications however inconsistent amplification occurred among rt qpcr and rt dpcr replicates at seeding levels 2 32 103 and 2 32 102 gc 50 ml among the five rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 replicates positivity was greater than other assays between the us cdc n1 rt qpcr and rt dpcr rt dpcr replicates positivity rates were slightly better than rt qpcr overall the us cdc n1 rt qpcr and the us cdc n1 rt dpcr assays outperformed other assays cdc n2 and e sarbeco were the least sensitive and this was most evident at the lower seeding dilution for all six rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays the exponential survival model effectively estimated the probabilities of sars cov 2 detection considering the entire methodological process table 3 verbyla et al 2016 any improvements in fit provided by the beta poisson model were not worth the extra degree of freedom as indicated by chi squared tests p values were all 0 05 among the rt qpcr assays and considering the definition of plod as the 95 probability of detection the lowest plod value was 3 954 gc 50 ml for us cdc n1 assay followed by 6 651 gc 50 ml for ccdc n plod values of us cdc n2 and e sarbeco were much greater than other assays us cdc n1 rt dpcr exhibited the lowest limits of detection ranging from 33 4 5 probability of detection to 1 952 95 probability of detection gc 50 ml we also determined the 50 and 95 probabilities of detection of sars cov 2 rna for all six rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays using the cumulative gaussian model table 3 bivins et al 2021b among the rt qpcr assays the lowest 95 plod value estimated by the cumulative gaussian model was again the us cdc n1 assay 3 621 gc 50 ml followed by ccdc orf1ab 3 948 gc 50 ml the plod values of us cdc n2 and e sarbeco were much greater than they were for other assays us cdc n1 rt dpcr exhibited the lowest limits of detection 448 50 probability of detection to 2 970 95 probability of detection gc 50 ml 3 3 variation in quantification for all rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays sars cov 2 rna was only quantifiable at seeding values 2 32 104 gc 50 ml wastewater as shown in table 4 the us cdc n2 rt qpcr assay demonstrated the largest variation in quantifiable samples with cvs of 89 and 147 at 2 32 105 gc 50 ml and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml respectively as shown in fig 1 the cv of the rt qpcr assays for ccdc n 50 52 ccdc orf1ab 51 40 and e sarbeco 44 59 were similar to that of the us cdc n1 rt dpcr assay 52 54 at each of the higher seeding levels besides the us cdc n2 rt qpcr assay previously mentioned the greatest increase in the cv between the two higher seeding levels was observed for the us cdc n1 rt qpcr 47 to 76 interestingly for the ccdc orf1ab rt qpcr the cv decreased from 51 to 40 suggesting improved quantitative precision as the seeded level decreased for all others the precision decreased with decreasing seeding level as is expected no assay yielded quantitative results when wastewater was seeded with 2 32 103 gc 50 or 2 32 102 gc 50 ml 3 4 recovery efficiency as summarized in table 5 the mean recoveries for rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays ranged from 3 63 ccdc n to 41 2 e sarbeco at 2 32 105 gc 50 ml to 2 77 ccdc n to 23 8 e sarbeco at 2 32 104 gc 50 ml at both these higher seeding levels the ccdc n assay demonstrated the lowest mean recovery and the e sarbeco assay demonstrated the highest as shown in fig 2 the largest variation in recovery efficiency was found for the us cdc n2 rt qpcr with a cv of 85 1 at 2 32 105 and 130 at 2 32 104 gc 50 ml while mean recoveries did vary statistically significant differences were only observed between the e sarbeco rt qpcr assay and the us cdc n1 p 0 028 us cdc n2 p 0 024 ccdc n p 0 0001 and rt dpcr n1 p 0 0003 assays at the higher seeding level and the e sarbeco rt qpcr and the us cdc n2 p 0 002 ccdc n p 0 0001 ccdc orf1ab p 0 026 and rt dpcr n1 p 0 0003 at the lower seeding level mean recovery efficiency significantly increased with increasing seed level for the us cdc n2 rt qpcr assay p 0 011 ccdc orf1ab p 0 008 and e sarbeco p 0 040 the us cdc n1 rt qpcr assay ccdc n assay and us cdc n1 rt dpcr assay recovery efficiencies remained similar between the two seeding levels aside from the e sarbeco rt qpcr assay the mean recovery efficiencies were most often below 10 across all assays and seeding levels 4 discussion many wastewater sars cov 2 surveillance studies have provided alod values by serially diluting standard materials and assaying the dilution series with various rt qpcr assays ahmed et al 2021b gerrity et al 2021 randazzo et al 2020 chavarria miró et al 2021 assuming a poisson model for the distribution of target gc into pcr reactions the theoretical 95 probability of detection is approximately 3 gene copies per pcr reaction ln 1 0 95 bustin et al 2009 but the models and methods used to determine alods and their estimated values vary widely between studies even among wastewater surveillance studies for sars cov 2 rna bivins et al 2021a for example during wastewater surveillance in virginia using droplet dpcr ddpcr gonzalez et al 2020 determined alods using 60 probability of detection n1 14 6 gc reaction while in northern indiana bivins et al 2021b using the same ddpcr platform estimated the alod using 95 probability of detection n1 3 3 gc reaction alods reported in the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature have ranged from 1 gc reaction gerrity et al 2021 to 50 gc reaction randazzo et al 2020 up to as high as 100 gc reaction chavarria miró et al 2021 however it should be noted that the control materials and statistical methods used to estimate the alods are not consistent from one study to another in the current study we have determined the alod for each rt qpcr dpcr assay using an exponential survival model verbyla et al 2016 the exponential survival model deviates from the poisson by incorporating a probability r that when the target is present describes the probability of survival of the target throughout the entire analytical workflow poisson assumes r 1 0 to be successfully detected so the estimated alod increases above the poisson by the inverse of r ln 1 0 95 r the observed alods of the rt qpcr assays suggest that the survival probabilities deviate from 1 with the us cdc n1 assay demonstrating the highest survival probability 3 9 5 0 32 and e sarbeco demonstrating the lowest 3 48 1 0 06 conversely the rt dpcr us cdc n1 assay probability of survival of 0 91 3 3 3 was the closest to 1 these results suggest that for the rt qpcr assays there are sources of error that reduce the detection probability even when a copy of the target has a high probability of having been added to the reaction well according to the poisson distribution the sources of error could include inhibition associated with the matrix or inefficiency of the pcr reaction in amplifying the control material in the current study rna extracted from gamma irradiated sars cov 2 was used as the control material so inhibition is expected to be minimal since the alods were measured over two days with minimal freeze thawing the degradation of rna during this time frame is also expected to be minimal while the alod provides information on the lowest number of gc than can be reliably detected by the rt qpcr assays when analyzing pure culture plasmid or other materials it does not incorporate the target genome loss in the sample matrix by primary and secondary concentration and nucleic acid extraction for clinical samples the results of pure reverse transcribed rna transcript standards and seeded samples were different for ccdc n and ccdc orf1ab vogels et al 2020 this indicates that the comparison of rt qpcr assays should be performed for relevant matrices such as clinical and wastewater samples the plod is the matrix relevant limit of detection incorporating the inefficiencies of the entire workflow determination of plod is not common practice in research literature especially for wastewater samples but has been conducted for microbial source tracking marker genes pathogens and indicator viruses in surface and drinking water samples stokdyk et al 2016 symonds et al 2016 staley et al 2012 verbyla et al 2016 ahmed et al 2018 in this study we determined plod values of sars cov 2 rna by seeding known concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples using five different rt qpcr and one rt dpcr assays to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the sars cov 2 plod for wastewater and provides insights on the analytical limitations for trace detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater for plod determination we used 36 different wastewater samples collected from 36 wwtps representing varying wastewater characteristics for seeding values 2 32 105 and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml all 18 wastewater samples and pcr replicates were positive by each assay rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays suggesting at these seeding levels detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater may be quite straightforward using the combination of adsorption extraction and the power water rneasy kit however with seeding values 2 32 103 and 2 32 102 gc 50 ml detection rates decreased with the lowest detection rates observed at the seeding level of 2 32 102 gc at these two seeding levels consistent amplification was not observed by all rt qpcr and rt dpcr assays interestingly the us cdc n1 assay outperformed other assays regarding detection sensitivity the superior performance of the us cdc n1 assays compared to other assays has been reported in research literature ahmed et al 2022 chavarria miró et al 2021 feng et al 2021 pecson et al 2021 pérez cataluña et al 2021 our findings also corroborate with a recent study that suggested us cdc n1 is suitable for screening sars cov 2 in wastewater with low covid 19 prevalence zhang et al 2022 the performance of us cdc n1 rt qpcr and rt dpcr were similar however rt dpcr yielded more positive replicates than rt qpcr the increased sensitivity of rt dpcr for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater compared to rt qpcr has also been reported ahmed et al 2022 ciesielski et al 2021 graham et al 2020 these findings clearly suggest that sub sampling error is occurring when the seeding level of sars cov 2 rna is 2 32 103 gc 50 ml wastewater ahmed et al 2021b which could introduce false negative errors in rna detection taylor et al 2019 furthermore factors such as stochastic amplification measurement uncertainty variability in virus concentration and rna extraction methods inefficient rt qpcr and stochastic levels of inhibitors could affect the plod and the reproducibility of results if the objective of the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance is early detection of covid 19 cases in a community then the factors mentioned above and associated variabilities should be carefully considered by analytical laboratories and public health units every amplification whether it is reproducible between replicates or not or even with a cq value 40 should be considered as a potential positive given appropriate negative results in all negative controls and reported to the relevant agencies for a virus such as sars cov 2 which is highly contagious it may be better to be overly cautious to effectively manage outbreaks the results of this study also highlight the importance of modelling detection limits in pcr based methods as probabilities rather than fixed limits this approach has been described previously to determine the alod verbyla et al 2016 forootan et al 2017 but we have now applied it to determine the plod considering the loss of sars cov 2 rna throughout the sample concentration and analysis process and the observation that the survival of the target during the pcr process is frequently less than 100 using a modelling approach can help determine a laboratory s probability of detecting the target when the concentrations are very low for example in this present study we found that sars cov 2 is detected using the us cdc n1 rt qpcr assay with a probability of 50 when the concentration is 915 gc 50 ml of wastewater therefore if the concentration is 915 gc 50 ml then processing 50 ml samples in triplicate would increase the probability of detection in at least one of the field triplicates to 87 5 1 0 53 0 875 from a public health perspective it is important to be able to detect the virus at concentrations below the 95 plod however laboratories may not be able to simply increase the volume of sample concentrated e g due to filter clogging or increasing likelihood of inhibition thus another way to improve the positive predictive value of wastewater surveillance would be to analyze field replicates which would increase the probability of amplification in at least one replicate developing a probability of detection model would allow a wastewater surveillance team to weigh the costs and benefits of adding field replicates to the standard operating procedure characterizing the sources of variation in sars cov 2 rna measurements in wastewater and fully reporting the associated uncertainty is also an important component of effective wastewater surveillance for public health applications mcclary gutierrez et al 2021a mcclary gutierrez et al 2021b the acceptable variation in pcr based quantification systems has been formalized as the limit of quantification aloq however allowable variation is debated with proposed cv threshold values from 25 to 35 klymus et al 2020 kralik and ricchi 2017 forootan et al 2017 for wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 rna the intrinsic and workflow derived variability remains largely uncharacterized due to limited method replication and the relationship between an aloq derived via control materials and idealized matrices and actual wastewater samples remains uncertain mcclary gutierrez et al 2021a medema et al 2020b in the current study we have characterized the variation through the entire sampling workflow by seeding sars cov 2 rna into wastewater from different wwtps with replication of both filters and rt qpcr dpcr reactions for all assays and measurement platforms sars cov 2 rna was quantifiable only when seeded levels were 2 32 104 gc 50 ml wastewater the us cdc n2 rt qpcr demonstrated the greatest variation with cvs of 89 and 147 at 2 32 105 gc and 2 32 104 gc 50 ml wastewater respectively the remaining rt qpcr assays demonstrated cvs ranging from 40 to 60 across both quantifiable seeding levels which was comparable with that demonstrated by the us cdc n1 rt dpcr the cvs of the us cdc n1 rt dpcr at the two seeding levels in the current study 54 52 were greater than those reported for filter replicates during wastewater surveillance in wisconsin usa 24 to 29 but it is unclear whether the results are comparable since increased variation would be expected at lower sars cov 2 rna concentrations feng et al 2021 furthermore differences in wastewater characteristics and analysis of exogenous and endogenous sars cov 2 introduce heterogeneity between studies during an inter laboratory comparison of 36 sampling methods recovery corrected sars cov 2 rna 10th and 90th percentile measurements spanned 2 3 log10 gc across all methods that yielded quantifiable results pecson et al 2021 a smaller methods comparison in canada found that across laboratories and methods seeded sars cov 2 and human coronavirus strain 229e concentrations were within 1 log10 gc of one another chik et al 2021 a wastewater surveillance interlaboratory study conducted at three wwtps in utah reported 10th percentile to 90th percentile measurements spanning roughly 0 6 log10 gc weidhaas et al 2021 in the current study we observed 10th to 90th percentiles spanning 0 47 to 0 99 log10 gene copies at the 2 32 105 gc 50 ml seeding level and 0 42 to 2 33 log10 gene copies at the 2 32 105 gc 50 ml seeding level while the variation of sars cov 2 rna measurements in the current study seems to be in reasonable agreement with those previously reported direct comparisons are precluded by uncertainty regarding the similarity of the endogenous and seeded sars cov 2 rna concentration in the wastewater used in the studies nonetheless our robust study design which included replication of both filters and rt qpcr rt dpcr reactions and wastewater samples from multiple wwtps indicates that after accounting for process inefficiencies the variation in measured sars cov 2 rna may exceed standards typically considered acceptable for limits of quantification since we seeded known concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples we were able to calculate the full process recovery efficiency loss of sars cov 2 through concentration and extraction methods used in this study using different assays and platforms we calculated recovery efficiency for 2 32 105 and 2 32 104 seeding levels because all wastewater samples and associated rt qpcr replicates were quantifiable using all rt qpcr assays the mean recovery efficiencies for all assays were greater for 2 32 105 seeding levels than 2 32 104 suggesting the concentrations of sars cov 2 present in wastewater influence method recovery the greater the concentration the greater the recovery and downstream detection rates similar results have been reported in a recent study where greater recovery was observed for bacteriophage phi 6 surrogate with the highest seed compared to the lowest seed levels sangsanont et al 2022 this is not unexpected considering we used wastewater samples from different wwtps with variable suspended solids tss 670 to 825 mg l while most of the recovery assessment studies used a single or a limited number of bulk wastewater samples ahmed et al 2020d feng et al 2021 observed a significant difference in recovery of bcov between the wwtps with some wwtps having more consistent recovery rates 0 21 to 3 0 than others 0 89 to 28 0 however relatively consistent recoveries were obtained for sars cov 2 using the us cdc n1 both rt qpcr and rt dpcr ccdc n and ccdc orf1 assays the variations in recovery efficiencies were greater for us cdc n2 and e sarbeco assays suggesting these assays alone may not be sensitive enough to detect trace concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater and should be used in combination with other assays this is most likely due to the lower alod of these two assays compared to the others however other factors such as wastewater characteristics rt qpcr efficiency and y intercepts and standard curve materials also introduce variability between assays based on the recovery data obtained in this study we recommend recovery assessment via the most consistent assay if possible using a dpcr platform the recovery efficiency presented in this study should be interpreted with care because measuring the actual concentrations of sars cov 2 in seeding stock is not straightforward kantor et al 2021 importantly the findings of the current study are based on seeding wastewater with gamma irradiated sars cov 2 the behavior of an exogenous control such as the one used in the current study compared to an endogenous sars cov 2 shed into wastewater via infected individuals remains uncharacterized 5 conclusions of the six assays evaluated the us cdc n1 rt dpcr followed by its rt qpcr assay was most sensitive regardless of the statistical model or seeding concentrations used to determine the alod and plod associated with the ae concentration method the us cdc n2 and e sarbeco assays were the least sensitive especially with decreasing seeding concentrations when evaluated alone alod and as a part of the ae concentration process plod trends in sars cov 2 rna recovery efficiency mirrored the analytical sensitivities with recovery efficiencies being less variable for us cdc n1 rt dpcr and rt qpcr and most variable for us cdc n2 rt qpcr and e sarbeco rt qpcr the greater the sars cov 2 rna concentration in a wastewater sample the greater the recovery and downstream detection probability when sars cov 2 rna seeding levels were 2 32 103 gc 50 ml inconsistent amplification was observed and detection rates decreased for all assays thus when sars cov 2 rna concentrations are expected to be low in wastewater it may be necessary to improve the positive predictive value of wastewater surveillance by analyzing additional field and rt pcr replicates comparing the behavior of endogenous sars cov 2 rna compared to various exogeneous controls such as the seeded sars cov 2 in the current study remains a critical research need for

16232,electrokinetic techniques represent a valuable approach to enhance solute transport reactant delivery and contaminant degradation in complex environmental matrices such as contaminated soil and groundwater and have a great potential for the remediation of many organic and inorganic pollutants this study investigates the complex interplay between the key electrokinetic transport mechanisms electromigration and electroosmosis in physically heterogeneous porous media and its impact on tracer distribution reactant mixing and degradation efficiency we perform experiments in a multidimensional setup considering different types of heterogeneities injected tracers and reactants as well as background electrolyte pore water with different chemical composition and ph we show that ek transport is significantly affected by the physical heterogeneities due to the interaction between electrokinetic and hydraulic processes and by the pore water chemistry that plays a key role on the magnitude and spatial distribution of electroosmotic fluxes the latter affect the overall transport of charged and non charged species including the migration velocity of injected plumes their spatial patterns spreading and mixing with the background groundwater and the extent of degradation and the spatio temporal evolution of reactive zones in the heterogeneous porous media process based numerical modeling allowed us to interpret the experimental observations and to disentangle the coupled effects of physical chemical and electrostatic processes in the multidimensional heterogeneous setups besides elucidating the mechanisms controlling electrokinetic transport the results of this study have also important implications for practical field implementation of ek approaches in intrinsically heterogeneous subsurface systems keywords electrokinetic remediation electromigration electroosmosis heterogeneous porous media contaminant degradation reactive transport modeling 1 introduction electrokinetic ek techniques rely on the application of electric fields in electrolyte solutions to promote electrochemical reactions and to enhance solute transport ek approaches have been used in different fields of science and engineering ranging from water treatment tian et al 2021 microfluidic applications alizadeh et al 2021 and resource recovery martens et al 2021 in the context of environmental applications electrokinetics has been studied for its potential of electrokinetic remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater ribeiro and prasad 2021 which consists in using electrodes establishing electric fields in the ground to enhance transport mechanisms in the subsurface reddy and cameselle 2009 a unique advantage of ek driven transport is the possibility to ensure effective reactant delivery in poorly accessible low permeability porous media where pollutants are often trapped and represent long term sources of groundwater contamination brooks et al 2021 chapman and parker 2005 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 ek technologies rely on two phenomena that determine the displacement of solutes in pore water i electromigration consisting in the transport of charged species towards the electrode of opposite charge acar and alshawabkeh 1993 probstein and hicks 1993 and ii electroosmosis involving the movement of water from the mobilization of the excess of charge in the double layer for negatively charged porous media which are typical in subsurface formations electroosmosis results in a net water flux from the anode towards the cathode alizadeh et al 2014 yustres et al 2020 electrokinetic techniques have been mostly tested in laboratory experiments however a few recent studies have shown first field applications for groundwater remediation at pilot scale czinnerová et al 2020 head et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 sprocati et al 2020 ek approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing contaminant mobilization cappello et al 2019 kim et al 2012 lópez vizcaíno et al 2017 yeung and gu 2011 in delivering amendments to stimulate microbial activity gill et al 2014 wick et al 2004 as well as oxidants or reductants for chemical transformation chowdhury et al 2017a head et al 2020 hodges et al 2013 ren et al 2014 electrokinetics is a versatile approach and is considered a suitable and promising technology for in situ remediation of many pollutants including organic contaminants czinnerová et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 ottosen et al 2019 radionuclides purkis et al 2021 and heavy metals wang et al 2021 an important aspect that has been extensively studied for natural groundwater flow and transport but has received considerably less attention in the context of ek applications is the role of subsurface heterogeneity geologic formations are inherently heterogeneous and the spatial distribution of physical chiogna et al 2015 jung and navarre sitchler 2018 steefel et al 2005 sudicky and illman 2011 ye et al 2015 and chemical battistel et al 2019 li et al 2014 heterogeneities have a dramatic impact on solute transport mixing and reactions at different scales rolle and le borgne 2019 valocchi et al 2019 only a few studies investigated electrokinetic transport in heterogeneous media and showed that ek can ensure significant transport velocities also in low permeability matrices chowdhury et al 2017b gill et al 2016 reynolds et al 2008 although less sensitive to heterogeneity compared to advective dispersive transport ek mass transfer processes are still strongly and non trivially impacted by the spatial distribution of porous media permeability the investigation of these effects has received little attention but is of great importance to improve the understanding of electrokinetic transport and to upscale ek remediation approaches from the laboratory to the field this study aims to address such research gap by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between the different flow and transport processes occurring upon the application of an electric field in heterogeneous porous media we performed a series of controled electrokinetic experiments in a multidimensional laboratory setup the experiments considered porous media with different heterogeneous configurations and hydrochemical conditions and explored the interaction between electroosmosis and electromigration for both conservative and reactive transport the main focus is the investigation of the interplay between physical and chemical processes and their impact on tracer displacement reactant delivery degradation efficiency and spatial distribution of reactive zones during ek transport in heterogeneous porous media process based reactive transport modeling was performed to enable the understanding and the interpretation of the coupled flow and transport patterns observed in the different experiments the key processes described in the numerical simulations of the different heterogeneous systems include fluid flow with electroosmosis and hydraulic terms multicomponent solute transport coulombic interactions between charged species in pore water and geochemical reactions 2 materials and methods the experiments were conducted in a quasi two dimensional setup illustrated in fig 1 consisting of a tempered glass chamber of inner size 795 mm 182 mm 11 mm rolle et al 2022 sprocati et al 2021 the setup was held by an aluminum frame and the metal part between the glass panels was covered by a polyethylene layer the porous media were packed in the central part of the system resulting in a domain with size of 300 mm 180 mm 11 mm held in place by two acrylic separators with honeycomb mesh and covered by a fine fabric layer in the experiments we used glass beads with different grain sizes as porous media the first type of glass beads had a grain size in the range of 0 40 0 60 mm sigmund lindner germany and will later be referred as coarse material the second type of glass beads had a grain size of 0 07 0 11 mm sigmund lindner germany and will be referred as fine material a total of eleven experiments were performed in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media the homogeneous experiments were carried out by filling uniformly the chamber with a given grain size whereas in the heterogeneous experiments the two grain sizes were used in simple geometric configurations consisting of a 50 mm 50 mm inclusion of the fine grain material in the surrounding coarse medium and vice versa in another set of experiments i e an inclusion of coarse grains within a fine matrix the experiments were performed under different hydrochemical conditions and in particular different ph values were established in the background pore water electrolyte solution to vary the magnitude and impact of electroosmosis in the setup the set of experiments included both conservative and reactive transport the tracer allura red was employed in the conservative transport tests whereas permanganate was injected in the reactive experiments in which glucose was considered as a proxy of an uncharged organic contaminant and was initially present only in the embedded inclusion a summary of the performed ek experiments and tested conditions is provided in table 1 additional information regarding details of the experimental setup can be found in the supplementary material section s1 the ek experiments were conducted applying a constant electric potential 200 v from a power supply ea elektro automatik ea psi 5200 10a germany to a pair of graphite rod electrodes ø6 300 mm elektrokul denmark which were immersed in the two reservoirs outside the porous medium at a distance of 400 mm between each other to buffer the electrolysis reactions at the electrodes a closed recirculation system was set up in each reservoir and the water was recirculated in two sealed external reservoirs of 2 l before being reinjected in proximity of the electrodes the recirculation was performed continuously during the ek experiments at a flowrate of 20 ml min using two channels of a multi channel peristaltic pump shenchen china a wet packing procedure of the porous media was applied consisting in successively filling the setup with water and glass beads to avoid gas entrapment in the heterogeneous setups the inclusion was embedded by filling a uniform layer of glass beads until 35 mm from the bottom and then placing a 3d printed separator open at the top in which glass beads with different grain size were poured until reaching a height of 50 mm with the separator in place the sides of the inclusion were gradually filled with the same glass beads used for the bottom layer once the glass beads reached the same level of the glass beads within the inclusion the separator was carefully removed and the packing procedure completed before the start of the experiments the water level in the reservoirs was adjusted so that the initial level was 131 mm from the bottom of the porous media during the experiments the change in water level was assessed by means of measuring tapes in each reservoir chamber the electric potential drop was measured with a multimeter peaktech 3315 germany using metallic wires with exposed metal tips placed in the porous medium at a distance of 280 mm and at a depth of 5 mm below the water table the current in the system was measured with another multimeter peaktech 3315 germany connected between the anode and the power supply values of voltage and current were recorded every hour for all experiments and are reported in the supplementary material table s1 conservative transport experiments were performed by injecting 8 ml of a 3 mm solution of allura red sigma aldrich germany this red color tracer is completely dissociated in aqueous solution and has a negative divalent charge the injection was performed on the left side of the domain 75 mm from the bottom of the porous medium and transport was assessed recording the movement of the plume over time with a camera nikon d300 with lens af s nikkor 50 mm f 1 4 g taking pictures every minute at a resolution of 4288 2848 pixels to optimize the picture quality the exposure time was set to 4 s the aperture to 16 the iso to 200 and the white balance to 5000 k to ensure constant lighting conditions all the experiments were conducted in a dark room where the setup was illuminated from the front with a light bulb 4000 k 806 lm 100 ma 9 5 w philips netherlands and from the back with an electroluminescent panel 1000 mm 300 mm el technik germany besides the ek experiments summarized in table 1 also advection dispersion reactive transport experiments were performed in the heterogeneous domain and their outcome were used to compare plume displacement reactant mixing and degradation between hydraulic driven and electrokinetic driven transport for the reactive experiments a solution of potassium permanganate kmno4 sigma aldrich germany was used permanganate has a clearly visible purple color and was injected with the same procedure adopted for the conservative tracer 8 ml 3 mm the set of reactive experiments investigated transport in a heterogeneous porous medium with a coarse matrix and an embedded inclusion of fine material 8 ml of an 8 mm glucose solution were injected in the middle of the inclusion before starting the experiments to mimic an organic contaminant initially trapped in the low permeability zone fig s1 as background electrolytes we selected two different buffer solutions the first solution consisted of a carbonate bicarbonate buffer sigma aldrich united states with a resulting ph of 9 the second solution was obtained with a kcl hcl buffer sigma aldrich united states with a ph 2 5 this range of ph values was selected to induce significant differences in terms of zeta potential at the grain surfaces thus resulting in different electroosmotic permeabilities hu et al 2019 vane and zang 1997 virkutyte et al 2002 for the advection dispersion reactive transport experiments a hydraulic flow was established using a peristaltic pump shenchen china to recirculate water from the right to the left reservoirs the flowrate was adjusted to achieve a seepage velocity of approximately 6 5 cm h comparable to the migration velocity in the electrokinetic experiments 3 theoretical background 3 1 flow equations the governing equation for water flow in saturated porous media reads as bear 1979 1 s s h t q g where s s 1 m is the specific storage h m is the hydraulic head g 1 s represents a volumetric source sink term and q m s is the total water flux upon the application of an external electric field the total water flux is given by the sum of the hydraulic flux q h m s and the electroosmotic flux q eo m s 2 q q eo q h the hydraulic flux is described by darcy s law and it is proportional to the hydraulic gradient h 3 q h k h h where the proportionality constant k h m s is the hydraulic conductivity in analogy the electroosmotic flux is proportional to the electric potential gradient φ v m and the electroosmotic conductivity k eo m2 v s is the proportionality constant jacobs and probstein 1996 4 q eo k e o φ eqs 2 4 indicate that the hydraulic and electroosmotic flows are strictly related and that the fluid flux is indeed dependent on both hydraulic and electric gradients to investigate the relevance of these mechanisms during electrokinetics we can consider as an example the setup in fig 1a b which represents a system where an electric potential is applied through electrodes across a porous medium in this case water can move from the reservoirs to the porous medium while the overall mass of water is conserved in the system with an equal water level in the two reservoirs h 0 m the resulting initial hydraulic gradient is null fig 1a however the electric potential gradient generates an electroosmotic flow that given the negative surface charges of the porous medium displaces the fluid from the anode right towards the cathode left during this transient behavior the water in the anode reservoir decreases and the water level in the cathode reservoir increases as a result a hydraulic gradient develops in the system over time which opposes the electroosmotic flux until an equilibrium is reached fig 1b in such case the electroosmotic flow equals the hydraulic flow and the water level in the reservoirs does not change anymore with time as long as the electric potential is maintained considering the system at equilibrium q h q eo combining eqs 3 and 4 it is possible to derive the hydraulic gradient which ensures equilibrium with the given electroosmotic flow 5 h k e o φ k h here it is important to note that while k h can range over several orders of magnitude depending on the porous medium from 10 10 m s for clays to 10 1 m s for clean sands and gravels the electroosmotic coefficient is in the order of 10 9 m2 v s and varies at most a couple of orders of magnitudes with the soil type mitchell and soga 2005 pandey and rajesh 2019 reynolds et al 2008 for instance when φ is 100 v m for sandy soils the predicted h is in the order of 10 3 m m and for soils with hydraulic conductivities lower than 1 10 7 m s the predicted h is higher than 1 m m indeed the higher the electric potential applied the higher the resulting h to ensure equilibrium in case heterogeneities are present in the porous media the flow field can be impacted by differences in hydraulic conductivities also during electrokinetics to assist with the identification of the dominant flow and transport mechanisms in heterogeneous systems we introduce here the electroosmotic hydraulic velocity ratio defined as 6 η e o h u e o u h u e o u h in which u e o q e o n m s is the electroosmotic velocity with n the porosity and u h q h n m s is the average hydraulic flow velocity in eq 6 η e o h tends to 1 in presence of only electroosmotic flow similarly to fig 1a to a value of 1 in case of only hydraulic flow and to 0 in case of equilibrium between electroosmotic and hydraulic velocities fig 1b 3 2 reactive transport equations the transport of charged species in saturated porous media during electrokinetics is described by the nernst planck equation newman and thomas alyea 2004a rasouli et al 2015 sprocati and rolle 2020 7 j i t o t n d i c

mass conservation for each species reads as 8 n c i t j i t o t r i in which r i mol m3 s is the source sink term the poisson s equation assuming null charge density is 9 2 φ 0 and regulates the

case of absence of electromigration and 0 when the electromigration velocity is equal to the total water velocity besides the governing flow and transport processes described above based on the nernst planck poisson equations geochemical reactions were included in the conceptual and numerical model the reaction network included equilibrium speciation reactions for the main ionic species as well as a complete irreversible bimolecular kinetics to describe the oxidation of glucose by permanganate in the reactive transport experiments 13 r mn o 4 k r mn o 4 c mn o 4 c c 6 h 12 o 6 where k r m n o 4 m3 s mol is the kinetic rate constant in this study the primary variables are the concentrations of the n species the electric potential and the hydraulic head the flow and transport equations governing electrokinetic transport are coupled through the electric potential the hydraulic flux and the fluxes of charged species the solution of such system of coupled equations requires an iterative approach the simulation of the conservative and reactive experiments performed in this study was carried out with the code np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 this numerical simulator is a coupling between comsol multiphysics and phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 implemented in a matlab interface muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 rolle et al 2018 np phreeqc ek uses a sequential non iterative operator split approach in which transport and reactions occur sequentially such approach provides great flexibility in modeling electrokinetic transport processes and geochemical reactions in multidimensional domains the models implemented in this study use a triangular mesh with 14 000 elements as illustrated in fig s2 the simulated aqueous species were different depending on the background electrolytes and the injected tracers used in the different conservative and reactive transport experiments all model parameters and input values are provided in the supplementary material specifically electric potentials applied at the boundaries of the domain are reported in table s1 whereas the input concentrations of all simulated scenarios are presented in table s3 table s4 provides an overview of the species considered in the simulations with their respective aqueous diffusion coefficients information about the grain size and porosity of the porous media is provided in table s5 finally table s6 includes further parameters such as tortuosity hydraulic conductivity electroosmotic coefficients and zeta potential values 4 results and discussion experiments were performed in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media in each setup the experiments were repeated considering high and low ph values to vary the magnitude of the electroosmotic flow here we discuss the results obtained in the heterogeneous setups whereas the outcomes of the homogeneous experiments and the value of the key transport properties determined for the coarse and fine grain sizes are reported in the supplementary material section s3 and tables s5 and s6 4 1 conservative transport experiments in heterogeneous porous media in the first set of heterogeneous experiments we investigated electrokinetic transport of allura red in a coarse porous medium with a low permeability inclusion considering a background electrolyte solution at a ph 9 hetc 3 1 as shown in fig 2 a the plume of allura red is transported with time towards the anode on the right and when the plume reaches the zone with the fine material it does not penetrate and circumvents the low permeability inclusion when the experiment was repeated in the same porous medium but at lower ph hetc 3 2 the observed plume behavior was significantly different in fact once the tracer reaches the low permeability inclusion the plume penetrates inside the inclusion and covers most of its area by the end of the experiment fig 2b the different transport behavior can be attributed to the different electroosmotic flows generated in the low permeability inclusion at different ph rodier and dodds 1995 which oppose the transport by electromigration of the negatively charged solute in fact when the ph is lower the electroosmotic flow is smaller and the tracer is able to penetrate more effectively within the inclusion the second set of heterogeneous experiments was performed in a fine porous medium matrix with a coarse inclusion for the case of background electrolytes with high ph hetc 4 1 we observed that the transport of allura red is retarded at initial times when the plume is in the low permeability matrix with respect to the previous heterogeneous experiments fig 3 a such behavior is due to the electroosmotic flow which is in the opposite direction with respect to the electromigration transport similarly to the homogeneous experiments with fine glass beads homc 2 1 fig s3c also in this case a high difference in water levels in the reservoirs was observed fig 3c such difference increases with higher rate at the beginning of the experiment indicating a higher net water flow in the direction of the cathode driven by electroosmosis and decreases with time as water accumulates in the cathode reservoir thus approaching equilibrium with the establishing hydraulic gradient considering the transport of allura red when the plume reaches the coarse inclusion it penetrates and travels within the coarse porous medium where electromigration is counteracted only by a small electroosmotic flow comparing such experiment with the one performed in the same porous medium but at a lower ph hetc 4 2 it can be observed that in the latter case the plume travels faster deforms less and not all tracer is focused in the inclusion fig 3b the difference in the plume displacement and deformation at different ph is another evidence of the impact of electroosmotic flow on the electromigration dominated transport of allura red towards the anode such effect is considerably reduced at low ph of the electrolyte background and in this case smaller differences in the water levels were also observed in the electrode reservoirs fig 3d the process based model is able to reproduce the results of the experiments in terms of the evolution of the tracer plume at different times figs 2 and 3 and allows the analysis of the underlying mechanisms controlling the observed plume behavior under the different physical and chemical conditions tested the model also allowed us to capture the water levels measured in the cathodic and anodic chambers at different times with good accuracy rmse of 0 3 and 0 6 mm for the cathode and anode reservoirs respectively in hetc 4 1 and rmse of 0 4 and 1 3 mm in hetc 4 2 fig 4 illustrates the different mechanisms governing the transport patterns in the heterogeneous cases after 120 min from the beginning of the experiments for all four heterogeneous scenarios the electric potential gradient φ varies from 550 to 300 v m fig 4a d spatial differences especially in proximity of the injection area arise from the different conductivities of the electrolytes at the initial time which in turn affect locally the electric potential gradient sprocati et al 2021 sprocati and rolle 2020 this is more evident for the two experiments conducted at low ph as a result of the differences between injection conductivity and electrolyte background conductivity regarding the total velocity of the tracer u a r t o t for case hetc 3 1 the second row of fig 4 allows us to interpret the observed behavior of the allura red plume around the inclusion considering the total sum of the velocity components affecting the transport the behavior of hetc 3 1 is indeed different from scenario hetc 3 2 in which the total velocity of the tracer is higher inside the injection and some streamlines also enter the low permeability zone in the experiment hetc 4 1 the total velocities have the greatest magnitude inside the inclusion and the lowest values in the matrix surrounding the inclusion finally in scenario hetc 4 2 at low ph the total velocity distribution changes less abruptly compared to hetc 4 1 especially close to the inclusion in the following we analyze in detail the behavior of the different transport terms eq 7 neglecting the contribution of diffusive flux which during ek is several orders of magnitude smaller than the electromigration flux sprocati et al 2019 the third row in fig 4 shows the electromigration velocities u a r m i g in all tested scenarios these velocity components do no show substantial spatial differences in the domain and are not much affected by the heterogeneous inclusions such behavior is due to the direct dependence of electromigration on the electric potential gradient and the tortuosity analyzing the total water flow velocity u fourth row in fig 4 it is possible to note that it is null in broad portions of the domains indicating that there is a balance between the electroosmotic u e o and the hydraulic u h flows in the system the latter originating from the induced water level difference at the reservoirs in addition we can notice two distinct patterns between the two types of heterogeneous systems in case of the fine inclusion hetc 3 1 and hetc 3 2 there is a water flow that originates from the inclusion and dissipates in the coarser matrix as the magnitude of the total water velocity is comparable with the electromigration velocity and as also shown by the computed streamlines a zone of clockwise recirculating flow develops in the domain such flow pattern strongly affects solute transport and results in the bilobed plume observed in fig 2a in the domain with the coarse inclusion in the finer matrix hetc 4 1 and hetc 4 2 the path of water flow is different and shows a recirculation near the upper and lower edges of the inclusion besides the different location also the direction of the recirculation zones is different compared to het 3 1 and het 3 2 since now counterclockwise rotation is observed to identify the origin of the recirculation patterns we need to consider the contribution of the electroosmotic flow and the hydraulic flow the electroosmotic velocity u e o in the system does not show important spatial variations in all scenarios fifth row in fig 4 and has a distribution similar to the electromigration flux however the intensity is dependent on the ph as it directly influences the electroosmotic coefficient therefore the electroosmotic velocity is stronger in scenarios with background electrolytes at high ph considering the hydraulic velocity u h we can observe significant differences between the different heterogeneous scenarios sixth row in fig 4 as a result of the hydraulic conductivity that is more than thirty times larger in the coarse glass beads the computed distribution of the hydraulic velocity shows that close to the edges of the domain its magnitude is equal to the electroosmotic velocity but its direction is opposite this means that the system is in equilibrium with zero net water fluxes across the boundaries and no change in water levels at the reservoirs in scenario hetc 3 1 the hydraulic velocity is larger above and below the inclusion as a result of the low hydraulic conductivity of the inclusion indeed the hydraulic velocity in such areas is smaller in case of a lower background ph hetc 3 2 as the electroosmotic flow at equilibrium is smaller in the case with coarse inclusion in the fine matrix and high ph hetc 4 1 the hydraulic velocity is larger in the high permeability inclusion superimposing the hydraulic velocity to the electroosmotic velocity results in a recirculating flow around the edges of the inclusion which can explain the behavior of the water flow discussed above similar results can also be observed for hetc 4 2 in which a smaller hydraulic flow is due to the reduced effect of electroosmosis generated in the system by lowering the ph with the metric η e o h it is possible to assess which flow component dominates in the system the plots on the seventh row of fig 4 illustrate that in all scenarios there is a flow balance η e o h 0 in broad areas of the porous matrix due to the hydraulic contact and dynamic equilibrium between the porous media and the electrode reservoirs however when considering cases hetc 3 1 and hetc 3 2 in the inclusion the value of η e o h is close to 1 indicating that in such zone the flow is dominated by electroosmosis above and below the inclusion the hydraulic flow dominates and η e o h assumes negative values considering scenarios hetc 4 1 and hetc 4 2 the evaluation of η e o h indicates that the flow inside the inclusion is dominated by the hydraulic flow η e o h 0 whereas on the outside matrix above and below the inclusion the flow is dominated by electroosmosis η e o h 0 the governing transport mechanisms can be also evaluated using the other metric introduced in section 3 the electromigration advective velocity ratio η m i g a r a d v the plots in the last row of fig 4 indicate that for all cases electromigration is the main transport mechanism of the tracer far from the inclusion where η m i g a r a d v is close to 1 considering the scenarios with high ph hetc 3 1 and hetc 4 1 η m i g a r a d v is close to 0 in the inclusion suggesting that in such areas the advective flow field is comparable to the electromigration velocity considering the experiments performed at low ph hetc 3 2 and hetc 4 2 the values of η m i g a r a d v in the domain are positive numbers suggesting that the governing transport mechanism is electromigration also in the inclusion the analysis of the fluxes ultimately highlights that there are strong coupling effects between the electroosmotic flow and the hydraulic flow and that the understanding of such effects and their interplay with the prevailing electromigration flux is fundamental to interpret the observed plume patterns 4 2 reactive transport experiments reactive transport was investigated in a heterogeneous porous medium consisting of a coarse matrix with embedded a fine material inclusion the aim of these experiments was to evaluate the delivery of permanganate and its capability to oxidize an organic compound glucose initially trapped in the low permeability inclusion we performed three different experiments a first case in which permanganate transport occurred only by advection dispersion in a hydraulic driven flow hetr 5 1 and two cases of electrokinetically driven transport with high hetr 5 2 and low hetr 5 3 ph background electrolyte solutions for the case of advective dispersive transport hetr 5 1 fig 5 a shows that permanganate moves with the water flow and when it encounters the low permeability inclusion the plume defocuses due to the divergent flow around the inclusion the reactant is transported in the coarse porous medium and bypasses the fine material zone in this experiment oxidation products brow yellow color associated with the reaction between permanganate and glucose can be observed only at the thin fringe of the permanganate plume for the cases of ek induced transport the behavior of permanganate is different from the advective dispersive transport in the experiment with high ph background hetr 5 2 similarly to the conservative case hetc 3 1 the electroosmotic flow in the inclusion is high and results in an electroosmotic velocity in the same order of the electromigration velocity fig 5b the opposite effects of the two electrokinetic transport processes in the low permeability inclusion limit the penetration of permanganate within this zone and the plume is mainly transported in the coarse material around the inclusion by the dominant electromigration towards the anode in this case some oxidation products are clearly noticeable after 120 min on the left side of the inclusion in the coarse porous medium the experiment conducted with a low ph background electrolyte indeed shows a different pattern now the effect of electroosmosis is minimal and permanganate can penetrate and migrate effectively through the low permeability inclusion fig 5c in this experiment reaction products are visible both on the left side and within the low permeability inclusion the use of a process based model accounting for ek transport and reaction kinetics is essential to consider all the complex interactions occurring simultaneously during the experiments and to understand the contribution of the different mechanisms to the observed reactive transport behavior fig 5d f shows that the model reproduces well the displacement and spatial distribution of the permanganate plumes observed in all reactive transport experiments the numerical simulations also allow visualizing the behavior of glucose such uncharged organic compound initially injected in the low permeability zone can only be transported with the fluid flow therefore in the advective dispersive scenario glucose almost does not move due to the defocusing of the hydraulic flow around the inclusion fig 5g and only a small fraction of the glucose mass diffuses towards the coarse matrix considering the spatial distribution of the reaction rate fig 5j it can be observed that mixing between permanganate and glucose only occurs in a small portion of the domain the reaction is thus limited by the slow diffusive dispersive mixing resulting in a slow removal of glucose from the system in case of ek transport within the heterogeneous system with high background ph hetr 5 2 the model reproduces well the transport of permanganate fig 5e in this case the charge neutral compound is not immobile but it is effectively displaced towards the cathode and exits the low permeability inclusion as a result of electroosmosis fig 5h due to the opposite transport direction between the permanganate and glucose the contact between the two reactants is effective and results in a wide area in which the mixing controled reaction occurs fig 5k and the reaction rates are at least three orders of magnitude higher compared to the advection dispersion case for the final case of ek transport with low ph background concentration hetr 5 3 the migration of the permanganate plume is less impacted by the low permeability inclusion fig 5f glucose appears to be displaced more slowly from the low permeability zone fig 5i due to the minor electroosmotic flow which also favored the penetration of permanganate within the inclusion in fact with this pore water composition electromigration is dominant and less countered by electroosmotic flow in the fine material inclusion in this experiment the mixing area is also significantly larger than in case hetr 5 1 fig 5l and its location is different compared to the other ek transport case hetr 5 2 to evaluate the degradation efficiency in the different reactive transport experiments we computed the relative mass of permanganate in the system at different times with respect to the mass at the beginning of the experiment the results are illustrated in fig 6 and show that for the advection dispersion scenario hetr 5 1 after 120 min more than 99 of permanganate was still present in the domain conversely for the ek transport scenarios we observe a larger extent of reaction in the system in both hetr 5 2 and hetr 5 3 the reaction starts when the permanganate contacts the organic compound such mixing of the reactants is anticipated at high ph hetr 5 2 since the higher electroosmotic flow is more effective in displacing glucose towards the cathode and the approaching permanganate plume a high consumption rate lasts until 80 min from the beginning of the experiments a similar degradation efficiency is observed in both ek transport cases with a remaining permanganate mass in the system of 86 for hetr 5 2 and 87 for hetr 5 3 at the end of the experiments these reactive transport experiments highlight the radically different transport dynamics during electrokinetics which greatly enhance the mixing and mixing limited reaction between a negatively charged reactant and an uncharged organic compound such different transport and mixing processes lead to increased degradation efficiencies compared to analogous settings relying exclusively on advective dispersive mass transfer moreover these experiments show that the distribution of the reactants and the active reactive zones are not trivial to understand and predict in heterogeneous systems since they depend on the patterns of physical heterogeneity on the pore water chemistry and consequently on the spatially variable distribution of electroosmotic fluxes 5 conclusions in this study we performed a fundamental experimental and model based investigation of electrokinetic transport mechanisms in heterogeneous porous media the following points summarize the major findings of our work importance of physical heterogeneity during ek transport and complex interplay between the dominant flow and solute mass transfer mechanisms of advection electroosmosis and electromigration the interaction between hydraulic fluxes results in spatially variable velocity fields and in water recirculation patterns that greatly impact the overall electrokinetic transport the displacement and spatial distribution of charged tracer plumes depend on the dominant ek transport mechanisms as well as on their interaction with the chemistry of the pore water solution the latter is important not only for the delivery and electrostatic interactions of the tracer in the pore water but also for its strong impact on the magnitude and spatial distribution of electroosmotic fluxes reactive transport and contaminant degradation can follow complex patterns in heterogeneous porous media the interaction between the different mass transfer processes determines the mixing between reactants the location and spatial distribution of reaction hotspots and ultimately the effectiveness of contaminant removal during electrokinetics a charged reactant might not even need to enter a low permeability zone to contact and react with an uncharged organic compound as the electroosmotic flow can help displacing the latter from the low permeability inclusion and favor its mixing with the delivered reactant conversely if the uncharged organic compound is sorbed within a low permeability zone it might be difficult for the charged reactant to come into contact with such target compound importance of process based multidimensional numerical simulations to understand and interpret the experiments and the observed patterns of the tracer plumes in the different experiments the process based model also illuminates the reactive transport behavior and helped visualizing and quantifying the evolution of the different reactants the location and magnitude of the reactive zones and the degradation efficiency despite the simplified physical and geochemical conditions considered in the experiments the outcomes of this work have important practical implications in the field of electrokinetic transport and remediation in fact understanding the interplay of electromigration and electroosmosis in heterogeneous porous media will help upscaling electokinetic remediation approaches important practical

16232,electrokinetic techniques represent a valuable approach to enhance solute transport reactant delivery and contaminant degradation in complex environmental matrices such as contaminated soil and groundwater and have a great potential for the remediation of many organic and inorganic pollutants this study investigates the complex interplay between the key electrokinetic transport mechanisms electromigration and electroosmosis in physically heterogeneous porous media and its impact on tracer distribution reactant mixing and degradation efficiency we perform experiments in a multidimensional setup considering different types of heterogeneities injected tracers and reactants as well as background electrolyte pore water with different chemical composition and ph we show that ek transport is significantly affected by the physical heterogeneities due to the interaction between electrokinetic and hydraulic processes and by the pore water chemistry that plays a key role on the magnitude and spatial distribution of electroosmotic fluxes the latter affect the overall transport of charged and non charged species including the migration velocity of injected plumes their spatial patterns spreading and mixing with the background groundwater and the extent of degradation and the spatio temporal evolution of reactive zones in the heterogeneous porous media process based numerical modeling allowed us to interpret the experimental observations and to disentangle the coupled effects of physical chemical and electrostatic processes in the multidimensional heterogeneous setups besides elucidating the mechanisms controlling electrokinetic transport the results of this study have also important implications for practical field implementation of ek approaches in intrinsically heterogeneous subsurface systems keywords electrokinetic remediation electromigration electroosmosis heterogeneous porous media contaminant degradation reactive transport modeling 1 introduction electrokinetic ek techniques rely on the application of electric fields in electrolyte solutions to promote electrochemical reactions and to enhance solute transport ek approaches have been used in different fields of science and engineering ranging from water treatment tian et al 2021 microfluidic applications alizadeh et al 2021 and resource recovery martens et al 2021 in the context of environmental applications electrokinetics has been studied for its potential of electrokinetic remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater ribeiro and prasad 2021 which consists in using electrodes establishing electric fields in the ground to enhance transport mechanisms in the subsurface reddy and cameselle 2009 a unique advantage of ek driven transport is the possibility to ensure effective reactant delivery in poorly accessible low permeability porous media where pollutants are often trapped and represent long term sources of groundwater contamination brooks et al 2021 chapman and parker 2005 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 ek technologies rely on two phenomena that determine the displacement of solutes in pore water i electromigration consisting in the transport of charged species towards the electrode of opposite charge acar and alshawabkeh 1993 probstein and hicks 1993 and ii electroosmosis involving the movement of water from the mobilization of the excess of charge in the double layer for negatively charged porous media which are typical in subsurface formations electroosmosis results in a net water flux from the anode towards the cathode alizadeh et al 2014 yustres et al 2020 electrokinetic techniques have been mostly tested in laboratory experiments however a few recent studies have shown first field applications for groundwater remediation at pilot scale czinnerová et al 2020 head et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 sprocati et al 2020 ek approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing contaminant mobilization cappello et al 2019 kim et al 2012 lópez vizcaíno et al 2017 yeung and gu 2011 in delivering amendments to stimulate microbial activity gill et al 2014 wick et al 2004 as well as oxidants or reductants for chemical transformation chowdhury et al 2017a head et al 2020 hodges et al 2013 ren et al 2014 electrokinetics is a versatile approach and is considered a suitable and promising technology for in situ remediation of many pollutants including organic contaminants czinnerová et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 ottosen et al 2019 radionuclides purkis et al 2021 and heavy metals wang et al 2021 an important aspect that has been extensively studied for natural groundwater flow and transport but has received considerably less attention in the context of ek applications is the role of subsurface heterogeneity geologic formations are inherently heterogeneous and the spatial distribution of physical chiogna et al 2015 jung and navarre sitchler 2018 steefel et al 2005 sudicky and illman 2011 ye et al 2015 and chemical battistel et al 2019 li et al 2014 heterogeneities have a dramatic impact on solute transport mixing and reactions at different scales rolle and le borgne 2019 valocchi et al 2019 only a few studies investigated electrokinetic transport in heterogeneous media and showed that ek can ensure significant transport velocities also in low permeability matrices chowdhury et al 2017b gill et al 2016 reynolds et al 2008 although less sensitive to heterogeneity compared to advective dispersive transport ek mass transfer processes are still strongly and non trivially impacted by the spatial distribution of porous media permeability the investigation of these effects has received little attention but is of great importance to improve the understanding of electrokinetic transport and to upscale ek remediation approaches from the laboratory to the field this study aims to address such research gap by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between the different flow and transport processes occurring upon the application of an electric field in heterogeneous porous media we performed a series of controled electrokinetic experiments in a multidimensional laboratory setup the experiments considered porous media with different heterogeneous configurations and hydrochemical conditions and explored the interaction between electroosmosis and electromigration for both conservative and reactive transport the main focus is the investigation of the interplay between physical and chemical processes and their impact on tracer displacement reactant delivery degradation efficiency and spatial distribution of reactive zones during ek transport in heterogeneous porous media process based reactive transport modeling was performed to enable the understanding and the interpretation of the coupled flow and transport patterns observed in the different experiments the key processes described in the numerical simulations of the different heterogeneous systems include fluid flow with electroosmosis and hydraulic terms multicomponent solute transport coulombic interactions between charged species in pore water and geochemical reactions 2 materials and methods the experiments were conducted in a quasi two dimensional setup illustrated in fig 1 consisting of a tempered glass chamber of inner size 795 mm 182 mm 11 mm rolle et al 2022 sprocati et al 2021 the setup was held by an aluminum frame and the metal part between the glass panels was covered by a polyethylene layer the porous media were packed in the central part of the system resulting in a domain with size of 300 mm 180 mm 11 mm held in place by two acrylic separators with honeycomb mesh and covered by a fine fabric layer in the experiments we used glass beads with different grain sizes as porous media the first type of glass beads had a grain size in the range of 0 40 0 60 mm sigmund lindner germany and will later be referred as coarse material the second type of glass beads had a grain size of 0 07 0 11 mm sigmund lindner germany and will be referred as fine material a total of eleven experiments were performed in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media the homogeneous experiments were carried out by filling uniformly the chamber with a given grain size whereas in the heterogeneous experiments the two grain sizes were used in simple geometric configurations consisting of a 50 mm 50 mm inclusion of the fine grain material in the surrounding coarse medium and vice versa in another set of experiments i e an inclusion of coarse grains within a fine matrix the experiments were performed under different hydrochemical conditions and in particular different ph values were established in the background pore water electrolyte solution to vary the magnitude and impact of electroosmosis in the setup the set of experiments included both conservative and reactive transport the tracer allura red was employed in the conservative transport tests whereas permanganate was injected in the reactive experiments in which glucose was considered as a proxy of an uncharged organic contaminant and was initially present only in the embedded inclusion a summary of the performed ek experiments and tested conditions is provided in table 1 additional information regarding details of the experimental setup can be found in the supplementary material section s1 the ek experiments were conducted applying a constant electric potential 200 v from a power supply ea elektro automatik ea psi 5200 10a germany to a pair of graphite rod electrodes ø6 300 mm elektrokul denmark which were immersed in the two reservoirs outside the porous medium at a distance of 400 mm between each other to buffer the electrolysis reactions at the electrodes a closed recirculation system was set up in each reservoir and the water was recirculated in two sealed external reservoirs of 2 l before being reinjected in proximity of the electrodes the recirculation was performed continuously during the ek experiments at a flowrate of 20 ml min using two channels of a multi channel peristaltic pump shenchen china a wet packing procedure of the porous media was applied consisting in successively filling the setup with water and glass beads to avoid gas entrapment in the heterogeneous setups the inclusion was embedded by filling a uniform layer of glass beads until 35 mm from the bottom and then placing a 3d printed separator open at the top in which glass beads with different grain size were poured until reaching a height of 50 mm with the separator in place the sides of the inclusion were gradually filled with the same glass beads used for the bottom layer once the glass beads reached the same level of the glass beads within the inclusion the separator was carefully removed and the packing procedure completed before the start of the experiments the water level in the reservoirs was adjusted so that the initial level was 131 mm from the bottom of the porous media during the experiments the change in water level was assessed by means of measuring tapes in each reservoir chamber the electric potential drop was measured with a multimeter peaktech 3315 germany using metallic wires with exposed metal tips placed in the porous medium at a distance of 280 mm and at a depth of 5 mm below the water table the current in the system was measured with another multimeter peaktech 3315 germany connected between the anode and the power supply values of voltage and current were recorded every hour for all experiments and are reported in the supplementary material table s1 conservative transport experiments were performed by injecting 8 ml of a 3 mm solution of allura red sigma aldrich germany this red color tracer is completely dissociated in aqueous solution and has a negative divalent charge the injection was performed on the left side of the domain 75 mm from the bottom of the porous medium and transport was assessed recording the movement of the plume over time with a camera nikon d300 with lens af s nikkor 50 mm f 1 4 g taking pictures every minute at a resolution of 4288 2848 pixels to optimize the picture quality the exposure time was set to 4 s the aperture to 16 the iso to 200 and the white balance to 5000 k to ensure constant lighting conditions all the experiments were conducted in a dark room where the setup was illuminated from the front with a light bulb 4000 k 806 lm 100 ma 9 5 w philips netherlands and from the back with an electroluminescent panel 1000 mm 300 mm el technik germany besides the ek experiments summarized in table 1 also advection dispersion reactive transport experiments were performed in the heterogeneous domain and their outcome were used to compare plume displacement reactant mixing and degradation between hydraulic driven and electrokinetic driven transport for the reactive experiments a solution of potassium permanganate kmno4 sigma aldrich germany was used permanganate has a clearly visible purple color and was injected with the same procedure adopted for the conservative tracer 8 ml 3 mm the set of reactive experiments investigated transport in a heterogeneous porous medium with a coarse matrix and an embedded inclusion of fine material 8 ml of an 8 mm glucose solution were injected in the middle of the inclusion before starting the experiments to mimic an organic contaminant initially trapped in the low permeability zone fig s1 as background electrolytes we selected two different buffer solutions the first solution consisted of a carbonate bicarbonate buffer sigma aldrich united states with a resulting ph of 9 the second solution was obtained with a kcl hcl buffer sigma aldrich united states with a ph 2 5 this range of ph values was selected to induce significant differences in terms of zeta potential at the grain surfaces thus resulting in different electroosmotic permeabilities hu et al 2019 vane and zang 1997 virkutyte et al 2002 for the advection dispersion reactive transport experiments a hydraulic flow was established using a peristaltic pump shenchen china to recirculate water from the right to the left reservoirs the flowrate was adjusted to achieve a seepage velocity of approximately 6 5 cm h comparable to the migration velocity in the electrokinetic experiments 3 theoretical background 3 1 flow equations the governing equation for water flow in saturated porous media reads as bear 1979 1 s s h t q g where s s 1 m is the specific storage h m is the hydraulic head g 1 s represents a volumetric source sink term and q m s is the total water flux upon the application of an external electric field the total water flux is given by the sum of the hydraulic flux q h m s and the electroosmotic flux q eo m s 2 q q eo q h the hydraulic flux is described by darcy s law and it is proportional to the hydraulic gradient h 3 q h k h h where the proportionality constant k h m s is the hydraulic conductivity in analogy the electroosmotic flux is proportional to the electric potential gradient φ v m and the electroosmotic conductivity k eo m2 v s is the proportionality constant jacobs and probstein 1996 4 q eo k e o φ eqs 2 4 indicate that the hydraulic and electroosmotic flows are strictly related and that the fluid flux is indeed dependent on both hydraulic and electric gradients to investigate the relevance of these mechanisms during electrokinetics we can consider as an example the setup in fig 1a b which represents a system where an electric potential is applied through electrodes across a porous medium in this case water can move from the reservoirs to the porous medium while the overall mass of water is conserved in the system with an equal water level in the two reservoirs h 0 m the resulting initial hydraulic gradient is null fig 1a however the electric potential gradient generates an electroosmotic flow that given the negative surface charges of the porous medium displaces the fluid from the anode right towards the cathode left during this transient behavior the water in the anode reservoir decreases and the water level in the cathode reservoir increases as a result a hydraulic gradient develops in the system over time which opposes the electroosmotic flux until an equilibrium is reached fig 1b in such case the electroosmotic flow equals the hydraulic flow and the water level in the reservoirs does not change anymore with time as long as the electric potential is maintained considering the system at equilibrium q h q eo combining eqs 3 and 4 it is possible to derive the hydraulic gradient which ensures equilibrium with the given electroosmotic flow 5 h k e o φ k h here it is important to note that while k h can range over several orders of magnitude depending on the porous medium from 10 10 m s for clays to 10 1 m s for clean sands and gravels the electroosmotic coefficient is in the order of 10 9 m2 v s and varies at most a couple of orders of magnitudes with the soil type mitchell and soga 2005 pandey and rajesh 2019 reynolds et al 2008 for instance when φ is 100 v m for sandy soils the predicted h is in the order of 10 3 m m and for soils with hydraulic conductivities lower than 1 10 7 m s the predicted h is higher than 1 m m indeed the higher the electric potential applied the higher the resulting h to ensure equilibrium in case heterogeneities are present in the porous media the flow field can be impacted by differences in hydraulic conductivities also during electrokinetics to assist with the identification of the dominant flow and transport mechanisms in heterogeneous systems we introduce here the electroosmotic hydraulic velocity ratio defined as 6 η e o h u e o u h u e o u h in which u

to fig 1a to a value of 1 in case of only hydraulic flow and to 0 in case of equilibrium between electroosmotic and hydraulic velocities fig 1b 3 2 reactive transport equations the transport of

planck poisson equations geochemical reactions were included in the conceptual and numerical model the reaction network included equilibrium speciation reactions for the main ionic species as well as a complete irreversible bimolecular kinetics to describe the oxidation of glucose by permanganate in the reactive transport experiments 13 r mn o 4 k r mn o 4 c mn o 4 c c 6 h 12 o 6 where k r m n o 4 m3 s mol is the kinetic rate constant in this study the primary variables are the concentrations of the n species the electric potential and the hydraulic head the flow and transport equations governing electrokinetic transport are coupled through the electric potential the hydraulic flux and the fluxes of charged species the solution of such system of coupled equations requires an iterative approach the simulation of the conservative and reactive experiments performed in this study was carried out with the code np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 this numerical simulator is a coupling between comsol multiphysics and phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 implemented in a matlab interface muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 rolle et al 2018 np phreeqc ek uses a sequential non iterative operator split approach in which transport and reactions occur sequentially such approach provides great flexibility in modeling electrokinetic transport processes and geochemical reactions in multidimensional domains the models implemented in this study use a triangular mesh with 14 000 elements as illustrated in fig s2 the simulated aqueous species were different depending on the background electrolytes and the injected tracers used in the different conservative and reactive transport experiments all model parameters and input values are provided in the supplementary material specifically electric potentials applied at the boundaries of the domain are reported in table s1 whereas the input concentrations of all simulated scenarios are presented in table s3 table s4 provides an overview of the species considered in the simulations with their respective aqueous diffusion coefficients information about the grain size and porosity of the porous media is provided in table s5 finally table s6 includes further parameters such as tortuosity hydraulic conductivity electroosmotic coefficients and zeta potential values 4 results and discussion experiments were performed in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media in each setup the experiments were repeated considering high and low ph values to vary the magnitude of the electroosmotic flow here we discuss the results obtained in the heterogeneous setups whereas the outcomes of the homogeneous experiments and the value of the key transport properties determined for the coarse and fine grain sizes are reported in the supplementary material section s3 and tables s5 and s6 4 1 conservative transport experiments in heterogeneous porous media in the first set of heterogeneous experiments we investigated electrokinetic transport of allura red in a coarse porous medium with a low permeability inclusion considering a background electrolyte solution at a ph 9 hetc 3 1 as shown in fig 2 a the plume of allura red is transported with time towards the anode on the right and when the plume reaches the zone with the fine material it does not penetrate and circumvents the low permeability inclusion when the experiment was repeated in the same porous medium but at lower ph hetc 3 2 the observed plume behavior was significantly different in fact once the tracer reaches the low permeability inclusion the plume penetrates inside the inclusion and covers most of its area by the end of the experiment fig 2b the different transport behavior can be attributed to the different electroosmotic flows generated in the low permeability inclusion at different ph rodier and dodds 1995 which oppose the transport by electromigration of the negatively charged solute in fact when the ph is lower the electroosmotic flow is smaller and the tracer is able to penetrate more effectively within the inclusion the second set of heterogeneous experiments was performed in a fine porous medium matrix with a coarse inclusion for the case of background electrolytes with high ph hetc 4 1 we observed that the transport of allura red is retarded at initial times when the plume is in the low permeability matrix with respect to the previous heterogeneous experiments fig 3 a such behavior is due to the electroosmotic flow which is in the opposite direction with respect to the electromigration transport similarly to the homogeneous experiments with fine glass beads homc 2 1 fig s3c also in this case a high difference in water levels in the reservoirs was observed fig 3c such difference increases with higher rate at the beginning of the experiment indicating a higher net water flow in the direction of the cathode driven by electroosmosis and decreases with time as water accumulates in the cathode reservoir thus approaching equilibrium with the establishing hydraulic gradient considering the transport of allura red when the plume reaches the coarse inclusion it penetrates and travels within the coarse porous medium where electromigration is counteracted only by a small electroosmotic flow comparing such experiment with the one performed in the same porous medium but at a lower ph hetc 4 2 it can be observed that in the latter case the plume travels faster deforms less and not all tracer is focused in the inclusion fig 3b the difference in the plume displacement and deformation at different ph is another evidence of the impact of electroosmotic flow on the electromigration dominated transport of allura red towards the anode such effect is considerably reduced at low ph of the electrolyte background and in this case smaller differences in the water levels were also observed in the electrode reservoirs fig 3d the process based model is able to reproduce the results of the experiments in terms of the evolution of the tracer plume at different times figs 2 and 3 and allows the analysis of the underlying mechanisms controlling the observed plume behavior under the different physical and chemical conditions tested the model also allowed us to capture the water levels measured in the cathodic and anodic chambers at different times with good accuracy rmse of 0 3 and 0 6 mm for the cathode and anode reservoirs respectively in hetc 4 1 and rmse of 0 4 and 1 3 mm in hetc 4 2 fig 4 illustrates the different mechanisms governing the transport patterns in the heterogeneous cases after 120 min from the beginning of the experiments for all four heterogeneous scenarios the electric potential gradient φ varies from 550 to 300 v m fig 4a d spatial differences especially in proximity of the injection area arise from the different conductivities of the electrolytes at the initial time which in turn affect locally the electric potential gradient sprocati et al 2021 sprocati and rolle 2020 this is more evident for the two experiments conducted at low ph as a result of the differences between injection conductivity and electrolyte background conductivity regarding the total velocity of the tracer u a r t o t for case hetc 3 1 the second row of fig 4 allows us to interpret the observed behavior of the allura red plume around the inclusion considering the total sum of the velocity components affecting the transport the behavior of hetc 3 1 is indeed different from scenario hetc 3 2 in which the total velocity of the tracer is higher inside the injection and some streamlines also enter the low permeability zone in the experiment hetc 4 1 the total velocities have the greatest magnitude inside the inclusion and the lowest values in the matrix surrounding the inclusion finally in scenario hetc 4 2 at low ph the total velocity distribution changes less abruptly compared to hetc 4 1 especially close to the inclusion in the following we analyze in detail the behavior of the different transport terms eq 7 neglecting the contribution of diffusive flux which during ek is several orders of magnitude smaller than the electromigration flux sprocati et al 2019 the third row in fig 4 shows the electromigration velocities u a r m i g in all tested scenarios these velocity components do no show substantial spatial differences in the domain and are not much affected by the heterogeneous inclusions such behavior is due to the direct dependence of electromigration on the electric potential gradient and the tortuosity analyzing the total water flow velocity u fourth row in fig 4 it is possible to note that it is null in broad portions of the domains indicating that there is a balance between the electroosmotic u e o and the hydraulic u h flows in the system the latter originating from the induced water level difference at the reservoirs in addition we can notice two distinct patterns between the two types of heterogeneous systems in case of the fine inclusion hetc 3 1 and hetc 3 2 there is a water flow that originates from the inclusion and dissipates in the coarser matrix as the magnitude of the total water velocity is comparable with the electromigration velocity and as also shown by the computed streamlines a zone of clockwise recirculating flow develops in the domain such flow pattern strongly affects solute transport and results in the bilobed plume observed in fig 2a in the domain with the coarse inclusion in the finer matrix hetc 4 1 and hetc 4 2 the path of water flow is different and shows a recirculation near the upper and lower edges of the inclusion besides the different location also the direction of the recirculation zones is different compared to het 3 1 and het 3 2 since now counterclockwise rotation is observed to identify the origin of the recirculation patterns we need to consider the contribution of the electroosmotic flow and the hydraulic flow the electroosmotic velocity u e o in the system does not show important spatial variations in all scenarios fifth row in fig 4 and has a distribution similar to the electromigration flux however the intensity is dependent on the ph as it directly influences the electroosmotic coefficient therefore the electroosmotic velocity is stronger in scenarios with background electrolytes at high ph considering the hydraulic velocity u h we can observe significant differences between the different heterogeneous scenarios sixth row in fig 4 as a result of the hydraulic conductivity that is more than thirty times larger in the coarse glass beads the computed distribution of the hydraulic velocity shows that close to the edges of the domain its magnitude is equal to the electroosmotic velocity but its direction is opposite this means that the system is in equilibrium with zero net water fluxes across the boundaries and no change in water levels at the reservoirs in scenario hetc 3 1 the hydraulic velocity is larger above and below the inclusion as a result of the low hydraulic conductivity of the inclusion indeed the hydraulic velocity in such areas is smaller in case of a lower background ph hetc 3 2 as the electroosmotic flow at equilibrium is smaller in the case with coarse inclusion in the fine matrix and high ph hetc 4 1 the hydraulic velocity is larger in the high permeability inclusion superimposing the hydraulic velocity to the electroosmotic velocity results in a recirculating flow around the edges of the inclusion which can explain the behavior of the water flow discussed above similar results can also be observed for hetc 4 2 in which a smaller hydraulic flow is due to the reduced effect of electroosmosis generated in the system by lowering the ph with the metric η e o h it is possible to assess which flow component dominates in the system the plots on the seventh row of fig 4 illustrate that in all scenarios there is a flow balance η e o h 0 in broad areas of the porous matrix due to the hydraulic contact and dynamic equilibrium between the porous media and the electrode reservoirs however when considering cases hetc 3 1 and hetc 3 2 in the inclusion the value of η e o h is close to 1 indicating that in such zone the flow is dominated by electroosmosis above and below the inclusion the hydraulic flow dominates and η e o h assumes negative values considering scenarios hetc 4 1 and hetc 4 2 the evaluation of η e o h indicates that the flow inside the inclusion is dominated by the hydraulic flow η e o h 0 whereas on the outside matrix above and below the inclusion the flow is dominated by electroosmosis η e o h 0 the governing transport mechanisms can be also evaluated using the other metric introduced in section 3 the electromigration advective velocity ratio η m i g a r a d v the plots in the last row of fig 4 indicate that for all cases electromigration is the main transport mechanism of the tracer far from the inclusion where η m i g a r a d v is close to 1 considering the scenarios with high ph hetc 3 1 and hetc 4 1 η m i g a r a d v is close to 0 in the inclusion suggesting that in such areas the advective flow field is comparable to the electromigration velocity considering the experiments performed at low ph hetc 3 2 and hetc 4 2 the values of η m i g a r a d v in the domain are positive numbers suggesting that the governing transport mechanism is electromigration also in the inclusion the analysis of the fluxes ultimately highlights that there are strong coupling effects between the electroosmotic flow and the hydraulic flow and that the understanding of such effects and their interplay with the prevailing electromigration flux is fundamental to interpret the observed plume patterns 4 2 reactive transport experiments reactive transport was investigated in a heterogeneous porous medium consisting of a coarse matrix with embedded a fine material inclusion the aim of these experiments was to evaluate the delivery of permanganate and its capability to oxidize an organic compound glucose initially trapped in the low permeability inclusion we performed three different experiments a first case in which permanganate transport occurred only by advection dispersion in a hydraulic driven flow hetr 5 1 and two cases of electrokinetically driven transport with high hetr 5 2 and low hetr 5 3 ph background electrolyte solutions for the case of advective dispersive transport hetr 5 1 fig 5 a shows that permanganate moves with the water flow and when it encounters the low permeability inclusion the plume defocuses due to the divergent flow around the inclusion the reactant is transported in the coarse porous medium and bypasses the fine material zone in this experiment oxidation products brow yellow color associated with the reaction between permanganate and glucose can be observed only at the thin fringe of the permanganate plume for the cases of ek induced transport the behavior of permanganate is different from the advective dispersive transport in the experiment with high ph background hetr 5 2 similarly to the conservative case hetc 3 1 the electroosmotic flow in the inclusion is high and results in an electroosmotic velocity in the same order of the electromigration velocity fig 5b the opposite effects of the two electrokinetic transport processes in the low permeability inclusion limit the penetration of permanganate within this zone and the plume is mainly transported in the coarse material around the inclusion by the dominant electromigration towards the anode in this case some oxidation products are clearly noticeable after 120 min on the left side of the inclusion in the coarse porous medium the experiment conducted with a low ph background electrolyte indeed shows a different pattern now the effect of electroosmosis is minimal and permanganate can penetrate and migrate effectively through the low permeability inclusion fig 5c in this experiment reaction products are visible both on the left side and within the low permeability inclusion the use of a process based model accounting for ek transport and reaction kinetics is essential to consider all the complex interactions occurring simultaneously during the experiments and to understand the contribution of the different mechanisms to the observed reactive transport behavior fig 5d f shows that the model reproduces well the displacement and spatial distribution of the permanganate plumes observed in all reactive transport experiments the numerical simulations also allow visualizing the behavior of glucose such uncharged organic compound initially injected in the low permeability zone can only be transported with the fluid flow therefore in the advective dispersive scenario glucose almost does not move due to the defocusing of the hydraulic flow around the inclusion fig 5g and only a small fraction of the glucose mass diffuses towards the coarse matrix considering the spatial distribution of the reaction rate fig 5j it can be observed that mixing between permanganate and glucose only occurs in a small portion of the domain the reaction is thus limited by the slow diffusive dispersive mixing resulting in a slow removal of glucose from the system in case of ek transport within the heterogeneous system with high background ph hetr 5 2 the model reproduces well the transport of permanganate fig 5e in this case the charge neutral compound is not immobile but it is effectively displaced towards the cathode and exits the low permeability inclusion as a result of electroosmosis fig 5h due to the opposite transport direction between the permanganate and glucose the contact between the two reactants is effective and results in a wide area in which the mixing controled reaction occurs fig 5k and the reaction rates are at least three orders of magnitude higher compared to the advection dispersion case for the final case of ek transport with low ph background concentration hetr 5 3 the migration of the permanganate plume is less impacted by the low permeability inclusion fig 5f glucose appears to be displaced more slowly from the low permeability zone fig 5i due to the minor electroosmotic flow which also favored the penetration of permanganate within the inclusion in fact with this pore water composition electromigration is dominant and less countered by electroosmotic flow in the fine material inclusion in this experiment the mixing area is also significantly larger than in case hetr 5 1 fig 5l and its location is different compared to the other ek transport case hetr 5 2 to evaluate the degradation efficiency in the different reactive transport experiments we computed the relative mass of permanganate in the system at different times with respect to the mass at the beginning of the experiment the results are illustrated in fig 6 and show that for the advection dispersion scenario hetr 5 1 after 120 min more than 99 of permanganate was still present in the domain conversely for the ek transport scenarios we observe a larger extent of reaction in the system in both hetr 5 2 and hetr 5 3 the reaction starts when the permanganate contacts the organic compound such mixing of the reactants is anticipated at high ph hetr 5 2 since the higher electroosmotic flow is more effective in displacing glucose towards the cathode and the approaching permanganate plume a high consumption rate lasts until 80 min from the beginning of the experiments a similar degradation efficiency is observed in both ek transport cases with a remaining permanganate mass in the system of 86 for hetr 5 2 and 87 for hetr 5 3 at the end of the experiments these reactive transport experiments highlight the radically different transport dynamics during electrokinetics which greatly enhance the mixing and mixing limited reaction between a negatively charged reactant and an uncharged organic compound such different transport and mixing processes lead to increased degradation efficiencies compared to analogous settings relying exclusively on advective dispersive mass transfer moreover these experiments show that the distribution of the reactants and the active reactive zones are not trivial to understand and predict in heterogeneous systems since they depend on the patterns of physical heterogeneity on the pore water chemistry and consequently on the spatially variable distribution of electroosmotic fluxes 5 conclusions in this study we performed a fundamental experimental and model based investigation of electrokinetic transport mechanisms in heterogeneous porous media the following points summarize the major findings of our work importance of physical heterogeneity during ek transport and complex interplay between the dominant flow and solute mass transfer mechanisms of advection electroosmosis and electromigration the interaction between hydraulic fluxes results in spatially variable velocity fields and in water recirculation patterns that greatly impact the overall electrokinetic transport the displacement and spatial distribution of charged tracer plumes depend on the dominant ek transport mechanisms as well as on their interaction with the chemistry of the pore water solution the latter is important not only for the delivery and electrostatic interactions of the tracer in the pore water but also for its strong impact on the magnitude and spatial distribution of electroosmotic fluxes reactive transport and contaminant degradation can follow complex patterns in heterogeneous porous media the interaction between the different mass transfer processes determines the mixing between reactants the location and spatial distribution of reaction hotspots and ultimately the effectiveness of contaminant removal during electrokinetics a charged reactant might not even need to enter a low permeability zone to contact and react with an uncharged organic compound as the electroosmotic flow can help displacing the latter from the low permeability inclusion and favor its mixing with the delivered reactant conversely if the uncharged organic compound is sorbed within a low permeability zone it might be difficult for the charged reactant to come into contact with such target compound importance of process based multidimensional numerical simulations to understand and interpret the experiments and the observed patterns of the tracer plumes in the different experiments the process based model also illuminates the reactive transport behavior and helped visualizing and quantifying the evolution of the different reactants the location and magnitude of the reactive zones and the degradation efficiency despite the simplified physical and geochemical conditions considered in the experiments the outcomes of this work have important practical implications in the field of electrokinetic transport and remediation in fact understanding the interplay of electromigration and electroosmosis in heterogeneous porous media will help upscaling electokinetic remediation approaches important practical implications for electrokinetic remediation may encompass the definition of injection strategies the design of sampling plans the estimation of expected remediation times as well as the choice of

16233,mathematical modelling is increasingly used to improve the design understanding and operation of water systems two modelling paradigms i e mechanistic and data driven modelling are dominant in the water sector both with their advantages and drawbacks hybrid modelling aims to combine the strengths of both paradigms here we introduce a novel framework that incorporates a data driven component into an existing activated sludge model of a water resource recovery facility in contrast to previous efforts we tightly integrate both models by incorporating a neural differential equation into an existing mechanistic ode model this machine learning component fills in the knowledge gaps of the mechanistic model we show that this approach improves the predictive capabilities of the mechanistic model and is able to extrapolate to unseen conditions a problematic task for data driven models this approach holds tremendous potential for systems that are difficult to model using the mechanistic paradigm only keywords hybrid models data driven models mechanistic models neural differential equations machine learning water systems 1 introduction water systems are becoming more and more complex in wastewater treatment for example a radical shift from removing contaminants to recovering resources has led to a shift from wastewater treatment plants to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs introducing a myriad of design and operational challenges at the same time environmental concerns demand lower consumption of energy and chemicals all while maintaining more stringent effluent limits and lowering process related greenhouse gas emissions especially n 2 o these exigent requirements lead to the application of more complex technologies similarly in drinking water production an increased variety of water sources and concerns about trace contaminants have introduced advanced technologies such as membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes as an antidote to this ever increasing complexity dynamic models are increasingly used to improve the design understanding and operation of these water systems these process models are used to simulate and evaluate various scenarios supplementing the use of heuristics and best practices there is a shift to use these models for operational purposes such as predictive control or digital twins necessitating models that are capable of making accurate predictions both in regimes seen and not seen before given the increasing digitization of water systems and corresponding data abundance as well as the cheaper access to computational power the opportunities for models have grown but the expectations have also risen higher predictive performance application as real time decision support tool and coupling of data as an example in the field of wastewater treatment the family of activated sludge models asm henze et al 2000 is well established and has demonstrated its usefulness in the design and operation of plants gujer 2006 rieger et al 2012 these models are mechanistic they have a model structure that incorporates physical e g mass balances or even empirical knowledge e g reaction dynamics into a mathematical description of the process the design and application of these models require extensive expert knowledge the parameters of these models are either known from theory e g stoichiometric constants empirically determined or estimated from relatively few observations as these parameters are limited in number and have a physical meaning these models are regarded as interpretable and can be leveraged to improve understanding of the system making them an ideal tool for the design and analysis of water systems brdjanovic et al 2015 however these mechanistic models are running into the limits of complexity and predictive performance burton et al 2013 the incorporated domain knowledge has been constructed from theory and empirical knowledge yet it is often a simplification incomplete and subject to certain assumptions as an example aeration dynamics are often significantly simplified and lumped together into a single k l a parameter bacterial communities are crudely divided into heterotrophs and autotrophs not reflecting the complex bacterial interactions saunders et al 2016 mixing behaviour is usually oversimplified by using a series of continuously stirred tank reactors cstr or a compartmental model approach rehman et al 2017 these discrepancies between model and reality result in model structure uncertainty which propagates and aggravates the predictive performance these shortcomings can be alleviated by manually incorporating ever more complicated dynamics as has been done for aeration amaral et al 2018 or n₂o emissions blomberg et al 2018 however there is a limit on complexity while keeping the model identifiable brun et al 2002 and practical moreover mechanistic models are typically designed with a specific use case in mind for instance the asm models are designed for domestic wastewater treatment plants it is therefore not trivial to adapt these models to the peculiarities of an industrial treatment plant thus limiting their application potential alternatively data driven modelling techniques can be used recent advances in the area of machine learning have led to a renewed interest in process engineering applications qin and chiang 2019 venkatasubramanian 2019 in contrast to mechanistic models data driven models do not require an explicitly defined model structure and instead search for relationships in the available data thus there is no explicit need to incorporate expert knowledge the learned model can subsequently be used for simulation given sufficient and representative data these models can make highly accurate predictions and can be updated online to adapt to changes in the process moreover different data sources and formats can be integrated into a data driven model opening up possibilities for exploiting the information contained in unstructured data such as microbial genomic samples speth et al 2016 data driven models typically contain a lot of parameters that have no physical meaning therefore they lack the interpretability of mechanistic models moreover a large dataset representative of the entire operational space is needed as this dataset is the only source of knowledge for the model data driven models fail to extrapolate into operational regions not seen before in contrast to domains where machine learning recently has made big strides e g face recognition the data available in water systems contain relatively little information as water systems are usually designed and operated for a stable performance this severely limits the application potential of data driven models in water systems in practice there is a thin line between mechanistic and data driven models for example many mechanistic models incorporate empirical knowledge such as monod type equations holmberg 1982 petersen et al 2003 by definition derived from data furthermore mechanistic models are usually calibrated to data introducing a data driven element from the data driven modelling perspective techniques such as feature engineering aim at incorporating domain knowledge to boost the performance of data driven models thus the distinction between both paradigms is not clear cut moreover both paradigms use different terminology thwarting cross pollination in mechanistic modelling the process of estimating the model parameters is called calibration while the data driven community calls the same process training evaluating a calibrated model to unseen data is a validation exercise for a mechanistic modeller but a testing exercise for a data driven modeller confusingly the data driven community would use a validation dataset for hyperparameter tuning an overview of these different terminologies and a comparison of both modelling paradigms is given in table 1 both types of models thus have their advantages and drawbacks given that domain knowledge is a simplification mechanistic models do not capture all complexity and therefore do not predict accurately on the other hand data driven models fail to predict in situations not seen before to mitigate the disadvantages of both paradigms we advocate a hybrid model paradigm consisting of both a mechanistic and a data driven component psichogios and ungar 1992 von stosch et al 2014 by combining mechanistic and data driven techniques the strengths of both paradigms are combined this allows for the incorporation of all available expert knowledge and data into a single hybrid model the data driven part of the model can fill in the gaps in domain knowledge while the mechanistic part can fill in the operational regions not represented in the data thus this approach allows for a trade off between data and domain knowledge while boosting predictive accuracy from a data driven modelling perspective integrating domain knowledge through a mechanistic component restricts the solution space to a desired subset reducing the risk of overfitting through a regularization effect when a piece of domain knowledge is incorporated only its parameters need to be estimated from data instead of its entire structure reducing the data requirements in general two approaches for hybrid modelling stand out serial and parallel fig 1 anderson et al 2000 su et al 1993 in a serial approach the output of the data driven component is fed as input to the mechanistic component this is particularly useful when a certain dynamics is not accurately described by the mechanistic model for example anderson et al 2000 and lee et al 2002 first train a data driven model to predict microbial kinetics these predictions are subsequently used as parameters in a mechanistic model similarly fouling in a membrane bioreactor can be estimated by a data driven component and integrated into a mechanistic model dalmau et al 2015 for these approaches to be successful intermediate data of this estimated parameter is needed such data is often not available severely limiting the application potential alternatively a parallel approach can be used here the data driven and mechanistic components are simulated simultaneously with their outputs added together côte et al 1995 lee et al 2002 2005 patton et al 1994 vojinovic et al 2003 the aim is to predict the residual error of the mechanistic model to perform a post hoc correction this approach holds the potential to improve the fit of data however the data driven component predicts the residual error of the state of the system it does not learn the underlying dynamics it merely reacts to the results of the model reality mismatch instead of proactively learning the missing dynamics therefore this approach proves to be problematic for all but the simplest systems as reported in anderson et al 2000 in contrast to previous efforts this study implements this parallel approach at the level of the differential equations tightly embedding the data driven component into a dynamic model the data driven component thus directly learns the missing dynamics to achieve this we incorporate a neural network in the right hand side of a differential equation ayoubi 1994 gonzalez garcia et al 1998 masri et al 1992 raissi et al 2018 as such network can approximate any arbitrary function chen and chen 1995 cybenko 1989 and can be trained through gradient descent this combination of a neural network and differential equations is known under various names such as continuous time recurrent neural networks funahashi and nakamura 1993 li et al 2005 and dynamic neural networks de jesus and hagan 2007 but is currently mostly known under the name of neural differential equations chen et al 2018 one can regard these neural differential equations as conventional differential equations where the model structure is determined based on data rather than by domain knowledge as these neural differential equations learn dynamics they can be closely coupled with mechanistic models formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations into an integrated hybrid model quaghebeur et al 2021 both components are trained simultaneously allowing for synergistic collaboration between them the above described methods of hybrid modelling can be classified as design approaches where prior knowledge dictates the design of the model for completeness domain knowledge can be incorporated into a data driven method by limiting the parameter space during training this can for instance be achieved by imposing inequality constraints or engineering a specific objective function thompson and kramer 1994 in this paper we first formally introduce the concept of neural odes and their hybrid form subsequently we illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each type of model through two simulation studies lastly we show its performance on real data collected from a batch settling experiment 2 models mechanistic ode model we consider a mechanistic model consisting of a system of k th order differential equations of the form 1 d k x t d t k f x t p where x t r n is an n dimensional vector representing the state at time t and f x t p r r n is a function parameterized by a vector p capturing the dynamics of the system the right hand side would typically be constructed from theory and empirical knowledge e g mass balances or measured reaction rates in this work we use the benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 alex et al 2008 as the mechanistic model neural ode model in a neural differential equation the structure is not predefined but rather discovered from data we consider a neural differential equation model of the form 2 d k x t d t k n x t w where n x t w r r n is a neural network parameterized by a weight vector w hybrid ode model lastly we consider a hybrid model incorporating a neural differential equation as its data driven component of the form 3 d k x t d t k f x t p n x t w here we limit ourselves to the above additive form although other possibilities such as nested or multiplicative forms might of course be possible and depending on the situation desirable oliveira 2004 psichogios and ungar 1992 su et al 1993 fundamental to the proposed approach is that the parameter vectors p and w are estimated simultaneously as a consequence there is a strong coupling between both components allowing for synergies this is in contrast to other approaches where a data driven component is trained on the residual error of the solution of a first principles model lee et al 2005 patton et al 1994 different methods can be used to identify the parameters of the right hand side of a differential equation whether it includes a mechanistic a neural component or both mechanistic models rely on a small number of parameters most of which have a physical meaning the majority of these parameters are known or deduced through experiments and subsequently used in the model parameters that cannot be estimated separately are fitted by minimizing a loss function l between the data and the solution i e numerical integration of the differential equation including a neural component substantially raises the number of parameters that need to be estimated as the entire structure of the dynamics needs to be inferred consequently this increases the complexity of training requiring techniques capable of efficiently estimating a large number of parameters this parameter search is often guided by the gradient of the loss function l a technique called gradient descent there are different techniques to calculate these gradients within the context of dynamical models backpropagation through the solver either with finite differences or automatic differentiation the adjoint method and gradient matching for a full description of these techniques we refer to quaghebeur et al 2021 3 illustration by simulation to illustrate the capabilities of the different models in a controlled context we perform two simulation studies using the benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 alex et al 2008 this bsm1 model was conceptualised as an asm based testbed for control strategies and models a wastewater treatment plant with two anaerobic tanks three aerated tanks and one settler fig 7a 3 1 method we started by first generating synthetic data of the behaviour of a wastewater treatment plant using the full bsm1 model the model simulated 150 days with constant influent to obtain a steady state subsequently seven days were simulated using the first seven days of the bsm1 dry weather influent fig 2 we sampled data every 15 minutes and added gaussian noise with mean μ 0 and standard deviation σ 0 25 we used the bsm1 implementation from lund university developed by the iwa task group on benchmarking of control strategies for wwtps jeppsson 2009 using matlab r2019b matlab 2019 we subsequently fitted three models to this dataset a a mechanistic model using only conventional differential equations eq 1 b a data driven model using neural differential equations eq 2 and c a hybrid model combining both eq 3 as a mechanistic component the bsm1 was used however to simulate imperfect domain knowledge in the mechanistic component we deliberately removed a piece of the structure of the bsm1 and thereby simplified it although this is an artificial construct it allows us to study the effects of incomplete domain knowledge in mechanistic models this imperfect model was subsequently fitted to the data please note this use of two mechanistic models a first unadapted bsm1 to generate the dataset and a second adapted bsm1 to fit to this dataset as a neural component of the models a multilayer perceptron with hyperbolic tangent activation functions was used with output dimension equal to the dimension of the system weights were initialized with mean μ 0 and standard deviation σ 0 1 importantly the initialized σ determines the balance between the first principles and neural components with larger values of σ giving rise to an initially more dominant neural component bias units were initialized to 0 in all experiments the size and number of hidden layers were chosen to balance accuracy and complexity i e the simplest network that can accurately approximate the dynamics training was performed in a batched manner to leverage parallelization at each iteration a batch was randomly sampled from the generated dataset each first data point was used as initial condition for the model integrating the solution for a predefined amount of time using a fixed stepsize scheme fourth order runge kutta a fixed stepsize scheme is preferred over an adaptive solver here as it allows for parallelization of the batches which is critical for efficient training moreover as the neural component tends to be unstable during training the stepsize can become inhibiting small when using an adaptive solver causing arithmetic underflows the rmse is subsequently calculated between the solutions and the data with the desired gradient calculated using either the adjoint method or automatic differentiation pontryagin et al 1962 an adam optimizer with learning rate 1 10 2 was used for 3000 iterations with the learning rate lowered to 1 10 3 after 2000 iterations all code was implemented in python 3 7 using the pytorch paszke et al 2019 and torchdiffeq libraries chen et al 2018 to validate the calibrated models we simulated the last seven days of both the dry and rainy bsm1 weather influent during days 8 10 of the rainy influent dataset a rain event occurs resulting in a doubled hydraulic load and halved contaminant concentration fig 3 during these days the influent is highly different from the dry weather influent used as training data fig 2 this allows us to assess the capabilities of the models to extrapolate into unseen operational regions 3 2 results we unfolded two scenarios each mimicking incomplete knowledge in the first one the microbial community is not accurately described as it does not capture the aerobic growth of the autotrophic community in the second one the hydraulic model of the plant is simplified 3 2 1 unknown growth dynamics of autotrophic bacteria to simulate imperfect domain knowledge in the mechanistic sub models we fitted a bsm1 version that does not account for the growth of autotrophs following the notation of bsm1 the growth process of autotrophs ρ 3 is governed by the equation 4 ρ 3 μ a s nh k nh s nh s o k o a s o x b a where μ a is the growth rate of the autotrophs by setting this μ a to zero the growth dynamics of the autotrophs is not captured by the model we can see this as an extreme case of a model that is poorly calibrated for the growth of autotrophs a neural differential equation with one hidden layer of 25 neurons is introduced for all variables affected by the missing microbial dynamics this mainly affects the autotrophic biomass influencing the removal of snh therefore we plot the effluent snh concentration the mechanistic model is able to capture the general dynamics both during dry fig 4 a and rainy weather fig 5 a however as the model simplifies the hydraulic behaviour it is not able to accurately reproduce the dynamics this is a clear example of the mismatch between the incomplete knowledge incorporated and the system the data driven model is able to make accurate predictions during dry weather fig 4b however when simulating the behaviour during rainy weather the model fails to make accurate predictions fig 5b additionally at times it gives physically impossible results such as the negative nh 4 concentrations encountered during the rain event the rainy weather influent is characterized by high hydraulic loads nearly twice the size as present in the dry weather influent and contaminant concentrations half as high thus this operational regime is not represented by the original training dataset and the model is in effect extrapolating leading to poor performance this example clearly shows the limits of a data driven model the hybrid model is able to accurately predict during dry weather fig 4c moreover it is able to give fairly accurate predictions during rainy weather fig 5c however its performance is worse than during dry weather with imperfect domain knowledge and a non representative dataset no submodel is able to capture the dynamics by itself however the combination of both submodels into the hybrid model allows for a better predictive performance the rmse for the different models and influent regimes is shown in table 2 during dry weather a regime represented in the dataset the data driven model rmse 0 22 performs the best the mechanistic model 1 52 is unable to fully capture the dynamics as it has imperfect domain knowledge the hybrid model 0 29 in effect augmenting the mechanistic model with a data driven part is able to fill in the gaps of the imperfect mechanistic model and comes close to the performance of the purely data driven model when considering rainy weather the data driven model 5 75 performs the worst as it is extrapolating into an unknown operational space the mechanistic model 3 06 better captures the system dynamic but is underestimating it most of the times the hybrid model 0 66 clearly outperforms the other models it is able to combine the strengths of both submodels and mitigates their weaknesses however it should be noted that a trade off is made as the model becomes less interpretable than the purely mechanistic model due to the presence of a black box component parameters that are trained in conjunction with the data driven component lose part of their physical interpretation and should only be interpreted within the context of the hybrid model next we intend to analyse the dynamics learned by the neural component this component should preferably learn the missing dynamics and not fit to noise as an example we analyse the behaviour of snh in the third reactor i e the first aerated reactor the absence of autotrophic growth severely affects the snh dynamics in this reactor following bsm1 convention the autotrophic growth process ρ 3 affects the dynamics of snh as 5 d s nh d t i x b 1 y a ρ 3 fig 6 a visualises the missing snh dynamics during the dry weather alongside the dynamics learned by the neural component of the hybrid model the neural component approximates this missing dynamics however especially at the peaks the neural component still deviates as these peaks are underrepresented in the noisy dataset however during the rain event fig 6b the approximation of the neural component starts to worsen as it extrapolates to an unseen operational region although not as accurate as during dry weather it is still able to provide an estimate of the missing dynamics explaining the improved performance of the hybrid model over the purely mechanistic model fig 5 3 2 2 simplified hydraulics in the previous simulation study a clearly defined model piece was missing i e the growth dynamics of the autotrophs described by eq 4 the neural component can fill in this knowledge gap by simply learning this equation in a second example we simplify the hydraulics instead of affecting one specific dynamics this simplification has a more profound effect on the model affecting the full dynamics of the system we adapted the hydraulic structure in the following way the two anoxic tanks tanks 1 and 2 are combined into a single tank of equal combined volume similarly two of the aerobic tanks tanks 3 and 4 are combined fig 7b we thus deliberately simplified the tanks in series model to mimic a lack of knowledge on the mixing behaviour this change in hydraulics affects the nitrification denitrification process therefore we plot the effluent s n o concentration to compensate for the missing knowledge a neural differential equation with two hidden layers of 30 neurons is introduced in the hybrid model for all variables the mechanistic model captures the general trends in the dynamics both during dry fig 8 a and rainy weather fig 9 a however as the model simplifies the hydraulic behaviour it is not able to accurately reproduce the dynamics during dry weather the data driven model is able to make accurate predictions fig 8b however it fails to do so during rainy weather fig 9b additionally the model predicts negative concentrations a physically impossible result as the rain event is not represented by the training dataset the model is in effect extrapolating leading to poor performance the hybrid model is able to make accurate predictions during dry weather fig 8c and fairly accurate predictions during rainy weather fig 9c however its performance is worse than during dry weather with imperfect domain knowledge and a non representative dataset none of the submodels is able to capture the dynamics of the wrrf by itself however the close integration of both submodels into the hybrid model allows for better predictive performance the rmse for the different models and influent regimes is shown in table 3 it can be concluded that during dry weather a regime represented in the dataset the hybrid model performs the best rmse 0 34 closely followed by the data driven model 0 36 as can be seen in figures 8c and 8 b the residual error mainly consists of an irreducible part due to the noise in the data the mechanistic model 0 66 is unable to fully capture the dynamics as it has imperfect domain knowledge however when considering rainy weather the data driven model 3 02 performs the worst as it is extrapolating into an unknown operational region the mechanistic model better captures the system dynamics but is underestimating it most of the times 3 02 the hybrid model 1 04 clearly outperforms the other models it is able to combine the strength of both submodels and mitigates their weaknesses 4 illustration on settling data to illustrate the capabilities of the different models on real data we performed a simulation study using real settling data 4 1 method de clercq et al 2005 describes a method to gather high resolution data using a radiotracer and gamma cameras to obtain solids concentration profiles during the batch settling of activated sludge we use two datasets obtained by the authors with initial total suspended solids tss concentrations c 0 of 3 23 g l and 4 20 g l respectively the first dataset is used for training the models the second one for validation the data is sampled at 30 second intervals we refer to the original paper for an in depth description of how this data was obtained similar to section 3 we fitted three models to the first dataset a a mechanistic model using only conventional differential equations eq 1 b a data driven model using neural differential equations eq 2 and c a hybrid model combining both eq 3 as a mechanistic component the batch version of the takács model takács et al 1991 was used representing the settling tank as 10 layers fig 10 this model takes into account various settling dynamics such as hindered settling but does not include compression settling and thus exemplifies a model based on incomplete knowledge the values for the parameters requiring calibration i e v 0 r h and r p were taken from torfs 2015 who calibrated the takács model on the dataset used the neural component and training procedure were implemented as described in section 3 in the hybrid model a neural differential equation with one hidden layer of 25 neurons is introduced for each settling layer 4 2 results similar results were obtained as in the simulation studies the mechanistic model captures the general trends of both the training and validation dataset figs 11 a and 12 a however these predictions are not very accurate especially in the lower layers where compression settling is not taken into account by the model on the training dataset the data driven model achieves makes the most accurate predictions fig 11b however the data driven model fails on the validation dataset with a higher initial concentration fig 12b a good example to highlight these limitations are the predictions in layer 3 in the training dataset the concentration first rises and then decreases due to the different initial concentration this dynamics is not present in the validation dataset however the model predicts a similar profile as it fails to correctly extrapolate the hybrid model accurately predicts the training dataset fig 11c moreover it is able to give fairly accurate predictions on the validation dataset although its performance is worse than on the training dataset fig 12c the hybrid model clearly benefits from the added domain knowledge in comparison to the data driven model the rmse values for the different models on the two datasets are shown in table 4 on the training dataset c 0 3 23 g l the data driven model performs the best rmse 0 07 the mechanistic takács model 0 68 is unable to fully capture the dynamics due to the deficiencies in the model in the case of the hybrid model 0 18 the neural component is able to fill in the gaps of the takács model and comes close to the performance of the purely data driven model on the validation dataset c 0 4 20 g l the data driven model 4 19 performs the worst as it has difficulty capturing the dynamics of unseen data the mechanistic model 0 83 better captures the system dynamics the hybrid model 0 46 clearly outperforms the other models it is able to combine the strengths of both submodels and mitigate their weaknesses 5 discussion in the first example a clearly defined piece of knowledge was missing i e the growth of the autotrophic bacteria the data driven component of the hybrid model is able to fill in this knowledge gap the resulting model delivers accurate predictions in regimes not seen before in stark contrast to the purely data driven model which fails to extrapolate moreover the data driven component improves the accuracy of the predictions over the mechanistic model furthermore as the second example shows similar improvements are achieved when the missing knowledge is not as clear cut e g the hydraulics are not correctly incorporated lastly we have discussed the performance of the hybrid model on batch settling data where the existing mechanistic takács model shows some shortcomings all three examples show that a hybrid model is able to combine the strengths of both the mechanistic and data driven modelling paradigms it allows for accurate predictions without the need for complete domain knowledge however a clear trade off is made as the introduction of a black box component decreases the interpretability and parameters should only be interpreted within the context of the hybrid model although we have shown the extrapolation capabilities of hybrid models one should always be critical towards their predictions as the correctness thereof is not guaranteed mechanistic models are widely used in the water sector the hybrid approach allows to naturally incorporate data driven techniques into these existing models it improves the predictive capacity which is essential for online applications such as predictive control and digital twins although the commonly used models cannot be considered purely mechanistic e g the use of empirically observed monod functions the introduction of a black box component decreases the interpretability and physical relevance of the parameters of the first principles component there is thus a trade off between accuracy and interpretability this is in contrast with other techniques such as symbolic bongard and lipson 2007 schmidt and lipson 2009 or sparse regression brunton et al 2016 schaeffer et al 2018 that are aimed at distilling interpretable models but suffer from scalability issues or are limited by the predefined library of candidate functions respectively therefore we foresee the use of this approach mainly in applications where predictive capabilities are detrimental e g in predictive control additionally the integrated model can easily adapt to changes in the dynamics in an online learning setting nevertheless this approach cannot be applied for designing new systems as no data is yet available last but not least analysis of the neural component can potentially direct the modeler towards gaps in the first principles model catalyzing model improvements we briefly touched upon this analysis of the neural component but ideas such as local surrogates ribeiro et al 2016 or shapley values lundberg and lee 2017 can potentially be leveraged to interpret the dynamics learned by the neural component the integration of data driven and mechanistic modelling techniques implies a mind shift about the usage of data during model development where one currently uses data to calibrate the parameters of a fixed model structure one should shift towards using data to partially augment this model structure the increasing amount of data available is a valuable resource that should be leveraged to improve its operation e g through the use of predictive control or digital twins moreover not only the data that directly relates to model components can be incorporated but all data formats and sources are potentially valuable concentrations of toxic components energy prices and precipitation predictions are examples of data sources that could potentially be incorporated to improve operational performance neural networks excel at unlocking insights from unstructured data such as metagenomic datasets providing a way to incorporate microbial dynamics sin and al 2021 rather than developing a purely data driven model or spending tremendous time and budget to describe each aspect of the process in a mechanistic way we believe that a huge gain in model predictive performance can be achieved by the incorporation of data driven techniques into existing mechanistic models we further advocate the close coupling of mechanistic and data driven models and their simultaneous training in contrast to previous work where a data driven model corrects the error of the mechanistic model this allows for synergies between the models nevertheless as with all data driven modelling techniques one needs to be cautious about data quality the garbage in garbage out principle is especially relevant and proper steps should be taken to ensure quality data statistics and machine learning practitioners have developed methods to counteract overfitting to data e g regularization and to properly evaluate the model e g cross validation these methods should be incorporated into good modelling practice of water systems 6 conclusion in this work we have introduced a novel framework for hybrid modelling of water systems incorporating a neural differential equation into a mechanistic model we have shown that the data driven component is able to capture the missing dynamics of the mechanistic component thereby improving the predictive performance moreover the mechanistic component allows for extrapolation to unseen conditions in conclusion neither first principles nor data driven modelling is the solution for all challenges in science and engineering integrating both combines their

16233,mathematical modelling is increasingly used to improve the design understanding and operation of water systems two modelling paradigms i e mechanistic and data driven modelling are dominant in the water sector both with their advantages and drawbacks hybrid modelling aims to combine the strengths of both paradigms here we introduce a novel framework that incorporates a data driven component into an existing activated sludge model of a water resource recovery facility in contrast to previous efforts we tightly integrate both models by incorporating a neural differential equation into an existing mechanistic ode model this machine learning component fills in the knowledge gaps of the mechanistic model we show that this approach improves the predictive capabilities of the mechanistic model and is able to extrapolate to unseen conditions a problematic task for data driven models this approach holds tremendous potential for systems that are difficult to model using the mechanistic paradigm only keywords hybrid models data driven models mechanistic models neural differential equations machine learning water systems 1 introduction water systems are becoming more and more complex in wastewater treatment for example a radical shift from removing contaminants to recovering resources has led to a shift from wastewater treatment plants to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs introducing a myriad of design and operational challenges at the same time environmental concerns demand lower consumption of energy and chemicals all while maintaining more stringent effluent limits and lowering process related greenhouse gas emissions especially n 2 o these exigent requirements lead to the application of more complex technologies similarly in drinking water production an increased variety of water sources and concerns about trace contaminants have introduced advanced technologies such as membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes as an antidote to this ever increasing complexity dynamic models are increasingly used to improve the design understanding and operation of these water systems these process models are used to simulate and evaluate various scenarios supplementing the use of heuristics and best practices there is a shift to use these models for operational purposes such as predictive control or digital twins necessitating models that are capable of making accurate predictions both in regimes seen and not seen before given the increasing digitization of water systems and corresponding data abundance as well as the cheaper access to computational power the opportunities for models have grown but the expectations have also risen higher predictive performance application as real time decision support tool and coupling of data as an example in the field of wastewater treatment the family of activated sludge models asm henze et al 2000 is well established and has demonstrated its usefulness in the design and operation of plants gujer 2006 rieger et al 2012 these models are mechanistic they have a model structure that incorporates physical e g mass balances or even empirical knowledge e g reaction dynamics into a mathematical description of the process the design and application of these models require extensive expert knowledge the parameters of these models are either known from theory e g stoichiometric constants empirically determined or estimated from relatively few observations as these parameters are limited in number and have a physical meaning these models are regarded as interpretable and can be leveraged to improve understanding of the system making them an ideal tool for the design and analysis of water systems brdjanovic et al 2015 however these mechanistic models are running into the limits of complexity and predictive performance burton et al 2013 the incorporated domain knowledge has been constructed from theory and empirical knowledge yet it is often a simplification incomplete and subject to certain assumptions as an example aeration dynamics are often significantly simplified and lumped together into a single k l a parameter bacterial communities are crudely divided into heterotrophs and autotrophs not reflecting the complex bacterial interactions saunders et al 2016 mixing behaviour is usually oversimplified by using a series of continuously stirred tank reactors cstr or a compartmental model approach rehman et al 2017 these discrepancies between model and reality result in model structure uncertainty which propagates and aggravates the predictive performance these shortcomings can be alleviated by manually incorporating ever more complicated dynamics as has been done for aeration amaral et al 2018 or n₂o emissions blomberg et al 2018 however there is a limit on complexity while keeping the model identifiable brun et al 2002 and practical moreover mechanistic models are typically designed with a specific use case in mind for instance the asm models are designed for domestic wastewater treatment plants it is therefore not trivial to adapt these models to the peculiarities of an industrial treatment plant thus limiting their application potential alternatively data driven modelling techniques can be used recent advances in the area of machine learning have led to a renewed interest in process engineering applications qin and chiang 2019 venkatasubramanian 2019 in contrast to mechanistic models data driven models do not require an explicitly defined model structure and instead search for relationships in the available data thus there is no explicit need to incorporate expert knowledge the learned model can subsequently be used for simulation given sufficient and representative data these models can make highly accurate predictions and can be updated online to adapt to changes in the process moreover different data sources and formats can be integrated into a data driven model opening up possibilities for exploiting the information contained in unstructured data such as microbial genomic samples speth et al 2016 data driven models typically contain a lot of parameters that have no physical meaning therefore they lack the interpretability of mechanistic models moreover a large dataset representative of the entire operational space is needed as this dataset is the only source of knowledge for the model data driven models fail to extrapolate into operational regions not seen before in contrast to domains where machine learning recently has made big strides e g face recognition the data available in water systems contain relatively little information as water systems are usually designed and operated for a stable performance this severely limits the application potential of data driven models in water systems in practice there is a thin line between mechanistic and data driven models for example many mechanistic models incorporate empirical knowledge such as monod type equations holmberg 1982 petersen et al 2003 by definition derived from data furthermore mechanistic models are usually calibrated to data introducing a data driven element from the data driven modelling perspective techniques such as feature engineering aim at incorporating domain knowledge to boost the performance of data driven models thus the distinction between both paradigms is not clear cut moreover both paradigms use different terminology thwarting cross pollination in mechanistic modelling the process of estimating the model parameters is called calibration while the data driven community calls the same process training evaluating a calibrated model to unseen data is a validation exercise for a mechanistic modeller but a testing exercise for a data driven modeller confusingly the data driven community would use a validation dataset for hyperparameter tuning an overview of these different terminologies and a comparison of both modelling paradigms is given in table 1 both types of models thus have their advantages and drawbacks given that domain knowledge is a simplification mechanistic models do not capture all complexity and therefore do not predict accurately on the other hand data driven models fail to predict in situations not seen before to mitigate the disadvantages of both paradigms we advocate a hybrid model paradigm consisting of both a mechanistic and a data driven component psichogios and ungar 1992 von stosch et al 2014 by combining mechanistic and data driven techniques the strengths of both paradigms are combined this allows for the incorporation of all available expert knowledge and data into a single hybrid model the data driven part of the model can fill in the gaps in domain knowledge while the mechanistic part can fill in the operational regions not represented in the data thus this approach allows for a trade off between data and domain knowledge while boosting predictive accuracy from a data driven modelling perspective integrating domain knowledge through a mechanistic component restricts the solution space to a desired subset reducing the risk of overfitting through a regularization effect when a piece of domain knowledge is incorporated only its parameters need to be estimated from data instead of its entire structure reducing the data requirements in general two approaches for hybrid modelling stand out serial and parallel fig 1 anderson et al 2000 su et al 1993 in a serial approach the output of the data driven component is fed as input to the mechanistic component this is particularly useful when a certain dynamics is not accurately described by the mechanistic model for example anderson et al 2000 and lee et al 2002 first train a data driven model to predict microbial kinetics these predictions are subsequently used as parameters in a mechanistic model similarly fouling in a membrane bioreactor can be estimated by a data driven component and integrated into a mechanistic model dalmau et al 2015 for these approaches to be successful intermediate data of this estimated parameter is needed such data is often not available severely limiting the application potential alternatively a parallel approach can be used here the data driven and mechanistic components are simulated simultaneously with their outputs added together côte et al 1995 lee et al 2002 2005 patton et al 1994 vojinovic et al 2003 the aim is to predict the residual error of the mechanistic model to perform a post hoc correction this approach holds the potential to improve the fit of data however the data driven component predicts the residual error of the state of the system it does not learn the underlying dynamics it merely reacts to the results of the model reality mismatch instead of proactively learning the missing dynamics therefore this approach proves to be problematic for all but the simplest systems as reported in anderson et al 2000 in contrast to previous efforts this study implements this parallel approach at the level of the differential equations tightly embedding the data driven component into a dynamic model the data driven component thus directly learns the missing dynamics to achieve this we incorporate a neural network in the right hand side of a differential equation ayoubi 1994 gonzalez garcia et al 1998 masri et al 1992 raissi et al 2018 as such network can approximate any arbitrary function chen and chen 1995 cybenko 1989 and can be trained through gradient descent this combination of a neural network and differential equations is known under various names such as continuous time recurrent neural networks funahashi and nakamura 1993 li et al 2005 and dynamic neural networks de jesus and hagan 2007 but is currently mostly known under the name of neural differential equations chen et al 2018 one can regard these neural differential equations as conventional differential equations where the model structure is determined based on data rather than by domain knowledge as these neural differential equations learn dynamics they can be closely coupled with mechanistic models formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations into an integrated hybrid model quaghebeur et al 2021 both components are trained simultaneously allowing for synergistic collaboration between them the above described methods of hybrid modelling can be classified as design approaches where prior knowledge dictates the design of the model for completeness domain knowledge can be incorporated into a data driven method by limiting the parameter space during training this can for instance be achieved by imposing inequality constraints or engineering a specific objective function thompson and kramer 1994 in this paper we first formally introduce the concept of neural odes and their hybrid form subsequently we illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each type of model through two simulation studies lastly we show its performance on real data collected from a batch settling experiment 2 models mechanistic ode model we consider a mechanistic model consisting of a system of k th order differential equations of the form 1 d k x t d t k f x t p where x t r n is an n dimensional vector representing the state at time t and f x t p r r n is a function parameterized by a vector p capturing the dynamics of the system the right hand side would typically be constructed from theory and empirical knowledge e g mass balances or measured reaction rates in this work we use the benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 alex et al 2008 as the mechanistic model neural ode model in a neural differential equation the structure is not predefined but rather discovered from data we consider a neural differential equation model of the form 2 d k x t d t k n x t w where n x t w r r n is a neural network parameterized by a weight vector w hybrid ode model lastly we consider a hybrid model incorporating a neural differential equation as its data driven component of the form 3 d k x t d t k f x t p n x t w here we limit ourselves to the above additive form although other possibilities such as nested or multiplicative forms might of course be possible and depending on the situation desirable oliveira 2004 psichogios and ungar 1992 su et al 1993 fundamental to the proposed approach is that the parameter vectors p and w are estimated simultaneously as a consequence there is a strong coupling between both components allowing for synergies this is in contrast to other approaches where a data driven component is trained on the residual error of the solution of a first principles model lee et al 2005 patton et al 1994 different methods can be used to identify the parameters of the right hand side of a differential equation whether it includes a mechanistic a neural component or both mechanistic models rely on a small number of parameters most of which have a physical meaning the majority of these parameters are known or deduced through experiments and subsequently used in the model parameters that cannot be estimated separately are fitted by minimizing a loss function l between the data and the solution i e numerical integration of the differential equation including a neural component substantially raises the number of parameters that need to be estimated as the entire structure of the dynamics needs to be inferred consequently this increases the complexity of training requiring techniques capable of efficiently estimating a large number of parameters this parameter search is often guided by the gradient of the loss function l a technique called gradient descent there are different techniques to calculate these gradients within the context of dynamical models backpropagation through the solver either with finite differences or automatic differentiation the adjoint method and gradient matching for a full description of these techniques we refer to quaghebeur et al 2021 3 illustration by simulation to illustrate the capabilities of the different models in a controlled context we perform two simulation studies using the benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 alex et al 2008 this bsm1 model was conceptualised as an asm based testbed for control strategies and models a wastewater treatment plant with two anaerobic tanks three aerated tanks and one settler fig 7a 3 1 method we started by first generating synthetic data of the behaviour of a wastewater treatment plant using the full bsm1 model the model simulated 150 days with constant influent to obtain a steady state subsequently seven days were simulated using the first seven days of the bsm1 dry weather influent fig 2 we sampled data every 15 minutes and added gaussian noise with mean μ 0 and standard deviation σ 0 25 we used the bsm1 implementation from lund university developed by the iwa task group on benchmarking of control strategies for wwtps jeppsson 2009 using matlab r2019b matlab 2019 we subsequently fitted three models to this dataset a a mechanistic model using only conventional differential equations eq 1 b a data driven model using neural differential equations eq 2 and c a hybrid model combining both eq 3 as a mechanistic component the bsm1 was used however to simulate imperfect domain knowledge in the mechanistic component we deliberately removed a piece of the structure of the bsm1 and thereby simplified it although this is an artificial construct it allows us to study the effects of incomplete domain knowledge in mechanistic models this imperfect model was subsequently fitted to the data please note this use of two mechanistic models a first unadapted bsm1 to generate the dataset and a second adapted bsm1 to fit to this dataset as a neural component of the models a multilayer perceptron with hyperbolic tangent activation functions was used with output dimension equal to the dimension of the system weights were initialized with mean μ 0 and standard deviation σ 0 1 importantly the initialized σ determines the balance between the first principles and neural components with larger values of σ giving rise to an initially more dominant neural component bias units were initialized to 0 in all experiments the size and number of hidden layers were chosen to balance accuracy and complexity i e the simplest network that can accurately approximate the dynamics training was performed in a batched manner to leverage parallelization at each iteration a batch was randomly sampled from the generated dataset each first data point was used as initial condition for the model integrating the solution for a predefined amount of time using a fixed stepsize scheme fourth order runge kutta a fixed stepsize scheme is preferred over an adaptive solver here as it allows for parallelization of the batches which is critical for efficient training moreover as the neural component tends to be unstable during training the stepsize can become inhibiting small when using an adaptive solver causing arithmetic underflows the rmse is subsequently calculated between the solutions and the data with the desired gradient calculated using either the adjoint method or automatic differentiation pontryagin et al 1962 an adam optimizer with learning rate 1 10 2 was used for 3000 iterations with the learning rate lowered to 1 10 3 after 2000 iterations all code was implemented in python 3 7 using the pytorch paszke et al 2019 and torchdiffeq libraries chen et al 2018 to validate the calibrated models we simulated the last seven days of both the dry and rainy bsm1 weather influent during days 8 10 of the rainy influent dataset a rain event occurs resulting in a doubled hydraulic load and halved contaminant concentration fig 3 during these days the influent is highly different from the dry weather influent used as training data fig 2 this allows us to assess the capabilities of the models to extrapolate into unseen operational regions 3 2 results we unfolded two scenarios each mimicking incomplete knowledge in the first one the microbial community is not accurately described as it does not capture the aerobic growth of the autotrophic community in the second one the hydraulic model of the plant is simplified 3 2 1 unknown growth dynamics of autotrophic bacteria to simulate imperfect domain knowledge in the mechanistic sub models we fitted a bsm1 version that does not account for the growth of autotrophs following the notation of bsm1 the growth process of autotrophs ρ 3 is governed by the equation 4 ρ 3 μ a s nh k nh s nh s o k o a s o x b a where μ a is the growth rate of the autotrophs by setting this μ a to zero the growth dynamics of the autotrophs is not captured by the model we can see this as an extreme case of a model that is poorly calibrated for the growth of autotrophs a neural differential equation with one hidden layer of 25 neurons is introduced for all variables affected by the missing microbial dynamics this mainly affects the autotrophic biomass influencing the removal of snh therefore we plot the effluent snh concentration the mechanistic model is able to capture the general dynamics both during dry fig 4 a and rainy weather fig 5 a however as the model simplifies the hydraulic behaviour it is not able to accurately reproduce the dynamics this is a clear example of the mismatch between the incomplete knowledge incorporated and the system the data driven model is able to make accurate predictions during dry weather fig 4b however when simulating the behaviour during rainy weather the model fails to make accurate predictions fig 5b additionally at times it gives physically impossible results such as the negative nh 4 concentrations encountered during the rain event the rainy weather influent is characterized by high hydraulic loads nearly twice the size as present in the dry weather influent and contaminant concentrations half as high thus this operational regime is not represented by the original training dataset and the model is in effect extrapolating leading to poor performance this example clearly shows the limits of a data driven model the hybrid model is able to accurately predict during dry weather fig 4c moreover it is able to give fairly accurate predictions during rainy weather fig 5c however its performance is worse than during dry weather with imperfect domain knowledge and a non representative dataset no submodel is able to capture the dynamics by itself however the combination of both submodels into the hybrid model allows for a better predictive performance the rmse for the different models and influent regimes is shown in table 2 during dry weather a regime represented in the dataset the data driven model rmse 0 22 performs the best the mechanistic model 1 52 is unable to fully capture the dynamics as it has imperfect domain knowledge the hybrid model 0 29 in effect augmenting the mechanistic model with a data driven part is able to fill in the gaps of the imperfect mechanistic model and comes close to the performance of the purely data driven model when considering rainy weather the data driven model 5 75 performs the worst as it is extrapolating into an unknown operational space the mechanistic model 3 06 better captures the system dynamic but is underestimating it most of the times the hybrid model 0 66 clearly outperforms the other models it is able to combine the strengths of both submodels and mitigates their weaknesses however it should be noted that a trade off is made as the model becomes less interpretable than the purely mechanistic model due to the presence of a black box component parameters that are trained in conjunction with the data driven component lose part of their physical interpretation and should only be interpreted within the context of the hybrid model next we intend to analyse the dynamics learned by the neural component this component should preferably learn the missing dynamics and not fit to noise as an example we analyse the behaviour of snh in the third reactor i e the first aerated reactor the absence of autotrophic growth severely affects the snh dynamics in this reactor following bsm1 convention the autotrophic growth process ρ 3 affects the dynamics of snh as 5 d s nh d t i x b 1 y a ρ 3 fig 6 a visualises the missing snh dynamics during the dry weather alongside the dynamics learned by the neural component of the hybrid model the neural component approximates this missing dynamics however especially at the peaks the neural component still deviates as these peaks are underrepresented in the noisy dataset however during the rain event fig 6b the approximation of the neural component starts to worsen as it extrapolates to an unseen operational region although not as accurate as during dry weather it is still able to provide an estimate of the missing dynamics explaining the improved performance of the hybrid model over the purely mechanistic model fig 5 3 2 2 simplified hydraulics in the previous simulation study a clearly defined model piece was missing i e the growth dynamics of the autotrophs described by eq 4 the neural component can fill in this knowledge gap by simply learning this equation in a second example we simplify the hydraulics instead of affecting one specific dynamics this simplification has a more profound effect on the model affecting the full dynamics of the system we adapted the hydraulic structure in the following way the two anoxic tanks tanks 1 and 2 are combined into a single tank of equal combined volume similarly two of the aerobic tanks tanks 3 and 4 are combined fig 7b we thus deliberately simplified the tanks in series model to mimic a lack of knowledge on the mixing behaviour this change in hydraulics affects the nitrification denitrification process therefore we plot the effluent s n o concentration to compensate for the missing knowledge a neural differential equation with two hidden layers of 30 neurons is introduced in the hybrid model for all variables the mechanistic model captures the general trends in the dynamics both during dry fig 8 a and rainy weather fig 9 a however as the model simplifies the hydraulic behaviour it is not able to accurately reproduce the dynamics during dry weather the data driven model is able to make accurate predictions fig 8b however it fails to do so during rainy weather fig 9b additionally the model predicts negative concentrations a physically impossible result as the rain event is not represented by the training dataset the model is in effect extrapolating leading to poor performance the hybrid model is able to make accurate predictions during dry weather fig 8c and fairly accurate predictions during rainy weather fig 9c however its performance is worse than during dry weather with imperfect domain knowledge and a non representative dataset none of the submodels is able to capture the dynamics of the wrrf by itself however the close integration of both submodels into the hybrid model allows for better predictive performance the rmse for the different models and influent regimes is shown in table 3 it can be concluded that during dry weather a regime represented in the dataset the hybrid model performs the best rmse 0 34 closely followed by the data driven model 0 36 as can be seen in figures 8c and 8 b the residual error mainly consists of an irreducible part due to the noise in the data the mechanistic model 0 66 is unable to fully capture the dynamics as it has imperfect domain knowledge however when considering rainy weather the data driven model 3 02 performs the worst as it is extrapolating into an unknown operational region the mechanistic model better captures the system dynamics but is underestimating it most of the times 3 02 the hybrid model 1 04 clearly outperforms the other models it is able to combine the strength of both submodels and mitigates their weaknesses 4 illustration on settling data to illustrate the capabilities of the different models on real data we performed a simulation study using real settling data 4 1 method de clercq et al 2005 describes a method to gather high resolution data using a radiotracer and gamma cameras to obtain solids concentration profiles during the batch settling of activated sludge we use two datasets obtained by the authors with initial total suspended solids tss concentrations c 0 of 3 23 g l and 4 20 g l respectively the first dataset is used for training the models the second one for validation the data is sampled at 30 second intervals we refer to the original paper for an in depth description of how this data was obtained similar to section 3 we fitted three models to the first dataset a a mechanistic model using only conventional differential equations eq 1 b a data driven model using neural differential equations eq 2 and c a hybrid model combining both eq 3 as a mechanistic component the batch version of the takács model takács et al 1991 was used representing the settling tank as 10 layers fig 10 this model takes into account various settling dynamics such as hindered settling but does not include compression settling and thus exemplifies a model based on incomplete knowledge the values for the parameters requiring calibration i e v 0 r h and r p were taken from torfs 2015 who calibrated the takács model on the dataset used the neural component and training procedure were implemented as described in section 3 in the hybrid model a neural differential equation with one hidden layer of 25 neurons is introduced for each settling layer 4 2 results similar results were obtained as in the simulation studies the mechanistic model captures the general trends of both the training and validation dataset figs 11 a and 12 a however these predictions are not very accurate especially in the lower layers where compression settling is not taken into account by the model on the training dataset the data driven model achieves makes the most accurate predictions fig 11b however the data driven model fails on the validation dataset with a higher initial concentration fig 12b a good example to highlight these limitations are the predictions in layer 3 in the training dataset the concentration first rises and then decreases due to the different initial concentration this dynamics is not present in the validation dataset however the model predicts a similar profile as it fails to correctly extrapolate the hybrid model accurately predicts the training dataset fig 11c moreover it is able to give fairly accurate predictions on the validation dataset although its performance is worse than on the training dataset fig 12c the hybrid model clearly benefits from the added domain knowledge in comparison to the data driven model the rmse values for the different models on the two datasets are shown in table 4 on the training dataset c 0 3 23 g l the data driven model performs the best rmse 0 07 the mechanistic takács model 0 68 is unable to fully capture the dynamics due to the deficiencies in the model in the case of the hybrid model 0 18 the neural component is able to fill in the gaps of the takács model and comes close to the performance of the purely data driven model on the validation dataset c 0 4 20 g l the data driven model 4 19 performs the worst as it has difficulty capturing the dynamics of unseen data the mechanistic model 0 83 better captures the system dynamics the hybrid model 0 46 clearly outperforms the other models it is able to combine the strengths of both submodels and mitigate their weaknesses 5 discussion in the first example a clearly defined piece of knowledge was missing i e the growth of the autotrophic bacteria the data driven component of the hybrid model is able to fill in this knowledge gap the resulting model delivers accurate predictions in regimes not seen before in stark contrast to the purely data driven model which fails to extrapolate moreover the data driven component improves the accuracy of the predictions over the mechanistic model furthermore as the second example shows similar improvements are achieved when the missing knowledge is not as clear cut e g the hydraulics are not correctly incorporated lastly we have discussed the performance of the hybrid model on batch settling data where the existing mechanistic takács model shows some shortcomings all three examples show that a hybrid model is able to combine the strengths of both the mechanistic and data driven modelling paradigms it allows for accurate predictions without the need for complete domain knowledge however a clear trade off is made as the introduction of a black box component decreases the interpretability and parameters should only be interpreted within the context of the hybrid model although we have shown the extrapolation capabilities of hybrid models one should always be critical towards their predictions as the correctness thereof is not guaranteed mechanistic models are widely used in the water sector the hybrid approach allows to naturally incorporate data driven techniques into these existing models it improves the predictive capacity which is essential for online applications such as predictive control and digital twins although the commonly used models cannot be considered purely mechanistic e g the use of empirically observed monod functions the introduction of a black box component decreases the interpretability and physical relevance of the parameters of the first principles component there is thus a trade off between accuracy and interpretability this is in contrast with other techniques such as symbolic bongard and lipson 2007 schmidt and lipson 2009 or sparse regression brunton et al 2016 schaeffer et al 2018 that are aimed at distilling interpretable models but suffer from scalability issues or are limited by the predefined library of candidate functions respectively therefore we foresee the use of this approach mainly in applications where predictive capabilities are detrimental e g in predictive control additionally the integrated model can easily adapt to changes in the dynamics in an online learning setting nevertheless this approach cannot be applied for designing new systems as no data is yet available last but not least analysis of the neural component can potentially direct the modeler towards gaps in the first principles model catalyzing model improvements we briefly touched upon this analysis of the neural component but ideas such as local surrogates ribeiro et al 2016 or shapley values lundberg and lee 2017 can potentially be leveraged to interpret the dynamics learned by the neural component the integration of data driven and mechanistic modelling techniques implies a mind shift about the usage of data during model development where one currently uses data to calibrate the parameters of a fixed model structure one should shift towards using data to partially augment this model structure the increasing amount of data available is a valuable resource that should be leveraged to improve its operation e g through the use of predictive control or digital twins moreover not only the data that directly relates to model components can be incorporated but all data formats and sources are potentially valuable concentrations of toxic components energy prices and precipitation predictions are examples of data sources that could potentially be incorporated to improve operational performance neural networks excel at unlocking insights from unstructured data such as metagenomic datasets providing a way to incorporate microbial dynamics sin and al 2021 rather than developing a purely data driven model or spending tremendous time and budget to describe each aspect of the process in a mechanistic way we believe that a huge gain in model predictive performance can be achieved by the incorporation of data driven techniques into existing mechanistic models we further advocate the close coupling of mechanistic and data driven models and their simultaneous training in contrast to previous work where a data driven model corrects the error of the mechanistic model this allows for synergies between the models nevertheless as with all data driven modelling techniques one needs to be cautious about data quality the garbage in garbage out principle is especially relevant and proper steps should be taken to ensure quality data statistics and machine learning practitioners have developed methods to counteract overfitting to data e g regularization and to properly evaluate the model e g cross validation these methods should be incorporated into good modelling practice of water systems 6 conclusion in this work we have introduced a novel framework for hybrid modelling of water systems incorporating a neural differential equation into a mechanistic model we have shown that the data driven component is able to capture the missing dynamics of the mechanistic component thereby improving the predictive performance moreover the mechanistic component allows for extrapolation to unseen conditions in conclusion neither first principles nor data driven modelling is the solution for all challenges in science and engineering integrating both combines their advantages while mitigating their disadvantages credit authorship contribution statement ward quaghebeur conceptualization methodology investigation software writing original draft visualization elena

and draw solute has significant effect on the sludge characteristics and membrane fouling performance in this pilot scale study an electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor e anmbr was proposed for treating pesticide wastewater at different hydraulic retention times hrts demonstrating that e anmbr was superior on improvement of sludge characteristics and mitigation of membrane fouling compared with the conventional anaerobic membrane bioreactor c anmbr e anmbr reduced sludge yield by 41 2 6 7 and the svi was significantly decreased by 32 5 13 8 the accumulation of vfa in e anmbr was slighter than that of c anmbr and the minimum average vfa was 255 6 mg l the methane yield of e anmbr 0 22 0 29 l ch4 g codremoved was 1 2 1 4 times than that of c anmbr the eps contents in suspended and attached sludge of e anmbr were significantly reduced by 41 8 3 3 and 77 4 14 5 than that of c anmbr respectively these results suggested that e anmbr has lower sludge disposal pressure higher stability and methane recovery potential not only that e anmbr successfully reduced membrane resistance delaying the fouling rate by 31 0 38 5 finally the linear relationship between eps characteristics and membrane pollution was determined graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor e anmbr pesticide wastewater characteristics of sludge energy recovery potential membrane fouling 1 introduction to increase the grain production more organic chemicals are used to prevent pests and fungi infections min et al 2020 yu et al 2021 zoxamide c14h16cl3no2 is an efficient protective fungicide and has been widely used to control oomycetes diseases mei et al 2014 as a kind of chiral fungicides zoxamide has been shown to be toxic to aquatic organisms pan et al 2020 regrettably however treatment of pesticide wastewater containing zoxamide has not been extensively studied the fundamental reason is that the pesticide wastewater has higher toxicity and the compounds containing chlorinated substituents are difficult to be completely degraded shen et al 2012 at present physical chemical and biological technologies are the main ways to treat pesticide wastewater yu et al 2021 cheng et al 2015 found that mweuv fenton technology could reduce the chemical oxygen demand cod in pesticide wastewater from 183 2 mg l to 36 9 mg l at most pliego et al 2014 treated pesticide wastewater by combining coagulation and fenton oxidation 58 of cod was removed by coagulation 80 of the remaining cod could be removed by adding the stoichiometric h2o2 dose however there are some disadvantages of these methods such as increasing financial investment and causing secondary pollution yu et al 2021 min et al 2020 the treatment of pesticide wastewater by biological methods are more full fledged by aerobic biological treatments however aerobic technologies are known to have lower load capacity higher energy consumption and the removal efficiency is poor once the influent cod concentration surpass 800 mg l yu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 used a novel aerobic fluidized bed to treat pesticide wastewater and found that the maximum influent cod concentration was about 1600 mg l thus anaerobic treatment is a befitting option because of the refractory characteristics of pesticide wastewater which is considered as an effective way to remove organic pollutants min et al 2020 however these simple anaerobic treatments present some disadvantages such as long hydraulic retention time and poor stability chen et al 2019 which may be the reason why anaerobic process has not been widely studied in treating pesticide wastewater anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr as a new system has the most laudable advantage of high effluent quality due to the micron scale intercept technology and has remarkable effect on treatment of wastewater with high cod robles et al 2020 kaya et al 2019 therefore anmbr may establish an anaerobic system with more effective effect in treating pesticide wastewater what gets in the way is that problems have yet to be properly addressed for anmbrs to the degradation of refractory organic pollutants such as severe membrane fouling which almost always occurs so undoubtedly the application of traditional anmbrs to large scale treatment of pesticide wastewater will inevitably require a large economic investment to membrane cleaning and replacement therefore membrane pollution mitigation is an urgent problem to be solved the characteristics of sludge concentration settleability and extracellular polymers eps concentration in sludge are considered to induce membrane fouling jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2007 thus an alternative system that with economically and technologically feasible to improve sludge characteristics and relieve membrane fouling should be studied imminently recently the novel system which couples with electricity and anaerobic reactor has been promisingly built to improve the efficiency and conquer membrane fouling liu et al 2013 chen et al 2011 demonstrated that the application of voltage could effectively enhance the settling ability of sludge shi et al 2019 proposed that the applied current prominently reduced the eps content in sludge and altered the composition of eps and eps was the main cause of membrane fouling ding et al 2018 also pointed out that anmbr coupled low voltage could alleviate membrane fouling by reducing the concentration of eps and changing its properties liu et al 2013 found that electrochemical membrane bioreactor could produce electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged materials eps sludge flocs etc and membranes then membrane fouling was restrained yang et al 2019 used electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor to treat wastewater which not only reduced membrane pollution but also enhanced energy recovery however electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactors have hardly been used to treat pesticide wastewater hopefully electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactors can improve performance and alleviate membrane pollution in treating pesticide wastewater therefore the current study an electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor e anmbr was established to optimize performance improve sludge characteristics and retard membrane fouling and compared with the conventional anaerobic membrane bioreactor c anmbr the purpose was systematically expressed in the following aspects 1 evaluating the efficiency of e anmbr and c anmbr focusing on sludge characteristics mlss mlvss mlvss mlss sludge yield and sludge settling volatile fatty acids vfa stability and energy recovery biogas production methane content and methane yield 2 investigating the evolution of membrane fouling of e anmbr and c anmbr the formation of eps and the correlation between membrane fouling and eps 3 estimating the effects of hrt on the efficiency and membrane fouling of e anmbr and c anmbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source and characteristics in the present study the raw wastewater came from a pesticide production plant in dalian china which was visually yellow and emitted a pungent

parameters of raw and the influent pesticide wastewater of e anmbr and c anmbr were shown in table s1 2 2 reactor equipment the e anmbr was designed for treating pesticide wastewater and compared with the c anmbr fig 1 two anmbrs with the same specification were constructed on the basic of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb with 3 m in total height and had a working volume of about 1 5 m3 which composed of major unit biogas collection plant and monitoring system the major unit consisted an intake pump a stirrer an uasb reactor and a membrane separation unit separate sludge sampling ports

current sampler the potential and current of the cathode anode and reference electrode were collected on line through an external data acquisition system keithley 2700 keithley co usa and the frequency was collected every 10 min 2 3 reactor operation the seed sludge was taken from the real anaerobic reactor from the wastewater treatment plant of a chemical plant and a brewhouse factory and mixed with a ratio of 2 1 with mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 20 6 g l f 0 65 which represents mlss mlvss the experiment was consisted of four stages the operating conditions will be detailed in the table 1 after the systems ran stably cod removal rate was more than 70 or no significant change the effects of different hrts on the performance in the range of 24 96 h was evaluated which with average concentration of cod in influent was kept at 10 365 142 mg l the whole experiment was carried out in an uninterrupted mode and the average temperature was maintained at 20 3 c at the stage of exploring the influence of hrt on performance a total of 218 days were run about 115 days operation and the 103 days of stable operation were selected for the result analysis at the end of each stage the filter cake layer deposited on the membrane surface was quickly washed with water then membrane modules were soaked for 2 h successively with 0 2 hcl and 0 05 naclo and then backwashed for 30 min the concentrations of mlss mlvss and bound eps proteins and carbohydrates were measured termly moreover the sludge characteristics and membrane resistance should also be measured 2 4 chemical analysis methods three parallel wastewater and sludge samples were taken from the different sample points of the e anmbr and c anmbr were immediately analyzed for wastewater cod tn bod5 and sludge

the method provided by hu et al 2019 and the alkalinity alk was measured by titration suggested by lafay et al 2014 in this work the bound eps was measure the eps in suspended sludge was named as suspended eps and the eps in the sludge attached to the membrane was named as attached eps for eps extraction the method of cationic exchange resin mentioned by frølund et al 1996 was suggested the concentrations of protein and carbohydrate for the eps were measured using lowry folin method and the phenol sulfuric acid method respectively which were propounded by miao et al 2018 tmp was monitored in real time by detecting equipment biogas volume was collected using an air collection bag and measured with a syringe gas chromatograph with fid detector gc 2014c shimadzu japan was employed to determined ch4 and co2 proportion tdx and porapak q chromatographic columns were used for determination 2 5 data analysis spss 22 0 was used for data analysis and statistical significance

yield by e anmbr compared with c anmbr the sludge concentration and yield coefficient were the important parameters for anaerobic biological treatment system control and operation as they determined the effluent quality directly as fig 2 a b showed the concentration of mlss in c anmbr was more concentrated than e anmbr under the different layer of the reactor when hrt was gradually decreased from 96 to 24 h the mlss of e anmbr at 0 2 m was detected about 59 16 5 71 64 59 4 16 62 12 4 57 and 54 81 4 71 g l which was lower than that of c anmbr 70 45 5 25 65 13 4 21 62 98 5 12 and 59 96 3 14 g l indicating that the longer hrt the higher the sludge concentration at the bottom of the reactor it was noted that there was distinct layer at the height of 1 3 m and the mlss of 1 41 0 09 1 71 0 08 2 05 0 11 and 2 43 0 17 g l were present in the highest sampling point of c anmbr the sludge concentration stratification was more obvious due to some physical interception of the electrode unit in e anmbr as seen in fig 2 c d the average concentrations of mlss and mlvss in both c anmbr and e anmbr increased with a shortening of hrt the concentration of mlss in c anmbr was 43 91 2 51 44 83 2 67 47 92 4 52 and 50 82 7 07 g l at hrt was 96 72 48 and 24 h respectively however the mlss concentration in e anmbr was significantly reduced to 40 01 0 95 41 06 1 65 43 41 2 48 and 44 97 3 77 g l p 0 01 which decreased by 8 4 11 5 compared with c anmbr moreover the average mlvss mlss of c anmbr was detected range from 0 66 0 01 to 0 60 0 01 when the hrt decreased from 96 h to 24 h but significantly enhanced to 0 71 0 01 0 70 0 01 0 69 0 02 and 0 65 0 01 p 0 01 due to the contribution of electrochemistry the sludge yield was measured as an important variable in the study of sludge characteristics it can be seen from fig 2 e f the sludge yield observed in e anmbr was 0 061 0 071 0 071 and 0 081 kg mlss kg codremoved while the values of c anmbr were 0 104 0 102 0 128 and 0 157 kg mlss kg codremoved which was 1 69 0 17 times of e anmbr kong et al 2021 used anmbr to treat municipal wastewater with hrt of 12 8 and 6 h when 1 g cod was removed about 0 19 0 26 g mlss was converted which was slightly larger than this study this may be related to the difference wastewater quality and microorganism matheus et al 2020 used moving bed biofilm reactor to treat pesticide wastewater with cod concentration of 458 687 mg l sludge production was kept at average 0 18 kg m3 d moreover the volatile sludge yield was 0 077 0 012 kg mlvss kgcodremoved c anmbr and was significantly less to 0 053 0 008 kg mlvss kgcodremoved of e anmbr p 0 01 these results shown that the shortening of hrt was accompanied by the increase of sludge yield which could be explained by the fact that suspended solids were flocculated and trapped in the sludge and were not used for anaerobic this was consistent with the study of cheng et al 2021 that the digestible cod left undigested would eventually be converted into residual sludge however bioelectrochemistry enhanced biodegradation and the ratio of cod digestion to methane was increased so the cod content converted to sludge was reduced zohreh et al 2020 indicated that bio electrochemical system has practical significance to reduce the burden of sludge treatment in practical application in summary the sludge yield of e anmbr and c anmbr both increased with the shortening of hrt in this study but the sludge yield of e anmbr was lower compared with c anmbr at the same hrt 3 2 performance of sludge settleability fig 3 demonstrated that the e anmbr has a superior sludge settleability compared with c anmbr with a higher zone sludge velocity zsv and lower sludge volume index svi settlement tests were conducted with the suspended sludge 1 3 m from e anmbr and c anmbr vesilind model was employed to quantify the settleability of sludge the velocity of sludge hindered settling v was confirmed by considering linear fitting of the region where displacement t has constant slope the results were shown in the fig 3 a b these results clearly indicated that the sludge settling speed was much higher with the assistance of electrochemistry compared with c anmbr the settling velocity of e anmbr was observed range between 1 367 and 0 761 cm min which about 37 116 p 0 01 higher than that of c anmbr the vesilind models were established with velocity as a function of mlss concentration and were shown in fig 3 c which were converted to the equations as follows 8 e anmbr v 10 25 exp 0 1182 x t 9 c anmbr v 9 55 exp 0 1195 x t e anmbr had larger v0 and lower k values of 10 25 and 0 1182 respectively while that were 9 55 and 0 1195 of c anmbr vesilind equations showed zsv of e anmbr was larger indicating that the sludge in e anmbr was easier to be compressed moreover svi also indicated that sludge settleability become worse with the decrease of hrt the average values of svi were increased from 24 3 to 36 4 ml g c anmbr and increased from 16 2 to 25 3 ml g e anmbr however the svi of e anmbr was significantly lower than that of c anmbr by 32 5 13 8 p 0 01 which proved that electrode module could improve sludge settleability these results were consistent with the previous reports such as chen et al 2011 proposed that the application of electrical field may lead to the change of sludge characteristics by causing some physicochemical changes in the applied media kargi and konya 2007 have found that the svi would decrease with increasing hrt 3 3 performance of volatile fatty acid and alkalinity volatile fatty acid vfa and alkalinity were important indicators to evaluate anaerobic digestion and their ratio α was a more direct expression of the stability of the system gong et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 a and fig s3 the alkalinity of e anmbr and c anmbr showed a gradual downward trend with the decrease of hrt might attributed to the increase of toxic substances resulted in the accumulation of vfa and the consumption of alkalinity hu et al 2020 generally the alkalinity value observed in e anmbr was much larger than that of c anmbr demonstrating that e anmbr could efficiently inhabit the anaerobic system acidification the average alkalinity of e anmbr was observed at 2761 434 2659 229 1878 105 and 1440 83 mg l under the hrt from 96 h to 24 h which was significantly higher p 0 01 than c anmbr 1831 158 1524 53 1370 66 and 1264 46 mg l these results showed that the vfa concentrations of e anmbr and c anmbr were almost kept at low values 500 mg l during the experimental period indicating the stability of reactors however the results also showed that the vfa was greatly influenced by the hrt as well as alkalinity the average vfa of e anmbr was observed at 255 6 267 3 309 19 and 441 21 mg l under the hrt from 96 to 24 h which was significantly lower p 0 01 than that of c anmbr 320 8 338 5 415 26 and 549 31 mg l the accumulation of vfa in the anaerobic system would inevitably lead to the inhibition of methanogen activity and the consequent impact on pollutant removal efficiency hu et al 2020 resoundingly the e anmbr with a conspicuous improvement in the utilization of vfa due to the external voltage implantation cui et al 2014 also pointed out that the introduction of electrode blocks could promote the effective utilization of pollutants were degraded by vfa thus reducing the accumulation of vfa the average values of vfa alkalinity α of e anmbr were 0 09 0 02 0 10 0 01 0 16 0 01 and 0 31 0 03 under different hrts fig 4c respectively and the α of c anmbr was 0 18 0 01 0 22 0 01 0 30 0 03 and 0 43 0 02 these results indicating that hrt of 24 h was the limitation for the two reactors as the microbial activity was affected and degrade pollutants was burdensome under the high loading rate condition it was noteworthy that as the increasing of vfa and decreasing of alkalinity led the average value of α in c anmbr dramatically increased to 0 43 0 02 under hrt of 24 h which was much above the theoretical critical value α 0 3 in the e anmbr although the vfa showed a slightly upward trend and the alkalinity showed slightly decreased trend the value of α was stable control lower than 0 3 at most of time this probably due to a small amount of electrode active bacteria which can effectively use vfa acetate as the substrate for current generation in the electrochemistry system thus ensuring a lower vfa cui et al 2014 in addition it was reasonable to believe that the application of electrochemical stimulation was beneficial to maintain the stability of the system under lower hrt and could slow down the suppression of vfa on methanogens ensuring a good performance wang et al 2020 hu et al 2019 3 4 performance of energy recovery potential fig 5 demonstrated that biogas production and methane production of e anmbr were much higher than c anmbr under all the operation conditions it was observed that the average biogas production of e anmbr was 810 42 1144 53 1577 44 and 3652 85 l d m3 reactor under hrt of 96 72 48 and 24 h respectively which about 1 10 1 38 times of c anmbr 735 67 905 90 985 123 and 1767 1153 l d m3 reactor with the shortening of hrt the daily biogas production increased which might be due to the increase of influent organic load leading to the generation of more gas in the degradation process the methane content of e anmbr was observed range between 56 9 and 71 5 while that of c anmbr was 54 1 64 9 these results indicated that e anmbr had a superior methane production compared with c anmbr due to the co metabolic was emphasized gao et al 2021 also confirmed that bioelectrochemistry could achieve accelerated biodegradation and biogas production the average methane yield of e anmbr and c anmbr was identified as 0 27 0 01 0 29 0 01 0 26 0 01 0 22 0 02 l ch4 g codremoved and 0 22 0 01 0 22 0 01 0 18 0 01 0 16 0 01 l ch4 g codremoved at four hrt conditions respectively during the whole operation time e anmbr significantly increased the methane production by 34 4 17 4 p 0 01 compared with c anmbr the methane yield of this study was lower than the research of balcıoğlu et al 2021 which reported methane productions of 0 31 0 31 0 26 and 0 26 l ch4 g codremoved using anmbr to treat confectionery wastewater under olrs of 2 2 4 4 6 6 and 7 9 kg cod m3 d presumably because pesticide wastewater was more difficult to digest than confectionery wastewater but electrical stimulation boosted the potential for methane recovery du et al 2019 used mec anmbr to treat highly concentrated organic wastewater with cod of 10 g l the methane production was increased to 77 1 in comparison with anmbr other studies tao et al 2020 hu et al 2019 have suggested that the low voltage stimulation has a positive effect on methane recovery broadly higher energy recovery potential was obtained in e anmbr 3 5 performance of eps concentration and ratio of proteins to carbohydrates fig 6 and fig 7 demonstrated that the eps concentration and the proteins carbohydrates pn ch value in suspended sludge and attached sludge the eps in suspended and attached sludge showed an obvious decrease tendency with descending of hrt unquestionably these results showed that the dominant component of eps were proteins which was consistent with the result of hu et al 2020 the average values of eps in suspended sludge were 40 55 0 93 46 72 1 38 58 56 2 10 and 65 78 0 74 mg cod g vss respectively at different stages in c anmbr fig 6 a expectedly compared with c anmbr the concentration of eps in suspended sludge of e anmbr was significantly reduced by 1 71 0 01 times p 0 01 and the observed values were 22 13 0 72 28 62 1 00 33 28 0 90 and 40 60 0 83 mg cod g vss these results indicated that electrochemical stimulation could reduce the eps accumulation and alleviate the membrane fouling zhang et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates decreased from 3 58 0 26 to 3 08 0 19 during the entire process of shortening hrt from 96 h to 24 h in suspended sludge but the value was remained higher than 3 manifesting that the system possessed a correspondingly high sludge activity chen et al 2018 liao et al 2001 robles et al 2013 unfortunately the value of pn chin c anmbr decreased from 3 19 0 04 96 h to 2 86 0 07 24 h implying that sludge might be relatively inactive when the hrt was shortened to 24 h liu et al 2002 demonstrated that microorganisms could enhance structural stability by secreting the secretion of carbohydrates however carbohydrates in eps were preferentially used by microorganisms so the decrease in the value of pn ch may be due to the gradual inhibition of microbial activity by toxicity leading to an increase in the content of residual carbohydrates on the other hand e anmbr not only had lower eps content also with higher value of pn ch which proved that electrical stimulation optimized the self protecting of microbes it also speeded up the utilization of carbohydrates by the metastasis of microorganisms hu et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the content of eps in attached sludge was lower than that of suspended sludge which was directly related to the low concentration of microorganisms attached to the membrane surface chen et al 2018 moreover these results exhibited that the content of eps on the membrane surface of c anmbr was about 2 06 0 23 times that on the membrane of e anmbr similarly with the shortening of hrt microorganisms secreted large eps the eps in attached sludge increased continuously which would lead to a stronger adhesion stress however unlike the eps in suspended sludge the shortening of hrt was accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of pn to ch and the values were detected to be 2 23 0 07 2 60 0 24 3 18 0 24 3 29 0 28 c anmbr and 1 59 0 24 1 64 0 31 2 25 0 41 2 53 0 38 e anmbr the lower ratio of proteins to carbohydrates in the attached sludge of e anmbr corresponded to a higher negative charge which was beneficial to augment the electrostatic repulsion between the sludge and membrane reducing the possibility of pollutant adsorption on the cake layer jiang et al 2020 bani melhem et al 2011 drew a conclusion that applying current to a membrane bioreactor resulted in a significant reduction in the adhesion of eps to the membrane proudly in this study e anmbr also had lower eps content and pn ch value the eps proteins and carbohydrates content and pn ch ratio in attached sludge was significantly diminished p 0 01 with the assistance of electrostimulation which provided potent evidence that e anmbr could slow down membrane fouling and promote the disintegration of the formed membrane 3 6 correlation between sludge settleability and eps the content and the major components carbohydrates proteins of eps in suspended sludge suspended eps were quantified to determine the correlation between components and sludge settleability characteristics svi fig 8 eps content showed a significant positive correlation with svi in both c anmbr r2 0 715 and e anmbr r2 0 706 which could be interpreted as some intracellular eps were released by bacterial autolysis and some biodegradable eps could be preferentially used by filamentous bacteria as substrates to proliferate resulting in the increase of svi the results demonstrated that the sludge settleability was closely connected with eps content and verified that the svi would augment with the increase of eps content implying poor settleability liao et al 2011 guo et al 2014 carbohydrates and proteins contents were both positively correlated with the svi c anmbr r2 0 754 r2 0 694 e anmbr r2 0 708 r2 0 693 however negatively correlation was observed between the ratio of pn to ch and svi in e anmbr r2 0 343 and c anmbr r2 0 671 which may be because the increase of pn ch value would result in the augment of sludge surface hydrophobicity jiang et al 2020 and lead to the separation of mud and wastewater was accelerated however guo et al 2014 suggested that the carbohydrates and proteins fractions of eps were positively and negatively correlated with svi respectively eps played an important role in the operation of membrane bioreactor these results indicated the overall increase of sludge setting performance could reduce the sludge floc in the supernatant retard the membrane fouling rate therefore the relationship models of eps and svi can guide how to adjust the content and composition of eps to control the settleability of activated sludge thus reducing membrane fouling in the current study for e anmbr lower carbohydrates and proteins and higher ratio of pn ch were observed indicating that with the assistance of bio electrochemistry the sludge settleability could be enhanced by improving the properties of eps 3 7 the evolution and distribution of membrane resistance the evolution and distribution of membrane resistance of e anmbr and c anmbr were investigated by using tmp data obtained from filtration experiments at identical membrane flux value 15 l m2 h there was higher total membrane resistance of c anmbr and this phenomenon became aggravation with the reactor running at the first initial 23 days the resistance of c anmbr gradually increased 265 i e from 3 15 1012 to 1 16 1013 m 1 of primeval level while the e anmbr increased about 180 i e from 2 90 1012 to 8 32 1013 m 1 to reduce the tmp the membranes were cleaned during the operation three membrane cleaning operations were carried out after cleaning the resistance of c anmbr was restored to 1 20 1 50 and 1 66 times of the preliminary stage i e 3 79 1012 4 73 1012 and 5 23 1012 m 1 respectively for e anmbr the resistance after cleaning was revived to 3 27 1012 3 55 1012 and 3 61 1012 m 1 respectively these results proved that e anmbr has lower irreversible contamination thus prolonging membrane replacement time as shown in fig 9 a hrt has a great impact on membrane pollution the membrane fouling phenomenon was more serious under the shorter hrt due to the higher organic loading rate olr these results were in accordance with the observation by huang et al 2011 that an increase in olr was accompanied by an increase in fouling rate moreover the fouling rates of e anmbr were 0 99 1 09 1 19 and 1 44 kpa d under hrt of 96 72 48 and 24 h respectively and for c anmbr the average fouling rates were determined to be 1 61 1 77 1 87 and 2 09 kpa d compared with c anmbr e anmbr significantly delayed the membrane fouling rate by 31 0 38 7 p 0 01 wei et al 2012 showed that embr could extend the cleaning cycle at least twice as long as conventional reactors more intuitively chen et al 2020 also indicated that compared with traditional membrane bioreactor the coupled electrochemical membrane bioreactor successfully reduced the fouling rate from 0 99 0 09 kpa d to 0 55 0 10 kpa d the distribution of membrane resistance was shown in fig 9 b which clearly showed that the total membrane resistance rt was dominated by the cake layer resistance rc 75 at each hrt and followed by pore blocking resistance rp 17 at first the membrane intrinsic resistance r0 of c anmbr and e anmbr was basically the same however after each cleaning the membrane intrinsic resistance of c anmbr was greater than that of e anmbr and the difference gradually expanded which further proved that e anmbr could play a promoting role in reducing irreversible pollution thus it was reasonable to believe that the electrical assistance could be recognized as a mature fouling control technology meng et al 2017 chen et al 2020 3 8 relationship between eps characteristics and membrane fouling the relationship between eps characteristics in sludge and membrane fouling rate were conducted to explore the role of eps in the evolution of membrane fouling fig 10 the analysis results showed that the contents of eps in suspended and attached sludge presented a strong positive correlation with the pollution rate r2 0 9 however it was worth noting that the eps in attached sludge attached eps had a stronger positive effect on membrane fouling moreover the obtained results manifested that pn and ch in eps were both the factors affecting membrane fouling and the proteins of the eps in attached sludge played a dominant part in pollution liu et al 2020 performed a statistical analysis of the correlation between eps components and membrane resistance and the results suggested that the amounts of eps and proteins showed stronger positive effects on membrane resistance while polysaccharides had a lighter impact other researchers have reported that proteins was the hydrophobic component of eps which was easy to deposit on the membrane surface thus decreasing the flux of the biofilm formed on the surface of membrane zhou et al 2008 lee 2003 in this study there was a negative correlation between pn ch of eps in suspended sludge suspended eps and membrane fouling which might be attributed to the conclusion drawn in the previous section that the higher the value of pn ch of eps in suspended sludge the better the sludge settling thus generating a decrease in sludge flocs of supernatant however in term of the ratio of pn to ch of attached eps was positively correlated with the membrane fouling rate this was similar to the study of masse et al 2006 which suggested that the appetency between the sludge flocs and proteins was generally stronger than that of polysaccharides and the ratio of polysaccharides proteins was founded to be negatively correlated with the membrane resistance researches liu et al 2020 liao et al 2001 lin et al 2009 have shown that the increase of pn ch would induce the decrease of the hydrophobicity of flocs and sludge was more likely to assemble on the membrane surface with higher viscosity accelerating the generation of biolayer resulting in a poor ability of the flocs to separate from wastewater and membrane pollution was aggravated finally in brief the concentration of eps and the proportion of each component could be employed to manifest the membrane permeability and evolution of membrane fouling and most of the parameters of eps in suspended and attached sludge were positively correlated with membrane fouling except that the pn ch of eps in suspended sludge therefore it could be seen that membrane fouling increased with the shortening of hrt and the e anmbr realized the mitigation of membrane fouling by reducing the eps content proteins carbohydrates and improving the characteristics of eps 4 conclusion the electrode module was employed to improve the sludge performance and alleviate membrane fouling in anmbr for treating pesticide wastewater and the correlation between sludge characteristics and membrane pollution was explored from the results of this work the following conclusions could be made 1 e anmbr successfully enhanced the performance including sludge characteristics stability and energy recovery specifically compared with c anmbr e anmbr significantly reduced sludge yield by 41 2 6 7 and decreased the svi by 32 5 13 8 the vfa accumulation was slighter than that of c anmbr and increased the methane yield by 34 4 17 4 2 the eps contents in suspended and attached sludge were significantly reduced by 41 8 3 3 and 77 4 14 5 compared with c anmbr this has a positive effect on sludge settling 3 e anmbr delayed the fouling rate by 31 0 38 5 and the positive correlation between fouling rate and eps protein carbohydrates concentration was determined 4 the reduction of hrt was accompanied by the degradation of performance and

and draw solute has significant effect on the sludge characteristics and membrane fouling performance in this pilot scale study an electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor e anmbr was proposed for treating pesticide wastewater at different hydraulic retention times hrts demonstrating that e anmbr was superior on improvement of sludge characteristics and mitigation of membrane fouling compared with the conventional anaerobic membrane bioreactor c anmbr e anmbr reduced sludge yield by 41 2 6 7 and the svi was significantly decreased by 32 5 13 8 the accumulation of vfa in e anmbr was slighter than that of c anmbr and the minimum average vfa was 255 6 mg l the methane yield of e anmbr 0 22 0 29 l ch4 g codremoved was 1 2 1 4 times than that of c anmbr the eps contents in suspended and attached sludge of e anmbr were significantly reduced by 41 8 3 3 and 77 4 14 5 than that of c anmbr respectively these results suggested that e anmbr has lower sludge disposal pressure higher stability and methane recovery potential not only that e anmbr successfully reduced membrane resistance delaying the fouling rate by 31 0 38 5 finally the linear relationship between eps

aquatic organisms pan et al 2020 regrettably however treatment of pesticide wastewater containing zoxamide has not been extensively studied the fundamental reason is that the pesticide wastewater has higher toxicity and the compounds containing chlorinated substituents are difficult to be completely degraded shen et al 2012 at present physical chemical and biological technologies are the main ways

efficiency is poor once the influent cod concentration surpass 800 mg l yu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 used a novel aerobic fluidized bed to treat pesticide wastewater and found that the maximum influent cod concentration was about 1600 mg l thus anaerobic treatment is a befitting option because of the refractory characteristics of pesticide wastewater which is considered as an effective way to remove organic pollutants min et al 2020 however these simple anaerobic treatments present some disadvantages such as long hydraulic retention time and poor stability chen et al 2019 which may be the reason why anaerobic process has not been widely studied in treating pesticide wastewater anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr as a new system has the most laudable advantage of high effluent quality due to the micron scale intercept technology and has remarkable effect on treatment of wastewater with high cod robles et al 2020 kaya et al 2019 therefore anmbr may establish an anaerobic system with more effective effect in treating pesticide wastewater what gets in the way is that problems have yet to be properly addressed for anmbrs to the degradation of refractory organic pollutants such as severe membrane fouling which almost always occurs so undoubtedly the application of traditional anmbrs to large scale treatment of pesticide wastewater will inevitably require a large economic investment to membrane cleaning and replacement therefore membrane pollution mitigation is an urgent problem to be solved the characteristics of sludge concentration settleability and extracellular polymers eps concentration in sludge are considered to induce membrane fouling jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2007 thus an alternative system that with economically and technologically feasible to improve sludge characteristics and relieve membrane fouling should be studied imminently recently the novel system which couples with electricity and anaerobic reactor has been promisingly built to improve the efficiency and conquer membrane fouling liu et al 2013 chen et al 2011 demonstrated that the application of voltage could effectively enhance the settling ability of sludge shi et al 2019 proposed that the applied current prominently reduced the eps content in sludge and altered the composition of eps and eps was the main cause of membrane fouling ding et al 2018 also pointed out that anmbr coupled low voltage could alleviate membrane fouling by reducing the concentration of eps and changing its properties liu et al 2013 found that electrochemical membrane bioreactor could produce electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged materials eps sludge flocs etc and membranes then membrane fouling was restrained yang et al 2019 used electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor to treat wastewater which not only reduced membrane pollution but also enhanced energy recovery however electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactors have hardly been used to treat pesticide wastewater hopefully electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactors can improve performance and alleviate membrane pollution in treating pesticide wastewater therefore the current study an electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor e anmbr was established to optimize performance improve sludge characteristics and retard membrane fouling and compared with the conventional anaerobic membrane bioreactor c anmbr the purpose was systematically expressed in the following aspects 1 evaluating the efficiency of e anmbr and c anmbr focusing on sludge characteristics mlss mlvss mlvss mlss sludge yield and sludge settling volatile fatty acids vfa stability and energy recovery biogas production methane content and methane yield 2 investigating the evolution of membrane fouling of e anmbr and c anmbr the formation of eps and the correlation between membrane fouling and eps 3 estimating the effects of hrt on the efficiency and membrane fouling of e anmbr and c anmbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source and characteristics in the present study the raw wastewater came from a pesticide production plant in dalian china which was visually yellow and emitted a pungent odor with cod of 12 000 23 000 mg l total phosphorus tp of 9 31 mg l and total nitrogen tn of 140 370 mg l in addition other substances were also presented including 2 2 3 3 tetramethylcyclopropane 1 2 pentanediol 2 3 dimethyl 2 butene carboxylic acid ethyl acetate benzoic acid 2 dimethylaminoethylester acetone dimethylbenzene tetramethylethylene phenol cyanide moreover some metal ions and acid ions were also included such as na ca2 so4 2 and no2 in this work the e anmbr and c anmbr were fed with wastewater which diluted raw wastewater in a certain proportion about 1 2 2 3 times according to the concentration required for the work 10 365 142 mg l nutrient and micronutrient concentrations were added and adjusted according to the recommendation provided by chen et al 2018 the detailed parameters of raw and the influent pesticide wastewater of e anmbr and c anmbr were shown in table s1 2 2 reactor equipment the e anmbr was designed for treating pesticide wastewater and compared with the c anmbr fig 1 two anmbrs with the same specification were constructed on the basic of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb with 3 m in total height and had a working volume of about 1 5 m3 which composed of major unit biogas collection plant and monitoring system the major unit consisted an intake pump a stirrer an uasb reactor and a membrane separation unit separate sludge sampling ports were set at 0 2 0 5 0 8 and 1 3 m away from the bottom the vacuum pressure gage was mainly responsible for real time monitoring of transmembrane pressure tmp in this study the hollow fiber flat plat

tmp 0 08 mpa the membrane flux was designed as 15 l m2 h the e anmbr was designed as a membrane free single chamber up flow system which built under the three phase separator of the uasb from bottom to top were the cathode the reference electrode saturated calomel electrode sce saturated kcl solution 244 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode and anode the distance between the anode and cathode chamber was kept at 6 cm the volumes of the anode and cathode chambers were 1 1 and the heights were both 22 cm the corrugated sandwich stainless mesh electrode used as the cathode and the sandwich stainless steel mesh mixed with carbon fiber used as anode the dc power supply was applied with an external voltage of 0 4 v and a 10 0 ω external resistor was connected to form a closed loop as the current sampler the potential and current of the cathode anode and reference electrode were collected on line through an external data acquisition system keithley 2700 keithley co usa and the frequency was collected every 10 min 2 3 reactor operation the seed sludge was taken from the real anaerobic reactor from the wastewater treatment plant of a chemical plant and a brewhouse factory and mixed with a ratio of 2 1 with mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 20 6 g l f 0 65 which represents mlss mlvss the experiment was consisted of four stages the operating conditions will be detailed in the table 1 after the systems ran stably cod removal rate was more than 70 or no significant change the effects of different hrts on the performance in the range of 24 96 h was evaluated which with average concentration of cod in influent was kept at 10 365 142 mg l the whole experiment was carried out in an uninterrupted mode and the average temperature was maintained at 20 3 c at the stage of exploring the influence of hrt on performance a total of 218 days were run about 115 days operation and the 103 days of stable operation were selected for the result analysis at the end of each stage the filter cake layer deposited on the membrane surface was quickly washed with water then membrane modules were soaked for 2 h successively with 0 2 hcl and 0 05 naclo and then backwashed for 30 min the concentrations of mlss mlvss and bound eps proteins and carbohydrates were measured termly moreover the sludge characteristics and membrane resistance should also be measured 2 4 chemical analysis methods three parallel wastewater and sludge samples were taken from the different sample points of the e anmbr and c anmbr were immediately analyzed for wastewater cod tn bod5 and sludge characteristics mlss mlvss svi according to the standard methods apha 2005 temperature ph and flow rate were monitored in real time by online sensors the volatile fatty acids vfas were implemented by the method provided by hu et al 2019 and the alkalinity alk was measured by titration suggested by lafay et al 2014 in this work the bound eps was measure the eps in suspended sludge was named as suspended eps and the eps in the sludge attached to the membrane was named as attached eps for eps extraction the method of cationic exchange resin mentioned by frølund et al 1996 was suggested the concentrations of protein and carbohydrate for the eps were measured using lowry folin method and the phenol sulfuric acid method respectively which were propounded by miao et al 2018 tmp was monitored in real time by detecting equipment biogas volume was collected using an air collection bag and measured with a syringe gas chromatograph with fid detector gc 2014c shimadzu japan was employed to determined ch4 and co2 proportion tdx and porapak q chromatographic columns were used for determination 2 5 data analysis spss 22 0 was used for data analysis and statistical significance test in this study the sludge and volatile sludge yield in this study were calculated by eqs 1 2 1 y mls s avg co d removed avg 2 y v mlvs s avg co d removed avg where y and yv represent sludge and volatile sludge yield respectively kg mlss kg codremoved and kg mlvss kg codremoved mlssavg and mlvssavg represent sludge production per day kg d codremoved avg denotes the daily average amount of cod removed kg d the filtration resistance was computed by putting the tmp values into resistance inseries model the resistance values of total rt membrane r0 cake layer rc and pore blocking rp were calculated by eqs 3 6 3 r 0 tm p 0 μ j 0 4 r t tm p t μ j t 5 r p tm p i μ j i r 0 6 r m r t r 0 r p where µ represents the solution viscosity pa s j0 jt and ji denote the membrane flux at different stages m3 m2 s tmp stands for the transmembrane pressure pa tmp0 represents the value presented by the clean membrane in clean water and tmpt represents the value at run time but understand contaminants that can be easily removed by backwashing are considered reversible fouling hence tmpi stands for tmp after relaxation the reference formula for membrane fouling rate average daily increase in tmp calculation was as follows 7 fr tm p t tm p 0 t 1000 where fr is fouling rate kpa d and t is the running time d 3 results and discussion 3 1 the reduction of sludge concentration and yield by e anmbr compared with c anmbr the sludge concentration and yield coefficient were the important parameters for anaerobic biological treatment system control and operation as they determined the effluent quality directly as fig 2 a b showed the concentration of mlss in c anmbr was more concentrated than e anmbr under the different layer of the reactor when hrt was gradually decreased from 96 to 24 h the mlss of e anmbr at 0 2 m was detected about 59 16 5 71 64 59 4 16 62 12 4 57 and 54 81 4 71 g l which was lower than that of c anmbr 70 45 5 25 65 13 4 21 62 98 5 12 and 59 96 3 14 g l indicating that the longer hrt the higher the sludge concentration at the bottom of the reactor it was noted that there was distinct layer at the height of 1 3 m and the mlss of 1 41 0 09 1 71 0 08 2 05 0 11 and 2 43 0 17 g l were present in the highest sampling point of c anmbr the sludge concentration stratification was more obvious due to some physical interception of the electrode unit in e anmbr as seen in fig 2 c d the average concentrations of mlss and mlvss in both c anmbr and e anmbr increased with a shortening of hrt the concentration of mlss in c anmbr was 43 91 2 51 44 83 2 67 47 92 4 52 and 50 82 7 07 g l at hrt was 96 72 48 and 24 h respectively however the mlss concentration in e anmbr was significantly reduced to 40 01 0 95 41 06 1 65 43 41 2 48 and 44 97 3 77 g l p 0 01 which decreased by 8 4 11 5 compared with c anmbr moreover the average mlvss mlss of c anmbr was detected range from 0 66 0 01 to 0 60 0 01 when the hrt decreased from 96 h to 24 h but significantly enhanced to 0 71 0 01 0 70 0 01 0 69 0 02 and 0 65 0 01 p 0 01 due to the contribution of electrochemistry the sludge yield was measured as an important variable in the study of sludge characteristics it can be seen from fig 2 e f the sludge yield observed in e anmbr was 0 061 0 071 0 071 and 0 081 kg mlss kg codremoved while the values of c anmbr were 0 104 0 102 0 128 and 0 157 kg mlss kg codremoved which was 1 69 0 17 times of e anmbr kong et al 2021 used anmbr to treat municipal wastewater with hrt of 12 8 and 6 h when 1 g cod was removed about 0 19 0 26 g mlss was converted which was slightly larger than this study this may be related to the difference wastewater quality and microorganism matheus et al 2020 used moving bed biofilm reactor to treat pesticide wastewater with cod concentration of 458 687 mg l sludge production was kept at average 0 18 kg m3 d moreover the volatile sludge yield was 0 077 0 012 kg mlvss kgcodremoved c anmbr and was significantly less to 0 053 0 008 kg mlvss kgcodremoved of e anmbr p 0 01 these results shown that the shortening of hrt was accompanied by the increase of sludge yield which could be explained by the fact that suspended solids were flocculated and trapped in the sludge and were not used for anaerobic this was consistent with the study of cheng et al 2021 that the digestible cod left undigested would eventually be converted into residual sludge however bioelectrochemistry enhanced biodegradation and the ratio of cod digestion to methane was increased so the cod content converted to sludge was reduced zohreh et al 2020 indicated that bio electrochemical system has practical significance to reduce the burden of sludge treatment in practical application in summary the sludge yield of e anmbr and c anmbr both increased with the shortening of hrt in this study but the sludge yield of e anmbr was lower compared with c anmbr at the same hrt 3 2 performance of sludge settleability fig 3 demonstrated that the e anmbr has a superior sludge settleability compared with c anmbr with a higher zone sludge velocity zsv and lower sludge volume index svi settlement tests were conducted with the suspended sludge 1 3 m from e anmbr and c anmbr vesilind model was employed to quantify the settleability of sludge the velocity of sludge hindered settling v was confirmed by considering linear fitting of the region where displacement t has constant slope the results were shown in the fig 3 a b these results clearly indicated that the sludge settling speed was much higher with the assistance of electrochemistry compared with c anmbr the settling velocity of e anmbr was observed range between 1 367 and 0 761 cm min which about 37 116 p 0 01 higher than that of c anmbr the vesilind models were established with velocity as a function of mlss concentration and were shown in fig 3 c which were converted to the equations as follows 8 e anmbr v 10 25 exp 0 1182 x t 9 c anmbr v 9 55 exp 0 1195 x t e anmbr had larger v0 and lower k values of 10 25 and 0 1182 respectively while that were 9 55 and 0 1195 of c anmbr vesilind equations showed zsv of e anmbr was larger indicating that the sludge in e anmbr was easier to be compressed moreover svi also indicated that sludge settleability become worse with the decrease of hrt the average values of svi were increased from 24 3 to 36 4 ml g c anmbr and increased from 16 2 to 25 3 ml g e anmbr however the svi of e anmbr was significantly lower than that of c anmbr by 32 5 13 8 p 0 01 which proved that electrode module could improve sludge settleability these results were consistent with the previous reports such as chen et al 2011 proposed that the application of electrical field may lead to the change of sludge characteristics by causing some physicochemical changes in the applied media kargi and konya 2007 have found that the svi would decrease with increasing hrt 3 3 performance of volatile fatty acid and alkalinity volatile fatty acid vfa and alkalinity were important indicators to evaluate anaerobic digestion and their ratio α was a more direct expression of the stability of the system gong et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 a and fig s3 the alkalinity of e anmbr and c anmbr showed a gradual downward trend with the decrease of hrt might attributed to the increase of toxic substances resulted in the accumulation of vfa and the consumption of alkalinity hu et al 2020 generally the alkalinity value observed in e anmbr was much larger than that of c anmbr demonstrating that e anmbr could efficiently inhabit the anaerobic system acidification the average alkalinity of e anmbr was observed at 2761 434 2659 229 1878 105 and 1440 83 mg l under the hrt from 96 h to 24 h which was significantly higher p 0 01 than c anmbr 1831 158 1524 53 1370 66 and 1264 46 mg l these results showed that the vfa concentrations of e anmbr and c anmbr were almost kept at low values 500 mg l during the experimental period indicating the stability of reactors however the results also showed that the vfa was greatly influenced by the hrt as well as alkalinity the average vfa of e anmbr was observed at 255 6 267 3 309 19 and 441 21 mg l under the hrt from 96 to 24 h which was significantly lower p 0 01 than that of c anmbr 320 8 338 5 415 26 and 549 31 mg l the accumulation of vfa in the anaerobic system would inevitably lead to the inhibition of methanogen activity and the consequent impact on pollutant removal efficiency hu et al 2020 resoundingly the e anmbr with a conspicuous improvement in the utilization of vfa due to the external voltage implantation cui et al 2014 also pointed out that the introduction of electrode blocks could promote the effective utilization of pollutants were degraded by vfa thus reducing the accumulation of vfa the average values of vfa alkalinity α of e anmbr were 0 09 0 02 0 10 0 01 0 16 0 01 and 0 31 0 03 under different hrts fig 4c respectively and the α of c anmbr was 0 18 0 01 0 22 0 01 0 30 0 03 and 0 43 0 02 these results indicating that hrt of 24 h was the limitation for the two reactors as the microbial activity was affected and degrade pollutants was burdensome under the high loading rate condition it was noteworthy that as the increasing of vfa and decreasing of alkalinity led the average value of α in c anmbr dramatically increased to 0 43 0 02 under hrt of 24 h which was much above the theoretical critical value α 0 3 in the e anmbr although the vfa showed a slightly upward trend and the alkalinity showed slightly decreased trend the value of α was stable control lower than 0 3 at most of time this probably due to a small amount of electrode active bacteria which can effectively use vfa acetate as the substrate for current generation in the electrochemistry system thus ensuring a lower vfa cui et al 2014 in addition it was reasonable to believe that the application of electrochemical stimulation was beneficial to maintain the stability of the system under lower hrt and could slow down the suppression of vfa on methanogens ensuring a good performance wang et al 2020 hu et al 2019 3 4 performance of energy recovery potential fig 5 demonstrated that biogas production and methane production of e anmbr were much higher than c anmbr under all the operation conditions it was observed that the average biogas production of e anmbr was 810 42 1144 53 1577 44 and 3652 85 l d m3 reactor under hrt of 96 72 48 and 24 h respectively which about 1 10 1 38 times of c anmbr 735 67 905 90 985 123 and 1767 1153 l d m3 reactor with the shortening of hrt the daily biogas production increased which might be due to the increase of influent organic load leading to the generation of more gas in the degradation process the methane content of e anmbr was observed range between 56 9 and 71 5 while that of c anmbr was 54 1 64 9 these results indicated that e anmbr had a superior methane production compared with c anmbr due to the co metabolic was emphasized gao et al 2021 also confirmed that bioelectrochemistry could achieve accelerated biodegradation and biogas production the average methane yield of e anmbr and c anmbr was identified as 0 27 0 01 0 29 0 01 0 26 0 01 0 22 0 02 l ch4 g codremoved and 0 22 0 01 0 22 0 01 0 18 0 01 0 16 0 01 l ch4 g codremoved at four hrt conditions respectively during the whole operation time e anmbr significantly increased the methane production by 34 4 17 4 p 0 01 compared with c anmbr the methane yield of this study was lower than the research of balcıoğlu et al 2021 which reported methane productions of 0 31 0 31 0 26 and 0 26 l ch4 g codremoved using anmbr to treat confectionery wastewater under olrs of 2 2 4 4 6 6 and 7 9 kg cod m3 d presumably because pesticide wastewater was more difficult to digest than confectionery wastewater but electrical stimulation boosted the potential for methane recovery du et al 2019 used mec anmbr to treat highly concentrated organic wastewater with cod of 10 g l the methane production was increased to 77 1 in comparison with anmbr other studies tao et al 2020 hu et al 2019 have suggested that the low voltage stimulation has a positive effect on methane recovery broadly higher energy recovery potential was obtained in e anmbr 3 5 performance of eps concentration and ratio of proteins to carbohydrates fig 6 and fig 7 demonstrated that the eps concentration and the proteins carbohydrates pn ch value in suspended sludge and attached sludge the eps in suspended and attached sludge showed an obvious decrease tendency with descending of hrt unquestionably these results showed that the dominant component of eps were proteins which was consistent with the result of hu et al 2020 the average values of eps in suspended sludge were 40 55 0 93 46 72 1 38 58 56 2 10 and 65 78 0 74 mg cod g vss respectively at different stages in c anmbr fig 6 a expectedly compared with c anmbr the concentration of eps in suspended sludge of e anmbr was significantly reduced by 1 71 0 01 times p 0 01 and the observed values were 22 13 0 72 28 62 1 00 33 28 0 90 and 40 60 0 83 mg cod g vss these results indicated that electrochemical stimulation could reduce the eps accumulation and alleviate the membrane fouling zhang et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates decreased from 3 58 0 26 to 3 08 0 19 during the entire process of shortening hrt from 96 h to 24 h in suspended sludge but the value was remained higher than 3 manifesting that the system possessed a correspondingly high sludge activity chen et al 2018 liao et al 2001 robles et al 2013 unfortunately the value of pn chin c anmbr decreased from 3 19 0 04 96 h to 2 86 0 07 24 h implying that sludge might be relatively inactive when the hrt was shortened to 24 h liu et al 2002 demonstrated that microorganisms could enhance structural stability by secreting the secretion of carbohydrates however carbohydrates in eps were preferentially used by microorganisms so the decrease in the value of pn ch may be due to the gradual inhibition of microbial activity by toxicity leading to an increase in the content of residual carbohydrates on the other hand e anmbr not only had lower eps content also with higher value of pn ch which proved that electrical stimulation optimized the self protecting of microbes it also speeded up the utilization of carbohydrates by the metastasis of microorganisms hu et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the content of eps in attached sludge was lower than that of suspended sludge which was directly related to the low concentration of microorganisms attached to the membrane surface chen et al 2018 moreover these results exhibited that the content of eps on the membrane surface of c anmbr was about 2 06 0 23 times that on the membrane of e anmbr similarly with the shortening of hrt microorganisms secreted large eps the eps in attached sludge increased continuously which would lead to a stronger adhesion stress however unlike the eps in suspended sludge the shortening of hrt was accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of pn to ch and the values were detected to be 2 23 0 07 2 60 0 24 3 18 0 24 3 29 0 28 c anmbr and 1 59 0 24 1 64 0 31 2 25 0 41 2 53 0 38 e anmbr the lower ratio of proteins to carbohydrates in the attached sludge of e anmbr corresponded to a higher negative charge which was beneficial to augment the electrostatic repulsion between the sludge and membrane reducing the possibility of pollutant adsorption on the cake layer jiang et al 2020 bani melhem et al 2011 drew a conclusion that applying current to a membrane bioreactor resulted in a significant reduction in the adhesion of eps to the membrane proudly in this study e anmbr also had lower eps content and pn ch value the eps proteins and carbohydrates content and pn ch ratio in attached sludge was significantly diminished p 0 01 with the assistance of electrostimulation which provided potent evidence that e anmbr could slow down membrane fouling and promote the disintegration of the formed membrane 3 6 correlation between sludge settleability and eps the content and the major components carbohydrates proteins of eps in suspended sludge suspended eps were quantified to determine the correlation between components and sludge settleability characteristics svi fig 8 eps content showed a significant positive correlation with svi in both c anmbr r2 0 715 and e anmbr r2 0 706 which could be interpreted as some intracellular eps were released by bacterial autolysis and some biodegradable eps could be preferentially used by filamentous bacteria as substrates to proliferate resulting in the increase of svi the results demonstrated that the sludge settleability was closely connected with eps content and verified that the svi would augment with the increase of eps content implying poor settleability liao et al 2011 guo et al 2014 carbohydrates and proteins contents were both positively correlated with the svi c anmbr r2 0 754 r2 0 694 e anmbr r2 0 708 r2 0 693 however negatively correlation was observed between the ratio of pn to ch and svi in e anmbr r2 0 343 and c anmbr r2 0 671 which may be because the increase of pn ch value would result in the augment of sludge surface hydrophobicity jiang et al 2020 and lead to the separation of mud and wastewater was accelerated however guo et al 2014 suggested that the carbohydrates and proteins fractions of eps were positively and negatively correlated with svi respectively eps played an important role in the operation of membrane bioreactor these results indicated the overall increase of sludge setting performance could reduce the sludge floc in the supernatant retard the membrane fouling rate therefore the relationship models of eps and svi can guide how to adjust the content and composition of eps to control the settleability of activated sludge thus reducing membrane fouling in the current study for e anmbr lower carbohydrates and proteins and higher ratio of pn ch were observed indicating that with the assistance of bio electrochemistry the sludge settleability could be enhanced by improving the properties of eps 3 7 the evolution and distribution of membrane resistance the evolution and distribution of membrane resistance of e anmbr and c anmbr were investigated by using tmp data obtained from filtration experiments at identical membrane flux value 15 l m2 h there was higher total membrane resistance of c anmbr and this phenomenon became aggravation with the reactor running at the first initial 23 days the resistance of c anmbr gradually increased 265 i e from 3 15 1012 to 1 16 1013 m 1 of primeval level while the e anmbr increased about 180 i e from 2 90 1012 to 8 32 1013 m 1 to reduce the tmp the membranes were cleaned during the operation three membrane cleaning operations were carried out after cleaning the resistance of c anmbr was restored to 1 20 1 50 and 1 66 times of the preliminary stage i e 3 79 1012 4 73 1012 and 5 23 1012 m 1 respectively for e anmbr the resistance after cleaning was revived to 3 27 1012 3 55 1012 and 3 61 1012 m 1 respectively these results proved that e anmbr has lower irreversible contamination thus prolonging membrane replacement time as shown in fig 9 a hrt has a great impact on membrane pollution the membrane fouling phenomenon was more serious under the shorter hrt due to the higher organic loading rate olr these results were in accordance with the observation by huang et al 2011 that an increase in olr was accompanied by an increase in fouling rate moreover the fouling rates of e anmbr were 0 99 1 09 1 19 and 1 44 kpa d under hrt of 96 72 48 and 24 h respectively and for c anmbr the average fouling rates were determined to be 1 61 1 77 1 87 and 2 09 kpa d compared with c anmbr e anmbr significantly delayed the membrane fouling rate by 31 0 38 7 p 0 01 wei et al 2012 showed that embr could extend the cleaning cycle at least twice as long as conventional reactors more intuitively chen et al 2020 also indicated that compared with traditional membrane bioreactor the coupled electrochemical membrane bioreactor successfully reduced the fouling rate from 0 99 0 09 kpa d to 0 55 0 10 kpa d the distribution of membrane resistance was shown in fig 9 b which clearly showed that the total membrane resistance rt was dominated by the cake layer resistance rc 75 at each hrt and followed by pore blocking resistance rp 17 at first the membrane intrinsic resistance r0 of c anmbr and e anmbr was basically the same however after each cleaning the membrane intrinsic resistance of c anmbr was greater than that of e anmbr and the difference gradually expanded which further proved that e anmbr could play a promoting role in reducing irreversible pollution thus it was reasonable to believe that the electrical assistance could be recognized as a mature fouling control technology meng et al 2017 chen et al 2020 3 8 relationship between eps characteristics and membrane fouling the relationship between eps characteristics in sludge and membrane fouling rate were conducted to explore the role of eps in the evolution of membrane fouling fig 10 the analysis results showed that the contents of eps in suspended and attached sludge presented a strong positive correlation with the pollution rate r2 0 9 however it was worth noting that the eps in attached sludge attached eps had a stronger positive effect on membrane fouling moreover the obtained results manifested that pn and ch in eps were both the factors affecting membrane fouling and the proteins of the eps in attached sludge played a dominant part in pollution liu et al 2020 performed a statistical analysis of the correlation between eps components and membrane resistance and the results suggested that the amounts of eps and proteins showed stronger positive effects on membrane resistance while polysaccharides had a lighter impact other researchers have reported that proteins was the hydrophobic component of eps which was easy to deposit on the membrane surface thus decreasing the flux of the biofilm formed on the surface of membrane zhou et al 2008 lee 2003 in this study there was a negative correlation between pn ch of eps in suspended sludge suspended eps and membrane fouling which might be attributed to the conclusion drawn in the previous section that the higher the value of pn ch of eps in suspended sludge the better the sludge settling thus generating a decrease in sludge flocs of supernatant however in term of the ratio of pn to ch of attached eps was positively correlated with the membrane fouling rate this was similar to the study of masse et al 2006 which suggested that the appetency between the sludge flocs and proteins was generally stronger than that of polysaccharides and the ratio of polysaccharides proteins was founded to be negatively correlated with the membrane resistance researches liu et al 2020 liao et al 2001 lin et al 2009 have shown that the increase of pn ch would induce the decrease of the hydrophobicity of flocs and sludge was more likely to assemble on the membrane surface with higher viscosity accelerating the generation of biolayer resulting in a poor ability of the flocs to separate from wastewater and membrane pollution was aggravated finally in brief the concentration of eps and the proportion of each component could be employed to manifest the membrane permeability and evolution of membrane fouling and most of the parameters of eps in suspended and attached sludge were positively correlated with membrane fouling except that the pn ch of eps in suspended sludge therefore it could be seen that membrane fouling increased with the shortening of hrt and the e anmbr realized the mitigation of membrane fouling by reducing the eps content proteins carbohydrates and improving the characteristics of eps 4 conclusion the electrode module was employed to improve the sludge performance and alleviate membrane fouling in anmbr for treating pesticide wastewater and the correlation between sludge characteristics and membrane pollution was explored from the results of this work the following conclusions could be made 1 e anmbr successfully enhanced the performance including sludge characteristics stability and energy recovery specifically compared with c anmbr e anmbr significantly reduced sludge yield by 41 2 6 7 and decreased the svi by 32 5 13 8 the vfa accumulation was slighter than that of c anmbr and increased the methane yield by 34 4 17 4 2 the eps contents in suspended and attached sludge were significantly reduced by 41 8 3 3 and 77 4 14 5 compared with c anmbr this has a positive effect on sludge settling 3 e anmbr delayed the fouling rate by 31 0 38 5 and the positive correlation between fouling rate and eps protein carbohydrates concentration was determined 4 the reduction of hrt was accompanied by the degradation of performance and acceleration of membrane fouling declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the
