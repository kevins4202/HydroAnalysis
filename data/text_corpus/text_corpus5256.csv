26280,globally urban infill is stressing existing stormwater systems necessitating costly infrastructure upgrades although household rainwater tanks provide significant distributed storage they have virtually no impact on reducing peak flows for rare long duration events this study introduces an innovative smart systems approach to operating tanks to overcome this limitation smart tanks are operated as systems and tank opening closing is optimised to reduce peak flows to evaluate the proposed approach we develop a simulation optimization model by coupling swmm with a multi objective genetic algorithm the results for a two allotment case study show a consistent reduction in peak flows for a 24 h 1 in 100 year storm for a range of rainfall patterns and tank sizes for example a system of 10 kl smart tanks reduced peak flows by 39 48 compared with the same sized retention tanks this smart systems approach provides an opportunity to reduce the cost of stormwater infrastructure

and modica 2016 gilroy and mccuen 2009 schubert et al 2017 recent developments also include the use of smart tank technology to reduce flood peaks for example products such as raingrid inc canada https www raingrid com and south east water s australia tank talk allow rainwater tanks fitted with a remote controlled outlet orifice to purge retained water prior to a forecasted rainfall event to maximise storage capacity with the aim of minimising peak outflows burns et al 2015b a key limitation of rainwater tanks in relation to flood control is that they have virtually no impact on the peak flows resulting from long duration rainfall events damodaram et al 2010 schubert et al 2017 vaes and berlamont 2001 this limitation occurs because in such events tanks fill to capacity partway through the event which means that the tanks have no impact for the remainder of the storm consequently for catchments where the total runoff from long duration events exceeds the maximum storage capacity of the tanks additional alternative means of mitigating flood peaks are required e g upgrading existing stormwater systems or providing new stormwater infrastructure such as detention basins upgrading infrastructure in this way has a number of disadvantages including 1 the potentially high cost of providing the required modifications extensions to existing stormwater systems 2 the potential loss of public open spaces and 3 the potential increase in the velocities of outflows which can negatively impact receiving environments these issues are likely to become increasingly important as urban flood risk increases due to climate change and urban development jato espino et al 2017 löwe et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 contrary to the findings of the studies mentioned above we argue in this short communication that systems of individual household rainwater tanks can be used to reduce the peak flows associated with long duration rainfall events this could potentially reduce and or eliminate the need for stormwater system upgrades due to urban infill and hence reduce costs increase open space and reduce impacts on receiving environments the premise underpinning this argument is that the reason for the inability of household rainwater tanks to cater to long duration rainfall events in previous studies is that the outflows from the tanks were not controlled during the rainfall events in contrast if tank outflows are controlled during long duration rainfall events and tanks are operated as systems rather than separately it is possible to reduce the peak flows from long duration rainfall events significantly by using existing household rainwater tanks consequently the objectives of this short communication are to propose a smart systems approach for operating smart rainwater tanks as a way to reduce the peak flow rate in urban stormwater systems develop a simulation optimization approach for testing the proposed smart systems approach on a simple idealised two allotment catchment for a series of rare long duration storm events analyse peak flow reduction performance and characteristics of optimal operational schemes for smart rainwater tank systems with tanks of different sizes and under different rainfall conditions 2 proposed smart systems approach for using smart rainwater tank systems to reduce urban flood peaks the concept underpinning the proposed smart systems approach is that stormwater system flood peaks can be reduced by using real time tank operation to offset the timing of the flood peaks from different sub catchments the key difference from previous studies is that operations from multiple tanks are simultaneously optimised at a system scale during the storm event rather than solely applying a blanket rule to empty all tanks prior to a storm event from a practical perspective this approach requires 1 individual tanks that can be operated independently i e orifices of individual tanks can be opened and closed at different times to achieve a systems scale objective and 2 real time control of tanks that needs to allow sufficiently precise timing of tank operation to provide optimal detention capacity in each storage when peak inflows arrive the proposed approach and underpinning concept can be illustrated by considering the idealised two storage smart tank system shown in fig 1 as can be seen the tanks receive roof runoff each from a separate roof catchment conveyed by a gutter and downpipe the tank outlet orifices and overflows not shown are connected via an outlet pipe to discharge into a kerb and gutter then roof runoff and ground surface runoff flow into the side entry pit and sub surface stormwater pipe in the idealised system presented it is assumed that the tank outlet orifices can be opened and closed fully or partially using a remotely controlled actuator that the rainfall intensities at one hour time steps for the duration of the storm are known at the beginning of the storm event to inform the real time orifice operation and that the tanks are emptied prior to the storm fig 2 illustrates the hypothesized system performance and operation for the tank system depicted in fig 1 under a rainfall event with sufficient average rainfall intensity and duration to result in a total runoff volume that exceeds total tank storage capacity for two different operating schemes the first is a traditional smart tank operating scheme where tanks are emptied prior to the storm and the outlet orifices of both tanks are shut from the start to the end of the storm event for example the operation of the smart tank in xu et al 2018 resulting in both storages acting as retention tanks the second is a smart systems operating scheme which represents an example of the proposed approach to operating smart tanks as a system where the orifices of the tanks are opened or closed at different times during the storm to reduce the system peak outflow rate as can be seen from fig 2 1 for the traditional scheme both tanks fill at the same rate from the start of the storm until both tanks are full after the tanks are full the runoff from the roofs of both houses q s1 and q s2 contribute to the system outflow q system simultaneously resulting in large coincident peaks fig 2 1 c in contrast for the smart system scheme fig 2 2 only one of the tanks is closed at the beginning of the storm with the other only closed once the first tank is full as a result the runoff peaks from the two roofs q s1 and q s2 are offset distributing the runoff over a longer duration and reducing peak runoff for the system max q system fig 2 2 d this reduction in peak flows occurs because at the time storage 2 reaches capacity storage 1 is only partially full and can retain subsequent inflows from its sub catchment fig 2 2 c as such at the time when total inflow rates are highest only one sub catchment roof connected to tank 2 contributes to the q system peak flow fig 2 2 d 3 methodology in order to test the utility of the proposed smart tank systems approach a number of computational experiments were conducted to determine the potential peak flow reduction performance that can be achieved for a simple two tank case study for a range of 24 h duration storms and tank sizes these experiments were performed using a simulation optimization approach as part of which a genetic algorithm is coupled with the swmm simulation model to determine the optimal operational policy for each tank for different storm patterns and tank sizes to ensure the maximum possible reductions in peak flow could be achieved details of the case study system are given in the next section the stormwater model and optimization approach used the system configurations and rainfall patterns trialled and the baseline scenarios used as performance benchmarks are detailed in the following sections 3 1 case study the case study area is based on a theoretical urban two allotment catchment in mitcham latitude 34 9875 s longitude 138 6375 e a suburb of adelaide south australia australia the region has a mediterranean climate and the catchment consists of 1 two 300 m2 allotments for residential infill each with 200 m2 roof area which is a typical development for the mitcham area and 2 half the road reserve and verge adjacent to the allotments the area is likely to experience an increase in infill urban development for at least the next 30 years which will cause increased stress on existing underground stormwater drains the estimated median rainwater tank size in greater adelaide which bounds mitcham is 5 kl maheepala et al 2014 the catchment characteristics are shown in table 1 3 2 stormwater system simulation model a stormwater model of the two storage system fig 1 on the case study site was developed in swmm v5 1 rossman 2004 swmm was selected as the stormwater simulation package as it allows for real time control rtc rules to be customised for each simulation can accurately estimate the theoretical hydraulic behaviour of the stormwater system and has been used successfully in a range of urban flood impact studies kong et al 2017 riaño briceño et al 2016 the model system consists of a smart rainwater tank connected to each roof with outlet orifices and overflows directly connected to a downstream stormwater pipe the swmm model is available in supplementary material s1 the real time control rules used in the study determine the opening of the orifice for each tank at each one hour time step during each 24 h storm the model is intended to represent an idealised system in order to estimate an upper limit for peak flow reduction performance for the proposed approach as such the following key assumptions were made for the stormwater system simulation model 1 a perfect forecast of rainfall intensities for a 24 h storm at 1 h time steps is available which enables smart tanks to be operated as a system with certainty that decisions made at each time step will lead to the maximum possible total peak flow reduction 2 100 connectivity of roof runoff to tank inlet assuming all roof runoff is conveyed to tanks during the storms 3 orifice openings can be controlled with precision to achieve a desired discharge rate assuming a known stage discharge behaviour for fully and partially opened orifices is available 4 runoff travel time from each allotment to the downstream discharge point is identical 5 runoff freely discharges at the drainage outlet 3 3 optimal outlet control the objective function used for the optimal control of the opening of the orifice was to minimise the peak system discharge rate for the duration of the 24 h storm i e min max q system minimising total tank volume required vs1 vs2 was also an objective i e min vs1 vs2 the decision variables were the opening of the orifice on each tank at each one hour time step i e one operating scheme constitutes the selection from the 11 percentage opening options 0 100 at 10 intervals for both tanks for each of the 24 time steps and initial condition and tank size for s1 assuming vs1 vs2 consequently the search space was 1125 1125 1 1739e 52 possible operating schemes for each physical configuration justifying the use of a formal optimization approach to identify the optimal operational strategies a variant of the nsga ii genetic algorithm deb et al 2002 was used to solve the optimization problem outlined above as nsga ii or its variants have been demonstrated to work well over a wide range of storm and rainwater tank systems optimization studies beh et al 2017 blinco et al 2017 di matteo et al 2017b lee et al 2012 marchi et al 2016 zare et al 2012 including a smart rainwater tank operation study behzadian et al 2018 the optimatics optimizer software was used to facilitate the optimization analysis which links the swmm model to the genetic algorithm for each optimization run the algorithm evolved a population of 100 operating schemes over 1000 generations resulting in optimal or near optimal solutions to the optimization problem i e optimal operating schemes for each tank size each optimization run was repeated five times for different starting random number seeds and the optimal solutions were aggregated and dominant solutions identified to reduce the impact of the stochastic operators used to generate solutions the optimal operating scheme s identified for a given tank orifice combination was the one that minimised the peak system discharge rate 3 4 trials 3 4 1 system configuration a system configuration consisted of one tank size and orifice size combination which was adopted for both tanks in the system table 2 shows the rainwater tank parameters trialled a total of four smart rainwater tank sizes were considered representing a range of above ground storage sizes that could practically fit within one allotment s outdoor area the orifice sizes tested for each storage size were between 10 mm and 60 mm which represents a lower and upper limit on the orifice size typically utilised on allotment scale detention storages all tanks were assumed to be emptied prior to the beginning of each storm per the traditional smart tank operating scheme adopted in xu et al 2018 3 4 2 rainfall patterns each of the system configurations was tested for ten rainfall patterns for a 1 in 100 year 24 h storm generated for the case study site a 1 in 100 year event was selected so that the system could be tested under extreme conditions and a 24 h 1440 min duration was selected as rainwater tanks typically fail in long duration events as mentioned in the introduction fig 3 shows the ten patterns generated using the watercom pty ltd arr 2016 rainfall pattern spreadsheet http www watercom com au download html all storms had 5 mm h average rainfall intensity and 120 mm total rainfall depth it was assumed any pre burst rainfall was of sufficiently low intensity that runoff could pass through open orifices on the storages ensuring the storages would be empty before the storm 3 5 performance evaluation changes in peak flows in order to assess the performance of the smart systems approach the change in system peak flow was compared against a baseline scenario of a system with no tanks installed no tank scenario hence the peak flow change for a trial consisting of the ith system configuration and jth rainfall pattern was determined as follows 1 system peak flow change max q s y s t e m i j max q s y s t e m b a s e l i n e j 1 100 where max q s y s t e m i j was the system outlet peak flow rate for the trial and max q s y s t e m b a s e l i n e j was the system outlet peak flowrate for the no tanks scenario during the simulation with the jth rainfall pattern the other scenario used for comparison was a system with 10 kl tanks operated using a traditional retention based smart tank operating scheme with tank emptied prior to the storm and orifice closed for the duration of the storm which was adopted as the real time control approach in xu et al 2018 4 results and discussion the peak flow reduction performance for the optimal operating scheme s for each trial i e system configuration and rainfall pattern combination was determined from the optimization results available in supplementary material s2 most trials had more than one operating scheme that resulted in the maximum peak flow reduction the performance of optimal schemes for each tank size and real time operation of one optimal scheme for a 5 kl smart systems scenario are analysed in this section 4 1 smart systems peak flow performance fig 4 shows the changes in system peak flow rate equation 1 achieved by using the smart systems approach compared with a traditional smart tank retention approach for a range of different smart tank sizes the key trend is that the smart systems approach consistently resulted in a reduction of peak flows irrespective of rainfall pattern and even for small tank sizes for example for 1 2 5 kl tanks the peak flow reduction ranged from 15 to 38 as tank sizes increased the magnitude of the peak flow reduction also increased for 5 kl tanks the reduction ranged from 20 to 48 while for 10 kl tanks the reduction ranged from 39 to 48 in contrast the 10 kl tanks operated as a traditional smart retention tank resulted in no reduction in peak flows compared to the no tanks scenario the variation in peak flow reductions obtained using the smart systems approach for different storms fig 4 is due to slight differences in the ability to offset the peaks from the two sub catchments based on the different storm patterns see section 4 2 for an explanation of the interaction between the inflow from a particular storm pattern and the corresponding orifice operating strategy to minimise peak system outflow this variation diminished with increasing tank size varying between 23 for the 1 kl tanks to 9 for the 10 kl tanks 4 2 smart systems operation for the purpose of illustrating how the smart tank systems controls were able to result in the reductions in peak outflows shown in fig 4 fig 5 compares and contrasts the simulated real time performance of two 10 kl smart retention tanks column 1 and a two 5 kl smart tank system with real time outlet controls column 2 for a 1 in 100 year ari 24 h storm pattern 1 fig 3 fig 5 1 shows that the 10 kl retention tanks did not have sufficient capacity to capture the first peak t 11 h or second peak inflows t 16 h and consequently spilled during these inflows at the arrival of the first peak the tanks each had only 1 02 kl spare capacity fig 5 1 a and c as a result the traditional smart retention tanks spilled during the first peak in a similar manner as the retention tank in the example in fig 2 which resulted in no mitigation of the outflow peak flow rate for the storm fig 5 1 d fig 5 2 illustrates how the smart systems approach produced a peak outflow reduction because the tank operation was optimised to provide sufficient detention capacity to capture the two large peak inflows prior to the first peak inflow t 1 to t 10 h both tanks remained mostly open fig 5 2 b consequently at t 11 h the tanks had sufficient spare capacity 4 46 kl in s1 and 4 27 kl in s2 to detain the first peak fig 5 2 c operating decisions during the period from the arrival of the first peak to the arrival of second peak inflow t 11 to t 16 h were critical to minimise the outflow rate from the second peak fig 5 2 d both tanks orifices remained partially open during the first peak then closed at t 12 h when both tanks were nearly full at t 13 h tank 1 began to purge however tank 2 purged one time step later at t 14 h the delayed purge produced an offset in the peak orifice outflows caused by the high head in each tank this behaviour ensured the peak orifice outflows were not coincident and thereby produced a lower system peak outflow during that time period similar to the hypothesized behaviour as illustrated in fig 2 since the tanks purged in the period between peaks they had sufficient spare capacity 5 00 kl in s1 and 4 54 kl in s2 to detain the second peak inflow after the second peak just as tank 1 was about to spill simultaneously with tank 2 at t 19 h tank 1 s orifice opening increased partially to purge pre emptively which avoided spill at a later time this example provides a demonstration of the research hypothesis that smart tanks operated as a system can yield improved peak outflow reduction performance compared with 1 simply purging tanks before a storm and not operating them during the storm and 2 blanket operation rules applying to all tanks simultaneously during a storm by optimising the opening and closing of the tanks throughout the storm the inflow peaks can be detained and the outflow peaks can be timed to ensure they are not coincident this approach resulted in system peak flow reductions of the order of 39 48 reduction for 10 kl tanks 5 conclusions and future research the results of this study demonstrate that by using a smart systems approach allotment scale rainwater tanks can potentially be operated to significantly reduce runoff peaks to downstream stormwater drainage systems during rare long duration storms this reduction in runoff peaks can be achieved by operating the tanks as a system during the storm to provide capacity to detain inflow peaks and limit coincident outflow peaks a simple two allotment stormwater simulation model was developed representing this smart systems approach where smart tanks are connected to allotment roofs and simulated for a case study site in adelaide south australia the orifice opening proportion for each tank at one hour time steps for the duration of a 1 in 100 year 24 h storm was optimised for different tank sizes and rainfall patterns using an evolutionary optimization algorithm the results demonstrate that for the case study site under ideal simulation conditions the smart systems approach consistently produced peak flow reductions regardless of rainfall pattern and or tank size the magnitude of the peak flow reduction increased as tank size increased ranging from 15 38 for 1 to 2 5 kl tanks up to 39 48 for 10 kl tanks opening the orifice of the tanks at different times throughout the storm was essential to minimise the peak outflow in optimal operating schemes in addition optimising the partial opening of the orifices allowed for improved performance the purpose of this short communication is to demonstrate the potential performance achievable by operating smart tanks as a system during a rainfall event which was done by assuming ideal conditions in relation to a number of factors storm pattern forecasting tank to roof connectedness accuracy of orifice control controlling discharge rate and a free outfall downstream further research is warranted to include an assessment of the sensitivity of the effectiveness of the proposed concept to these assumptions as well as the effectiveness of this concept under different climatic conditions and for systems of different size and complexity e g such as a cluster or precinct scale and the optimal placement of smart tanks within urban infill areas

outlined above as nsga ii or its variants have been demonstrated to work well over a wide range of storm and rainwater tank systems optimization studies beh et al 2017 blinco et al 2017 di matteo et al 2017b lee et al 2012 marchi et al 2016 zare et al 2012 including a smart rainwater tank operation study behzadian et al 2018 the optimatics optimizer software was used to facilitate the optimization analysis which links the swmm model to the genetic algorithm for each optimization run the algorithm evolved a population of 100 operating schemes over 1000 generations resulting in optimal or near optimal solutions to the optimization problem i e optimal operating schemes for each tank size each optimization run was repeated five times for different starting random number seeds and the optimal solutions were aggregated and dominant solutions identified to reduce the impact of the stochastic operators used to generate solutions the optimal operating scheme s identified for a given tank orifice combination was the one that minimised the peak system discharge rate 3 4 trials 3 4 1 system configuration a system configuration consisted of one tank size and orifice size combination which was adopted for both tanks in the system table 2 shows the rainwater tank parameters trialled a total of four smart rainwater tank sizes were considered representing a range of above ground storage sizes that could practically fit within one allotment s outdoor area the orifice sizes tested for each storage size were between 10 mm and 60 mm which represents a lower and upper limit on the orifice size typically utilised on allotment scale detention storages all tanks were assumed to be emptied prior to the beginning of each storm per the traditional smart tank operating scheme adopted in xu et al 2018 3 4 2 rainfall patterns each of the system configurations was tested for ten rainfall patterns for a 1 in 100 year 24 h storm generated for the case study site a 1 in 100 year event was selected so that the system could be tested under extreme conditions and a 24 h 1440 min duration was selected as rainwater tanks typically fail in long duration events as mentioned in the introduction fig 3 shows the ten patterns generated using the watercom pty ltd arr 2016 rainfall pattern spreadsheet http www watercom com au download html all storms had 5 mm h average rainfall intensity and 120 mm total rainfall depth it was assumed any pre burst rainfall was of sufficiently low intensity that runoff could pass through open orifices on the storages ensuring the storages would be empty before the storm 3 5 performance evaluation changes in peak flows in order to assess the performance of the smart systems approach the change in system peak flow was compared against a baseline scenario of a system with no tanks installed no tank scenario hence the peak flow change for a trial consisting of the ith system configuration and jth rainfall pattern was determined as follows 1 system peak flow change max q s y s t e m i j max q s y s t e m b a s e l i n e j 1 100 where max q s y s t e m i j was the system outlet peak flow rate for the trial and max q s y s t e m b a s e l i n e j was the system outlet peak flowrate for the no tanks scenario during the simulation with the jth rainfall pattern the other scenario used for comparison was a system with 10 kl tanks operated using a traditional retention based smart tank operating scheme with tank emptied prior to the storm and orifice closed for the duration of the storm which was adopted as the real time control approach in xu et al 2018 4 results and discussion the peak flow reduction performance for the optimal operating scheme s for each trial i e system configuration and rainfall pattern combination was determined from the optimization results available in supplementary material s2 most trials had more than one operating scheme that resulted in the maximum peak flow reduction the performance of optimal schemes for each tank size and real time operation of one optimal scheme for a 5 kl smart systems scenario are analysed in this section 4 1 smart systems peak flow performance fig 4 shows the changes in system peak flow rate equation 1 achieved by using the smart systems approach compared with a traditional smart tank retention approach for a range of different smart tank sizes the key trend is that the smart systems approach consistently resulted in a reduction of peak flows irrespective of rainfall pattern and even for small tank sizes for example for 1 2 5 kl tanks the peak flow reduction ranged from 15 to 38 as tank sizes increased the magnitude of the peak flow reduction also increased for 5 kl tanks the reduction ranged from 20 to 48 while for 10 kl tanks the reduction ranged from 39 to 48 in contrast the 10 kl tanks operated as a traditional smart retention tank resulted in no reduction in peak flows compared to the no tanks scenario the variation in peak flow reductions obtained using the smart systems approach for different storms fig 4 is due to slight differences in the ability to offset the peaks from the two sub catchments based on the different storm patterns see section 4 2 for an explanation of the interaction between the inflow from a particular storm pattern and the corresponding orifice operating strategy to minimise peak system outflow this variation diminished with increasing tank size varying between 23 for the 1 kl tanks to 9 for the 10 kl tanks 4 2 smart systems operation for the purpose of illustrating how the smart tank systems controls were able to result in the reductions in peak outflows shown in fig 4 fig 5 compares and contrasts the simulated real time performance of two 10 kl smart retention tanks column 1 and a two 5 kl smart tank system with real time outlet controls column 2 for a 1 in 100 year ari 24 h storm pattern 1 fig 3 fig 5 1 shows that the 10 kl retention tanks did not have sufficient capacity to capture the first peak t 11 h or second peak inflows t 16 h and consequently spilled during these inflows at the arrival of the first peak the tanks each had only 1 02 kl spare capacity fig 5 1 a and c as a result the traditional smart retention tanks spilled during the first peak in a similar manner as the retention tank in the example in fig 2 which resulted in no mitigation of the outflow peak flow rate for the storm fig 5 1 d fig 5 2 illustrates how the smart systems approach produced a peak outflow reduction because the tank operation was optimised to provide sufficient detention capacity to capture the two large peak inflows prior to the first peak inflow t 1 to t 10 h both tanks remained mostly open fig 5 2 b consequently at t 11 h the tanks had sufficient spare capacity 4 46 kl in s1 and 4 27 kl in s2 to detain the first peak fig 5 2 c operating decisions during the period from the arrival of the first peak to the arrival of second peak inflow t 11 to t 16 h were critical to minimise the outflow rate from the second peak fig 5 2 d both tanks orifices remained partially open during the first peak then closed at t 12 h when both tanks were nearly full at t 13 h tank 1 began to purge however tank 2 purged one time step later at t 14 h the delayed purge produced an offset in the peak orifice outflows caused by the high head in each tank this behaviour ensured the peak orifice outflows were not coincident and thereby produced a lower system peak outflow during that time period similar to the hypothesized behaviour as illustrated in fig 2 since the tanks purged in the period between peaks they had sufficient spare capacity 5 00 kl in s1 and 4 54 kl in s2 to detain the second peak inflow after the second peak just as tank 1 was about to spill simultaneously with tank 2 at t 19 h tank 1 s orifice opening increased partially to purge pre emptively which avoided spill at a later time this example provides a demonstration of the research hypothesis that smart tanks operated as a system can yield improved peak outflow reduction performance compared with 1 simply purging tanks before a storm and not operating them during the storm and 2 blanket operation rules applying to all tanks simultaneously during a storm by optimising the opening and closing of the tanks throughout the storm the inflow peaks can be detained and the outflow peaks can be timed to ensure they are not coincident this approach resulted in system peak flow reductions of the order of 39 48 reduction for 10 kl tanks 5 conclusions and future research the results of this study demonstrate that by using a smart systems approach allotment scale rainwater tanks can potentially be operated to significantly reduce runoff peaks to downstream stormwater drainage systems during rare long duration storms this reduction in runoff peaks can be achieved by operating the tanks as a system during the storm to provide capacity to detain inflow peaks and limit coincident outflow peaks a simple two allotment stormwater simulation model was developed representing this smart systems approach where smart tanks are connected to allotment roofs and simulated for a case study site in adelaide south australia the orifice opening proportion for each tank at one hour time steps for the duration of a 1 in 100 year 24 h storm was optimised for different tank sizes and rainfall patterns using an evolutionary optimization algorithm the results demonstrate that for the case study site under ideal simulation conditions the smart systems approach consistently produced peak flow reductions regardless of rainfall pattern and or tank size the magnitude of the peak flow reduction increased as tank size increased ranging from 15 38 for 1 to 2 5 kl tanks up to 39 48 for 10 kl tanks opening the orifice of the tanks at different times throughout the storm was essential to minimise the peak outflow in optimal operating schemes in addition optimising the partial opening of the orifices allowed for improved performance the purpose of this short communication is to demonstrate the potential performance achievable by operating smart tanks as a system during a rainfall event which was done by assuming ideal conditions in relation to a number of factors storm pattern forecasting tank to roof connectedness accuracy of orifice control controlling discharge rate and a free outfall downstream further research is warranted to include an assessment of the sensitivity of the effectiveness of the proposed concept to these assumptions as well as the effectiveness of this concept under different climatic conditions and for systems of different size and complexity e g such as a cluster or precinct scale and the optimal placement of smart tanks within urban infill areas

26281,dynamic global vegetation models dgvms are of crucial importance for understanding and predicting vegetation carbon nitrogen and water dynamics of ecosystems in response to climate change their complexity however creates challenges for model analysis and data integration a solution is to interface dgvms with established statistical computing environments here we introduce rlpjguess an r package that couples the widely used dgvm lpj guess with the r environment for statistical computing making existing r packages and functions readily available to perform complex analyses with this model we demonstrate the advantages of this framework by using rlpjguess to perform several otherwise laborious tasks first a set of single simulations followed by global and local sensitivity analyses a bayesian calibration with a markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm and a predictive simulation with multiple climate scenarios our example highlights the opportunities of interfacing existing models in earth and environmental sciences with state of the art computing environments such as r keywords rlpjguess dynamic global vegetation model dgvm lpj guess model calibration

the source code of which is available upon request athttp web nateko lu se lpj guess note rlpjguess is not compatible with the educational version of lpj guess publically available on the lpj guess website 1 introduction the complexity of terrestrial ecosystems with many interactions between the various drivers and compartments limits our ability to understand and predict system responses based on simple statistical relationships therefore the most widely used tools to describe transient vegetation dynamics in response to changes in climate and atmospheric co2 concentration are dynamic process based vegetation models hartig et al 2012 these models include detailed process based representations of productivity competition population dynamics and forest succession either for particular tree species e g bugmann 2001 or in the so called dynamic global vegetation models d g vms usually for plant functional types pfts e g prentice et al 2007 most d g vms are fairly complex dietze et al 2014 working with such complex system models creates distinct challenges 1 simulations are often slow necessitating the use of parallel computing when many model evaluations are necessary 2 the complexity of process interactions often leads to unpredictable model behaviour from its structural properties simulations need to be run to understand how the model responds to changes in inputs or parameters algorithms to perform such local or global sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2000 often require a considerable number of model evaluations table 1 3 even more evaluations are needed for model inversion table 1 model inversion or inverse calibration means that we search for the model parameters and inputs most likely to produce the observed outputs voosen 2016 in recent years bayesian approaches to model calibration have become increasingly popular because they allow quantifying model parameters and predictions as well as their uncertainties bagnara et al 2015 hartig et al 2012 van oijen et al 2005 as posterior densities usually cannot be derived analytically monte carlo algorithms such as importance sampling markov chain monte carlo mcmc and sequential monte carlo are commonly used hartig et al 2011 4 finally decision makers demand model predictions together with their uncertainties this is often achieved via monte carlo simulations or ensemble runs in this context bayesian methods provide a particularly comprehensive if computer intensive way to propagate uncertainty in different parts of the model to the output although all these techniques are well known and readily available in scientific computing environment such as r matlab and python they are still rarely applied for complex dgvms e g luo et al 2009 in our experience an important reason is the amount of work associated with interfacing established dgvms which are usually programmed in lower level languages such as c c or fortran with existing statistical frameworks and algorithms that are available in the mentioned higher level languages for the lpj guess model lund potsdam jena general ecosystem simulator smith et al 2014 we address this problem through a new interface with the statistical tools provided in r r core team 2015 lpj guess is a process based model of vegetation dynamics and biogeochemistry designed for regional to global applications it combines eco physiological features of the widely used lund potsdam jena dynamic global vegetation model lpj dgvm sitch et al 2003 with detailed representations of vegetation dynamics and canopy structure as used in forest gap models lpj guess developed by a community of scientists from different institutions http iis4 nateko lu se lpj guess index html is one of the most widely applied dgvms to investigate vegetation dynamics so far resulting in more than 200 international peer reviewed articles in isi listed journals http iis4 nateko lu se lpj guess lpj guess bibliography pdf the model has also been parameterized regionally e g its european version represents main tree species instead of global pfts hickler et al 2012 recently smith et al 2014 incorporated nitrogen cycling and limitation making lpj guess one of the most complete vegetation models currently available despite or maybe because of this complexity however most applications of lpj guess concentrate on predicting or understanding present and past patterns and dynamics ahlström et al 2015 while few studies present advanced analysis of the model itself such as sensitivity analyses or model calibration but see pappas et al 2013 wramneby et al 2008 zaehle et al 2005 in this paper we present rlpjguess a newly developed r package that couples lpj guess with r this more convenient interface to the many methods available in r will create new research possibilities for vegetation modellers and thereby help to advance the field s capabilities to run complicated analyses and tests 2 the rlpjguess package with rlpjguess every step necessary to run lpj guess can be carried out from within r facilitating model setup output analysis and complex tasks such as sensitivity analysis and model calibrations for which r provides many dedicated packages a basic use example of rlpjguess would be to run lpj guess for a single site with the default parameter values rlpjguess allows to run lpj guess both in pft or species specific mode and it supports the default climate data supplied by the lpj guess developers as well as user defined climate input files the standard run settings of lpj guess e g presence absence length of the spin up species or pfts simulated nitrogen limitation etc can be changed through the rlpjguess functions getdesign and getparameterlist fig 1 after the model run has terminated user selected outputs are returned for further analyses together with the settings of the model run fig 1 this basic use can be extended by 1 changing model parameters for example to carry out calibrations and sensitivity analysis and 2 running the model on multiple locations or with multiple climate scenarios for both options rlpjguess supports parallelization for personal computers servers and high performance computing hpc clusters including the message passing interface mpi protocols for parallel computing typically available on hpc clusters rlpjguess is fully operational on macos windows and linux operating systems 3 case study to demonstrate the functionality of rlpjguess we present a case study comprised of four tasks carried out from within r 1 a set of single model runs 2 a global and local sensitivity analysis using parallelization 3 a bayesian model calibration 4 a parallel prediction run using multiple climate scenarios installation instructions and code for every task are provided as appendices to this paper 3 1 single model runs to demonstrate the basic communication of the rlpjguess package with lpj guess we performed three single model runs appendix b using 62 years of weather data 1950 2012 obtained from the german weather service s station in erfurt germany for all the simulations we estimated the vegetation biomass carbon c biomass and the leaf area index lai with the settings given in table 2 in the first run fig 2 a we simulated vegetation dynamics with the pft parameterization for a single forest stand including only temperate pfts that would be able to grow at the study site according to their bioclimatic limits smith et al 2014 in the second run fig 2b we simulated the same stand with the species specific parameterization including only temperate species hickler et al 2012 in the third run we simulated only fagus sylvatica fig 2c which is the dominant species in the area fischer et al 2010 the results are generally in line with expectations about the natural regeneration of a pure beech stand in a similar climate 4 7 kg c m 2 granier et al 2008 the calculation time was 2 5 s for each simulation 3 2 parallelized sensitivity analyses for the next analysis step we used the simulated lai and c biomass for f sylvatica as reference data and created a goodness of fit function specifically a likelihood based on normal error assumptions for lai and c biomass to measure how well results from subsequent simulations match these simulated data we subsequently ran two sensitivity analyses to test for the influence sensitivity of 55 lpj guess parameters plus two additional parameters for the standard deviations of the normal errors on the model fit expressed by the likelihood minimum and maximum values for each parameter were derived from the literature pappas et al 2013 wramneby et al 2008 zaehle et al 2005 the first analysis performed was a local one at a time oat sensitivity analysis which we programmed by hand using the parallel option of rlpjguess with 13 cores appendix c fig c1 as a second analysis we ran a global morris sensitivity analysis campolongo et al 2007 appendix c figs c2 and c3 implemented in the r package sensitivity pujol et al 2016 as rlpjguess allows parallelization of most of the implemented sensitivity functions we made use of this option this allowed us to screen a large number of species specific parameters while other studies focused on a lower number of parameters at the pft level in a relatively short amount of time 5 min for the oat analysis 15 min for the morris analysis the results from our local and global sensitivity analyses fig 3 were in agreement with findings of previous studies in the sense that the parameters that we identified as particularly important were highlighted when tested in previous studies as well pappas et al 2013 wramneby et al 2008 zaehle et al 2005 3 3 bayesian calibration based on the sensitivity analysis we selected the 16 most influential parameters and ran a full bayesian calibration using the differential evolution dezs ter braak 2006 mcmc algorithm from the bayesiantools r package hartig et al 2017 with 3 chains and 105 iterations appendix d the total runtime for this full calibration unparallelized was 118 h 5 days as expected for a successful calibration the model converged on parameter values close to the values used to generate the reference data gelman rubin s test of convergence 1 05 with well defined posterior distributions fig 4 a predictions from the calibrated model matched the reference data well with small uncertainties fig 4b and c 3 4 multiple climate scenarios as a fourth and last analysis step we set up a simulation with multiple climate scenarios appendix e note that multiple locations could be simulated in the same way we created 10 time series based on the original weather data with increasing temperature from 0 5 c to 5 c and precipitations from 5 to 70 using the holtwinter and predict holtwinter functions included in the r base package stats to construct hypothetical climate forcing data for the period 2013 2062 using the calibrated model version from the previous step we simulated the 10 scenarios in parallel on 10 cores fig 5 with a total runtime of 5 s the trends of productivity resulting from these simulations are in accordance with ahlström et al 2012 who studied productivity in response to climate change with lpj guess at this latitude for the time period 1950 2005 4 conclusions while complex system models are widely used in ecology and earth system sciences they are so far rarely coupled to advanced statistical algorithms for model analysis rlpjguess addresses this issue for the lpj guess model allowing users to access many important lpj guess features from r with a minimum amount of coding and advanced parallelization options in our case study we highlighted four possible analyses that could be run through rlpjguess but there are many further options a particular interesting application would be to experiment with model emulations fer et al 2018 by allowing to investigate lpj guess in a more systematic and automatized way rlpjguess will facilitate new insights about vegetation dynamics as well as a much needed better integration between the model and the various data streams see also parallel efforts e g dietze 2017 as such we believe that our package adds significant value to lpj guess as a tool to investigate the vegetation carbon nitrogen and water dynamics of ecosystems over time and to identify new possible threats especially related to climate change moreover rlpjguess could be easily extended or adopted to other dgvms or even other model classes i e climatic or hydrological in order to improve their

the results from our local and global sensitivity analyses fig 3 were in agreement with findings of previous studies in the sense that the parameters that we identified as particularly important were highlighted when tested in previous studies as well pappas et al 2013 wramneby et al 2008 zaehle et al 2005 3 3 bayesian calibration based on the sensitivity analysis we selected the 16 most influential parameters and ran a full bayesian calibration using the differential evolution dezs ter braak 2006 mcmc algorithm from the bayesiantools r package hartig et al 2017 with 3 chains and 105 iterations appendix d the total runtime for this full calibration unparallelized was 118 h 5 days as expected for a successful calibration the model converged on parameter values close to the values used to generate the reference data gelman rubin s test of convergence 1 05 with well defined posterior distributions fig 4 a predictions from the calibrated model matched the reference data well with small uncertainties fig 4b and c 3 4 multiple climate scenarios as a fourth and last analysis step we set up a simulation with multiple climate scenarios appendix e note that multiple locations could be simulated in the same way we created 10 time series based on the original weather data with increasing temperature from 0 5 c to 5 c and precipitations from 5 to 70 using the holtwinter and predict holtwinter functions included in the r base package stats to construct hypothetical climate forcing data for the period 2013 2062 using the calibrated model version from the previous step we simulated the 10 scenarios in parallel on 10 cores fig 5 with a total runtime of 5 s the trends of productivity resulting from these simulations are in accordance with ahlström et al 2012 who studied productivity in response to climate change with lpj guess at this latitude for the time period 1950 2005 4 conclusions while complex system models are widely used in ecology and earth system sciences they are so far rarely coupled to advanced statistical algorithms for model analysis rlpjguess addresses this issue for the lpj guess model allowing users to access many important lpj guess features from r with a minimum amount of coding and advanced parallelization options in our case study we highlighted four possible analyses that could be run through rlpjguess but there are many further options a particular interesting application would be to experiment with model emulations fer et al 2018 by allowing to investigate lpj guess in a more systematic and automatized way rlpjguess will facilitate new insights about vegetation dynamics as well as a much needed better integration between the model and the various data streams see also parallel efforts e g dietze 2017 as such we believe that our package adds significant value to lpj guess as a tool to investigate the vegetation carbon nitrogen and water dynamics of ecosystems over time and to identify new possible threats especially related to climate change moreover rlpjguess could be easily extended or adopted to other dgvms or even other model classes i e climatic or hydrological in order to improve their

26282,the objective of this research was to assess the effect of gullying on the erosive response at the basin scale by modeling for this purpose a distributed hydrological model which includes erosion by raindrop rilling and gullying was configured and applied in a mediterranean basin in southern spain the results show a range of parameters close to those provided by the literature and good agreement with field measurements however the simulations indicate that the rill erodibility parameter at the surface is overestimated by as much as 70 to compensate for gullying processes other parameters such as the subsoil erodibility of the soil profile play an important role in the erosive response of the basin a geomorphological threshold for sediment yield that relates density of gullies and erodibility parameters was found these responses are especially relevant in semiarid environments where the intense pulses of precipitation have important effects on landscape evolution keywords hillslope modeling gullying basin scale erodibility 1 introduction on hillslopes where the dispersive nature of flow constrains water and sediment circulation simpson and schlunegger 2003 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 the processes involved offer a wide variety and present complex relationships for basin scale modeling the impact of rain drops and concentrated flow have been generally considered to be the dominant processes in erosion modeling nearing et al 1989 merritt et al 2003 other processes such as small scale landslides subsurface soil washing or gully erosion could notably increase the hillslope erosive rate de vente et al 2008 but are poorly understood in terms of modeling in particular gullies have been responsible for important soil losses in semi arid environments wasson et al 2002 martínez casasnovas 2003 casalí et al 2009 vigiak et al 2011 with percentages exceeding 95 of the total sediment yield poesen et al 2003 predictive models that have dealt with gullying processes have focused on local changes in gully morphology sidorchuk and sidorchuk 1998 sidorchuk 1999 gully headcut migration alonso et al 2002 flores cervantes et al 2006 campo bescós et

and poesen 2014 rossi et al 2015 however from a physical based modeling point of view the influence of gullying on sediment yield has received less attention merritt et al 2003 borja et al 2018 there are issues about how different parameters such as soil properties vegetation cover topography land use changes and their spatial distributions interact with gullying stages including their inception development and relationship with other surface and subsurface runoff processes bocco 1991 torri and poesen 2014 in most cases the sediment contribution and responses related to the aforementioned processes have not been analyzed at basin scale de vente and poesen 2005 the main goal of this work is to analyze the effect of soil parameters and erosion processes on gullying when modeling erosive responses at the basin scale with this aim the interaction between different erosive processes such as raindrop impacts concentrated flow in rills and gullies and their headcut migrations have been modeled with a semi physically based and distributed hydrological model the model which considers the spatial variability of soil parameters including hydraulic conductivity pressure potential head and soil erodibility has been calibrated and validated with suspended load measurements in a steep semiarid subbasin in southeastern of spain where gullying processes exhibit a remarkable activity 2 model description the model developed works at the event temporal scale with adaptive calculations of δ t on the order of approximately 1 2 s according to the courant friedrichs levy condition and the digital elevation model dem and with a spatial resolution of δx 30 m as the basis for calculating water and sediment flow appendix 1 presents a list of the symbols of each parameter and variable with their units and physical meanings the conceptual scheme of the model fig 1 includes hillslope zoning that depends on different erosive processes within the dem the distribution of hillslope and channel cells is built from the drainage network taking into account the hydrological regime in the study area in this regard fluvial and diffusive hillslope processes which have important physical differences in erosion and transport were distinguished following previous proposals willgoose 2005a b from the modeling point of view the differences can be summarized as the following a hillslope cells fig 1 labels 1 and 2 including water and sediment runoff the balance of erosion sedimentation and raindrop impacts the rill and gully erosion caused by concentrated flow and headcut processes and b channel cells including only transportation and sedimentation fig 1 label 3 this configuration allows us to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the soil and the land uses at the hillslopes by also considering the spatial distributions of the forcing agents the numerical approach based on the dem increases the availability of the model to interact with raster information such as remote sensing images or interpolated maps additionally the automatic calculation of the rill density based on flow and terrain conditions involves assumptions that this study helps to improve the gullying modeling which could be compared to what was implemented by the eurosem model for high rill density or furrowed surfaces morgan et al 1998 is taken into account here in greater detail however the high computational cost limits the spatial scale of application and the simulation period following the conceptualization the model generates and circulates the rate of erosion and deposition in each cell along the dem during a precipitation event by considering the distribution of the rainfall throughout the subbasin 2 1 water and sediment routing on hillslopes the hillslope fluxes of water and sediment are modeled following a diffusive wave equation approach this scheme is a good representation of the st venant equations for hydrological purposes in areas with both gentle and steep slopes orlandini and rosso 1996 jain and singh 2005 gottardi and venutelli 2008 the runoff routing model follows the numerical solution given by jain and singh 2005 based on finite volume methods the conservative form of the unidimensional equation for surface water in a volume ν confined by a surface s is given by 1 ν h t d ν s u h ω d s ν r i d ν where r i represents the source term and the other terms are listed in appendix i as are all terms throughout the manuscript the resolution of the flux vector in the normal direction allows the treatment of the two dimensional problem as a local unidimensional problem jain and singh 2005 the reduction of overland flow and hillslope erosion to a 1d model presents limitations by simplifying the role of the microtopography the interaction of vegetation with rilling and the direction of subsurface flow liu et al 2004 nord and esteves 2005 however approaches based on 2d modeling are considerably limited due to difficulties with validating the complex relationships existing in natural soil and their associated computational costs at the basin scale the basic equation discretized with the finite volume method fvm for 1d water flow at each cell of the dem is given by the expression zhao et al 1994 2 w 2 h t w ε 1 s d f ε w 2 g where s d is the number of the total upstream contributors cells the model assumes a structure of d 8 which means 8 possible directions around the peripheral cells following the criteria of jain and singh 2005 a lateral distribution is assumed in the cell in case of a diagonal flow direction the numerical integration using fvm for a dem is performed with a second order two step predictor corrector scheme described by zhao et al 1994 and jain and singh 2005 therefore for each cell the value of h at the first predictor step at each δ t is 3 h h t 1 δ t w 2 q i n t 1 q o u t t 1 δ t r t i t and with 4 q i n t 1 q o u t t 1 with time superscript notation for the whole document the water

h t 1 h δ t w 2 q i n q o u t r t i t the courant friedrichs levy condition for this explicit scheme is given by 7 max u g h δ t l 1 where u is calculated from u q o u t w the numerical solution of the runoff equation was compared with the analytical solution proposed by eagleson 1970 and described in detail in kazezyılmaz alhan and medina 2007 this comparison was made from the case study proposed by gottardi and venutelli 2008 that is based on a stretch of river with a slope of 0 001 and a length of 200 m a spatial resolution of δ x 5 m a unit width and a manning s roughness coefficient of n 0 03 precipitation is considered to be uniform with a rate of 60 mm h based on these considerations the configured numerical model was applied under kinematic and diffusive wave hypotheses and the results were compared with the analytical solution the results for the analytical solution magenta and for the model under kinematic and diffusive approaches blue and red respectively are plotted in fig 2 the modeled runoff agrees well with the analytical solution although there is a time lag in the maximum flow value that was already identified by gottardi and venutelli 2008 for sediment transport the problem can be considered using a two step predictor corrector approach for both water and sediment in a decoupled form tayfur 2002 wu 2008 although flow density can vary with the concentration of sediment salinity and temperature it has been assumed that sediment load does not affect the hydrodynamic properties of flow as previously reported wu 2008 the continuity equation for hillslope sediment in a control volume ν bounded by a surface s can be written as 8 ν h c s t d ν s q c s x d s ν e d ν with these considerations the sediment load of each cell across the dem can be written as 9 c s t 1 h t h t 1 c s t 1 δ t w 2 q s i n t 1 q s o u t t 1 δ t e t where q s o u t is the outflow of sediment calculated from q s o u t c s q o u t 2 2

concerning rainfall discharge and suspended sediment load at the subbasin s outlet are detailed in this section with reference to the study area and based on these data the sensitivity of the model was analyzed and calibrated and thus the erosive responses under different parameter values were evaluated 3 1 study area the studied area the barbacana subbasin 13 3 km 2 is located in the southern part of the guadalfeo river basin in the southeastern region of the iberian peninsula fig 4 this subbasin presents an advanced geomorphology with average slopes between 0 2 0 7 m m 1 and maximum values of 1 4 m m 1 approximately 77 of the area is allocated to almond trees prunus dulcis and vineyards vitis vinifera with 13 of degraded scrub retama sphaerocarpa genista umbellata the potential erosive range estimates from usle and rusle models exceeds 200 mg ha 1 y 1 vázquez 1995 dirección general de medio natural y política forestal 2007 these values do not capture the processes at event scale in either of the gullies observed in the area gulliver 2009 millares et al 2012 the edaphic profile is composed of highly weathered soils classified as eurithric regosols and lithosols according to the classification proposed by fao unesco fao unesco 1988 with average textures of 58 26 and 15 of sand silt and clay respectively based on 34 samples within the study area perez 1987 delgado et al 1993 3 2 available data the distributed values of the different soil parameters were derived from the work developed by perez 1987 delgado et al 1993 rodríguez et al 2008 and are shown in fig 5 moreover the values of the very fine sand fraction the organic matter content o m and the dry specific weight of the soil γ m d were assessed during different field campaigns from these parameters the values of k i k r and τ r c were obtained from empirical relationships based on soil textures particle diameter organic matter content and dry specific weight of the soil usda scs 1992 foster et al 1995 romero et al 2007 table 1 shows the statistical values for the distributed parameters in addition the analysis of land uses and the vegetation cover map available for the study area junta de andalucía 2005 revealed a great homogeneity in the land uses and tillage practices for which constant values of plant residue and random soil roughness of 0 2 and 0 06 respectively were considered parameters of the gullies initial depth density and head width were obtained from ortophotographs junta de andalucía 2009 2010 with an approximate scale of 1 20 000 and on site surveys 3 3 observed rainfall event in the period from january 27th to february 3rd 2005 a sequence of precipitation events with great temporal variability was recorded on the 27th and 28th the rainfall intensity in the subbasin was very low between the 10 30 and 12 00 a m on march 1st a 2 h long rainfall event with a maximum intensity of 13 7 mm h 1 with uniformly distributed precipitation was recorded in the study area fig 6 the hyetograph is shown in fig 6a the total rain depth was 45 mm in 24 h with a return period of over 4 5 years based on 40 years of rainfall data and a generalized extreme value gev fit as a probability distribution function in spite of their moderate intensity similar events have been described as capable of triggering gully formation casalí et al 1999 during the event 12 valid samples of suspended sediment as well as flow measurements were manually taken at the river mouth of the subbasin as part of a broad field campaign developed in the guadalfeo river millares et al 2014 table 2 shows sampling method for suspended sediment concentration and flow at the subbasins mouth at the guadalfeo river additionally samples of bedload were taken with a helley smith sampler from which median sediment size and mineralogical composition were assessed by sieve analysis and x ray diffraction respectively this analysis pointed to a bedload flow of 0 255 kg s 1 with d 50 2 54 mm related to sediment stored in the channel which allowed us to discard the contribution from the hillslopes during this event to determine the suspended sediment concentration ssc mg l 1 the samples were analyzed using a 0 7 μ m pore size whatman gf f filter following the tss 160 2 protocol u s environmental protection agency 1999 fig 6b shows the hydrograph and sedimentograph at the basin outlet for this event it is important to take into account the associated errors concerning the flow measurement of water and sediment for the manual assessment of sediment concentration errors associated with the homogeneity of the mixture or aggregate formation prior to laboratory analysis have been previously reported wren et al 2000 additionally flow measurements present difficulties in velocity assessment and in quantifying the fraction that goes into subsurface flow at the basin outlet for this reason 4 measurements upstream and downstream of the guadalfeo river at the subbasin outlet were taken 3 4 sensitivity analysis the model sensitivity was evaluated by adopting a local analysis of different parameters the sensitivity index s i dimensionless calculated for an increase of a given parameter is obtained from the expression van griensven et al 2006 33 s i r m p 1 p i δ p i p m r m p 1 p i p p r m p 1 p i p m δ p i p i where r m is the result and δ p i is the change in a given parameter p i while the remaining variables are constant the sign of si indicates whether the model responds codirectionally to p i for water flow the selected parameters were n k s h f and δ θ referred to the maximum flow modeled at the subbasin outlet during the event for erosion deposition processes the selected parameters were d m τ c r r s t v r f c k i k r and n g which referred to the total volume of the outgoing sediment table 3 summarizes the range of values considered from previous studies usda scs 1992 foster et al 1995 romero et al 2007 knapen et al 2007 and the estimated data for the study site as noted by knapen et al 2007 values of τ c and k r can vary several orders of magnitude between soils with different textures or organic matter properties the variation of si for different water flow parameters is shown in fig 7 a the results of the model exhibit great sensitivity to variations of the k s parameter this has already been identified in other studies de roo et al 1996 for the case of erosion modeling fig 7b the model shows the highest sensitivity to soil erodibility parameters the soil cover fraction was lower although it had a very wide range of sensitivity the parameter τ c is moderately sensitive the role of the diameter of the soil particle should be highlighted for sedimentation processes which is expected due to its influence on settling velocity 3 5 model calibration the sensitivity analysis results allow us to reduce the number of parameters subject to calibration the parameter f c is relatively easy to estimate from the ortophotography and satellite images the value of d m was obtained from soil pits perez 1987 delgado et al 1993 although its spatial distribution is variable the range of values considered for d m is sufficiently broad to evaluate its sensitivity values of n and k s for flow along the hillslopes and τ c or k r for erosion are the most difficult to determine at the basin scale to reduce uncertainty in the parameter estimation 2500 simulations were carried out for each simulation the maximum flow and sediment volume were confronted with field measurements and the values of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the correlation coefficient and the relative mean error were calculated fig 8 shows the calibration results for water flow and sediment flow for the selected parameters the best fit values can be clearly observed using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and the relative mean error for the flow resistance coefficient n and the infiltration velocity k s a linear relationship can be observed with a narrow range of optimal values for the k s factor ranging between 0 4 and 0 45 which is almost half of the original map estimated for k s which gives the maximum distributed values from 1 4 10 6 m s 1 to 5 10 6 m s 1 values of n show a greater range from 0 015 to 0 04 soil erodibility and critical shear stress show an increasingly exponential relationship with a relatively constant value of 4 pa for increasing values of soil erodibility this behavior highlights how changes in soil erodibility for values below 1 0 10 3 s m 1 have an important effects on erosion by concentrated flow above this threshold changes in critical shear stress of the soil vary slowly reaching higher values with an average value approximately 4 pa this relationship coincides with that reported by knapen et al 2007 from field and laboratory tests 3 6 response validation based on the previous analysis a constant value of n 0 04 and distributed maps ranging from 1 44 10 6 5 10 6 m s 1 3 6 16 mm and 0 3 0 45 for k s h f and δ θ respectively were selected for water flow five simulations were considered to evaluate the effect of different erosion processes and their relationship with soil erodibility table 4 simulation 1 does not consider gullying processes only erosion caused by rills and raindrop impact simulation 2 considered gullying processes with a constant soil erodibility profile of k g 0 2 k r and a significant decrease in rill erodibility in simulations 3 to 5 the original surface rill erodibility was maintained as constant and the soil erodibility profile was modified to k g 0 5 k r k g 0 2 k r and k g 0 1 k r s m 1 fig 9 shows the results concerning the five simulations as observed the modeled erosive response coincides in time and shape with the measured data with a maximum bimodal sediment flow related to the geomorphological configuration of the sub basin with two drainage units an excellent agreement is found for the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient with the calibrated parameters of simulations 1 and 2 nse 0 89 and nse 0 88 respectively it is important to highlight that for simulation 2 the rill erodibility had to be reduced by 70 to compensate for the effect of gullying simulations 3 to 5 present values that overestimate the measurements performed when the calibrated values of rill erodibility were maintained with a proportional increase related to the internal erodibility of the soil profile 4 results and discussion in this study gullying including headcut migration and its internal concentrated flow has been simulated with other hillslope processes using a semi physically based and distributed model to assess changes in the basin erosive response simulation results showed a relative gullying sediment yield of 15 which is close to values reported previously for the study area vázquez 1995 furthermore the simulated headcut migration with an average distance of 3 8 cm was close to field observation at the study site gulliver 2009 and is also in line with the rates reported previously for southern spain vandekerckhove et al 2001 the parametrization of the scenario without gullies is similar to that described in knapen et al 2007 particularly the average threshold of 4 pa for critical shear stress these results support the average reference values obtained through field and laboratory tests from a modeling point of view the range of values for soil erodibility and critical shear stress generalize at basin scale what has been previously obtained the wider range of values obtained for soil erodibility which is more dependent on edaphic characteristics highlight the importance of a deeper knowledge of soil and land uses effects represented here by cover fraction soil roughness and plant residue this contrasts with critical shear stress which is more dependent on hydraulics and sediment size moreover the modification of soil erodibility parameters by the inclusion of gullying processes often not considered in modeling tasks highlights the important role of soil and its surface and subsurface erodibility in the erosive response the results of the simulations show how rill erodibility has to be overestimated in areas with gullying to compensate for the noninclusion of these hillslope processes this indicates that this parameter is generally overestimated in the relevant literature by considering the extension of the mapped gullies the increase of k r reaches 70 in the study area the results also point toward the important role of gully density given in our study by n g and the characteristics of the soil profile represented by k g which affects both the gully head migration and the internal erosion in the gully fig 10 shows the relationship between rill erodibility and the number of gullies by considering different values of k g as a function of k r the curves represent the best fit based on nse values with respect to the objective function as shown in fig 10 the nearer the inner erodibility of the gully to the rill erodibility the greater the reduction of k r necessary to obtain the observed results this decreasing exponential relationship approaches an asymptote this indicates that the increase in the number of gullies no larger produces an erodibility change which suggests a geomorphological threshold from which gullying does not produce an increase in sediment production as fig 10 shows this threshold has a strong dependence on soil profile erodibility with values of n g 8 n g 30 and n g 40 for soil profiles of k g 0 5 k r k g 0 2 k r and k g 0 1 k r respectively although the objective of this work was focused on changes in the erosive response the uncertainty associated with the set of simulation parameters errors in field and laboratory measurements as well as the adopted assumptions should be taken into account erosion modeling includes a headcut migration during events smaller than the cell size and b flow distribution between rills and gullies proportional to the width of the gullies and their density the first fits for the simulated event and obtained results with maximum values of 0 3 m the second points to the uncertainties of flow conditions along the hillslopes and their spatial heterogeneity the numerically modeled pattern of runoff which contrasts with measurements at the outlet of the basin as in previous works jain et al 2004 presents limitations for local conditions of overland flow or infiltration it is also important to highlight the effects of other processes that occur along the gully such as water seepage piping and mass failure that could be dominant in some cases simon et al 2000 thomas et al 2004 rengers et al 2016 the high sediment concentration at the first steps of gully formation could change the density and viscosity of flow which would alter critical shear stress infiltration or turbulence as have been considered in some models schindewolf and schmidt 2012 these processes could easily affect soil erodibility and therefore modify the erosive response moreover the morphodynamics of the gully including its different phases namely initiation development headcut migration stabilization and colonization of vegetation leopold et al 1995 bull 1997 gonzalez 2001 have not been considered in this work although the model showed positive results larger datasets and different rainfall event conditions are needed for its proper and complete validation in this regards the modeling attempt presented here also faces significant challenges such as improved considerations of the role of vegetation on erosive dynamics or comparing the model results at local sites within the hillslopes despite these limitations and others associated with distributed hydrological modeling described in detail by merritt et al 2003 recent works have underlined their capacity to reproduce runoff responses jain et al 2004 and the complexity and nonlinearity of the sediment cycle as well as its great potentiality for catchment management decision support bussi et al 2014 5 conclusions the obtained results allow us to assess the influence of soil and subsoil erodibility parameters on the erosive response by modeling gullying processes at the basin scale overestimation of soil erodibility reaches up to 70 to compensate for gullying when such processes are not taken into account the relationship between these parameters and the density of gullies define a geomorphological threshold for sediment yield by gullying notably these effects are not considered in the parametric models based on universal soil loss equation usle approaches this is especially important in semi arid environments where extreme precipitation events with durations of a few hours have serious effects on landscape evolution the complexity of the model presented in this work and the uncertainty related to different processes reveals into the great lack of knowledge of gullying at basin scale and the need to measure and develop field studies to assess the specific contributions of gully erosion acknowledgments this research was supported by the

26282,the objective of this research was to assess the effect of gullying on the erosive response at the basin scale by modeling for this purpose a distributed hydrological model which includes erosion by raindrop rilling and gullying was configured and applied in a mediterranean basin in southern spain the results show a range of parameters close to those provided by the literature and good agreement with field measurements however the simulations indicate that the rill erodibility parameter at the surface is overestimated by as much as 70 to compensate for gullying processes other parameters such as the subsoil erodibility of the soil profile play an important role in the erosive response of the basin a geomorphological threshold for sediment yield that relates density of gullies and erodibility parameters was found these responses are especially relevant in semiarid environments where the intense pulses of precipitation have important effects on landscape evolution keywords hillslope modeling gullying basin scale erodibility 1 introduction on hillslopes where the dispersive nature of flow constrains water and sediment circulation simpson and schlunegger 2003 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 the processes involved offer a wide variety and present complex relationships for basin scale modeling the impact of rain drops and concentrated flow have been generally considered to be the dominant processes in erosion modeling nearing et al 1989 merritt et al 2003 other processes such as small scale landslides subsurface soil washing or gully erosion could notably increase the hillslope erosive rate de vente et al 2008 but are poorly understood in terms of modeling in particular gullies have been responsible for important soil losses in semi arid environments wasson et al 2002 martínez casasnovas 2003 casalí et al 2009 vigiak et al 2011 with percentages exceeding 95 of the total sediment yield poesen et al 2003 predictive models that have dealt with gullying processes have focused on local changes in gully morphology sidorchuk and sidorchuk 1998 sidorchuk 1999 gully headcut migration alonso et al 2002 flores cervantes et al 2006 campo bescós et

and poesen 2014 rossi et al 2015 however from a physical based modeling point of view the influence of gullying on sediment yield has received less attention merritt et al 2003 borja et al 2018 there are issues about how different parameters such as soil properties vegetation cover topography land use changes and their spatial distributions interact with gullying stages including their inception development and relationship with other surface and subsurface runoff processes bocco 1991 torri and poesen 2014 in most cases the sediment contribution and responses related to the aforementioned processes have not been analyzed at basin scale de vente and poesen 2005 the main goal of this work is to analyze the effect of soil parameters and erosion processes on gullying when modeling erosive responses at the basin scale with this aim the interaction between different erosive processes such as raindrop impacts concentrated flow in rills and gullies and their headcut migrations have been modeled with a semi physically based and distributed hydrological model the model which considers the spatial variability of soil parameters including hydraulic conductivity pressure potential head and soil erodibility has been calibrated and validated with suspended load measurements in a steep semiarid subbasin in southeastern of spain where gullying processes exhibit a remarkable activity 2 model description the model developed works at the event temporal scale with adaptive calculations of δ t on the order of approximately 1 2 s according to the courant friedrichs levy condition and the digital elevation model dem and with a spatial resolution of δx 30 m as the basis for calculating water and sediment flow appendix 1 presents a list of the symbols of each parameter and variable with their units and physical meanings the conceptual scheme of the model fig 1 includes hillslope zoning that depends on different erosive processes within the dem the distribution of hillslope and channel cells is built from the drainage network taking into account the hydrological regime in the study area in this regard fluvial and diffusive hillslope processes which have important physical differences in erosion and transport were distinguished following previous proposals willgoose 2005a b from the modeling point of view the differences can be summarized as the following a hillslope cells fig 1 labels 1 and 2 including water and sediment runoff the balance of erosion sedimentation and raindrop impacts the rill and gully erosion caused by concentrated flow and headcut processes and b channel cells including only transportation and sedimentation fig 1 label 3 this configuration allows us to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the soil and the land uses at the hillslopes by also considering the spatial distributions of the forcing agents the numerical approach based on the dem increases the availability of the model to interact with raster information such as remote sensing images or interpolated maps additionally the automatic calculation of the rill density based on flow and terrain conditions involves assumptions that this study helps to improve the gullying modeling which could be compared to what was implemented by the eurosem model for high rill density or furrowed surfaces morgan et al 1998 is taken into account here in greater detail however the high computational cost limits the spatial scale of application and the simulation period following the conceptualization the model generates and circulates the rate of erosion and deposition in each cell along the dem during a precipitation event by considering the distribution of the rainfall throughout the subbasin 2 1 water and sediment routing on hillslopes the hillslope fluxes of water and sediment are modeled following a diffusive wave equation approach this scheme is a good representation of the st venant equations for hydrological purposes in areas with both gentle and steep slopes orlandini and rosso 1996 jain and singh 2005 gottardi and venutelli 2008 the runoff routing model follows the numerical solution given by jain and singh 2005 based on finite volume methods the conservative form of the unidimensional equation for surface water in a volume ν confined by a surface s is given by 1 ν h t d ν s u h ω d s ν r i d ν where r i represents the source term and the other terms are listed in appendix i as are all terms throughout the manuscript the resolution of the flux vector in the normal direction allows the treatment of the two dimensional problem as a local unidimensional problem jain and singh 2005 the reduction of overland flow and hillslope erosion to a 1d model presents limitations by simplifying the role of the microtopography the interaction of vegetation with rilling and the direction of subsurface flow liu et al 2004 nord and esteves 2005 however approaches based on 2d modeling are considerably limited due to difficulties with validating the complex relationships existing in natural soil and their associated computational costs at the basin scale the basic equation discretized with the finite volume method fvm for 1d water flow at each cell of the dem is given by the expression zhao et al 1994 2 w 2 h t w ε 1 s d f ε w 2 g where s d is the number of the total upstream contributors cells the model assumes a structure of d 8 which means 8 possible directions around the peripheral cells following the criteria of jain and singh 2005 a lateral distribution is assumed in the cell in case of a diagonal flow direction the numerical integration using fvm for a dem is performed with a second order two step predictor corrector scheme described by zhao et al 1994 and jain and singh 2005 therefore for each cell the value of h at the first predictor step at each δ t is 3 h h t 1 δ t w 2 q i n t 1 q o u t t 1 δ t r t i t and with 4 q i n t 1 q o u t t 1 with time superscript notation for the whole document the water

the runoff equation was compared with the analytical solution proposed by eagleson 1970 and described in detail in kazezyılmaz alhan and medina 2007 this comparison was made from the case study proposed by gottardi and venutelli 2008 that is based on a stretch of river with a slope of 0 001 and a length of 200 m a spatial resolution of δ x 5 m a unit width and a manning s roughness coefficient of n 0 03 precipitation is considered to be uniform with a rate of 60 mm h based on these considerations the configured numerical model was applied under kinematic and diffusive wave hypotheses and the results were compared with the analytical solution the results for the analytical solution magenta and for the model under kinematic and diffusive approaches blue and red respectively are plotted in fig 2 the modeled runoff agrees well with the analytical solution although there is a time lag in the maximum flow value that was already identified by gottardi and venutelli 2008 for sediment transport the problem can be considered using a two step predictor corrector approach for both water and sediment in a decoupled form tayfur 2002 wu 2008 although flow density can vary with the concentration of sediment salinity and temperature it has been assumed that sediment load does not affect the hydrodynamic properties of flow as previously reported wu 2008 the continuity equation for hillslope sediment in a control volume ν bounded by a surface s can be written as 8 ν h c s t d ν s q c s x d s ν e d ν with these considerations the sediment load of each cell across the dem can be written as 9 c s t 1 h t h t 1 c s t 1 δ t w 2 q s i n t 1 q s o u t t 1 δ t e t where q s o u t is the outflow of sediment calculated from q s o u t c s q o u t 2 2

concerning rainfall discharge and suspended sediment load at the subbasin s outlet are detailed in this section with reference to the study area and based on these data the sensitivity of the model was analyzed and calibrated and thus the erosive responses under different parameter values were evaluated 3 1 study area the studied area the barbacana subbasin 13 3 km 2 is located in the southern part of the guadalfeo river basin in the southeastern region of the iberian peninsula fig 4 this subbasin presents an advanced geomorphology with average slopes between 0 2 0 7 m m 1 and maximum values of 1 4 m m 1 approximately 77 of the area is allocated to almond trees prunus dulcis and vineyards vitis vinifera with 13 of degraded scrub retama sphaerocarpa genista umbellata the potential erosive range estimates from usle and rusle models exceeds 200 mg ha 1 y 1 vázquez 1995 dirección general de medio natural y política forestal 2007 these values do not capture the processes at event scale in either of the gullies observed in the area gulliver 2009 millares et al 2012 the edaphic profile is composed of highly weathered soils classified as eurithric regosols and lithosols according to the classification proposed by fao unesco fao unesco 1988 with average textures of 58 26 and 15 of sand silt and clay respectively based on 34 samples within the study area perez 1987 delgado et al 1993 3 2 available data the distributed values of the different soil parameters were derived from the work developed by perez 1987 delgado et al 1993 rodríguez et al 2008 and are shown in fig 5 moreover the values of the very fine sand fraction the organic matter content o m and the dry specific weight of the soil γ m d were assessed during different field campaigns from these parameters the values of k i k r and τ r c were obtained from empirical relationships based on soil textures particle diameter organic matter content and dry specific weight of the soil usda scs 1992 foster et al 1995 romero et al 2007 table 1 shows the statistical values for the distributed parameters in addition the analysis of land uses and the vegetation cover map available for the study area junta de andalucía 2005 revealed a great homogeneity in the land uses and tillage practices for which constant values of plant residue and random soil roughness of 0 2 and 0 06 respectively were considered parameters of the gullies initial depth density and head width were obtained from ortophotographs junta de andalucía 2009 2010 with an approximate scale of 1 20 000 and on site surveys 3 3 observed rainfall event in the period from january 27th to february 3rd 2005 a sequence of precipitation events with great temporal variability was recorded on the 27th and 28th the rainfall intensity in the subbasin was very low between the 10 30 and 12 00 a m on march 1st a 2 h long rainfall event with a maximum intensity of 13 7 mm h 1 with uniformly distributed precipitation was recorded in the study area fig 6 the hyetograph is shown in fig 6a the total rain depth was 45 mm in 24 h with a return period of over 4 5 years based on 40 years of rainfall data and a generalized extreme value gev fit as a probability distribution function in spite of their moderate intensity similar events have been described as capable of triggering gully formation casalí et al 1999 during the event 12 valid samples of suspended sediment as well as flow measurements were manually taken at the river mouth of the subbasin as part of a broad field campaign developed in the guadalfeo river millares et al 2014 table 2 shows sampling method for suspended sediment concentration and flow at the subbasins mouth at the guadalfeo river additionally samples of bedload were taken with a helley smith sampler from which median sediment size and mineralogical composition were assessed by sieve analysis and x ray diffraction respectively this analysis pointed to a bedload flow of 0 255 kg s 1 with d 50 2 54 mm related to sediment stored in the channel which allowed us to discard the contribution from the hillslopes during this event to determine the suspended sediment concentration ssc mg l 1 the samples were analyzed using a 0 7 μ m pore size whatman gf f filter following the tss 160 2 protocol u s environmental protection agency 1999 fig 6b shows the hydrograph and sedimentograph at the basin outlet for this event it is important to take into account the associated errors concerning the flow measurement of water and sediment for the manual assessment of sediment concentration errors associated with the homogeneity of the mixture or aggregate formation prior to laboratory analysis have been previously reported wren et al 2000 additionally flow measurements present difficulties in velocity assessment and in quantifying the fraction that goes into subsurface flow at the basin outlet for this reason 4 measurements upstream and downstream of the guadalfeo river at the subbasin outlet were taken 3 4 sensitivity analysis the model sensitivity was evaluated by adopting a local analysis of different parameters the sensitivity index s i dimensionless calculated for an increase of a given parameter is obtained from the expression van griensven et al 2006 33 s i r m p 1 p i δ p i p m r m p 1 p i p p r m p 1 p i p m δ p i p i where r m is the result and δ p i is the change in a given parameter p i while the remaining variables are constant the sign of si indicates whether the model responds codirectionally to p i for water flow the selected parameters were n k s h f and δ θ referred to the maximum flow modeled at the subbasin outlet during the event for erosion deposition processes the selected parameters were d m τ c r r s t v r f c k i k r and n g which referred to the total volume of the outgoing sediment table 3 summarizes the range of values considered from previous studies usda scs 1992 foster et al 1995 romero et al 2007 knapen et al 2007 and the estimated data for the study site as noted by knapen et al 2007 values of τ c and k r can vary several orders of magnitude between soils with different textures or organic matter properties the variation of si for different water flow parameters is shown in fig 7 a the results of the model exhibit great sensitivity to variations of the k s parameter this has already been identified in other studies de roo et al 1996 for the case of erosion modeling fig 7b the model shows the highest sensitivity to soil erodibility parameters the soil cover fraction was lower although it had a very wide range of sensitivity the parameter τ c is moderately sensitive the role of the diameter of the soil particle should be highlighted for sedimentation processes which is expected due to its influence on settling velocity 3 5 model calibration the sensitivity analysis results allow us to reduce the number of parameters subject to calibration the parameter f c is relatively easy to estimate from the ortophotography and satellite images the value of d m was obtained from soil pits perez 1987 delgado et al 1993 although its spatial distribution is variable the range of values considered for d m is sufficiently broad to evaluate its sensitivity values of n and k s for flow along the hillslopes and τ c or k r for erosion are the most difficult to determine at the basin scale to reduce uncertainty in the parameter estimation 2500 simulations were carried out for each simulation the maximum flow and sediment volume were confronted with field measurements and the values of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the correlation coefficient and the relative mean error were calculated fig 8 shows the calibration results for water flow and sediment flow for the selected parameters the best fit values can be clearly observed using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and the relative mean error for the flow resistance coefficient n and the infiltration velocity k s a linear relationship can be observed with a narrow range of optimal values for the k s factor ranging between 0 4 and 0 45 which is almost half of the original map estimated for k s which gives the maximum distributed values from 1 4 10 6 m s 1 to 5 10 6 m s 1 values of n show a greater range from 0 015 to 0 04 soil erodibility and critical shear stress show an increasingly exponential relationship with a relatively constant value of 4 pa for increasing values of soil erodibility this behavior highlights how changes in soil erodibility for values below 1 0 10 3 s m 1 have an important effects on erosion by concentrated flow above this threshold changes in critical shear stress of the soil vary slowly reaching higher values with an average value approximately 4 pa this relationship coincides with that reported by knapen et al 2007 from field and laboratory tests 3 6 response validation based on the previous analysis a constant value of n 0 04 and distributed maps ranging from 1 44 10 6 5 10 6 m s 1 3 6 16 mm and 0 3 0 45 for k s h f and δ θ respectively were selected for water flow five simulations were considered to evaluate the effect of different erosion processes and their relationship with soil erodibility table 4 simulation 1 does not consider gullying processes only erosion caused by rills and raindrop impact simulation 2 considered gullying processes with a constant soil erodibility profile of k g 0 2 k r and a significant decrease in rill erodibility in simulations 3 to 5 the original surface rill erodibility was maintained as constant and the soil erodibility profile was modified to k g 0 5 k r k g 0 2 k r and k g 0 1 k r s m 1 fig 9 shows the results concerning the five simulations as observed the modeled erosive response coincides in time and shape with the measured data with a maximum bimodal sediment flow related to the geomorphological configuration of the sub basin with two drainage units an excellent agreement is found for the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient with the calibrated parameters of simulations 1 and 2 nse 0 89 and nse 0 88 respectively it is important to highlight that for simulation 2 the rill erodibility had to be reduced by 70 to compensate for the effect of gullying simulations 3 to 5 present values that overestimate the measurements performed when the calibrated values of rill erodibility were maintained with a proportional increase related to the internal erodibility of the soil profile 4 results and discussion in this study gullying including headcut migration and its internal concentrated flow has been simulated with other hillslope processes using a semi physically based and distributed model to assess changes in the basin erosive response simulation results showed a relative gullying sediment yield of 15 which is close to values reported previously for the study area vázquez 1995 furthermore the simulated headcut migration with an average distance of 3 8 cm was close to field observation at the study site gulliver 2009 and is also in line with the rates reported previously for southern spain vandekerckhove et al 2001 the parametrization of the scenario without gullies is similar to that described in knapen et al 2007 particularly the average threshold of 4 pa for critical shear stress these results support the average reference values obtained through field and laboratory tests from a modeling point of view the range of values for soil erodibility and critical shear stress generalize at basin scale what has been previously obtained the wider range of values obtained for soil erodibility which is more dependent on edaphic characteristics highlight the importance of a deeper knowledge of soil and land uses effects represented here by cover fraction soil roughness and plant residue this contrasts with critical shear stress which is more dependent on hydraulics and sediment size moreover the modification of soil erodibility parameters by the inclusion of gullying processes often not considered in modeling tasks highlights the important role of soil and its surface and subsurface erodibility in the erosive response the results of the simulations show how rill erodibility has to be overestimated in areas with gullying to compensate for the noninclusion of these hillslope processes this indicates that this parameter is generally overestimated in the relevant literature by considering the extension of the mapped gullies the increase of k r reaches 70 in the study area the results also point toward the important role of gully density given in our study by n g and the characteristics of the soil profile represented by k g which affects both the gully head migration and the internal erosion in the gully fig 10 shows the relationship between rill erodibility and the number of gullies by considering different values of k g as a function of k r the curves represent the best fit based on nse values with respect to the objective function as shown in fig 10 the nearer the inner erodibility of the gully to the rill erodibility the greater the reduction of k r necessary to obtain the observed results this decreasing exponential relationship approaches an asymptote this indicates that the increase in the number of gullies no larger produces an erodibility change which suggests a geomorphological threshold from which gullying does not produce an increase in sediment production as fig 10 shows this threshold has a strong dependence on soil profile erodibility with values of n g 8 n g 30 and n g 40 for soil profiles of k g 0 5 k r k g 0 2 k r and k g 0 1 k r respectively although the objective of this work was focused on changes in the erosive response the uncertainty associated with the set of simulation parameters errors in field and laboratory measurements as well as the adopted assumptions should be taken into account erosion modeling includes a headcut migration during events smaller than the cell size and b flow distribution between rills and gullies proportional to the width of the gullies and their density the first fits for the simulated event and obtained results with maximum values of 0 3 m the second points to the uncertainties of flow conditions along the hillslopes and their spatial heterogeneity the numerically modeled pattern of runoff which contrasts with measurements at the outlet of the basin as in previous works jain et al 2004 presents limitations for local conditions of overland flow or infiltration it is also important to highlight the effects of other processes that occur along the gully such as water seepage piping and mass failure that could be dominant in some cases simon et al 2000 thomas et al 2004 rengers et al 2016 the high sediment concentration at the first steps of gully formation could change the density and viscosity of flow which would alter critical shear stress infiltration or turbulence as have been considered in some models schindewolf and schmidt 2012 these processes could easily affect soil erodibility and therefore modify the erosive response moreover the morphodynamics of the gully including its different phases namely initiation development headcut migration stabilization and colonization of vegetation leopold et al 1995 bull 1997 gonzalez 2001 have not been considered in this work although the model showed positive results larger datasets and different rainfall event conditions are needed for its proper and complete validation in this regards the modeling attempt presented here also faces significant challenges such as improved considerations of the role of vegetation on erosive dynamics or comparing the model results at local sites within the hillslopes despite these limitations and others associated with distributed hydrological modeling described in detail by merritt et al 2003 recent works have underlined their capacity to reproduce runoff responses jain et al 2004 and the complexity and nonlinearity of the sediment cycle as well as its great potentiality for catchment management decision support bussi et al 2014 5 conclusions the obtained results allow us to assess the influence of soil and subsoil erodibility parameters on the erosive response by modeling gullying processes at the basin scale overestimation of soil erodibility reaches up to 70 to compensate for gullying when such processes are not taken into account the relationship between these parameters and the density of gullies define a geomorphological threshold for sediment yield by gullying notably these effects are not considered in the parametric models based on universal soil loss equation usle approaches this is especially important in semi arid environments where extreme precipitation events with durations of a few hours have serious effects on landscape evolution the complexity of the model presented in this work and the uncertainty related to different processes reveals into the great lack of knowledge of gullying at basin scale and the need to measure and develop field studies to assess the specific contributions of gully erosion acknowledgments this research was supported by the

26283,robust environmental decision support tools are critical to maximise the ecological benefit of management decisions however the models that underpin these rarely undergo rigorous evaluation here we evaluated components of a scenario based habitat suitability model the murray flow assessment tool by correlating model outputs against fish monitoring data collected since its development overall we detected a low correlation between habitat suitability scores for fish and fish assemblages during low flow conditions including when lags in fish response to hydrological inputs were introduced scores specific to fish functional groups were also poorly correlated with data for those groups finally model outcomes were highly sensitive to methods used to combine both individual indices and weightings for each component thus we recommend using constant weightings simple and consistent combination methods and reconsidering the number of fish functional groups as simplifications to this model and in the development of similar habitat suitability models elsewhere keywords habitat suitability model ecological response model preference curve evaluation murray darling basin 1 introduction environmental flows are managed flows that are released to benefit ecosystems downstream the use of fresh water for environmental flow regimes must be justified against a backdrop of increasing demands for water for irrigation stock domestic use and industry vorosmarty et al 2010 one approach to justifying environmental flows is to quantify potential benefits to aquatic ecosystems through the use of ecological response models hails and ormerod 2013 a range of modelling approaches have been used to assess potential ecological outcomes of alternative flow regimes these include individual based approaches e g perry and bond 2009 minimising differences in target scenarios compared with natural flow regimes e g ecological limits of hydrologic alteration poff et al 2010 and habitat based approaches e g murray flow assessment tool mfat young et al 2000 one advantage to habitat based approaches is that they provide a mechanism by which long term suitability of environmental conditions can be assessed marsh and cuddy 2010 in this paper we provide an overview of habitat suitability models commonly used to underpin decision support tools and then describe and evaluate the one used to underpin decision making in the murray darling basin mdb australia 1 1 habitat suitability models habitat suitability models hsms are generally static representations of change which can be spatially resolved and probabilistic guisan and zimmermann 2000 they serve three main purposes to predict species presence on the basis of abiotic and biotic variables improve the understanding of species habitat relationships and quantify habitat requirements ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 it is reasonable to expect a hsm to demonstrably meet the purpose for which it was built e g to assess the potential outcome of flow regimes by predicting species presence if it is to prove an effective model that can be used as part of a decision support tool there are multiple forms of hsms ranging from statistical or mechanistic to expert based index models index based hsms typically use habitat suitability or preference indices to describe the requirements for each habitat component e g flow duration inundation area required for a species life stage or guild lamouroux et al 1998 1999 welcomme et al 2006 these are subsequently combined using one of a number of possible combination methods often also differentially weighting individual components to give an overall habitat score indices are used to depict how habitat suitability for a particular organism changes ranging from unsuitable to suitable often as an index of 0 1 there are typically three categories of habitat suitability indices hsis bovee 1986 category i professional judgement category ii habitat use and category iii habitat preference category i indices are derived from life history studies in the literature or professional judgement category ii indices use data collected specifically for habitat studies based on frequency of occurrence of actual habitat conditions used by different species and life stages in a stream category iii combine a category ii frequency analysis with additional information on the availability of habitat combinations in the sampling reaches hsis can be created separately for different variables e g low and high flows and then combined to define a composite index response variables can also vary and can represent different parts of an ecosystem e g birds fish macroinvertebrates vegetation the choice of both habitat and response variables should relate to the objectives of the model and specific use case 1 2 habitat suitability models to assess competing flow regimes for aquatic and floodplain ecosystems a range of modelling tools have been developed to predict how physical habitat conditions e g water depth velocity cover substrata change with discharge and then use those relationships to infer changes in habitat suitability for a range of relevant taxa the instream flow incremental methodology bovee 1982 and its associated software the physical habitat simulation system phabsim shuler and nehring 1993 is a widely used hsm typically hsms compare hydrologic and hydraulic data for a grid of cells in a river stretch with the hsis of a target species young et al 2000 uses a similar modelling approach to phabsim where habitat requirements are modelled using hydrologic suitability indices however responses are at the scale of a zone rather than a grid more recent incarnations of the approach can be found in ecomodeller marsh et al 2007 and the ibis decision support system merritt et al 2009 2010 using the classification scheme of bovee 1986 these models use category i habitat suitability indices i e derived using professional judgement thomas and bovee 1993 suggest that the most controversial aspect of phabsim and presumably other hsms more generally is in the specification of a habitat suitability index for the taxon of interest phabsim has been evaluated to determine its sensitivity to errors in habitat suitability estimates e g shrivell 1989 hydraulic simulation e g osbourne et al 1988 and the use of a range of computational algorithms for microhabitat simulation e g gan and mcmahon 1990 more recent examples of index based hsms have been less rigorously evaluated to date at least in the scientific literature furthermore the method used to combine suitability indices into a composite score and the relative weightings of each are additional potential sources of model uncertainty that are rarely evaluated to our knowledge although the latter has been assessed for mfat and some alternative combination methods considered norton and andrews 2006 in hsms the most common methods used for combining suitability indices to calculate a composite hsi are the arithmetic mean geometric mean nth root of the product of n individual indices or the single factor limiting response i e the most limiting factor mfat uses a range of combination methods which were derived from expert judgements made by the regional evaluation groups regs young et al 2003 other hsms use different approaches e g ecomodeller most limiting factor marsh et al 2007 ibis either arithmetic mean or an expert driven weighting merritt et al 2010 phabsim enables the user to select the composite algorithm where input variables can be unweighted suggesting that each is equally important to the growth and survival of the organisms or weighted to reflect the relative importance of each shuler and nehring 1993 there are a range of options available for combining suitability indices in phabism e g geometric mean most limiting factor in the majority of approaches environmental variables are treated as independent and model sensitivity to the combination method chosen is not presented in the scientific literature 1 3 case study model murray flow assessment tool mfat mfat was developed to assess the ecological response to flow scenarios at a range of locations along the river murray and its tributaries australia young et al 2003 fig 1 the stated objective of the model is to provide a picture of the state of riverine ecology years into the future as a result of different possible flow management strategies young et al 2003 p 258 modelled daily river flows were used as an input to assess algal growth in channel habitat suitability for native fish and associated off channel habitat suitability for wetland and floodplain vegetation and waterbirds nine zones excluding the river murray estuary were described within each zone regs developed hsis for each functional group for a range of taxa including fish for typically 2 to 3 regions at the time of development mfat documented the best available ecological and hydrological scientific knowledge for the murray enabling repeatable and objective comparisons of flow scenarios across a range of spatial scales srp 2003 despite the length of time since its development mfat remains one of the tools actively used and adapted in environmental water planning within the mdb e g cew 2011 mdba 2011 overton et al 2014 the process used to develop an index of native fish habitat suitability with a range of 0 1 called habitat condition by the developers is typical of that used for other taxa seven functional groups were defined to span the range of fish species present e g wetland specialists main channel generalists appendix a for each region relevant functional groups were specified and not all groups were necessarily included in all zones or regions a range of hsis were developed for each functional group for flow related variables e g inundation duration dry period which were then combined to give an assessment of adult habitat condition ahc and recruitment habitat condition rhc for each functional group fig 2 norton and andrews 2006 hsis varied among regions as determined by each regional evaluation group reg these were again combined into a functional group specific fish habitat condition fhc index that was then aggregated across functional groups to give a single combined fish hsi native fish habitat condition nfhc per sub region norton and andrews 2006 weightings and combination methods at each step were determined using the expert opinion of the regs and thus vary the limitations of mfat are similar to those for many other hsms where outcomes consider single events in isolation rather than dynamic change and are often based on limited data or poorly documented thresholds miao et al 2009 model decisions and knowledge were well documented during the development of mfat limitations in expert opinion cooke 1991 and the response to multiple extreme events or event connectivity miao et al 2009 and uncertainty in the form of the relationship between flow and the response are broad limitations of the approach hsms also tend to ignore interactions among species life stages and habitat variables ayllón et al 2011 mfat is uses hydrologic data as a surrogate for small scale hydraulic data so does not consider depth velocity or substrate all of which may be more influential than and potentially poorly correlated with flow per se srp 2003 thus limiting the small scale conclusions that can be drawn furthermore there can be mismatch in the scale of the habitat assessment versus the specific indicators that are being simulated mfat has been criticised for not being easy to use being insensitive to alternative scenarios and for being overly complex largely through the number of weightings and the methods for combining hsis used mfat was considered to be a work in progress following its initial development srp 2003 but to our knowledge no further development beyond some sensitivity testing norton and andrews 2006 has occurred so this assessment stands furthermore no other tools have been developed at a similar spatial scale to supersede mfat that are able to inform the management of the southern mdb so there is benefit in attempting to test the model structure 1 4 testing a habitat condition model our aim was to test the fish habitat condition scores generated by mfat over time against fish assemblage data that are now available for the mfat defined zones to identify whether the two were correlated thus investigating one of the main purposes of a hsi that it predicts species presence based on biotic and abiotic factors while mfat was designed to assess average habitat condition for different long term scenarios rather than temporal progressions through time if habitat condition influences fish assemblages then there should be some general relationships between habitat condition outcomes and representative fish assemblages these relationships may be subject to time lags in this paper we attempt to identify these general relationships to explore relationships between fish assemblages and fish habitat condition as a form of evaluation of mfat similar to the approaches of hubert and rahel 1989 and railsback et al 2003 we describe which aspects of current assemblage data were consistent with the results of mfat simulations identify where mfat was performing well for the years in which we were able to test it and make recommendations for improvement where it was not we also investigate the sensitivity of the model to combination methods and variable weightings effectively exploring the manner in which suitable habitat is defined for the fish functional groups used within mfat 2 material and methods 2 1 fish assemblage data for comparison with mfat habitat condition scores the fish data used to empirically validate the mfat tool were sourced from the sustainable rivers audit sra the sra was a field based program designed to assess the condition of river ecosystems in the mdb davies et al 2010 the fish assemblage was surveyed during low flow conditions in spring summer and autumn each year from 2004 to 2007 for the data utilised here davies et al 2010 each sampling event spanned several weeks but were considered representative of assemblages over longer time periods at least 18 sampling sites within each river valley were sampled during each sampling event davies et al 2010 at each site all habitats were sampled in proportion to their occurrence up to 50 individuals per species were collected at each site the sra sample data recorded the identity origin i e point of collection and condition of individuals as well as the abundance and biomass of each species sampling effort was constant across all sites in the sra only fish greater than 15 mm were counted and biomass was calculated using empirical length weight relationships davies et al 2010 sra fish sampling used standardised methodologies to minimise errors due to variation in catch effort and this paper uses data obtained over the 2004 to 2007 sra sampling period only electrofishing data were included in the analyses of this paper to minimise variability due to sampling method for our analysis we used the sustainable rivers audit sra data from four of the zones defined by the murray flow assessment tool mfat zone a the mitta mitta river zone c yarrawonga weir to the wakool junction zone e lock 11 to lock 3 and zone j the murrumbidgee river fig 1 of the 134 sampling sites surveyed as a part of the sra assessment that fell within the four mfat zones explored 44 sites were in zone a 66 in zone c 2 in zone e and 34 in zone j zone e used location specific assessments for fish habitat condition and these were not intended to be extrapolated across the zone roberts et al 2003 so only directly comparable sra sampling sites were used all sampling sites were surveyed only once as a part of the sra assessment the sampling dates for each region differed systematically with sampling sites in zone c surveyed in november and december in each of 2004 2005 and 2006 and those in zone a sampled in march in each of 2005 and 2006 the two sampling sites in zone e were both sampled in june 2005 zone j was sampled in january and february of 2007 a flow chart summarising how the sra data were incorporated in our analyses is provided fig 3 we created 30 fish metrics from the sra data mfat developers did not specify which community properties were most likely to be represented by the model so we chose a suite to analyse a diversity of community properties the metrics we used included community descriptors abundance biomass species richness for the seven fish functional habitat groups defined by mfat i e macquarie perch macquaria australasica freshwater catfish tandanus tandanus flood spawners wetland specialists main channel generalists main channel specialists and low flow specialists see appendix a for species within each fish functional group note that macquarie perch and freshwater catfish are each considered by mfat to be their own functional group and that we capitalise each of the functional groups throughout to clearly identify places where we are referring to the groups as defined here these metrics represent a plausible range of community attributes that could be influenced by habitat condition if abundance were related to habitat condition this may suggest that greater habitat condition enabled greater recruitment success and or lower mortality regardless of species identity within a functional group a relationship with species richness suggested that greater habitat condition resulted in a more diverse assemblage while a relationship with biomass suggested that greater habitat condition resulted larger and or more fish in a given zone a seven functional groups were defined by mfat in addition to those we also calculated four additional groups other for species that were collected by sra but not categorised by mfat native including all native species exotic including all exotic species and total including all fish species collected to determine whether patterns simulated by mfat applied across the fish assemblage as a whole rather than just to the functional groups specified b for example main channel specialist abundance for a given site was correlated with the ahc score for main channel specialists in the mfat zone in which that site fell to assess how well the scores derived for that group correlated with the intended group c for example main channel specialist abundance was cross correlated with the ahc score for all other functional groups to assess whether all functional groupings were necessary based on their ability to correlate with fish metrics for their own versus other functional groups d for example for a 2 year lag fish metrics from 2006 were correlated with mfat nhfc scores from 2004 and fish metrics from 2007 were correlated with nfhc from 2005 to assess whether there was a lag in fish response to suitable habitat e for example fish metrics from both 2006 and 2007 were correlated with mfat nhfc scores from 2005 to assess whether year specific events such as floods correlated with fish assemblages f mfat component scores are abbreviated as follows ahc adult habitat condition shc spawning habitat condition lhc larval habitat condition rhc recruitment habitat condition fhc fish habitat condition nfhc native fish habitat condition refer to fig 2 for additional information on the construction of each component score by using the seven fish functional groups defined by mfat we firstly assessed the relationships between mfat and the functional groups it was designed to represent see fig 3 however much of the fish assemblage measured by sra fell outside the species included in those functional groups thus we also investigated whether the relationships simulated by mfat applied to the wider fish assemblage by adding four additional groups total native invasive and other invasive and other species are not included in mfat and the native category combined the seven mfat functional groups plus the other category these categories were compared against the overall mfat scores such as fhc an example of a fish metric was abundance of wetland specialists or biomass of main channel specialists 2 2 modelling a baseline hydrological scenario to generate mfat fish habitat condition scores to create the mfat habitat condition scores the first step was to run a hydrological scenario we used the current river operations baseline scenario based on that included in csiro 2012 from msm bigmod close and sharma 2005 because it approximates the management and flow volumes within the river when the sra data were collected assuming that all existing infrastructure is in place refer to the discussion for a justification of the choice of modelled rather than measured flows for this comparison the modelled baseline outputs daily flows in the river murray over 114 years and has been used as the baseline in water resource planning by the murray darling basin authority this scenario met the recommendation by mfat developers in young et al 2003 whereby flow scenarios used to run the model represent the daily flow values that were the output from a river hydrology model the original development and use of mfat was also based on modelled flows young et al 2003 daily hydrologic outputs were therefore used as inputs to the mfat models in the four zones fig 3 an annual fhc score is calculated for each zone which can then be aggregated across calendar years this score is generated by combining preference curves as described in fig 2 for example within a year an event is scored based on preference curves that represented exceedance of a flow percentile the timing of this event the duration and the time since a last event where there are multiple events the highest score for the year was used the resultant mfat scores applied for the individual zone for a single year we provide a summary of the scores for the mfat scenario in section 4 and the method used to construct them in fig 3 hydrology inputs to mfat occur at specific locations but the results may be extrapolated to a range of spatial scales from single locations to the whole river basin young et al 2003 basic flow characteristics table 1 at eight gauges were used to describe the scenario for both the entire model period and the period over which sra data were collected colemans upper region and tallandoon lower region are located in the mitta mitta river which makes up the headwaters of the river murray zone a yarrawonga upper region and tocumwal lower region are found in the mid lowland reaches of the murray zone c zone e focuses specifically on two locations rather than regions mullaroo creek upper and lock 7 lower gundagai which is the nearest gauging station to the tumut river confluence upper region and redbank weir lower region are located on the murrumbidgee river zone j refer to fig 1 for a map of gauge locations 2 3 evaluating correlations between mfat scores and empirical data sra fish metrics to validate the mfat s ability to predict the native fish assemblage of the mid murray river we examined the correlation between mfat fish condition summary scores i e nfhc and sra fish metrics fig 3 analyses were conducted using site specific data from across all four river zones as mfat nfhc scores were created for each river zone all sites within a zone received identical scores preliminary data exploration revealed no obvious complex relations i e there was no evidence of bimodal or quadratic relationships or interactions indicating that simple correlation was sufficient to test the predictive potential of the mfat model in instances where a functional group contained only one species e g low flow specialists binomial logistic regression was used in place of pearson s r correlations binomial general linear models were fitted using the bias corrected algorithm for maximum likelihood estimates developed by firth 1993 and conducted using the brglm package in r kosmidis 2013 all correlations were constructed using pearson s r in systat v 12 systat software san jose ca correlations were also generated between the sra fish metrics and components of the overall mfat score fish habitat condition score fhc ahc and rhc fig 3 the rationale for using the component scores in addition to the nfhc was to identify whether any part of the model was more or less correlated with fish assemblages this included investigating how well correlated rhc was despite a lack of fish data providing a direct measure of recruitment we did not analyse the component scores that combined to create rhc lhc and spawning habitat condition shc we were also interested in whether the predictive ability of the mfat model was similar across fish functional groups e g wetland specialists freshwater catfish etc because this could lead to model simplification i e functional groups could be merged to this end we cross correlated mfat functional group specific scores against the fish metrics for other functional groups fig 3 we considered that functional groups would be supported when there was a significant positive correlation α 0 05 between the score for that group and any of the fish metrics assessed we tested for any consistent lags in response time by correlating the fish metrics with same suite of scores generated over the ten years prior to fish data collection fig 3 this test used lags in mfat scores that were appropriate for each data point e g for fish collected in 2006 an mfat score with a lag of one year came from 2005 while fish collected in 2007 had an mfat score with a 1 year lag from 2006 we also investigated whether there were any threshold or other year specific responses by correlating fish metrics with mfat scores from specific previous years between 1997 and 2006 i e regardless of the year in which fish were sampled an example of such an effect may be a relatively high flow year where successful recruitment drove fish populations for several years to come so here all fish metrics were correlated against the mfat score from a single year e g 2006 regardless of when they were collected e g 2006 and 2007 in the example above unless a lag is specified analyses used a default of comparing mfat scores to fish metrics in the same year 2 4 evaluating the influence of weightings on the nfhc score the default weightings used by mfat to calculate parameters within the model were defined by the expert inputs of the various regs to characterise the impact of each variable on different fish functional groups in different regions and zones as a result the relative weighting of a given parameter varies among regions zones and functional groups for example the following formulae illustrate the use of weightings xa in the calculation of fhc rhc and ahc see also fig 2 1 fhc x 1 ahc x 2 rhc 2 rhc x 3 shc x 4 lhc 3 ahc x 5 wd x 6 wt x 7 cc x 8 fp x 9 mf where shc is spawning habitat condition lhc is larval habitat condition and ahc is a combination of the suitability of the amount of woody debris present wd water temperature wt channel condition cc fish passage fp and maintenance flows mf in the upper region of zone c ahc is weighted between 0 36 and 0 53 x1 in equation 1 out of a total of 1 0 depending on the functional group in the lower region of zone c the same parameter is weighted variously between 0 25 and 0 77 depending on the functional group indicating that adult habitat condition was considered more influential for some groups than recruitment habitat condition weighted with x2 in equation 1 the relative weighting of spawning habitat condition x3 in equation 2 compared to larval habitat condition x4 in equation 2 to calculate rhc also varied widely in the lower region of zone c accounting for 0 3 to 0 82 of the total 1 0 depending on the functional group other weightings for other zones vary similarly across regions and functional groups to test the influence of the weightings applied to each component of the nfhc score obtained we compared three weighting types fig 3 default combinations reflecting the expert inputs of the regs constant weightings where all factors were treated equally and random numbers generated in microsoft excel were all used thirty sets of random numbers were generated and correlations were calculated for each and the mean and standard deviation of those correlations are reported the range of weightings used including both the default and altered weightings are shown in appendix b in assessing the performance of the constant and randomly assigned weightings the weightings used to calculate ahc and rhc were altered i e either to be constant or according to the random weightings generated respectively and fhc was recalculated equation 1 weightings were also altered for the rhc inputs shc and lhc equation 2 the shc and lhc scores are hydrologically defined where inputs included flood magnitude flow timing rate of flow rise and fall duration of flow flushing flows flow percentiles and no flow conditions fig 2 the ahc component is dependent on physical habitat variables e g woody debris water temperature channel condition fish passage and maintenance flows equation 3 these variables were fixed over the duration of the modelling period as was the case during mfat development so ahc did not vary among years but did among regions appendix c reference flows used to determine parts of the ahc score were set to the defaults used in mfat so called natural conditions young et al 2003 the nfhc score represents the aggregate fhc for all functional groups equally weighted 2 5 evaluating the influence of the method of combining component scores mfat uses a broad range of methods to create the habitat condition scores across the various functional groups regions and zones with the method used for main channel specialists in zone c given as an example in fig 2 different methods e g using geometric versus arithmetic means include inherent assumptions and have the ability to influence model outputs to test this influence we compared six common methods of combining habitat condition indices with that actually used in mfat for each of lhc for main channel specialists in upper region of zone c which uses both weighted sums and geometric means for different components as illustrated in fig 2 and for both wetland specialists and main channel generalists in the upper region of zone a fig 3 by default lhc for both main channel generalists and main channel specialists is a function of the suitability of the flow duration fd inundation area ia inundation duration id dry period dp and flow percentile fpl in mfat these were combined according to the following formulae 4 lhc fp l fd where the median flow is less than the natural median and 5 lhc ia id dp 3 where the median flow is greater than the natural median where natural median is defined as the median flow modelled to occur without water resource development in the mdb young et al 2003 this definition however is not used for other functional groups in the same regions for example for flood spawners in the upper regions of zones a and c lhc is defined as follows 6 lhc lhc nf 1 lhc nf rf l ia id dp 4 where lhcnf is a user defined default value for larval habitat condition in no flood conditions rfl is the suitability of the rate of flow fall for larval fish components and other terms are consistent with the definitions above in contrast lhc for wetland specialists in both regions of zone a is defined as a constant value of 1 this range of combination methods illustrates the choices available and the potential for those choices to be influencing the scores that mfat produces we calculated lhc for each group using a maximum minimum i e to identify the most limiting factor average geometric mean of fpl and fd referred to as square root flows constant of 1 referred to as constant 1 and multiplying fpl and fd referred to as multiplicative flows we concentrated on fpl and fd as flows were generally low between 2004 and 2007 so were more often below the natural median than above it equation 4 table 1 for each example we report the percentage change in lhc rhc and fhc compared with the defaults 3 results mfat predicted considerable variation in fish habitat condition in the south eastern mdb between 2004 and 2007 for that period native fish habitat condition nfhc scores varied between 0 31 and 0 82 fish habitat condition fhc varied between 0 06 for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone a in 2006 to 0 90 for the same functional group in the lower region of zone e in 2005 appendix c adult habitat condition ahc varied between 0 00 for wetland specialists in the lower region of zone j in 2007 and 0 88 for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone e in 2005 recruitment habitat condition rhc varied between 0 04 for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone a in 2006 to 1 00 for wetland specialists main channel generalists and main channel specialists for a range of zones and years appendix c these ranges suggest that the baseline flow scenario used was sufficiently variable to allow meaningful assessment of correlations between murray flow assessment tool mfat scores and fish metrics through time the sra program recorded 7800 individual fish from 30 species between 2004 and 2007 of which 3205 were native 41 total biomass was 1 119 738 kg of which only 174 863 kg 16 were from native fish reflecting the general small bodied nature of australian natives the introduced gambusia gambusia holbrooki was the most abundant species 1338 ind with the native mountain galaxias galaxias olidus the next most abundant 919 ind the six most commonly detected species were all introduced with common carp cyprinus carpio found at 54 sites across three zones and the brown trout salmo trutta found at 52 sites across all four zones the two most common the most commonly detected native species was australian smelt retropinna semoni 23 sites across 3 zones followed by mountain galaxias 20 sites across all 4 zones the total richness abundance and biomass of fish varied substantially across zones and functional groups appendix d zones with more sampling sites tended to have higher abundances and richness than those with few sra data and table e1 contains no correction for the number of sampling sites included in each zone the other functional group was most commonly the richest i e in both regions of zone a and c and the upper region of zone j but main channel generalists lower region of zone a and upper region of zone j wetland specialists lower regions of zones a and j and main channel specialists upper region of zone j were equally diverse in some regions the most abundant functional group varied substantially across zones and regions with the low flow specialist and flood spawner functional groups were typically the least abundant only 53 individuals from 3 species were collected from zone e no freshwater catfish were caught during the sra sampling included here and only four macquarie perch were detected so those two groups were excluded from functional group specific analyses 3 1 evaluating correlations between nfhc and component scores and sra fish data collected in the same year overall native fish habitat condition scores were poorly correlated with sra overall fish metrics n 134 for all correlations fig 4 when scores were generated using flows from the same year as fish sampling e g comparing native and total richness abundance and biomass for 2004 with the mfat score calculated for 2004 nfhc scores were consistently negatively correlated with overall fish metrics fig 4 with 0 year lag these negative correlations were weak i e between 0 07 and 0 12 and were not statistically significant the nfhc was best correlated with main channel specialist abundance in the same year r 0 12 but this was not a significant relationship weak and non significant associations were also found for the components of nhfc table 2 fhc showed very few significant correlations with any overall or functional group specific fish metric there were no instances where fhc was significantly positively correlated with the functional group which it was intended to describe pearson s r ranged from 0 50 for the correlation between richness and fhc for wetland specialists to 0 18 for the correlation between biomass and fhc for low flow specialists although there were insufficient numbers of macquarie perch and freshwater catfish collected to include in these analyses similarly there were no instances of significant positive correlations between rhc scores and the functional group for which they were intended in contrast ahc scores were almost always better correlated than the fhc score was with individual fish metrics also the correlation between ahc for main channel generalists and the intended functional group richness was highly significant r 0 65 we also investigated whether any single functional group specific score may have captured habitat condition across multiple fish functional group metrics i e to identify potential simplifications in the functional groups included in the model there was a trend for fhc for freshwater catfish to be significantly positively correlated with fish metrics across multiple functional groups e g wetland and low flow specialist biomass r 0 50 for both table e1 rhc for low flow specialists was best correlated with fish metrics across other functional groups being significantly correlated with total biomass r 0 21 and main channel generalist richness r 0 35 among others table e2 ahc scores for main channel generalists were significantly positively correlated with the suite of individual fish metrics table e3 including measures of richness biomass and abundances e g native and flood spawner biomass r 0 348 and 0 498 respectively for other functional groups ahc for macquarie perch main channel specialists and low flow specialists were all significantly correlated with a range of individual fish metrics particularly for richness fish metrics 3 2 evaluating lags in correlation between nfhc scores and sra fish data incorporating lags of 3 9 and 10 years into the comparison improved the resultant correlations fig 4 table 3 comparisons including lags of either 3 or 10 years resulted in consistently positive but non significant correlations with a lag of 9 years all correlations were positive except for that with native biomass r 0 08 appendix f and correlations between the nfhc score and either total or native abundance were highly statistically significant r 0 35 and 0 31 respectively most fish functional groups appeared to be contributing to this pattern with wetland specialist main channel generalist main channel specialist and low flow specialist abundances all significantly positively correlated with nfhc scores at a lag of 9 years the notion of a threshold or other year specific response had some support with nfhc scores from 1996 being better correlated with fish metrics than most other years table e4 for that year correlations with native richness and native abundance were both statistically significant r 0 23 and 0 24 respectively this pattern was largely driven by significant positive correlations with wetland specialist and main channel generalist richness and abundances and with low flow specialist abundances nfhc scores from 1995 2000 and 2002 also showed positive correlations with fish metrics but these were not statistically significant 3 3 evaluating the influence of weightings on the nfhc score the default weightings used to combine the components did not improve the strength of correlations observed between the nfhc score and fish metrics fig 5 for the overall fish metrics investigated the default weightings resulted in more negative correlations with fish metrics than constant even weightings or the average of correlations derived from randomly assigned weightings for the most part changing the method of weighting nfhc components shifted the relationships from the moderate to slight negative correlations observed under the original weightings with no time lag introduced to either no relationship or small positive correlations fig 5 small positive correlations were more common for native fish metrics than total fish metrics indicating that native species patterns may have been better captured using constant or random weightings no correlations identified for any method of selecting weightings were statistically significant fig 5 3 4 evaluating the influence of the method of combining component scores the method of combining habitat condition indices had a large impact on the value of larval habitat condition lhc obtained for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone c four of the six alternative combination methods applied tended to decrease lhc while the other two resulted in increases fig 6 changes of 124 and 100 in lhc were observed for individual years within the 114 year model run on average altering the combination method for lhc resulted in changes of between 30 and 100 when propagated through the model to calculate rhc and fhc this impact was progressively lower due to the impact of other factors in those calculations which we did not recalculate similar patterns were evident for the other examples explored for main channel generalists in the upper region of zone a changes in lhc of between 177 and 100 in individual years were observed average changes depending on the combination method used were between 8 and 99 for wetland specialists in the upper region of zone a lhc differed by between 0 and 100 on average both examples again showed a tendency for lower lhc scores than the default combination method produced 4 discussion 4 1 evaluating correlations between mfat scores and empirical data from the same year overall native fish habitat condition nfhc scores were poorly correlated with the fish assemblages sampled during the sustainable rivers audit sra in the four zones investigated this suggests that i habitat condition is only a limited representation of changes which preference different assemblages of fish ii that the choice of flow period and hydrologic variables investigated here are not representative of long term flows and a different period and potentially longer period of flows or different suite of variables is needed iii that fish habitat is not as strongly influenced by flow as the models suggest noting that whilst non flow habitat characteristics are used in mfat they are treated as static states or iv that fish data cannot be used as a surrogate measure of habitat condition and fish assemblages may be influenced by other drivers such as recruitment failure trophic interactions and harvesting we also investigated the components of nfhc to determine whether any of these were better correlated with fish assemblages ahc tended to be better correlated with fish assemblages than rhc in particular but also somewhat better than fhc ahc captures non hydrologic parameters e g the presence of woody debris and connectivity and did not vary at any location across years thus mfat may be better at capturing inherent differences among locations than differences associated with hydrology for the period investigated differences in the numbers of fish caught from each functional group did not appear to be affecting the observed patterns either main channel generalists and invasive species were two of the most abundant groups analysed but neither appeared more likely to be significantly correlated with mfat scores than groups with fewer sampled individuals and differences in fish abundance should have had less impact on correlations with overall fish metrics instead the lack of consistency between taxa identified as being likely to have suitable habitat and the taxa actually captured was notable there was no evidence that any functional group specific components of nfhc were performing better for their own functional group compared to others and so no evidence that the number of functional groups included was warranted even main channel generalist adult habitat condition ahc which was significantly correlated with main channel generalist abundance was better correlated with other fish functional groups indicating low specificity of the scores produced component scores tended to be well correlated across all functional groups or none suggesting that differences in fish habitat condition may be small across the various functional groups and simplification across functional groups may be beneficial e g ahc for main channel generalists may describe habitat condition more broadly across a range of functional groups as could fhc for freshwater catfish 4 2 evaluating lags in correlations between mfat scores and empirical data a 9 year lag improved correlations with nfhc scores for the abundance of most functional groups and overall fish metrics including total and native abundance there was little evidence of other significant lags or of differing lags for different functional groups some of the groups which were significantly correlated at a lag of 9 years included long lived species e g murray cod macquaria peelii peelii live 40 years lintermans 2007 but others are likely much shorter lived e g galaxids within the wetland specialists typically live 1 3 years allen et al 2002 this raises questions as to the biological importance of such a long lag and it is possible that the result is coincidental furthermore analysis of scores from specific calendar years showed that 1996 was the best correlated single year which may confound the finding of a significant 9 year lag as 1996 was 9 years prior to sampling for many of the sra sites included this potential confounding of whether the length of time i e 9 years or the individual year e g due to a threshold response in some flow variable influenced fish assemblages cannot be untangled using this data set however the 1996 flow year had the highest flow peak up to 143 740 ml day 1 at the yarrawonga gauge for the river murray of the 10 year 1995 2004 flow series analysed this suggests that mfat scores may be more representative of high flow years than the series of low flow years assessed here or perhaps the effects of a year of high habitat condition has a sustained impact on fish assemblages e g over multiple generations via an increase in standing stock but additional investigation would be necessary to confirm either effect 4 3 impact of study design on mfat assessment in comparing the outputs of mfat to measured fish assemblages for the relevant regions it was possible that we were attempting to apply the model in a manner for which it was not intended for example mfat was designed to investigate the habitat condition for multiple taxa including fish over a scale that represents a flow regime rather than changes through time consequently we have looked for general patterns rather than investigating temporal trends for example to find relationships between habitat condition and fish assemblages it appears reasonable to us that fish habitat in good condition should be expected to result in generally more diverse more abundant native fish assemblages or ones that have greater biomass than habitat in poor condition if all else is equal this appears to be consistent with developers intentions given that linking model responses to measureable indicators of fish assemblage was a goal of future development young et al 2000 as a result we believe that it is valid to assess links between model outputs and fish assemblages as new monitoring data are available given that we have repeated mfat scores for multiple sites within zones some readers may question whether our experimental design is pseudo replicated pseudo replication arises when the assumption of independence among replicate samples is not met colegrave and ruxton 2018 which would arise if the dependent variables in this analysis were not independent here the lack of independence among samples here is in the independent variables it is in fact extremely common to run linear models with few levels in an independent variable this is what routinely occurs in analyses of variance and covariance and is not considered to be pseudo replicated quinn and keough 2002 the alternative approach of averaging fish metrics across a zone has the effect of dramatically reducing the variability within the fish data set which may perversely be more likely to result in spurious relationships being identified this variability was considered to be a critical part of the fish response to habitat and so we did not choose to average in our evaluation we used modelled rather than measured flows there is a long history of using modelled flows both to construct and test ecohydrological models e g garnier et al 2002 lester and fairweather 2011 and knouft and chu 2015 all use modelled flows and monitoring data across a range of target model taxa and either choice is valid the analyses included here were intended to inform management by providing a quantitative assessment of differences in fish assemblage that may correspond to changes in mfat score across alternative environmental watering scenarios thus any relationships identified needed to hold in modelled scenarios of future flows and the use of measured flows would have created additional uncertainty in that application although observed hydrologic data are often assumed to be error free this is rarely the case particularly at low flows di baldassarre and montanari 2009 tomkins 2012 and assessment of the hydrologic model used indicated that the model performed well under low flow conditions such as those that were typical of the period investigated here csiro 2008a van dijk et al 2008 thus we have confidence that the model is a reasonable representation of flows and that the use of modelled data was more appropriate in this case than observed hydrologic data the comparison of mfat scores and sra data undertaken here occurred under one set of conditions and assumptions that may affect the apparent performance of the mfat model these include that eight regions over up to four years each may limit the variability in mfat scores assessed the years in which fish data were collected 2004 2007 were low flow years csiro 2008b so mfat s ability to perform under a range of flows was not assessed there is potential mismatch for some sra sites and mfat zones with zone c for example being defined as a length of the main channel reg 2003 but many of the sra sites occurring on tributaries the systematic timing of sra sampling may have influenced the pattern of correlations observed and sampling efficiency may vary among zones gwinn et al 2015 component scores were all correlated with fish assemblages 15 mm including rhc not least because no data at an appropriate scale measured recruitment specifically e g young of year data pearson s r was used as the measure of correlation introducing assumptions of a bivariate normal distribution and that relationships were linear zar 1999 initial investigation of the data and relationships identified suggested that these assumptions were reasonable and the choices made here were intended to maximise the data included without contravening the intention of the model developers based on model documentation e g reg 2003 roberts et al 2003 caution is however warranted due to the number of individual tests that were conducted and because scores from mfat were repeated so as not to underestimate variability in sra data potentially inflating sample sizes conducting many tests in this manner is likely to produce type i errors in 5 of cases i e α 0 05 so individual significant relationships should be further tested in planned comparisons with novel data sets to ensure that correlations are meaningful zar 1999 or by adjusting the resultant probability values by tests such as bonferroni procedures repeating mfat scores can also lower critical r values potentially tending to increase the number of significant relationships identified however the general lack of correlation among functional groups and their mfat component scores and total fish metrics and nfhc scores would not be affected by any type i errors nor any inflation of sample sizes and ensuring that any non independence of data did not affect the outcome described here colegrave and ruxton 2018 4 4 evaluating the influence of weightings on the nfhc score the weightings used to combine individual mfat components into an overall score appeared to add little to the correlation of model outputs with fish metrics these weightings were based on expert opinion as to the relative importance of model parameters for each functional group in each region and zone weightings varied widely among those categories previous analyses found that model outcomes were variably sensitive to default weightings depending on the number of parameters included in a given mfat component norton and andrews 2006 here constant even weightings or randomly generated weightings had similar correlations to overall fish metrics and both consistently outperformed the default reg defined weightings particularly for native fish metrics this indicates that the default weightings are obscuring relationships between mfat scores and the fish assemblages assessed here possibly due to unintended interactions we recommend that constant weightings be applied as a potential simplification to the model one that would perform equally well or better under low flow conditions such as those tested here 4 5 evaluating the influence of the method of combining component scores the method of combining habitat condition indices had a substantial impact on the overall score obtained the default method of combining indices used in mfat varied widely among parameters but also for the same parameter among functional groups regions and zones default methods included arithmetic and geometric means constant values and threshold statements there are assumptions associated with each e g that habitat condition for one variable such as velocity can compensate to some degree for poor condition in another such as depth for an arithmetic mean korman et al 1994 thus the choice of multiple methods implies different limiting factors across locations and for different functional groups when we altered the method of combining indices for lhc and propagated the result differences in fhc of between 55 and 67 were obtained with the potential to substantially affect nfhc scores previous modelling found differences of between 15 and 36 in nfhc as a result of an additional 1500 gl y 1 flow in these regions srp 2003 so these differences are likely to be ecologically meaningful thus we recommend that combination methods be as simple as possible given the potential for unintended interactions and that the assumptions inherent in the chosen combination method are carefully considered and documented ensuring that different approaches are warranted by our ecological understanding the impact of inconsistent combination methods on the ability of mfat to predict fish habitat condition are not clear highlighting the need for careful choice of model structure and the need to undertake rigorous testing to understand the impact of those decisions 4 6 utility of habitat condition models to support natural resource management mfat young et al 2000 has proved to be an influential resource for modelling ecological outcomes in the mdb it has been used in establishing the volume of water recovery for the murray darling basin authority s living murray program www mdba gov au programs tlm accessed 25 05 2012 as a tool for supporting decisions on environmental water use cew 2011 and for assessment of ecological outcomes of the murray darling basin plan csiro 2012 indeed the impetus for this work arose from questions asked by natural resource managers about what changes in fish assemblages would result from increased habitat condition in the mfat model this ongoing application illustrates a need for models such as mfat to support natural resource management but also comparisons such as those described here to ensure that results are interpreted appropriately this work has shown that the mfat model is highly sensitive to some of its assumptions and simplifications are likely to be warranted for it to be of greater value to natural resource managers however there have been few subsequent advances in improving the tool base available for modelling fish populations in the mdb freshwater fish are acknowledged to be difficult to model van nes et al 2002 and fish is only one of the components modelled by mfat as a whole but it remains important to understand how well fish models perform future investments in modelling fish communities should seek to be less expert driven and use a modelling approach that is more adept at handling dynamic changes in ecosystems to improve the representation of community and population dynamics anderson et al 2006 and testing is needed over a wide range of hydrologic conditions however the data and knowledge needed to support such models are generally still quite poor and the potential use of new data in modelling is rarely considered when planning data generating programs given the importance of ecological models in evaluating and optimising flow scenarios future investments in data collection which can support model development are urgently needed this includes data collection which is hypothesis based and collected more frequently than occurs under current data programs and so represents a significant challenge to management agencies and researchers to design efficient cost effective programs 5 conclusions and recommendations we found that the scores derived from the fish models in the murray flow assessment tool mfat were poorly correlated with fish metrics calculated from sra fish surveys in 2004 2007 during the low flow years of our assessment structural components in the models were better correlated than flow related components functional group specific components were not better correlated with fish metrics for that functional group than others suggesting low specificity for each score default weightings on components did not improve correlations between mfat scores and fish metrics compared with constant equal weightings or randomly derived weightings and the method of combining components had a large impact on mfat scores we recommend that constant equal weightings be used instead of the default weightings to simplify the mfat model we also recommend that the method of combining components be re assessed to introduce some consistency and decrease the likelihood of unintended interactions finally functional group specific habitat condition indices should be re assessed to ensure that the described differences in habitat condition among the various groups reflect their specific habitat needs and that the inclusion of all groups is warranted model refinements should continue to be evaluated against additional data preferably including higher flow years than could be assessed here as should the other taxonomic groups e g wetland vegetation included within mfat we believe that implementing these changes will lead to a more robust tool that will better inform the management of the river murray to maximise fish habitat condition similarly applying these recommendations during the development of similar models in future should lead to simpler models with more transparent links

26283,robust environmental decision support tools are critical to maximise the ecological benefit of management decisions however the models that underpin these rarely undergo rigorous evaluation here we evaluated components of a scenario based habitat suitability model the murray flow assessment tool by correlating model outputs against fish monitoring data collected since its development overall we detected a low correlation between habitat suitability scores for fish and fish assemblages during low flow conditions including when lags in fish response to hydrological inputs were introduced scores specific to fish functional groups were also poorly correlated with data for those groups finally model outcomes were highly sensitive to methods used to combine both individual indices and weightings for each component thus we recommend using constant weightings simple and consistent combination methods and reconsidering the number of fish functional groups as simplifications to this model and in the development of similar habitat suitability models elsewhere keywords habitat suitability model ecological response model preference curve evaluation murray darling basin 1 introduction environmental flows are managed flows that are released to benefit ecosystems downstream the use of fresh water for environmental flow regimes must be justified against a backdrop of increasing demands for water for irrigation stock domestic use and industry vorosmarty et al 2010 one approach to justifying environmental flows is to quantify potential benefits to aquatic ecosystems through the use of ecological response models hails and ormerod 2013 a range of modelling approaches have been used to assess potential ecological outcomes of alternative flow regimes these include individual based approaches e g perry and bond 2009 minimising differences in target scenarios compared with natural flow regimes e g ecological limits of hydrologic alteration poff et al 2010 and habitat based approaches e g murray flow assessment tool mfat young et al 2000 one advantage to habitat based approaches is that they provide a mechanism by which long term suitability of environmental conditions can be assessed marsh and cuddy 2010 in this paper we provide an overview of habitat suitability models commonly used to underpin decision support tools and then describe and evaluate the one used to underpin decision making in the murray darling basin mdb australia 1 1 habitat suitability models habitat suitability models hsms are generally static representations of change which can be spatially resolved and probabilistic guisan and zimmermann 2000 they serve three main purposes to predict species presence on the basis of abiotic and biotic variables improve the understanding of species habitat relationships and quantify habitat requirements ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 it is reasonable to expect a hsm to demonstrably meet the purpose for which it was built e g to assess the potential outcome of flow regimes by predicting species presence if it is to prove an effective model that can be used as part of a decision support tool there are multiple forms of hsms ranging from statistical or mechanistic to expert based index models index based hsms typically use habitat suitability or preference indices to describe the requirements for each habitat component e g flow duration inundation area required for a species life stage or guild lamouroux et al 1998 1999 welcomme et al 2006 these are subsequently combined using one of a number of possible combination methods often also differentially weighting individual components to give an overall habitat score indices are used to depict how habitat suitability for a particular organism changes ranging from unsuitable to suitable often as an index of 0 1 there are typically three categories of habitat suitability indices hsis bovee 1986 category i professional judgement category ii habitat use and category iii habitat preference category i indices are derived from life history studies in the literature or professional judgement category ii indices use data collected specifically for habitat studies based on frequency of occurrence of actual habitat conditions used by different species and life stages in a stream category iii combine a category ii frequency analysis with additional information on the availability of habitat combinations in the sampling reaches hsis can be created separately for different variables e g low and high flows and then combined to define a composite index response variables can also vary and can represent different parts of an ecosystem e g birds fish macroinvertebrates vegetation the choice of both habitat and response variables should relate to the objectives of the model and specific use case 1 2 habitat suitability models to assess competing flow regimes for aquatic and floodplain ecosystems a range of modelling tools have been developed to predict how physical habitat conditions e g water depth velocity cover substrata change with discharge and then use those relationships to infer changes in habitat suitability for a range of relevant taxa the instream flow incremental methodology bovee 1982 and its associated software the physical habitat simulation system phabsim shuler and nehring 1993 is a widely used hsm typically hsms compare hydrologic and hydraulic data for a grid of cells in a river stretch with the hsis of a target species young et al 2000 uses a similar modelling approach to phabsim where habitat requirements are modelled using hydrologic suitability indices however responses are at the scale of a zone rather than a grid more recent incarnations of the approach can be found in ecomodeller marsh et al 2007 and the ibis decision support system merritt et al 2009 2010 using the classification scheme of bovee 1986 these models use category i habitat suitability indices i e derived using professional judgement thomas and bovee 1993 suggest that the most controversial aspect of phabsim and presumably other hsms more generally is in the specification of a habitat suitability index for the taxon of interest phabsim has been evaluated to determine its sensitivity to errors in habitat suitability estimates e g shrivell 1989 hydraulic simulation e g osbourne et al 1988 and the use of a range of computational algorithms for microhabitat simulation e g gan and mcmahon 1990 more recent examples of index based hsms have been less rigorously evaluated to date at least in the scientific literature furthermore the method used to combine suitability indices into a composite score and the relative weightings of each are additional potential sources of model uncertainty that are rarely evaluated to our knowledge although the latter has been assessed for mfat and some alternative combination methods considered norton and andrews 2006 in hsms the most common methods used for combining suitability indices to calculate a composite hsi are the arithmetic mean geometric mean nth root of the product of n individual indices or the single factor limiting response i e the most limiting factor mfat uses a range of combination methods which were derived from expert judgements made by the regional evaluation groups regs young et al 2003 other hsms use different approaches e g ecomodeller most limiting factor marsh et al 2007 ibis either arithmetic mean or an expert driven weighting merritt et al 2010 phabsim enables the user to select the composite algorithm where input variables can be unweighted suggesting that each is equally important to the growth and survival of the organisms or weighted to reflect the relative importance of each shuler and nehring 1993 there are a range of options available for combining suitability indices in phabism e g geometric mean most limiting factor in the majority of approaches environmental variables are treated as independent and model sensitivity to the combination method chosen is not presented in the scientific literature 1 3 case study model murray flow assessment tool mfat mfat was developed to assess the ecological response to flow scenarios at a range of locations along the river murray and its tributaries australia young et al 2003 fig 1 the stated objective of the model is to provide a picture of the state of riverine ecology years into the future as a result of different possible flow management strategies young et al 2003 p 258 modelled daily river flows were used as an input to assess algal growth in channel habitat suitability for native fish and associated off channel habitat suitability for wetland and floodplain vegetation and waterbirds nine zones excluding the river murray estuary were described within each zone regs developed hsis for each functional group for a range of taxa including fish for typically 2 to 3 regions at the time of development mfat documented the best available ecological and hydrological scientific knowledge for the murray enabling repeatable and objective comparisons of flow scenarios across a range of spatial scales srp 2003 despite the length of time since its development mfat remains one of the tools actively used and adapted in environmental water planning within the mdb e g cew 2011 mdba 2011 overton et al 2014 the process used to develop an index of native fish habitat suitability with a range of 0 1 called habitat condition by the developers is typical of that used for other taxa seven functional groups were defined to span the range of fish species present e g wetland specialists main channel generalists appendix a for each region relevant functional groups were specified and not all groups were necessarily included in all zones or regions a range of hsis were developed for each functional group for flow related variables e g inundation duration dry period which were then combined to give an assessment of adult habitat condition ahc and recruitment habitat condition rhc for each functional group fig 2 norton and andrews 2006 hsis varied among regions as determined by each regional evaluation group reg these were again combined into a functional group specific fish habitat condition fhc index that was then aggregated across functional groups to give a single combined fish hsi native fish habitat condition nfhc per sub region norton and andrews 2006 weightings and combination methods at each step were determined using the expert opinion of the regs and thus vary the limitations of mfat are similar to those for many other hsms where outcomes consider single events in isolation rather than dynamic change and are often based on limited data or poorly documented thresholds miao et al 2009 model decisions and knowledge were well documented during the development of mfat limitations in expert opinion cooke 1991 and the response to multiple extreme events or event connectivity miao et al 2009 and uncertainty in the form of the relationship between flow and the response are broad limitations of the approach hsms also tend to ignore interactions among species life stages and habitat variables ayllón et al 2011 mfat is uses hydrologic data as a surrogate for small scale hydraulic data so does not consider depth velocity or substrate all of which may be more influential than and potentially poorly correlated with flow per se srp 2003 thus limiting the small scale conclusions that can be drawn furthermore there can be mismatch in the scale of the habitat assessment versus the specific indicators that are being simulated mfat has been criticised for not being easy to use being insensitive to alternative scenarios and for being overly complex largely through the number of weightings and the methods for combining hsis used mfat was considered to be a work in progress following its initial development srp 2003 but to our knowledge no further development beyond some sensitivity testing norton and andrews 2006 has occurred so this assessment stands furthermore no other tools have been developed at a similar spatial scale to supersede mfat that are able to inform the management of the southern mdb so there is benefit in attempting to test the model structure 1 4 testing a habitat condition model our aim was to test the fish habitat condition scores generated by mfat over time against fish assemblage data that are now available for the mfat defined zones to identify whether the two were correlated thus investigating one of the main purposes of a hsi that it predicts species presence based on biotic and abiotic factors while mfat was designed to assess average habitat condition for different long term scenarios rather than temporal progressions through time if habitat condition influences fish assemblages then there should be some general relationships between habitat condition outcomes and representative fish assemblages these relationships may be subject to time lags in this paper we attempt to identify these general relationships to explore relationships between fish assemblages and fish habitat condition as a form of evaluation of mfat similar to the approaches of hubert and rahel 1989 and railsback et al 2003 we describe which aspects of current assemblage data were consistent with the results of mfat simulations identify where mfat was performing well for the years in which we were able to test it and make recommendations for improvement where it was not we also investigate the sensitivity of the model to combination methods and variable weightings effectively exploring the manner in which suitable habitat is defined for the fish functional groups used within mfat 2 material and methods 2 1 fish assemblage data for comparison with mfat habitat condition scores the fish data used to empirically validate the mfat tool were sourced from the sustainable rivers audit sra the sra was a field based program designed to assess the condition of river ecosystems in the mdb davies et al 2010 the fish assemblage was surveyed during low flow conditions in spring summer and autumn each year from 2004 to 2007 for the data utilised here davies et al 2010 each sampling event spanned several weeks but were considered representative of assemblages over longer time periods at least 18 sampling sites within each river valley were sampled during each sampling event davies et al 2010 at each site all habitats were sampled in proportion to their occurrence up to 50 individuals per species were collected at each site the sra sample data recorded the identity origin i e point of collection and condition of individuals as well as the abundance and biomass of each species sampling effort was constant across all sites in the sra only fish greater than 15 mm were counted and biomass was calculated using empirical length weight relationships davies et al 2010 sra fish sampling used standardised methodologies to minimise errors due to variation in catch effort and this paper uses data obtained over the 2004 to 2007 sra sampling period only electrofishing data were included in the analyses of this paper to minimise variability due to sampling method for our analysis we used the sustainable rivers audit sra data from four of the zones defined by the murray flow assessment tool mfat zone a the mitta mitta river zone c yarrawonga weir to the wakool junction zone e lock 11 to lock 3 and zone j the murrumbidgee river fig 1 of the 134 sampling sites surveyed as a part of the sra assessment that fell within the four mfat zones explored 44 sites were in zone a 66 in zone c 2 in zone e and 34 in zone j zone e used location specific assessments for fish habitat condition and these were not intended to be extrapolated across the zone roberts et al 2003 so only directly comparable sra sampling sites were used all sampling sites were surveyed only once as a part of the sra assessment the sampling dates for each region differed systematically with sampling sites in zone c surveyed in november and december in each of 2004 2005 and 2006 and those in zone a sampled in march in each of 2005 and 2006 the two sampling sites in zone e were both sampled in june 2005 zone j was sampled in january and february of 2007 a flow chart summarising how the sra data were incorporated in our analyses is provided fig 3 we created 30 fish metrics from the sra data mfat developers did not specify which community properties were most likely to be represented by the model so we chose a suite to analyse a diversity of community properties the metrics we used included community descriptors abundance biomass species richness for the seven fish functional habitat groups defined by mfat i e macquarie perch macquaria australasica freshwater catfish tandanus tandanus flood spawners wetland specialists main channel generalists main channel specialists and low flow specialists see appendix a for species within each fish functional group note that macquarie perch and freshwater catfish are each considered by mfat to be their own functional group and that we capitalise each of the functional groups throughout to clearly identify places where we are referring to the groups as defined here these metrics represent a plausible range of community attributes that could be influenced by habitat condition if abundance were related to habitat condition this may suggest that greater habitat condition enabled greater recruitment success and or lower mortality regardless of species identity within a functional group a relationship with species richness suggested that greater habitat condition resulted in a more diverse assemblage while a relationship with biomass suggested that greater habitat condition resulted larger and or more fish in a given zone a seven functional groups were defined by mfat in addition to those we also calculated four additional groups other for species that were collected by sra but not categorised by mfat native including all native species exotic including all exotic species and total including all fish species collected to determine whether patterns simulated by mfat applied across the fish assemblage as a whole rather than just to the functional groups specified b for example main channel specialist abundance for a given site was correlated with the ahc score for main channel specialists in the mfat zone in which that site fell to assess how well the scores derived for that group correlated with the intended group c for example main channel specialist abundance was cross correlated with the ahc score for all other functional groups to assess whether all functional groupings were necessary based on their ability to correlate with fish metrics for their own versus other functional groups d for example for a 2 year lag fish metrics from 2006 were correlated with mfat nhfc scores from 2004 and fish metrics from 2007 were correlated with nfhc from 2005 to assess whether there was a lag in fish response to suitable habitat e for example fish metrics from both 2006 and 2007 were correlated with mfat nhfc scores from 2005 to assess whether year specific events such as floods correlated with fish assemblages f mfat component scores are abbreviated as follows ahc adult habitat condition shc spawning habitat condition lhc larval habitat condition rhc recruitment habitat condition fhc fish habitat condition nfhc native fish habitat condition refer to fig 2 for additional information on the construction of each component score by using the seven fish functional groups defined by mfat we firstly assessed the relationships between mfat and the functional groups it was designed to represent see fig 3 however much of the fish assemblage measured by sra fell outside the species included in those functional groups thus we also investigated whether the relationships simulated by mfat applied to the wider fish assemblage by adding four additional groups total native invasive and other invasive and other species are not included in mfat and the native category combined the seven mfat functional groups plus the other category these categories were compared against the overall mfat scores such as fhc an example of a fish metric was abundance of wetland specialists or biomass of main channel specialists 2 2 modelling a baseline hydrological scenario to generate mfat fish habitat condition scores to create the mfat habitat condition scores the first step was to run a hydrological scenario we used the current river operations baseline scenario based on that included in csiro 2012 from msm bigmod close and sharma 2005 because it approximates the management and flow volumes within the river when the sra data were collected assuming that all existing infrastructure is in place refer to the discussion for a justification of the choice of modelled rather than measured flows for this comparison the modelled baseline outputs daily flows in the river murray over 114 years and has been used as the baseline in water resource planning by the murray darling basin authority this scenario met the recommendation by mfat developers in young et al 2003 whereby flow scenarios used to run the model represent the daily flow values that were the output from a river hydrology model the original development and use of mfat was also based on modelled flows young et al 2003 daily hydrologic outputs were therefore used as inputs to the mfat models in the four zones fig 3 an annual fhc score is calculated for each zone which can then be aggregated across calendar years this score is generated by combining preference curves as described in fig 2 for example within a year an event is scored based on preference curves that represented exceedance of a flow percentile the timing of this event the duration and the time since a last event where there are multiple events the highest score for the year was used the resultant mfat scores applied for the individual zone for a single year we provide a summary of the scores for the mfat scenario in section 4 and the method used to construct them in fig 3 hydrology inputs to mfat occur at specific locations but the results may be extrapolated to a range of spatial scales from single locations to the whole river basin young et al 2003 basic flow characteristics table 1 at eight gauges were used to describe the scenario for both the entire model period and the period over which sra data were collected colemans upper region and tallandoon lower region are located in the mitta mitta river which makes up the headwaters of the river murray zone a yarrawonga upper region and tocumwal lower region are found in the mid lowland reaches of the murray zone c zone e focuses specifically on two locations rather than regions mullaroo creek upper and lock 7 lower gundagai which is the nearest gauging station to the tumut river confluence upper region and redbank weir lower region are located on the murrumbidgee river zone j refer to fig 1 for a map of gauge locations 2 3 evaluating correlations between mfat scores and empirical data sra fish metrics to validate the mfat s ability to predict the native fish assemblage of the mid murray river we examined the correlation between mfat fish condition summary scores i e nfhc and sra fish metrics fig 3 analyses were conducted using site specific data from across all four river zones as mfat nfhc scores were created for each river zone all sites within a zone received identical scores preliminary data exploration revealed no obvious complex relations i e there was no evidence of bimodal or quadratic relationships or interactions indicating that simple correlation was sufficient to test the predictive potential of the mfat model in instances where a functional group contained only one species e g low flow specialists binomial logistic regression was used in place of pearson s r correlations binomial general linear models were fitted using the bias corrected algorithm for maximum likelihood estimates developed by firth 1993 and conducted using the brglm package in r kosmidis 2013 all correlations were constructed using pearson s r in systat v 12 systat software san jose ca correlations were also generated between the sra fish metrics and components of the overall mfat score fish habitat condition score fhc ahc and rhc fig 3 the rationale for using the component scores in addition to the nfhc was to identify whether any part of the model was more or less correlated with fish assemblages this included investigating how well correlated rhc was despite a lack of fish data providing a direct measure of recruitment we did not analyse the component scores that combined to create rhc lhc and spawning habitat condition shc we were also interested in whether the predictive ability of the mfat model was similar across fish functional groups e g wetland specialists freshwater catfish etc because this could lead to model simplification i e functional groups could be merged to this end we cross correlated mfat functional group specific scores against the fish metrics for other functional groups fig 3 we considered that functional groups would be supported when there was a significant positive correlation α 0 05 between the score for that group and any of the fish metrics assessed we tested for any consistent lags in response time by correlating the fish metrics with same suite of scores generated over the ten years prior to fish data collection fig 3 this test used lags in mfat scores that were appropriate for each data point e g for fish collected in 2006 an mfat score with a lag of one year came from 2005 while fish collected in 2007 had an mfat score with a 1 year lag from 2006 we also investigated whether there were any threshold or other year specific responses by correlating fish metrics with mfat scores from specific previous years between 1997 and 2006 i e regardless of the year in which fish were sampled an example of such an effect may be a relatively high flow year where successful recruitment drove fish populations for several years to come so here all fish metrics were correlated against the mfat score from a single year e g 2006 regardless of when they were collected e g 2006 and 2007 in the example above unless a lag is specified analyses used a default of comparing mfat scores to fish metrics in the same year 2 4 evaluating the influence of weightings on the nfhc score the default weightings used by mfat to calculate parameters within the model were defined by the expert inputs of the various regs to characterise the impact of each variable on different fish functional groups in different regions and zones as a result the relative weighting of a given parameter varies among regions zones and functional groups for example the following formulae illustrate the use of weightings xa in the calculation of fhc rhc and ahc see also fig 2 1 fhc x 1 ahc x 2 rhc 2 rhc x 3 shc x 4 lhc 3 ahc x 5 wd x 6 wt x 7 cc x 8 fp x 9 mf where shc is spawning habitat condition lhc is larval habitat condition and ahc is a combination of the suitability of the amount of woody debris present wd water temperature wt channel condition cc fish passage fp and maintenance flows mf in the upper region of zone c ahc is weighted between 0 36 and 0 53 x1 in equation 1 out of a total of 1 0 depending on the functional group in the lower region of zone c the same parameter is weighted variously between 0 25 and 0 77 depending on the functional group indicating that adult habitat condition was considered more influential for some groups than recruitment habitat condition weighted with x2 in equation 1 the relative weighting of spawning habitat condition x3 in equation 2 compared to larval habitat condition x4 in equation 2 to calculate rhc also varied widely in the lower region of zone c accounting for 0 3 to 0 82 of the total 1 0 depending on the functional group other weightings for other zones vary similarly across regions and functional groups to test the influence of the weightings applied to each component of the nfhc score obtained we compared three weighting types fig 3 default combinations reflecting the expert inputs of the regs constant weightings where all factors were treated equally and random numbers generated in microsoft excel were all used thirty sets of random numbers were generated and correlations were calculated for each and the mean and standard deviation of those correlations are reported the range of weightings used including both the default and altered weightings are shown in appendix b in assessing the performance of the constant and randomly assigned weightings the weightings used to calculate ahc and rhc were altered i e either to be constant or according to the random weightings generated respectively and fhc was recalculated equation 1 weightings were also altered for the rhc inputs shc and lhc equation 2 the shc and lhc scores are hydrologically defined where inputs included flood magnitude flow timing rate of flow rise and fall duration of flow flushing flows flow percentiles and no flow conditions fig 2 the ahc component is dependent on physical habitat variables e g woody debris water temperature channel condition fish passage and maintenance flows equation 3 these variables were fixed over the duration of the modelling period as was the case during mfat development so ahc did not vary among years but did among regions appendix c reference flows used to determine parts of the ahc score were set to the defaults used in mfat so called natural conditions young et al 2003 the nfhc score represents the aggregate fhc for all functional groups equally weighted 2 5 evaluating the influence of the method of combining component scores mfat uses a broad range of methods to create the habitat condition scores across the various functional groups regions and zones with the method used for main channel specialists in zone c given as an example in fig 2 different methods e g using geometric versus arithmetic means include inherent assumptions and have the ability to influence model outputs to test this influence we compared six common methods of combining habitat condition indices with that actually used in mfat for each of lhc for main channel specialists in upper region of zone c which uses both weighted sums and geometric means for different components as illustrated in fig 2 and for both wetland specialists and main channel generalists in the upper region of zone a fig 3 by default lhc for both main channel generalists and main channel specialists is a function of the suitability of the flow duration fd inundation area ia inundation duration id dry period dp and flow percentile fpl in mfat these were combined according to the following formulae 4 lhc fp l fd where the median flow is less than the natural median and 5 lhc ia id dp 3 where the median flow is greater than the natural median where natural median is defined as the median flow modelled to occur without water resource development in the mdb young et al 2003 this definition however is not used for other functional groups in the same regions for example for flood spawners in the upper regions of zones a and c lhc is defined as follows 6 lhc lhc nf 1 lhc nf rf l ia id dp 4 where lhcnf is a user defined default value for larval habitat condition in no flood conditions rfl is the suitability of the rate of flow fall for larval fish components and other terms are consistent with the definitions above in contrast lhc for wetland specialists in both regions of zone a is defined as a constant value of 1 this range of combination methods illustrates the choices available and the potential for those choices to be influencing the scores that mfat produces we calculated lhc for each group using a maximum minimum i e to identify the most limiting factor average geometric mean of fpl and fd referred to as square root flows constant of 1 referred to as constant 1 and multiplying fpl and fd referred to as multiplicative flows we concentrated on fpl and fd as flows were generally low between 2004 and 2007 so were more often below the natural median than above it equation 4 table 1 for each example we report the percentage change in lhc rhc and fhc compared with the defaults 3 results mfat predicted considerable variation in fish habitat condition in the south eastern mdb between 2004 and 2007 for that period native fish habitat condition nfhc scores varied between 0 31 and 0 82 fish habitat condition fhc varied between 0 06 for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone a in 2006 to 0 90 for the same functional group in the lower region of zone e in 2005 appendix c adult habitat condition ahc varied between 0 00 for wetland specialists in the lower region of zone j in 2007 and 0 88 for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone e in 2005 recruitment habitat condition rhc varied between 0 04 for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone a in 2006 to 1 00 for wetland specialists main channel generalists and main channel specialists for a range of zones and years appendix c these ranges suggest that the baseline flow scenario used was sufficiently variable to allow meaningful assessment of correlations between murray flow assessment tool mfat scores and fish metrics through time the sra program recorded 7800 individual fish from 30 species between 2004 and 2007 of which 3205 were native 41 total biomass was 1 119 738 kg of which only 174 863 kg 16 were from native fish reflecting the general small bodied nature of australian natives the introduced gambusia gambusia holbrooki was the most abundant species 1338 ind with the native mountain galaxias galaxias olidus the next most abundant 919 ind the six most commonly detected species were all introduced with common carp cyprinus carpio found at 54 sites across three zones and the brown trout salmo trutta found at 52 sites across all four zones the two most common the most commonly detected native species was australian smelt retropinna semoni 23 sites across 3 zones followed by mountain galaxias 20 sites across all 4 zones the total richness abundance and biomass of fish varied substantially across zones and functional groups appendix d zones with more sampling sites tended to have higher abundances and richness than those with few sra data and table e1 contains no correction for the number of sampling sites included in each zone the other functional group was most commonly the richest i e in both regions of zone a and c and the upper region of zone j but main channel generalists lower region of zone a and upper region of zone j wetland specialists lower regions of zones a and j and main channel specialists upper region of zone j were equally diverse in some regions the most abundant functional group varied substantially across zones and regions with the low flow specialist and flood spawner functional groups were typically the least abundant only 53 individuals from 3 species were collected from zone e no freshwater catfish were caught during the sra sampling included here and only four macquarie perch were detected so those two groups were excluded from functional group specific analyses 3 1 evaluating correlations between nfhc and component scores and sra fish data collected in the same year overall native fish habitat condition scores were poorly correlated with sra overall fish metrics n 134 for all correlations fig 4 when scores were generated using flows from the same year as fish sampling e g comparing native and total richness abundance and biomass for 2004 with the mfat score calculated for 2004 nfhc scores were consistently negatively correlated with overall fish metrics fig 4 with 0 year lag these negative correlations were weak i e between 0 07 and 0 12 and were not statistically significant the nfhc was best correlated with main channel specialist abundance in the same year r 0 12 but this was not a significant relationship weak and non significant associations were also found for the components of nhfc table 2 fhc showed very few significant correlations with any overall or functional group specific fish metric there were no instances where fhc was significantly positively correlated with the functional group which it was intended to describe pearson s r ranged from 0 50 for the correlation between richness and fhc for wetland specialists to 0 18 for the correlation between biomass and fhc for low flow specialists although there were insufficient numbers of macquarie perch and freshwater catfish collected to include in these analyses similarly there were no instances of significant positive correlations between rhc scores and the functional group for which they were intended in contrast ahc scores were almost always better correlated than the fhc score was with individual fish metrics also the correlation between ahc for main channel generalists and the intended functional group richness was highly significant r 0 65 we also investigated whether any single functional group specific score may have captured habitat condition across multiple fish functional group metrics i e to identify potential simplifications in the functional groups included in the model there was a trend for fhc for freshwater catfish to be significantly positively correlated with fish metrics across multiple functional groups e g wetland and low flow specialist biomass r 0 50 for both table e1 rhc for low flow specialists was best correlated with fish metrics across other functional groups being significantly correlated with total biomass r 0 21 and main channel generalist richness r 0 35 among others table e2 ahc scores for main channel generalists were significantly positively correlated with the suite of individual fish metrics table e3 including measures of richness biomass and abundances e g native and flood spawner biomass r 0 348 and 0 498 respectively for other functional groups ahc for macquarie perch main channel specialists and low flow specialists were all significantly correlated with a range of individual fish metrics particularly for richness fish metrics 3 2 evaluating lags in correlation between nfhc scores and sra fish data incorporating lags of 3 9 and 10 years into the comparison improved the resultant correlations fig 4 table 3 comparisons including lags of either 3 or 10 years resulted in consistently positive but non significant correlations with a lag of 9 years all correlations were positive except for that with native biomass r 0 08 appendix f and correlations between the nfhc score and either total or native abundance were highly statistically significant r 0 35 and 0 31 respectively most fish functional groups appeared to be contributing to this pattern with wetland specialist main channel generalist main channel specialist and low flow specialist abundances all significantly positively correlated with nfhc scores at a lag of 9 years the notion of a threshold or other year specific response had some support with nfhc scores from 1996 being better correlated with fish metrics than most other years table e4 for that year correlations with native richness and native abundance were both statistically significant r 0 23 and 0 24 respectively this pattern was largely driven by significant positive correlations with wetland specialist and main channel generalist richness and abundances and with low flow specialist abundances nfhc scores from 1995 2000 and 2002 also showed positive correlations with fish metrics but these were not statistically significant 3 3 evaluating the influence of weightings on the nfhc score the default weightings used to combine the components did not improve the strength of correlations observed between the nfhc score and fish metrics fig 5 for the overall fish metrics investigated the default weightings resulted in more negative correlations with fish metrics than constant even weightings or the average of correlations derived from randomly assigned weightings for the most part changing the method of weighting nfhc components shifted the relationships from the moderate to slight negative correlations observed under the original weightings with no time lag introduced to either no relationship or small positive correlations fig 5 small positive correlations were more common for native fish metrics than total fish metrics indicating that native species patterns may have been better captured using constant or random weightings no correlations identified for any method of selecting weightings were statistically significant fig 5 3 4 evaluating the influence of the method of combining component scores the method of combining habitat condition indices had a large impact on the value of larval habitat condition lhc obtained for main channel specialists in the upper region of zone c four of the six alternative combination methods applied tended to decrease lhc while the other two resulted in increases fig 6 changes of 124 and 100 in lhc were observed for individual years within the 114 year model run on average altering the combination method for lhc resulted in changes of between 30 and 100 when propagated through the model to calculate rhc and fhc this impact was progressively lower due to the impact of other factors in those calculations which we did not recalculate similar patterns were evident for the other examples explored for main channel generalists in the upper region of zone a changes in lhc of between 177 and 100 in individual years were observed average changes depending on the combination method used were between 8 and 99 for wetland specialists in the upper region of zone a lhc differed by between 0 and 100 on average both examples again showed a tendency for lower lhc scores than the default combination method produced 4 discussion 4 1 evaluating correlations between mfat scores and empirical data from the same year overall native fish habitat condition nfhc scores were poorly correlated with the fish assemblages sampled during the sustainable rivers audit sra in the four zones investigated this suggests that i habitat condition is only a limited representation of changes which preference different assemblages of fish ii that the choice of flow period and hydrologic variables investigated here are not representative of long term flows and a different period and potentially longer period of flows or different suite of variables is needed iii that fish habitat is not as strongly influenced by flow as the models suggest noting that whilst non flow habitat characteristics are used in mfat they are treated as static states or iv that fish data cannot be used as a surrogate measure of habitat condition and fish assemblages may be influenced by other drivers such as recruitment failure trophic interactions and harvesting we also investigated the components of nfhc to determine whether any of these were better correlated with fish assemblages ahc tended to be better correlated with fish assemblages than rhc in particular but also somewhat better than fhc ahc captures non hydrologic parameters e g the presence of woody debris and connectivity and did not vary at any location across years thus mfat may be better at capturing inherent differences among locations than differences associated with hydrology for the period investigated differences in the numbers of fish caught from each functional group did not appear to be affecting the observed patterns either main channel generalists and invasive species were two of the most abundant groups analysed but neither appeared more likely to be significantly correlated with mfat scores than groups with fewer sampled individuals and differences in fish abundance should have had less impact on correlations with overall fish metrics instead the lack of consistency between taxa identified as being likely to have suitable habitat and the taxa actually captured was notable there was no evidence that any functional group specific components of nfhc were performing better for their own functional group compared to others and so no evidence that the number of functional groups included was warranted even main channel generalist adult habitat condition ahc which was significantly correlated with main channel generalist abundance was better correlated with other fish functional groups indicating low specificity of the scores produced component scores tended to be well correlated across all functional groups or none suggesting that differences in fish habitat condition may be small across the various functional groups and simplification across functional groups may be beneficial e g ahc for main channel generalists may describe habitat condition more broadly across a range of functional groups as could fhc for freshwater catfish 4 2 evaluating lags in correlations between mfat scores and empirical data a 9 year lag improved correlations with nfhc scores for the abundance of most functional groups and overall fish metrics including total and native abundance there was little evidence of other significant lags or of differing lags for different functional groups some of the groups which were significantly correlated at a lag of 9 years included long lived species e g murray cod macquaria peelii peelii live 40 years lintermans 2007 but others are likely much shorter lived e g galaxids within the wetland specialists typically live 1 3 years allen et al 2002 this raises questions as to the biological importance of such a long lag and it is possible that the result is coincidental furthermore analysis of scores from specific calendar years showed that 1996 was the best correlated single year which may confound the finding of a significant 9 year lag as 1996 was 9 years prior to sampling for many of the sra sites included this potential confounding of whether the length of time i e 9 years or the individual year e g due to a threshold response in some flow variable influenced fish assemblages cannot be untangled using this data set however the 1996 flow year had the highest flow peak up to 143 740 ml day 1 at the yarrawonga gauge for the river murray of the 10 year 1995 2004 flow series analysed this suggests that mfat scores may be more representative of high flow years than the series of low flow years assessed here or perhaps the effects of a year of high habitat condition has a sustained impact on fish assemblages e g over multiple generations via an increase in standing stock but additional investigation would be necessary to confirm either effect 4 3 impact of study design on mfat assessment in comparing the outputs of mfat to measured fish assemblages for the relevant regions it was possible that we were attempting to apply the model in a manner for which it was not intended for example mfat was designed to investigate the habitat condition for multiple taxa including fish over a scale that represents a flow regime rather than changes through time consequently we have looked for general patterns rather than investigating temporal trends for example to find relationships between habitat condition and fish assemblages it appears reasonable to us that fish habitat in good condition should be expected to result in generally more diverse more abundant native fish assemblages or ones that have greater biomass than habitat in poor condition if all else is equal this appears to be consistent with developers intentions given that linking model responses to measureable indicators of fish assemblage was a goal of future development young et al 2000 as a result we believe that it is valid to assess links between model outputs and fish assemblages as new monitoring data are available given that we have repeated mfat scores for multiple sites within zones some readers may question whether our experimental design is pseudo replicated pseudo replication arises when the assumption of independence among replicate samples is not met colegrave and ruxton 2018 which would arise if the dependent variables in this analysis were not independent here the lack of independence among samples here is in the independent variables it is in fact extremely common to run linear models with few levels in an independent variable this is what routinely occurs in analyses of variance and covariance and is not considered to be pseudo replicated quinn and keough 2002 the alternative approach of averaging fish metrics across a zone has the effect of dramatically reducing the variability within the fish data set which may perversely be more likely to result in spurious relationships being identified this variability was considered to be a critical part of the fish response to habitat and so we did not choose to average in our evaluation we used modelled rather than measured flows there is a long history of using modelled flows both to construct and test ecohydrological models e g garnier et al 2002 lester and fairweather 2011 and knouft and chu 2015 all use modelled flows and monitoring data across a range of target model taxa and either choice is valid the analyses included here were intended to inform management by providing a quantitative assessment of differences in fish assemblage that may correspond to changes in mfat score across alternative environmental watering scenarios thus any relationships identified needed to hold in modelled scenarios of future flows and the use of measured flows would have created additional uncertainty in that application although observed hydrologic data are often assumed to be error free this is rarely the case particularly at low flows di baldassarre and montanari 2009 tomkins 2012 and assessment of the hydrologic model used indicated that the model performed well under low flow conditions such as those that were typical of the period investigated here csiro 2008a van dijk et al 2008 thus we have confidence that the model is a reasonable representation of flows and that the use of modelled data was more appropriate in this case than observed hydrologic data the comparison of mfat scores and sra data undertaken here occurred under one set of conditions and assumptions that may affect the apparent performance of the mfat model these include that eight regions over up to four years each may limit the variability in mfat scores assessed the years in which fish data were collected 2004 2007 were low flow years csiro 2008b so mfat s ability to perform under a range of flows was not assessed there is potential mismatch for some sra sites and mfat zones with zone c for example being defined as a length of the main channel reg 2003 but many of the sra sites occurring on tributaries the systematic timing of sra sampling may have influenced the pattern of correlations observed and sampling efficiency may vary among zones gwinn et al 2015 component scores were all correlated with fish assemblages 15 mm including rhc not least because no data at an appropriate scale measured recruitment specifically e g young of year data pearson s r was used as the measure of correlation introducing assumptions of a bivariate normal distribution and that relationships were linear zar 1999 initial investigation of the data and relationships identified suggested that these assumptions were reasonable and the choices made here were intended to maximise the data included without contravening the intention of the model developers based on model documentation e g reg 2003 roberts et al 2003 caution is however warranted due to the number of individual tests that were conducted and because scores from mfat were repeated so as not to underestimate variability in sra data potentially inflating sample sizes conducting many tests in this manner is likely to produce type i errors in 5 of cases i e α 0 05 so individual significant relationships should be further tested in planned comparisons with novel data sets to ensure that correlations are meaningful zar 1999 or by adjusting the resultant probability values by tests such as bonferroni procedures repeating mfat scores can also lower critical r values potentially tending to increase the number of significant relationships identified however the general lack of correlation among functional groups and their mfat component scores and total fish metrics and nfhc scores would not be affected by any type i errors nor any inflation of sample sizes and ensuring that any non independence of data did not affect the outcome described here colegrave and ruxton 2018 4 4 evaluating the influence of weightings on the nfhc score the weightings used to combine individual mfat components into an overall score appeared to add little to the correlation of model outputs with fish metrics these weightings were based on expert opinion as to the relative importance of model parameters for each functional group in each region and zone weightings varied widely among those categories previous analyses found that model outcomes were variably sensitive to default weightings depending on the number of parameters included in a given mfat component norton and andrews 2006 here constant even weightings or randomly generated weightings had similar correlations to overall fish metrics and both consistently outperformed the default reg defined weightings particularly for native fish metrics this indicates that the default weightings are obscuring relationships between mfat scores and the fish assemblages assessed here possibly due to unintended interactions we recommend that constant weightings be applied as a potential simplification to the model one that would perform equally well or better under low flow conditions such as those tested here 4 5 evaluating the influence of the method of combining component scores the method of combining habitat condition indices had a substantial impact on the overall score obtained the default method of combining indices used in mfat varied widely among parameters but also for the same parameter among functional groups regions and zones default methods included arithmetic and geometric means constant values and threshold statements there are assumptions associated with each e g that habitat condition for one variable such as velocity can compensate to some degree for poor condition in another such as depth for an arithmetic mean korman et al 1994 thus the choice of multiple methods implies different limiting factors across locations and for different functional groups when we altered the method of combining indices for lhc and propagated the result differences in fhc of between 55 and 67 were obtained with the potential to substantially affect nfhc scores previous modelling found differences of between 15 and 36 in nfhc as a result of an additional 1500 gl y 1 flow in these regions srp 2003 so these differences are likely to be ecologically meaningful thus we recommend that combination methods be as simple as possible given the potential for unintended interactions and that the assumptions inherent in the chosen combination method are carefully considered and documented ensuring that different approaches are warranted by our ecological understanding the impact of inconsistent combination methods on the ability of mfat to predict fish habitat condition are not clear highlighting the need for careful choice of model structure and the need to undertake rigorous testing to understand the impact of those decisions 4 6 utility of habitat condition models to support natural resource management mfat young et al 2000 has proved to be an influential resource for modelling ecological outcomes in the mdb it has been used in establishing the volume of water recovery for the murray darling basin authority s living murray program www mdba gov au programs tlm accessed 25 05 2012 as a tool for supporting decisions on environmental water use cew 2011 and for assessment of ecological outcomes of the murray darling basin plan csiro 2012 indeed the impetus for this work arose from questions asked by natural resource managers about what changes in fish assemblages would result from increased habitat condition in the mfat model this ongoing application illustrates a need for models such as mfat to support natural resource management but also comparisons such as those described here to ensure that results are interpreted appropriately this work has shown that the mfat model is highly sensitive to some of its assumptions and simplifications are likely to be warranted for it to be of greater value to natural resource managers however there have been few subsequent advances in improving the tool base available for modelling fish populations in the mdb freshwater fish are acknowledged to be difficult to model van nes et al 2002 and fish is only one of the components modelled by mfat as a whole but it remains important to understand how well fish models perform future investments in modelling fish communities should seek to be less expert driven and use a modelling approach that is more adept at handling dynamic changes in ecosystems to improve the representation of community and population dynamics anderson et al 2006 and testing is needed over a wide range of hydrologic conditions however the data and knowledge needed to support such models are generally still quite poor and the potential use of new data in modelling is rarely considered when planning data generating programs given the importance of ecological models in evaluating and optimising flow scenarios future investments in data collection which can support model development are urgently needed this includes data collection which is hypothesis based and collected more frequently than occurs under current data programs and so represents a significant challenge to management agencies and researchers to design efficient cost effective programs 5 conclusions and recommendations we found that the scores derived from the fish models in the murray flow assessment tool mfat were poorly correlated with fish metrics calculated from sra fish surveys in 2004 2007 during the low flow years of our assessment structural components in the models were better correlated than flow related components functional group specific components were not better correlated with fish metrics for that functional group than others suggesting low specificity for each score default weightings on components did not improve correlations between mfat scores and fish metrics compared with constant equal weightings or randomly derived weightings and the method of combining components had a large impact on mfat scores we recommend that constant equal weightings be used instead of the default weightings to simplify the mfat model we also recommend that the method of combining components be re assessed to introduce some consistency and decrease the likelihood of unintended interactions finally functional group specific habitat condition indices should be re assessed to ensure that the described differences in habitat condition among the various groups reflect their specific habitat needs and that the inclusion of all groups is warranted model refinements should continue to be evaluated against additional data preferably including higher flow years than could be assessed here as should the other taxonomic groups e g wetland vegetation included within mfat we believe that implementing these changes will lead to a more robust tool that will better inform the management of the river murray to maximise fish habitat condition similarly applying these recommendations during the development of similar models in future should lead to simpler models with more transparent links

high sensitivity of model regional results on the detail of the input data in regard to water quality haydon and deletic 2009 soil carbon c dynamics post et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 grosz et al 2017 and crop yields pogson et al 2012 with regard to crop yields results are actually inconsistent a few simulation studies find detailed data to be important for representing regional variation of crop yields olesen et al 2000 especially for small areas e g 1000 2000 km2 wassenaar et al 1999 for larger areas most simulation studies show detailed input data to be less important due to masked spatial heterogeneity in both the weather and the soil characteristics angulo et al 2013 2014 niu et al 2009 the effect of input data on the regional distribution of modelled n fluxes is explored to a much lesser extent some studies of soil aspects report markedly lower variability of n fluxes helliwell et al 2007 windolf et al 2012 suggesting that existing soil texture data are sufficient for understanding regional variations other studies get reliable results at finer rather than coarser detail especially for areas with contrasting landscape factors rankinen et al 2002 styczen and storm 1993 for most crops the relationship between n fluxes and field management such as n fertilisation is convex i e the flux response per extra unit of n applied becomes larger but is modified by environmental factors such as soil properties hydroclimate and sampling factors gao et al 2016 the soil hydraulic properties i e saturated θs and residual soil water contents θ r and hydraulic conductivity k are typically contingent on soil texture and structure but are heterogeneous due to the spatial variability in soil structure organic matter content and bulk density and are not readily available for large scales obtaining sufficient and reliable soil hydraulic data at regional scale is challenging also due to the effort required for extensive soil sampling the application of pedotransfer functions which have been derived in various countries in order to estimate soil hydraulics indirectly may be a promising method to obtain effective hydraulic parameters for the soil type of interest effective parameters are those derived from a mesh defined at the measurement scale into a coarser mesh that can be used in large scale e g watershed scale basin scale regional scale hydroclimatic and environmental modelling china is the world s largest producer of grain and the explicit goal of the central government is to be reasonably self sufficient in food despite having to feed 20 of the worlds population with only 8 of the worlds arable land the north china plain ncp is an important region for grain production in the country which supports two crop harvests per year rainfed maize zea mays l june to october and irrigated winter wheat triticum aestivum l october to june this double cropping system is the most dominant agroecosystem supplying about 50 of the national maize and wheat yet its environmental sustainability has been questioned due to a low n use efficiency high n leaching and excessive consumption of groundwater to meet crop water needs for high yields ma et al 2012 yang et al 2015 recently gao et al 2016 used county scale weather data and fao harmonised world soil data hwsd about 1 5 000 000 scale in a statistical modelling study to clarify whether and if so how weather and soil as environmental factors regulate the rate and amount of n leaching in the ncp the authors emphasised the importance of including local hydro climatic conditions in regional estimates of n leaching which are known to affect soil n cycling and transport in the root zone despite the significance of n leaching having been recognised in numerous field and modelling studies its regional magnitude from a maize winter wheat double cropping system is uncertain due to uncertainties in the models and the driving variables and to differences in the weather and soil data used in the studies this paper addresses two main questions first what are the differences in regional crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching when simulated using weather and soil data inputs differing in detail in the context of reliability and preferability second after detecting preferable input data is it possible to apply and demonstrate their use for regional management scenarios the main objectives were to i derive water retention and hydraulic information for soils characteristic of an agriculture intensive alluvial region in the ncp ii compare regional crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching simulated using the different weather and soil input data ranging from low to high detail and iii investigate agro management actions with potential to balance crop production and n leaching at regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydro climatic conditions the study area was the shijiazhuang prefecture located in the hebei province china fig 1 the area is situated in the ncp and includes the province capital shijiazhuang city population 4 3 mil in 2015 and 17 rural counties population 6 7 mil in 2015 covering about 15 000 km2 between longitudes 113 7 115 8 e and latitudes 37 3 38 5 n the altitude across the region which is agricultural varies from 20 to 100 m above sea level except in the north west which is mountainous the climate is continental semi arid and monsoon influenced with a mean monthly temperature of 2 c in january and 27 c in july and mean annual precipitation of about 500 mm of which 70 falls as rain during the humid summer months july to september with little to no precipitation in spring and autumn and especially winter the annual potential evapotranspiration is about 1000 mm the geology consists of alluvial fluvial surface fans on top of quaternary aged deposits of inter fingering gravel sand and silt extending to about 400 m depth the hutuo river runs north of shijiazhuang city fig 1 most agroecosystems are irrigated by groundwater and a few use irrigation water from the shijin distribution canal running from the western reservoirs some farmers use wastewater from the xiaohe canal for irrigation despite poor water quality more than 80 of the agricultural land use consists of maize winter wheat double cropping 2 2 the model input data and simulations daisy version 5 19 used in this study is a one dimensional mechanistic and deterministic soil plant atmosphere system model that simulates flows of water c and n driven by daily weather and field management data

soil organic matter som is calculated from the actual amount of n in these pools using their carbon to nitrogen c n ratio net n mineralisation or immobilisation is derived from the overall n balance details on model equations and assumptions are available elsewhere hansen 2002 hansen et al 2012 daisy needs data on weather soil crop and management information 2 2 1 weather data weather data from 2000 to 2013 were available from four meteorological stations fig 1 and included daily measurements of sunshine hours h mean air temperature c precipitation mm vapor pressure hpa and wind speed m s 1 sunshine hours were converted to global radiation mj m 2 using the ångström equation as given by allen et al 1998 the respective values for wet and dry deposition of 7 5 ppm and 10 kg n ha 1 for ammonium and 2 5 ppm and 5 kg n ha 1 for nitrate required by the daisy weather file were approximated from zhang et al 2011 and were applied for all four weather files 2 2 2 soil data three soil datasets were used fig 2 the first dataset named s1 is a point measurement from a field station used to represent the entire region thus a roughly 1 15 000 000 geographical scale giving about 125 125 km resolution to these data and comprised soil physical properties texture organic matter bulk density measured at the luancheng station the second dataset named s2 geographical scale 1 5 000 000 resolution 10 10 km was extracted from the fao dsmw fao 2007 it is a complex dataset available for free online in vector format containing a set of spatially distributed polygons defining main soils each including soil type units that are not spatially delineated but are semantically described for their percent wise contribution to the main soils and properties texture organic matter bulk density in topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm extended to 200 cm in this study the third dataset named s3 geographical scale 1 1 000 000 resolution 1 1 km was extracted from shangguan et al 2013 this multi dimensional raster dataset is also available for free online and includes spatially distributed units pixels on the map each containing sub units layers of 20 cm down to 200 cm depth with information on soil physical properties texture organic matter bulk density as it is impossible to consider each soil of the s3 data pixels were spatially aggregated based on top and subsoil clay content following a sensitivity analysis of daisy and units of topsoil clay content between 4 and 8 9 15 16 19 and 20 26 were grouped as 6 12 17 and 21 respectively whereas units of subsoil clay content of 5 13 and 13 28 were grouped as 9 and 21 respectively resulting in six main soils the pixels were depth weight averaged into topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 200 cm and conversion from raster to vector format was performed in total 13 columns one in s1 six in s2 and six in s3 each composed of topsoil and subsoil were set up the values of the c parameters required to initialise the model were adopted from manevski et al 2016b except for the c n ratio of the topsoil and subsoil which was fixed at 11 and 12 respectively for all soils daisy also requires soil hydraulic parameters for each top and subsoil to solve the richards equation these were described by the van genuchten mualem equation van genuchten 1980 and the values of saturated k ks matching point cm day θs θ r and α n and l were derived from a three step ensemble modelling procedure first initial ks θs θ r α n and l values were calculated with five pedotransfer functions i e rawls and brakensiek 1985 schaap et al 1998 wösten et al 1999 børgesen et al 2008 and weynants et al 2009 see table s1 in the supplementaty material second these initial parameter values were used to tabulate soil water content θ at several pressure heads h between 0 and 16 000 cm the van genuchten water retention curve and k between 16 and 16 000 cm the mualem hydraulic curve thus yielding five datasets for θ h and five datasets for k h last final θs θ r α n and l values were found by curve fitting of θ h with a nonlinear least squares optimisation approach using the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 which outputs fitted θs θ r α n and l were then used as inputs to find the final ks also in retc the retention and hydraulic curve for all soil types in the study can be found in figs s1 s6 of the supplementary material 2 2 3 crop data maize and winter wheat parameterisations published in manevski et al 2016a b were adopted as these have been calibrated and validated on field experimental data for crop development and growth on different loamy soils and management situations for multiple years at luancheng in the ncp the values of crop potential evapotranspiration factor epfacds at flowering and maturity were lowered from 1 1 to 1 0 i e 7 decrease to reflect more closely the farmers cultivars and associated losses e g due to pests and diseases as opposed to the cultivars grown in the well managed experimental plots used for original parameter calibration manevski et al 2016b everything else remained unchanged 2 2 4 management data the management information included time of ploughing type of crop and time of sowing and harvest straw management incorporation or removal time and amount of fertiliser n and of irrigation most of these were derived from long term field experiments at the luancheng station aiming to represent the farming practice in the wider region that is non limiting for crop production manevski et al 2016b wang et al 2013 sowing maize was set in mid june after ploughing whereas for winter wheat it was early october crop straw removal at harvest was simulated to mimic farmers practice hou et al 2012 ma et al 2012 for fertiliser n county level data were obtained from the statistical china knowledge resource integrated database http epub cnki net the annual fertiliser rates used in the simulations were 400 600 and 800 kg n ha 1 based on the frequency distribution and 25th 50th and 75th percentiles of respectively 464 575 and 799 kg n ha 1 see table s2 in the supplementary material irrigation was simulated to follow n fertilisation and was supplemented throughout the season with water applied directly to the soil surface bypassing the crop canopy as farmers irrigate their fields by flooding with pumped groundwater the amounts were available from field logs and varied between 60 and 187 mm for maize and 200 400 mm for winter wheat depending on year see table 1 ammonium and nitrate concentrations of the irrigation water were not specified in the model as no such data could be found nor are they regulated required as recommended maximum concentrations according to the standards for irrigation water quality of china gb 5084 2005 2 2 5 simulations a total of 156 systems i e 4 weather stations 13 soil columns 3 fertiliser n rates were simulated to describe the current weather soil management in the region denoted hereafter as current situation i e scenario 0 for all simulations the model was continuously run from 1 june 2000 to 1 june 2013 with daily precipitation irrigation and potential evapotranspiration set at the atmospheric upper boundary and deep groundwater at the lower boundary the first two years were excluded in order to minimise the impact of model initialisation on the results thus leaving ten years with full maize winter wheat annual crop rotations output files were processed in matlab2013a to calculate mean annual values of crop yields maize wheat soil water drainage and n leaching at the end of the root zone 200 cm accumulated from 1 june to 31 may i e for hydrological year which in the north china plain runs from maize sowing to wheat harvest and these were used in the upscaling 2 3 upscaling spatial information on weather soil cropped area and fertiliser n is needed for upscaling the field scale simulation results for weather the region was represented by data from either a single station 1 or all stations fig 1 for soil the three soil datasets described previously were used for cropped area the maize winter wheat distribution was derived from a classified landsat tm thematic mapper 30 m resolution image from june 2008 guo and shen 2015 for fertiliser n mean annual county data were used fig 1 a 5 5 km grid was intersected with the weather soil crop and fertiliser n data in arcmap ver 10 3 so each cell contained a weather soil crop fertiliser n combination s with a corresponding value for crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching simulated with daisy variables for each combination were multiplied with crop area summed within a cell and divided with crop area in the cell in order to express per hectare for soil input s2 the spatial distribution of the sub units within units was not known and variables per cell were calculated as o i x o j where o is the simulated output variable crop yield drainage or n leaching i is the main unit i e soil j is the sub unit i e soil type within the main soil and x is the known percentage contribution of j into i 2 4 uncertainty analysis the regional distribution of the simulated crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching for the weather and soil input data was assessed in the form of frequency density plots beanplots using the beanplot function in the beanplot package for r r core team 2013 these plots depict the range of a data sample similarly to box whisker plots without further assumptions on the distribution or the mean median the contour lines of the plots represent a density trace that offers an insight into the frequency distribution of the sample the density trace was calculated using silverman s rule of thumb bandwidth with scotts variation bw nrd for a normal gaussian kernel a detailed description of beanplots and their implementation can be found elsewhere kampstra 2008 to further assess the uncertainty introduced by the detail of the input data descriptive statistics and coefficients of variation cv were calculated for the upscaled variables and root mean squared residuals rmsr were computed between simulated upscaled and statistical crop yields 2 5 management scenario analysis using weather and soil input data at the highest detail i e multiple weather and s3 data seven management scenarios all with straw incorporation were simulated upscaled and compared to scenario 0 i the first three denoted scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 were derived from scenario 0 and included three annual fertiliser n rates uniformly applied across the region i e 400 300 and 200 kg n ha 1 for scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 respectively whereas irrigation remaining as in scenario 0 table 1 ii the next two denoted scenario 4 and scenario 5 were derived from scenario 2 the optimal for field scale manevski et al 2016b and introduced deficit irrigation which has been found to be a more cost efficient instrument for reducing n leaching compared to a change in fertiliser n amount only horan and shortle 2001 thus the irrigation amount was decreased by 25 in winter wheat scenario 4 and in both winter wheat and summer maize rainfed maize scenario 5 table 1 iii the last two scenarios scenario 6 and scenario 7 are the same as scenario 5 in terms of fertilisation and deficit irrigation but represent spatially differentiated measures for regional n management where a certain measure targets a particular element of a landscape in scenario 6 winter wheat was replaced every second year by winter fallow within 5 km of rivers and canals and in scenario 7 winter wheat was completely taken out of the double crop rotation the 168 scenario simulation results four weather stations six soil columns seven scenarios were upscaled as described before and analysed in the form of maps notably the model was re validated for crop yields prior to the scenario simulations focusing on the response to irrigation for this purpose a two year data subset for grain yield 2007 2009 two full seasons for maize and wheat from a long term irrigation experiment was used a detailed description can be found in sun et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 briefly maize and winter wheat had been grown since 1997 in a double crop rotation on a silty loam field at luancheng station in the ncp with six irrigation treatments rainfed or one two three four or five events of 60 70 mm each based on crop development stage replicated four times surface irrigation was applied using a low pressure tube water transportation system with a flow meter to record the irrigation applied annual fertilisation was 300 430 kg ha 1 n and 130 240 kg ha 1 p2o5 crop yields were measured at harvest straw was either incorporated into the topsoil maize or left in the field wheat 3 results 3 1 regional weather characteristics intra annual weather variation and regional patters are important factors controlling crop growth and soil n dynamics there were only small differences in temperature and precipitation amounts for the region and little intra annual variation during the wheat season september to june whereas precipitation varied during the maize season june september when most rainfall occurred fig 3 differences were seen for global radiation relative humidity and wind speed which are important for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration and drainage as well as crop water use and water stress reference evapotranspiration was 895 922 1097 and 1025 mm year 1 for zone 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the slightly lower reference evapotranspiration values for the first two zones in the south and south east were probably due to the higher relative humidity and lower global radiation recorded there which have a negative effect on evapotranspiration 3 2 regional soil characteristics all datasets classified the soils in the region as loamy with a light loam topsoil and heavy loam subsoil table 2 topsoil bulk density was lower indicating water permeability and good aeration whereas subsoil bulk density was higher indicating possible restriction to root growth and water movement for s1 low detail the soil was a silty loam with distinct clayey subsoil for s2 medium detail the soil consisted of fine textured loams with four dominant soils varying from sandy loams lithosols with eutric cambisols to silty clay loams chromic cambisols and clay loams mollic gleysols and calcaric fluvisols and with 19 24 clay in the topsoil and 18 28 clay in the subsoil yet major variation between the soils of s2 was seen in their silt and sand content the former being larger for loams compared to sandy clay loams and the latter notably larger for sandy clay loams compared to loams for both top and subsoil table 2 compared to s1 and s2 soils the s3 soils high detail were much coarser in texture and varied between loams and sandy loams with either 9 or 21 clay content in the subsoil spatially s2 and s3 both showed the existence of alluvial fluvial fans north west to south east along and around the hutuo river fig 4 the estimated values of the van genuchten mualem hydraulic parameters table 3 generally followed the textural description of the soils with sandy loam soils being the most conductive ks 4 18 cm h 1 loamy soils the least conductive ks 0 7 1 4 cm h 1 and sandy clay loam soils in between ks 0 8 2 7 cm h 1 except for one sandy clay loam in s2 lithosol with a ks value of about 22 cm h 1 probably due to a higher predicted value for α larger pores of soil matrix the saturated and residual soil water contents i e θs and θr respectively also resembled the textural description of the soils with θs being lower and θr being higher for the more clayey soils compared to sandy soils and this was more evident for s2 than s3 table 3 3 3 effect of detail of weather and soil input data on simulated regional variables the beanplots of simulated mean crop yields drainage and n leaching upscaled for the shijiazhuang prefecture are presented in fig 5 with associated statistics in table 4 the increased detail of weather data expanded the range max min and the modality number of peaks of the beanplots for crop yields the coefficient of variation cv for s1 s2 and s3 was respectively 0 1 1 3 and 4 2 for single weather and 5 4 6 3 and 8 2 for multiple weather stations compared to 17 2 for the statistical crop yields the median crop yield was 13 5 mg ha 1 for single weather and 13 0 mg ha 1 for multiple weather stations compared to 12 0 mg ha 1 for the statistical yields table 4 daisy could not simulate the upper limit of 15 16 mg ha 1 for the statistical yields probably due to management factors not considered explicitly by the model such as the use of improved varieties by some farmers and supply of nutrients other than n further regardless of weather data detail there was a small effect of soil data detail although the modality of crop yields for s3 tended to be closer to that of the statistical yields drainage under s1 was not affected by the detail of the weather data and its magnitude range and modality were low table 2 drainage under s2 and s3 had a larger range and modality and lower median for fine compared to coarse weather data fig 5 table 4 the beanplots for s2 and s3 were similar in that both were bimodal had similar 25th and 75th percentiles and medians of 35 38 mm for single weather and 20 30 mm for multi weather station data the beanplots of simulated regional n leaching were similar to those of drainage in terms of lowest range modality and median for s1 compared to s2 and s3 the increased detail of both weather and soil data increased the range and modality of the plots with a concomitant decrease in their medians with regard to variation s1 and s2 showed lower medians of respectively 12 and 28 3 kg n ha 1 for the single weather station and 10 and 24 kg n ha 1 for multiple stations compared to 62 and 39 kg n ha 1 for s3 s3 also showed a wide leaching range of 6 250 kg n ha 1 the uncertainty in simulating regional leaching based on soil type is quantified in table 5 annual n leaching for the whole prefecture did not differ much irrespective of weather data detail implying its lesser importance when focusing on the prefecture as a whole on the other hand markedly higher differences more than threefold in total annual n leaching were seen between the soil data sets emphasising the high importance of the choice of soil data for this variable complementary to the beanplots is the spatial distribution of the simulated upscaled variables fig 6 overall the maps clearly showed the cause effects of high fertiliser n and irrigation input leading to high crop yields and n leaching the somewhat lower crop yields in the eastern regions for all soil data were due to the lower water holding capacity of those soils as implied by the coarser texture i e lower clay content fig 4 in the western part which is largely mountainous and most of the land cover is natural vegetation the actual cropping area and management conditions would be the least known but of least importance 3 4 regional scenario analysis 3 4 1 model re validation prior the scenario analysis daisy was re validated and the results showed that the model was fairly responsive to irrigation management applied to maize and winter wheat with good accuracy for predicted grain yields under various irrigation amounts except for the somewhat lower accuracy for winter wheat under low irrigation 0 1 irrigations fig 7 the statistical analysis showed that the root mean squared error rmse for simulated maize and wheat yields was respectively 0 7 and 1 3 mg ha 1 the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 61 and 0 43 and the mean absolute error mae of 0 21 and 1 11 mg ha 1 as absolute accuracy of the model in the re validation was of less importance the overestimated yield response of winter wheat under rainfed and low irrigation conditions i e lower simulated yields than observed can be treated as lower boundary yield conditions the results indicate that the model can be used with confidence for regional yield simulation under various irrigations 3 4 2 management scenarios scenarios involving change in crop fertiliser and irrigation strategies all with straw incorporation were investigated for their potential to reduce n leaching and maintain yields in shijiazhuang region scenario 1 scenario 7 table 1 compared to the farmers current practice scenario 0 mean yield drainage and n leaching of respectively 12 6 mg ha 1 31 2 mm and 38 8 kg n ha 1 table 4 there were no differences in magnitude and spatialisation for simulated regional crop yields and drainage for scenario 1 and scenario 2 but only for n leaching of 35 and 20 kg n ha 1 corresponding to a reduction of about 8 and 47 n leaching was further reduced by almost 80 in scenario 3 whereas yields decreased by 1 0 1 2 mg ha 1 and drainage slightly increased n leaching responded strongly to fertiliser rate despite irrigation main factor for soil water and nitrate transport being the same for all three scenarios scenario 2 was selected as a base for the subsequent scenarios involving deficit irrigation since the time of irrigation was already strategically set in scenario 0 only the amounts were decreased table 1 the results showed decreased yields of respectively 12 and 30 for scenario 4 and scenario 5 relative to scenario 0 as the return water flows to the soil from excess irrigation were also reduced in the previous scenarios drainage also reduced further in scenario 6 replacing winter wheat with fallow every second year around rivers and channels did not introduce changes in annual drainage although it generated the lowest amounts of n leaching with large yield reductions fig 8 shifting to a rainfed single maize system scenario 7 however started to increase annual drainage compared to the previous two scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 variables response to weather and soil data detail although ample irrigation used in the simulations probably equilibrated differences between sites and years crop yields were moderately affected by the detail of both weather and soil data increasing the detail of the weather data increased consistently the range i e variation of simulated regional crop yields regardless of the detail of the soil data fig 5 and table 4 this shows that the magnitude of simulated regional crop yields and their spatial distribution are controlled by the weather though other factors such as field management and pest disease control are also important as implied by the wide range of 8 16 mg ha 1 y 1 for the statistical yields scale studies across europe also found improved representation of regional crop yields when using finer detail weather data input to simulation models hoffmann et al 2015 olesen et al 2000 zhao et al 2015 regarding the soil data detail low effect on regional variation of simulated crop yields have been previously reported due to an ample water supply from precipitation that partly mask differences in soil water holding capacity hendriks et al 2016 but also due to loss of variability in soil hydraulic properties calculated by pedotransfer functions angulo et al 2014 in the present study however the effect of soil data detail in interaction with the weather on regional crop yields was notable probably due to the coarser textural description of s3 compared to s1 and s2 despite the ample supply of soil water and n for the crops for comparison zhang et al 2014 used ssurgo medium detail or statsgo low detail soil data as inputs to simulate cropland carbon fluxes in the usa whereas pogson et al 2008 used the fao hwsd medium detail and the international geosphere biosphere programme soil data igbp high detail to study regional crop yields in the uk both studies found substantial uncertainties in the simulated regional agro environmental variables due to inherent differences in the size of the basic units and their contents i e providing a single value for units that in reality include a range of different soil types similarly hoffmann et al 2016 also found a notable effect i e error on crop yields by decreasing the detail of both weather and soil data input to simulation models for a temperate region in germany drainage and n leaching responded markedly to the detail of the weather data fig 5 and table 4 and the lower end of the drainage beanplot for s2 and s3 corroborates field studies across the ncp reporting little drainage for maize wheat double crop rotations due to low rainfall especially during the winter wheat season and low initial soil moisture content in the soil profile li et al 2014a yang et al 2015 differences in drainage appear to persist despite full irrigation used in the simulations that would offset differences in water retention and hydraulic properties between the soils the regional drainage simulated using s1 showed low values and very little variation and the presence of a specific feature such as an alluvial clay layer described in this point scale soil dataset with very low infiltration rate and unknown spatial variations seems to hamper regional generalisation although s1 cannot reflect more precisely regional soil variations it was included for comparison to mimic a very scarce data situation it should be mentioned that reliable depiction of drainage in the model depends among other things on evapotranspiration which was simulated on average 352 25 mm for maize and 430 39 for wheat for all soil datasets for comparison zhang et al 2011 reported mean evapotranspiration of 396 mm for maize and 458 mm for wheat under irrigated conditions from 2000 to 2009 at luancheng in the ncp derived with the water balance method therefore major differences in the water balance between the soil datasets could be attributed to differences in simulated drainage all input data could capture the lower end of 0 20 kg n ha 1 leaching whereas only s3 depicted the higher end of more than 300 kg n ha 1 which agrees with reports of 20 300 kg n ha 1 in the shijiazhuang prefecture based on field measurements and model simulations li et al 2014b qiu et al 2011 an important reason for differences in n leaching and drainage and possibly also crop yields is the som content which was twice as high in s1 compared to s2 and s3 respectively 2 5 and 1 3 and which thus partly counteracted the effects of a more sandy soil in the latter data sets for s2 and s3 a reason for the substantially different soil texture description is column depth being respectively 100 and 200 cm the former being extended to 200 cm in the simulations also s2 was derived from the dsmw by fao a widely used dataset in simulation studies that is based on soil profile information from field projects in china during the 1970s and 80s which might have been limited in access when this dataset was composed s3 was derived from the data in shangguan et al 2013 collected from detailed soil books at national and provincial levels across china digitised and thoroughly checked for quality mistakes and redundancy s2 consisted solely of medium to fine textured soils fig 4 whereas s3 contained coarse textured soils as well which is more consistent with the common understanding in chinese soil science that sandier soils have been deposited alluvially along and around the hutuo river and silty and loamy soils in the other areas hu et al 2010 although s2 and s3 are among the best soil datasets currently available for the ncp their detail differs markedly with regard to soil physical properties thus affecting rates of simulated mineralisation of organic matter in the soil nitrification and denitrification and finally n leaching thus modellers and environmental managers need to be careful with some of the soil data and be aware of their original purpose content and limitations 4 2 deriving effective soil hydraulic parameters knowledge of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties is mandatory for describing and predicting water flow and solute transport in the unsaturated soil zone the mualem van genuchten model is among the best known vereecken et al 2010 and it relies on its parameters which in the present study were estimated by ensemble modelling in addition to the determination of ks the conductivity parameter l that was fixed to 0 5 focus in the optimisation of k was the unsaturated matrix domain as its values near saturation are specific to the measurement conditions thus highly uncertain djurhuus et al 1999 ensemble modelling follows the rationale from meteorology and recently from crop modelling that the existence of multiple models developed and tested in one region may perform relatively poor in other regions where multi model ensemble prediction techniques i e those using an averaged prediction from several models have been developed to address this problem kollas et al 2015 yin et al 2017a 2017b the estimated ks values table 3 were close to the medians of 3 7 1 4 and 1 3 cm h 1 for respectively sandy loam loam and sandy clay loam reported by dai et al 2013 who derived van genuchten parameters for chinese soils using a similar ensemble approach literature values of the van genuchten parameters especially n for loamy soils are to some extent inconsistent due to different definitions of soil texture classes and types of retention models used in the pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1999 the values of the other hydraulic parameters were also similar to those of dai et al 2013 except for θ r which were lower and ranged from 0 018 to 0 033 0 015 0 018 and 0 0 0 04 for respectively loam sandy loam and sandy clay loam probably because some of the pedotransfer function data derived from sandier soils characterised by low θr e g børgesen et al 2008 the pedotransfer functions were derived from large data sets with a broad textural range of soils across europe and usa and validated against independent data some of which use more inputs than merely soil texture i e bulk density and som weynants et al 2009 børgesen et al 2008 no specific pedotransfer functions have been published for ncp soils and were thus not included in the ensemble modelling leading to uncertainty in the derived values though the accuracy of the functions is essentially unknown outside the datasets used for their development they provide a good balance between accuracy and availability their development and improvement remains essential for applications in agroecosystem modelling across scales thus future studies may validate the results of this study against direct field measured k θ s and θ r values across the region and adapt them if necessary 4 3 regional approach to balance crop production and nitrogen leaching plausible scenarios for regional variables are of interest for instance in evaluating their comparative performance under a range of agro environmental conditions such information have a bearing on policies concerning environmental protection regional support and rural development despite the conservative nature of daisy i e lower yield response to fertiliser n compared to the real yield response e g fig 4 the model can be used to investigate management effects on crop production and associated n losses e g børgesen et al 2001 contrary to the farmers practice of straw removal all regional scenarios considered straw incorporation after crop harvest because this is promoted in the last decade in the ncp and in some parts has steadily increased the som contents moreover straw incorporation effect on crop yields is likely to be more evident in coarser textured soils through a direct nutritional effect and possibly an improvement of soil characteristics pituello et al 2015 the first three scenarios scenario 1 to scenario 3 fig 8 focused on region wide decrease of the fertiliser n rate as excessive n fertilisation poses a threat to the groundwater quality despite the soil removal capacity by denitrification brauns et al 2016 region wide measures are also easier to communicate with farmers compared to spatially targeted measures the results of scenario 2 i e full irrigation straw incorporation and 300 kg n ha 1 fertiliser split between maize and winter wheat yielded satisfactorily in terms of balancing crop yields and n leaching this also supports other studies in the region that have reported reduced n leaching for about 70 at an n rate of 40 60 of the current one without compromising yields e g fang et al 2013 michalczyk et al 2014 noteworthy is that the annual drainage under the irrigated conditions for scenario 1 to scenario 3 of mostly between 30 and 70 mm was close to the 71 mm 44 mm for maize and 27 mm for wheat reported previously for the same pedo climatic conditions yang et al 2015 apart of adjusting fertiliser n rate to control n leaching deficit irrigation is increasingly studied as a management option in the ncp especially for winter wheat that grows in the semi arid period due to the rapid decline in the groundwater table shu et al 2012 which is forecast to continue even under minimum irrigation of the maize winter wheat double crop system and a future shift to alternative cropping systems like single maize or wheat or a dryland wheat maize system has been proposed yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation is advantageous as crops may evapotranspire less than their potential while generating equal or even higher crop yields if irrigated less but during critical moments of their growth cycle du et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 this was considered by the other scenarios and scenario 4 and the results show no yield loss large reduction in n leaching but also reduced drainage for almost 50 because the return water flows by irrigation were reduced for 25 in this scenario table 1 these results corroborate field results that it is possible to decrease irrigation of wheat for 20 30 without significant yield loss du et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 additional decrease in irrigation was considered for maize by managing it as a rainfed crop scenario 5 which resulted in notable yield reductions fig 8 probably because the deficit irrigation of the winter wheat left the soil drier after harvest which exacerbated the rainfed maize growth although maize yields can reach their potentials in some rain rich years as a 10 year average this scenario resulted in notably less income for the farmers as indicated by the low crop yields in scenario 6 winter wheat was replaced with fallow every second year around rivers and channels which are areas at particular risk of n leaching from inland intensive agriculture brauns et al 2016 as expected the largest yield reductions were seen along the rivers and channels fig 8 whereas drainage and n leaching did not differ compared to the previous scenario and were kept to low values this underlines the importance of the geographical position of the measures as very important for achieving the expected balance between crop production and n losses in spatially targeted measures are to be considered shifting to a rainfed single maize system scenario 7 started to increase annual drainage supporting others results shu et al 2012 yang et al 2015 for easing the groundwater decline in the ncp by decreasing irrigation however drainage thus groundwater recharge is linked with the amount of irrigation water pumped from the groundwater aquifer and is therefore a weak indicator of future groundwater decline future studies may determine the net water use instead recharge minus irrigation for better insights 5 conclusions this study showed that weather and soil data ranging from low generalised to high spatialised detail were not equally suitable for simulation of regional crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching across an agriculture intensive alluvial region in the ncp higher weather data detail increased the spatial variability of all simulated variables and decreased their median value simulated crop yields 12 7 12 9 mg ha 1 y 1 were closer to the statistical yields 12 mg ha 1 y 1 when using high detail weather and soil input data though the response to data detail was weak soil water drainage and n leaching showed considerably larger uncertainties and higher soil data detail increased their magnitude two to threefold as well as their spatial variability their regional medians and the direction of the spatial distribution were however similar for medium and high detail soil data of respectively 20 6 and 31 2 mm y 1 for drainage and 24 7 and 38 8 kg n ha 1 y 1 for leaching against 3 8 mm y 1 and 10 3 kg n ha 1 y 1 for low detail data consequently if the objective is to explicitly simulate the spatial variation of crop yield drainage and n leaching common global national weather and soil datasets need to be of high detail or supported by field work to better characterise spatial heterogeneity the simulated management scenarios with the high detail weather and soil input data revealed that crop yields could be maintained and n leaching reduced by using region wide incorporation of crop straw an annual n supplement of 300 kg ha 1 and about 25 less irrigation as an alternative to current farming practices the other scenarios involving rainfed maize and spatially targeted winter wheat managements decreased drastically crop yields while drainage and n leaching were minimal drainage in this part of the ncp started to increase only after switching from a maize winter wheat double crop to maize monocrop the study approach is useful for scientists and regional environmental managers in china and elsewhere and for regions with low data quality and quantity it shows the limitations in the use of such data in regional simulation studies the ensemble prediction of soil hydraulic properties appears to be a very promising method for parameterisation of field scale simulation models for their regional applications software and data usage and availability 1 software title daisy a soil plant atmosphere model first available 1990 developers søren hansen and per abrahamsen contact

26284,single or multiple weather station data were combined with soil textural data ranging from low to high detail i e point data from a field station the fao digital soil map of the world and a comprehensive data from national soil survey as input to the daisy model to simulate and upscale crop yields drainage and nitrogen leaching for an agroecosystem in the north china plain increasing the detail of the weather data increased the spatial variation of all simulated variables and decreased their regional median regional crop yields were simulated well with high detail input data though at a weak response to data detail simulated regional drainage and nitrogen leaching and their spatial variability however responded well and increased two to threefold but their regional medians were similar for medium and high detail soil data this work demonstrates the importance of explicit consideration of weather and soil variability for agro environmental simulation studies at regional scale graphical abstract image 1 keywords crop yields drainage environmental geology mathematical model nitrogen leaching soil classification 1 introduction field scale and process based agroecosystem simulation models in the following simply referred to as models require high quality regionally representative input data to provide reliable and representative results in regional studies typical input data include weather variables precipitation temperature and global radiation soil textural and hydraulic properties and field management actions which are used to simulate crop growth soil water and nitrogen n dynamics for a number of representative weather soil management combinations characterising a region results can be upscaled to various levels such as grid cell municipality or country e g børgesen et al 2001 li et al 2014a in reality crop growth and soil n responses differ spatially and temporally due to the heterogeneity of weather soil and field managements hu and mo 2011 peña haro et al 2014 detailed input data are therefore required at regional level to upscale the simulation results faivre et al 2004 and for reliable simulation outputs to guide agro environmental management børgesen et al 2001 strokal et al 2014 input data for weather variables and soil texture are available from various sources differing in detail and geographical scale for example global

bgr 2018 or regional databases from climate and geological institutes at scales 1 50 000 or larger however the uncertainty associated with the use of different input data for simulation results is rarely considered when assessing applications for regional agro environmental management but it is of significant interest beyond agroecosystem modelling previous research has explicitly demonstrated high sensitivity of model regional results on the detail of the input data in regard to water quality haydon and deletic 2009 soil carbon c dynamics post et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 grosz et al 2017 and crop yields pogson et al 2012 with regard to crop yields results are actually inconsistent a few simulation studies find detailed data to be important for representing regional variation of crop yields olesen et al 2000 especially for small areas e g 1000 2000 km2 wassenaar et al 1999 for larger areas most simulation studies show detailed input data to be less important due to masked spatial heterogeneity in both the weather and the soil characteristics angulo et al 2013 2014 niu et al 2009 the effect of input data on the regional distribution of modelled n fluxes is explored to a much lesser extent some studies of soil aspects report markedly lower variability of n fluxes helliwell et al 2007 windolf et al 2012 suggesting that existing soil texture data are sufficient for understanding regional variations other studies get reliable results at finer rather than coarser detail especially for areas with contrasting landscape factors rankinen et al 2002 styczen and storm 1993 for most crops the relationship between n fluxes and field management such as n fertilisation is convex i e the flux response per extra unit of n applied becomes larger but is modified by environmental factors such as soil properties hydroclimate and sampling factors gao et al 2016 the soil hydraulic properties i e saturated θs and residual soil water contents θ r and hydraulic conductivity k are typically contingent on soil texture and structure but are heterogeneous due to the spatial variability in soil structure organic matter content and bulk density and are not readily available for large scales obtaining sufficient and reliable soil hydraulic data at regional scale is challenging also due to the effort required for extensive soil sampling the application of pedotransfer functions which have been derived in various countries in order to estimate soil hydraulics indirectly may be a promising method to obtain effective hydraulic parameters for the soil type of interest effective parameters are those derived from a mesh defined at the measurement scale into a coarser mesh that can be used in large scale e g watershed scale basin scale regional scale hydroclimatic and environmental modelling china is the world s largest producer of grain and the explicit goal of the central government is to be reasonably self sufficient in food despite having to feed 20 of the worlds population with only 8 of the worlds arable land the north china plain ncp is an important region for grain production in the country which supports two crop harvests per year rainfed maize zea mays l june to october and irrigated winter wheat triticum aestivum l october to june this double cropping system is the most dominant agroecosystem supplying about 50 of the national maize and wheat yet its environmental sustainability has been questioned due to a low n use efficiency high n leaching and excessive consumption of groundwater to meet crop water needs for high yields ma et al 2012 yang et al 2015 recently gao et al 2016 used county scale weather data and fao harmonised world soil data hwsd about 1 5 000 000 scale in a statistical modelling study to clarify whether and if so how weather and soil as environmental factors regulate the rate and amount of n leaching in the ncp the authors emphasised the importance of including local hydro climatic conditions in regional estimates of n leaching which are known to affect soil n cycling and transport in the root zone despite the significance of n leaching having been recognised in numerous field and modelling studies its regional magnitude from a maize winter wheat double cropping system is uncertain due to uncertainties in the models and the driving variables and to differences in the weather and soil data used in the studies this paper addresses two main questions first what are the differences in regional crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching when simulated using weather and soil data inputs differing in detail in the context of reliability and preferability second after detecting preferable input data is it possible to apply and demonstrate their use for regional management scenarios the main objectives were to i derive water retention and hydraulic information for soils characteristic of an agriculture intensive alluvial region in the ncp ii compare regional crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching simulated using the different weather and soil input data ranging from low to high detail and iii investigate agro management actions with potential to balance crop production and n leaching at regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydro climatic conditions the study area was the shijiazhuang prefecture located in the hebei province china fig 1 the area is situated in the ncp and includes the province capital shijiazhuang city population 4 3 mil in 2015 and 17 rural counties population 6 7 mil in 2015 covering about 15 000 km2 between longitudes 113 7 115 8 e and latitudes 37 3 38 5 n the altitude across the region which is agricultural varies from 20 to 100 m above sea level except in the north west which is mountainous the climate is continental semi arid and monsoon influenced with a mean monthly temperature of 2 c in january and 27 c in july and mean annual precipitation of about 500 mm of which 70 falls as rain during the humid summer months july to september with little to no precipitation in spring and autumn and especially winter the annual potential evapotranspiration is about 1000 mm the geology consists of alluvial fluvial surface fans on top of quaternary aged deposits of inter fingering gravel sand and silt extending to about 400 m depth the hutuo river runs north of shijiazhuang city fig 1 most agroecosystems are irrigated by groundwater and a few use irrigation water from the shijin distribution canal running from the western reservoirs some farmers use wastewater from the xiaohe canal for irrigation despite poor water quality more than 80 of the agricultural land use consists of maize winter wheat double cropping 2 2 the model input data and simulations daisy version 5 19 used in this study is a one dimensional mechanistic and deterministic soil plant atmosphere system model that simulates flows of water c and n driven by daily weather and field management data hansen et al 2012 the model is fairly detailed and soil hydrology is simulated by soil heat flow fourier s equation and water transport richard s equation richards 1931 based on measured precipitation applied irrigation and reference evapotranspiration fao penman monteith equation allan et al 1998 transport of inorganic n convection dispersion equation is also numerically solved plant growth is simulated by a detailed leaf area and light utilisation approach for calculating photosynthesis maintenance and growth respiration turnover of organic n from litter and roots organic fertiliser and soil organic matter som is calculated from the actual amount of n in these pools using their carbon to nitrogen c n ratio net n mineralisation or immobilisation is derived from the overall n balance details on model equations and assumptions are available elsewhere hansen 2002 hansen et al 2012 daisy needs data on weather soil crop and management information 2 2 1 weather data weather data from 2000 to 2013 were available from four meteorological stations fig 1 and included daily measurements of sunshine hours h mean air temperature c precipitation mm vapor pressure hpa and wind speed m s 1 sunshine hours were converted to global radiation mj m 2 using the ångström equation as given by allen et al 1998 the respective values for wet and dry deposition of 7 5 ppm and 10 kg n ha 1 for ammonium and 2 5 ppm and 5 kg n ha 1 for nitrate required by the daisy weather file were approximated from zhang et al 2011 and were applied for all four weather files 2 2 2 soil data three soil datasets were used fig 2 the first dataset named s1 is a point measurement from a field station used to represent the entire region thus a roughly 1 15 000 000 geographical scale giving about 125 125 km resolution to these data and comprised soil physical properties texture organic matter bulk density measured at the luancheng station the second dataset named s2 geographical scale 1 5 000 000 resolution 10 10 km was extracted from the fao dsmw fao 2007 it is a complex dataset available for free online in vector format containing a set of spatially distributed polygons defining main soils each including soil type units that are not spatially delineated but are semantically described for their percent wise contribution to the main soils and properties texture organic matter bulk density in topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm extended to 200 cm in this study the third dataset named s3 geographical scale 1 1 000 000 resolution 1 1 km was extracted from shangguan et al 2013 this multi dimensional raster dataset is also available for free online and includes spatially distributed units pixels on the map each containing sub units layers of 20 cm down to 200 cm depth with information on soil physical properties texture organic matter bulk density as it is impossible to consider each soil of the s3 data pixels were spatially aggregated based on top and subsoil clay content following a sensitivity analysis of daisy and units of topsoil clay content between 4 and 8 9 15 16 19 and 20 26 were grouped as 6 12 17 and 21 respectively whereas units of subsoil clay content of 5 13 and 13 28 were grouped as 9 and 21 respectively resulting in six main soils the pixels were depth weight averaged into topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 200 cm and conversion from raster to vector format was performed in total 13 columns one in s1 six in s2 and six in s3 each composed of topsoil and subsoil were set up the values of the c parameters required to initialise the model were adopted from manevski et al 2016b except for the c n ratio of the topsoil and subsoil which was fixed at 11 and 12 respectively for all soils daisy also requires soil hydraulic parameters for each top and subsoil to solve the richards equation these were described by the van genuchten mualem equation van genuchten 1980 and the values of saturated k ks matching point cm day θs θ r and α n and l were derived from a three step ensemble modelling procedure first initial ks θs θ r α n and l values were calculated with five pedotransfer functions i e rawls and brakensiek 1985 schaap et al 1998 wösten et al 1999 børgesen et al 2008 and weynants et al 2009 see table s1 in the supplementaty material second these initial parameter values were used to tabulate soil water content θ at several pressure heads h between 0 and 16 000 cm the van genuchten water retention curve and k between 16 and 16 000 cm the mualem hydraulic curve thus yielding five datasets for θ h and five datasets for k h last final θs θ r α n and l values were found by curve fitting of θ h with a nonlinear least squares optimisation approach using the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 which outputs fitted θs θ r α n and l were then used as inputs to find the final ks also in retc the retention and hydraulic curve for all soil types in the study can be found in figs s1 s6 of the supplementary material 2 2 3 crop data maize and winter wheat parameterisations published in manevski et al 2016a b were adopted as these have been calibrated and validated on field experimental data for crop development and growth on different loamy soils and management situations for multiple years at luancheng in the ncp the values of crop potential evapotranspiration factor epfacds at flowering and maturity were lowered from 1 1 to 1 0 i e 7 decrease to reflect more closely the farmers cultivars and associated losses e g due to pests and diseases as opposed to the cultivars grown in the well managed experimental plots used for original parameter calibration manevski et al 2016b everything else remained unchanged 2 2 4 management data the management information included time of ploughing type of crop and time of sowing and harvest straw management incorporation or removal time and amount of fertiliser n and of irrigation most of these were derived from long term field experiments at the luancheng station aiming to represent the farming practice in the wider region that is non limiting for crop production manevski et al 2016b wang et al 2013 sowing maize was set in mid june after ploughing whereas for winter wheat it was early october crop straw removal at harvest was simulated to mimic farmers practice hou et al 2012 ma et al 2012 for fertiliser n county level data were obtained from the statistical china knowledge resource integrated database http epub cnki net the annual fertiliser rates used in the simulations were 400 600 and 800 kg n ha 1 based on the frequency distribution and 25th 50th and 75th percentiles of respectively 464 575 and 799 kg n ha 1 see table s2 in the supplementary material irrigation was simulated to follow n fertilisation and was supplemented throughout the season with water applied directly to the soil surface bypassing the crop canopy as farmers irrigate their fields by flooding with pumped groundwater the amounts were available from field logs and varied between 60 and 187 mm for maize and 200 400 mm for winter wheat depending on year see table 1 ammonium and nitrate concentrations of the irrigation water were not specified in the model as no such data could be found nor are they regulated required as recommended maximum concentrations according to the standards for irrigation water quality of china gb 5084 2005 2 2 5 simulations a total of 156 systems i e 4 weather stations 13 soil columns 3 fertiliser n rates were simulated to describe the current weather soil management in the region denoted hereafter as current situation i e scenario 0 for all simulations the model was continuously run from 1 june 2000 to 1 june 2013 with daily precipitation irrigation and potential evapotranspiration set at the atmospheric upper boundary and deep groundwater at the lower boundary the first two years were excluded in order to minimise the impact of model initialisation on the results thus leaving ten years with full maize winter wheat annual crop rotations output files were processed in matlab2013a to calculate mean annual values of crop yields maize wheat soil water drainage and n leaching at the end of the root zone 200 cm accumulated from 1 june to 31 may i e for hydrological year which in the north china plain runs from maize sowing to wheat harvest and these were used in the upscaling 2 3 upscaling spatial information on weather soil cropped area and fertiliser n is needed for upscaling the field scale simulation results for weather the region was represented by data from either a single station 1 or all stations fig 1 for soil the three soil datasets described previously were used for cropped area the maize winter wheat distribution was derived from a classified landsat tm thematic mapper 30 m resolution image from june 2008 guo and shen 2015 for fertiliser n mean annual county data were used fig 1 a 5 5 km grid was intersected with the weather soil crop and fertiliser n data in arcmap ver 10 3 so each cell contained a weather soil crop fertiliser n combination s with a corresponding value for crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching simulated with daisy variables for each combination were multiplied with crop area summed within a cell and divided with crop area in the cell in order to express per hectare for soil input s2 the spatial distribution of the sub units within units was not known and variables per cell were calculated as o i x o j where o is the simulated output variable crop yield drainage or n leaching i is the main unit i e soil j is the sub unit i e soil type within the main soil and x is the known percentage contribution of j into i 2 4 uncertainty analysis the regional distribution of the simulated crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching for the weather and soil input data was assessed in the form of frequency density plots beanplots using the beanplot function in the beanplot package for r r core team 2013 these plots depict the range of a data sample similarly to box whisker plots without further assumptions on the distribution or the mean median the contour lines of the plots represent a density trace that offers an insight into the frequency distribution of the sample the density trace was calculated using silverman s rule of thumb bandwidth with scotts variation bw nrd for a normal gaussian kernel a detailed description of beanplots and their implementation can be found elsewhere kampstra 2008 to further assess the uncertainty introduced by the detail of the input data descriptive statistics and coefficients of variation cv were calculated for the upscaled variables and root mean squared residuals rmsr were computed between simulated upscaled and statistical crop yields 2 5 management scenario analysis using weather and soil input data at the highest detail i e multiple weather and s3 data seven management scenarios all with straw incorporation were simulated upscaled and compared to scenario 0 i the first three denoted scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 were derived from scenario 0 and included three annual fertiliser n rates uniformly applied across the region i e 400 300 and 200 kg n ha 1 for scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 respectively whereas irrigation remaining as in scenario 0 table 1 ii the next two denoted scenario 4 and scenario 5 were derived from scenario 2 the optimal for field scale manevski et al 2016b and introduced deficit irrigation which has been found to be a more cost efficient instrument for reducing n leaching compared to a change in fertiliser n amount only horan and shortle 2001 thus the irrigation amount was decreased by 25 in winter wheat scenario 4 and in both winter wheat and summer maize rainfed maize scenario 5 table 1 iii the last two scenarios scenario 6 and scenario 7 are the same as scenario 5 in terms of fertilisation and deficit irrigation but represent spatially differentiated measures for regional n management where a certain measure targets a particular element of a landscape in scenario 6 winter wheat was replaced every second year by winter fallow within 5 km of rivers and canals and in scenario 7 winter wheat was completely taken out of the double crop rotation the 168 scenario simulation results four weather stations six soil columns seven scenarios were upscaled as described before and analysed in the form of maps notably the model was re validated for crop yields prior to the scenario simulations focusing on the response to irrigation for this purpose a two year data subset for grain yield 2007 2009 two full seasons for maize and wheat from a long term irrigation experiment was used a detailed description can be found in sun et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 briefly maize and winter wheat had been grown since 1997 in a double crop rotation on a silty loam field at luancheng station in the ncp with six irrigation treatments rainfed or one two three four or five events of 60 70 mm each based on crop development stage replicated four times surface irrigation was applied using a low pressure tube water transportation system with a flow meter to record the irrigation applied annual fertilisation was 300 430 kg ha 1 n and 130 240 kg ha 1 p2o5 crop yields were measured at harvest straw was either incorporated into the topsoil maize or left in the field wheat 3 results 3 1 regional weather characteristics intra annual weather variation and regional patters are important factors controlling crop growth and soil n dynamics there were only small differences in temperature and precipitation amounts for the region and little intra annual variation during the wheat season september to june whereas precipitation varied during the maize season june september when most rainfall occurred fig 3 differences were seen for global radiation relative humidity and wind speed which are important for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration and drainage as well as crop water use and water stress reference evapotranspiration was 895 922 1097 and 1025 mm year 1 for zone 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the slightly lower reference evapotranspiration values for the first two zones in the south and south east were probably due to the higher relative humidity and lower global radiation recorded there which have a negative effect on evapotranspiration 3 2 regional soil characteristics all datasets classified the soils in the region as loamy with a light loam topsoil and heavy loam subsoil table 2 topsoil bulk density was lower indicating water permeability and good aeration whereas subsoil bulk density was higher indicating possible restriction to root growth and water movement for s1 low detail the soil was a silty loam with distinct clayey subsoil for s2 medium detail the soil consisted of fine textured loams with four dominant soils varying from sandy loams lithosols with eutric cambisols to silty clay loams chromic cambisols and clay loams mollic gleysols and calcaric fluvisols and with 19 24 clay in the topsoil and 18 28 clay in the subsoil yet major variation between the soils of s2 was seen in their silt and sand content the former being larger for loams compared to sandy clay loams and the latter notably larger for sandy clay loams compared to loams for both top and subsoil table 2 compared to s1 and s2 soils the s3 soils high detail were much coarser in texture and varied between loams and sandy loams with either 9 or 21 clay content in the subsoil spatially s2 and s3 both showed the existence of alluvial fluvial fans north west to south east along and around the hutuo river fig 4 the estimated values of the van genuchten mualem hydraulic parameters table 3 generally followed the textural description of the soils with sandy loam soils being the most conductive ks 4 18 cm h 1 loamy soils the least conductive ks 0 7 1 4 cm h 1 and sandy clay loam soils in between ks 0 8 2 7 cm h 1 except for one sandy clay loam in s2 lithosol with a ks value of about 22 cm h 1 probably due to a higher predicted value for α larger pores of soil matrix the saturated and residual soil water contents i e θs and θr respectively also resembled the textural description of the soils with θs being lower and θr being higher for the more clayey soils compared to sandy soils and this was more evident for s2 than s3 table 3 3 3 effect of detail of weather and soil input data on simulated regional variables the beanplots of simulated mean crop yields drainage and n leaching upscaled for the shijiazhuang prefecture are presented in fig 5 with associated statistics in table 4 the increased detail of weather data expanded the range max min and the modality number of peaks of the beanplots for crop yields the coefficient of variation cv for s1 s2 and s3 was respectively 0 1 1 3 and 4 2 for single weather and 5 4 6 3 and 8 2 for multiple weather stations compared to 17 2 for the statistical crop yields the median crop yield was 13 5 mg ha 1 for single weather and 13 0 mg ha 1 for multiple weather stations compared to 12 0 mg ha 1 for the statistical yields table 4 daisy could not simulate the upper limit of 15 16 mg ha 1 for the statistical yields probably due to management factors not considered explicitly by the model such as the use of improved varieties by some farmers and supply of nutrients other than n further regardless of weather data detail there was a small effect of soil data detail although the modality of crop yields for s3 tended to be closer to that of the statistical yields drainage under s1 was not affected by the detail of the weather data and its magnitude range and modality were low table 2 drainage under s2 and s3 had a larger range and modality and lower median for fine compared to coarse weather data fig 5 table 4 the beanplots for s2 and s3 were similar in that both were bimodal had similar 25th and 75th percentiles and medians of 35 38 mm for single weather and 20 30 mm for multi weather station data the beanplots of simulated regional n leaching were similar to those of drainage in terms of lowest range modality and median for s1 compared to s2 and s3 the increased detail of both weather and soil data increased the range and modality of the plots with a concomitant decrease in their medians with regard to variation s1 and s2 showed lower medians of respectively 12 and 28 3 kg n ha 1 for the single weather station and 10 and 24 kg n ha 1 for multiple stations compared to 62 and 39 kg n ha 1 for s3 s3 also showed a wide leaching range of 6 250 kg n ha 1 the uncertainty in simulating regional leaching based on soil type is quantified in table 5 annual n leaching for the whole prefecture did not differ much irrespective of weather data detail implying its lesser importance when focusing on the prefecture as a whole on the other hand markedly higher differences more than threefold in total annual n leaching were seen between the soil data sets emphasising the high importance of the choice of soil data for this variable complementary to the beanplots is the spatial distribution of the simulated upscaled variables fig 6 overall the maps clearly showed the cause effects of high fertiliser n and irrigation input leading to high crop yields and n leaching the somewhat lower crop yields in the eastern regions for all soil data were due to the lower water holding capacity of those soils as implied by the coarser texture i e lower clay content fig 4 in the western part which is largely mountainous and most of the land cover is natural vegetation the actual cropping area and management conditions would be the least known but of least importance 3 4 regional scenario analysis 3 4 1 model re validation prior the scenario analysis daisy was re validated and the results showed that the model was fairly responsive to irrigation management applied to maize and winter wheat with good accuracy for predicted grain yields under various irrigation amounts except for the somewhat lower accuracy for winter wheat under low irrigation 0 1 irrigations fig 7 the statistical analysis showed that the root mean squared error rmse for simulated maize and wheat yields was respectively 0 7 and 1 3 mg ha 1 the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 61 and 0 43 and the mean absolute error mae of 0 21 and 1 11 mg ha 1 as absolute accuracy of the model in the re validation was of less importance the overestimated yield response of winter wheat under rainfed and low irrigation conditions i e lower simulated yields than observed can be treated as lower boundary yield conditions the results indicate that the model can be used with confidence for regional yield simulation under various irrigations 3 4 2 management scenarios scenarios involving change in crop fertiliser and irrigation strategies all with straw incorporation were investigated for their potential to reduce n leaching and maintain yields in shijiazhuang region scenario 1 scenario 7 table 1 compared to the farmers current practice scenario 0 mean yield drainage and n leaching of respectively 12 6 mg ha 1 31 2 mm and 38 8 kg n ha 1 table 4 there were no differences in magnitude and spatialisation for simulated regional crop yields and drainage for scenario 1 and scenario 2 but only for n leaching of 35 and 20 kg n ha 1 corresponding to a reduction of about 8 and 47 n leaching was further reduced by almost 80 in scenario 3 whereas yields decreased by 1 0 1 2 mg ha 1 and drainage slightly increased n leaching responded strongly to fertiliser rate despite irrigation main factor for soil water and nitrate transport being the same for all three scenarios scenario 2 was selected as a base for the subsequent scenarios involving deficit irrigation since the time of irrigation was already strategically set in scenario 0 only the amounts were decreased table 1 the results showed decreased yields of respectively 12 and 30 for scenario 4 and scenario 5 relative to scenario 0 as the return water flows to the soil from excess irrigation were also reduced in the previous scenarios drainage also reduced further in scenario 6 replacing winter wheat with fallow every second year around rivers and channels did not introduce changes in annual drainage although it generated the lowest amounts of n leaching with large yield reductions fig 8 shifting to a rainfed single maize system scenario 7 however started to increase annual drainage compared to the previous two scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 variables response to weather and soil data detail although ample irrigation used in the simulations probably equilibrated differences between sites and years crop yields were moderately affected by the detail of both weather and soil data increasing the detail of the weather data increased consistently the range i e variation of simulated regional crop yields regardless of the detail of the soil data fig 5 and table 4 this shows that the magnitude of simulated regional crop yields and their spatial distribution are controlled by the weather though other factors such as field management and pest disease control are also important as implied by the wide range of 8 16 mg ha 1 y 1 for the statistical yields scale studies across europe also found improved representation of regional crop yields when using finer detail weather data input to simulation models hoffmann et al 2015 olesen et al 2000 zhao et al 2015 regarding the soil data detail low effect on regional variation of simulated crop yields have been previously reported due to an ample water supply from precipitation that partly mask differences in soil water holding capacity hendriks et al 2016 but also due to loss of variability in soil hydraulic properties calculated by pedotransfer functions angulo et al 2014 in the present study however the effect of soil data detail in interaction with the weather on regional crop yields was notable probably due to the coarser textural description of s3 compared to s1 and s2 despite the ample supply of soil water and n for the crops for comparison zhang et al 2014 used ssurgo medium detail or statsgo low detail soil data as inputs to simulate cropland carbon fluxes in the usa whereas pogson et al 2008 used the fao hwsd medium detail and the international geosphere biosphere programme soil data igbp high detail to study regional crop yields in the uk both studies found substantial uncertainties in the simulated regional agro environmental variables due to inherent differences in the size of the basic units and their contents i e providing a single value for units that in reality include a range of different soil types similarly hoffmann et al 2016 also found a notable effect i e error on crop yields by decreasing the detail of both weather and soil data input to simulation models for a temperate region in germany drainage and n leaching responded markedly to the detail of the weather data fig 5 and table 4 and the lower end of the drainage beanplot for s2 and s3 corroborates field studies across the ncp reporting little drainage for maize wheat double crop rotations due to low rainfall especially during the winter wheat season and low initial soil moisture content in the soil profile li et al 2014a yang et al 2015 differences in drainage appear to persist despite full irrigation used in the simulations that would offset differences in water retention and hydraulic properties between the soils the regional drainage simulated using s1 showed low values and very little variation and the presence of a specific feature such as an alluvial clay layer described in this point scale soil dataset with very low infiltration rate and unknown spatial variations seems to hamper regional generalisation although s1 cannot reflect more precisely regional soil variations it was included for comparison to mimic a very scarce data situation it should be mentioned that reliable depiction of drainage in the model depends among other things on evapotranspiration which was simulated on average 352 25 mm for maize and 430 39 for wheat for all soil datasets for comparison zhang et al 2011 reported mean evapotranspiration of 396 mm for maize and 458 mm for wheat under irrigated conditions from 2000 to 2009 at luancheng in the ncp derived with the water balance method therefore major differences in the water balance between the soil datasets could be attributed to differences in simulated drainage all input data could capture the lower end of 0 20 kg n ha 1 leaching whereas only s3 depicted the higher end of more than 300 kg n ha 1 which agrees with reports of 20 300 kg n ha 1 in the shijiazhuang prefecture based on field measurements and model simulations li et al 2014b qiu et al 2011 an important reason for differences in n leaching and drainage and possibly also crop yields is the som content which was twice as high in s1 compared to s2 and s3 respectively 2 5 and 1 3 and which thus partly counteracted the effects of a more sandy soil in the latter data sets for s2 and s3 a reason for the substantially different soil texture description is column depth being respectively 100 and 200 cm the former being extended to 200 cm in the simulations also s2 was derived from the dsmw by fao a widely used dataset in simulation studies that is based on soil profile information from field projects in china during the 1970s and 80s which might have been limited in access when this dataset was composed s3 was derived from the data in shangguan et al 2013 collected from detailed soil books at national and provincial levels across china digitised and thoroughly checked for quality mistakes and redundancy s2 consisted solely of medium to fine textured soils fig 4 whereas s3 contained coarse textured soils as well which is more consistent with the common understanding in chinese soil science that sandier soils have been deposited alluvially along and around the hutuo river and silty and loamy soils in the other areas hu et al 2010 although s2 and s3 are among the best soil datasets currently available for the ncp their detail differs markedly with regard to soil physical properties thus affecting rates of simulated mineralisation of organic matter in the soil nitrification and denitrification and finally n leaching thus modellers and environmental managers need to be careful with some of the soil data and be aware of their original purpose content and limitations 4 2 deriving effective soil hydraulic parameters knowledge of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties is mandatory for describing and predicting water flow and solute transport in the unsaturated soil zone the mualem van genuchten model is among the best known vereecken et al 2010 and it relies on its parameters which in the present study were estimated by ensemble modelling in addition to the determination of ks the conductivity parameter l that was fixed to 0 5 focus in the optimisation of k was the unsaturated matrix domain as its values near saturation are specific to the measurement conditions thus highly uncertain djurhuus et al 1999 ensemble modelling follows the rationale from meteorology and recently from crop modelling that the existence of multiple models developed and tested in one region may perform relatively poor in other regions where multi model ensemble prediction techniques i e those using an averaged prediction from several models have been developed to address this problem kollas et al 2015 yin et al 2017a 2017b the estimated ks values table 3 were close to the medians of 3 7 1 4 and 1 3 cm h 1 for respectively sandy loam loam and sandy clay loam reported by dai et al 2013 who derived van genuchten parameters for chinese soils using a similar ensemble approach literature values of the van genuchten parameters especially n for loamy soils are to some extent inconsistent due to different definitions of soil texture classes and types of retention models used in the pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1999 the values of the other hydraulic parameters were also similar to those of dai et al 2013 except for θ r which were lower and ranged from 0 018 to 0 033 0 015 0 018 and 0 0 0 04 for respectively loam sandy loam and sandy clay loam probably because some of the pedotransfer function data derived from sandier soils characterised by low θr e g børgesen et al 2008 the pedotransfer functions were derived from large data sets with a broad textural range of soils across europe and usa and validated against independent data some of which use more inputs than merely soil texture i e bulk density and som weynants et al 2009 børgesen et al 2008 no specific pedotransfer functions have been published for ncp soils and were thus not included in the ensemble modelling leading to uncertainty in the derived values though the accuracy of the functions is essentially unknown outside the datasets used for their development they provide a good balance between accuracy and availability their development and improvement remains essential for applications in agroecosystem modelling across scales thus future studies may validate the results of this study against direct field measured k θ s and θ r values across the region and adapt them if necessary 4 3 regional approach to balance crop production and nitrogen leaching plausible scenarios for regional variables are of interest for instance in evaluating their comparative performance under a range of agro environmental conditions such information have a bearing on policies concerning environmental protection regional support and rural development despite the conservative nature of daisy i e lower yield response to fertiliser n compared to the real yield response e g fig 4 the model can be used to investigate management effects on crop production and associated n losses e g børgesen et al 2001 contrary to the farmers practice of straw removal all regional scenarios considered straw incorporation after crop harvest because this is promoted in the last decade in the ncp and in some parts has steadily increased the som contents moreover straw incorporation effect on crop yields is likely to be more evident in coarser textured soils through a direct nutritional effect and possibly an improvement of soil characteristics pituello et al 2015 the first three scenarios scenario 1 to scenario 3 fig 8 focused on region wide decrease of the fertiliser n rate as excessive n fertilisation poses a threat to the groundwater quality despite the soil removal capacity by denitrification brauns et al 2016 region wide measures are also easier to communicate with farmers compared to spatially targeted measures the results of scenario 2 i e full irrigation straw incorporation and 300 kg n ha 1 fertiliser split between maize and winter wheat yielded satisfactorily in terms of balancing crop yields and n leaching this also supports other studies in the region that have reported reduced n leaching for about 70 at an n rate of 40 60 of the current one without compromising yields e g fang et al 2013 michalczyk et al 2014 noteworthy is that the annual drainage under the irrigated conditions for scenario 1 to scenario 3 of mostly between 30 and 70 mm was close to the 71 mm 44 mm for maize and 27 mm for wheat reported previously for the same pedo climatic conditions yang et al 2015 apart of adjusting fertiliser n rate to control n leaching deficit irrigation is increasingly studied as a management option in the ncp especially for winter wheat that grows in the semi arid period due to the rapid decline in the groundwater table shu et al 2012 which is forecast to continue even under minimum irrigation of the maize winter wheat double crop system and a future shift to alternative cropping systems like single maize or wheat or a dryland wheat maize system has been proposed yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation is advantageous as crops may evapotranspire less than their potential while generating equal or even higher crop yields if irrigated less but during critical moments of their growth cycle du et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 this was considered by the other scenarios and scenario 4 and the results show no yield loss large reduction in n leaching but also reduced drainage for almost 50 because the return water flows by irrigation were reduced for 25 in this scenario table 1 these results corroborate field results that it is possible to decrease irrigation of wheat for 20 30 without significant yield loss du et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 additional decrease in irrigation was considered for maize by managing it as a rainfed crop scenario 5 which resulted in notable yield reductions fig 8 probably because the deficit irrigation of the winter wheat left the soil drier after harvest which exacerbated the rainfed maize growth although maize yields can reach their potentials in some rain rich years as a 10 year average this scenario resulted in notably less income for the farmers as indicated by the low crop yields in scenario 6 winter wheat was replaced with fallow every second year around rivers and channels which are areas at particular risk of n leaching from inland intensive agriculture brauns et al 2016 as expected the largest yield reductions were seen along the rivers and channels fig 8 whereas drainage and n leaching did not differ compared to the previous scenario and were kept to low values this underlines the importance of the geographical position of the measures as very important for achieving the expected balance between crop production and n losses in spatially targeted measures are to be considered shifting to a rainfed single maize system scenario 7 started to increase annual drainage supporting others results shu et al 2012 yang et al 2015 for easing the groundwater decline in the ncp by decreasing irrigation however drainage thus groundwater recharge is linked with the amount of irrigation water pumped from the groundwater aquifer and is therefore a weak indicator of future groundwater decline future studies may determine the net water use instead recharge minus irrigation for better insights 5 conclusions this study showed that weather and soil data ranging from low generalised to high spatialised detail were not equally suitable for simulation of regional crop yields soil water drainage and n leaching across an agriculture intensive alluvial region in the ncp higher weather data detail increased the spatial variability of all simulated variables and decreased their median value simulated crop yields 12 7 12 9 mg ha 1 y 1 were closer to the statistical yields 12 mg ha 1 y 1 when using high detail weather and soil input data though the response to data detail was weak soil water drainage and n leaching showed considerably larger uncertainties and higher soil data detail increased their magnitude two to threefold as well as their spatial variability their regional medians and the direction of the spatial distribution were however similar for medium and high detail soil data of respectively 20 6 and 31 2 mm y 1 for drainage and 24 7 and 38 8 kg n ha 1 y 1 for leaching against 3 8 mm y 1 and 10 3 kg n ha 1 y 1 for low detail data consequently if the objective is to explicitly simulate the spatial variation of crop yield drainage and n leaching common global national weather and soil datasets need to be of high detail or supported by field work to better characterise spatial heterogeneity the simulated management scenarios with the high detail weather and soil input data revealed that crop yields could be maintained and n leaching reduced by using region wide incorporation of crop straw an annual n supplement of 300 kg ha 1 and about 25 less irrigation as an alternative to current farming practices the other scenarios involving rainfed maize and spatially targeted winter wheat managements decreased drastically crop yields while drainage and n leaching were minimal drainage in this part of the ncp started to increase only after switching from a maize winter wheat double crop to maize monocrop the study approach is useful for scientists and regional environmental managers in china and elsewhere and for regions with low data quality and quantity it shows the limitations in the use of such data in regional simulation studies the ensemble prediction of soil hydraulic properties appears to be a very promising method for parameterisation of field scale simulation models for
