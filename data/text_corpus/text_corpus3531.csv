17655,aquatic bacterial communities play an important role in biogeochemical cycling in river ecosystems however knowledge of the linkages between bacterial communities and dissolved organic matter dom in urban rivers is limited here 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and parallel factor parafac modeling of excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy were used to analyze the compositions co occurrence patterns and interactions with chromophoric dom cdom of bacterial communities in urban river water samples influenced by different human activities the results revealed that two protein like components accounted for 65 2 9 56 of the total variability in all three fluorescence components which suggests that cdom in urban rivers is mainly a microbial source in addition to ph and do cdom is also an important factor affecting bacterial community structure and the main classes gammaproteobacteria and clostridia and genera limnohabitans and alpinimonas showed strong positive correlations with terrestrial humic like c1 and tryptophan like c2 respectively when autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria coexist in urban rivers the production and degradation of cdom will occur simultaneously furthermore the riverine bacterial co occurrence network had a nonrandom modular structure which was mainly driven by classification correlation and bacterial function the high abundance of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism carbon metabolism and nitrogen metabolism in the urban river indicated that anthropogenic activity may be the dominant selective force altering the bacterial communities overall our results provide a novel view for the assembly of bacterial communities in urban river ecosystems under the influence of different human activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban polluted river bacterial community cdom co occurrence network functional genus 1 introduction human activities have significantly changed the biochemical cycles of n p and other nutrients in aquatic atmospheric and terrestrial ecosystems over past decades resulting in serious ecological problems camargo and alonso 2006 he et al 2011 for example nutrient concentrations in obstructed urban river ecosystems have caused a wide variety of ecological impacts including cyanobacteria outbreaks oxygen depletion and loss of biodiversity dudgeon et al 2006 woodward et al 2012 as an important part of urban river ecosystems the bacterial community plays an important role in biogeochemical processes and nutrient recycling bai et al 2014 battin et al 2009 and is an ideal variable that can be used to monitor the ecological impacts of human activities on the functional characteristics of the river water environment lear et al 2009 due to their responses to even small chemical and physical changes the composition of aquatic bacterial communities may vary spatially in response to environmental changes resulting from human activities paerl et al 2014 schwermer et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 most studies focusing on microbial communities in urban aquatic ecosystems have studied the effects of wastewater from wastewater treatment plants drury et al 2013 roberto et al 2018 rain runoff ibekwe et al 2016 urban landscapes wang et al 2018a or hydropower station construction wang et al 2016 on bacterial communities in urban rivers however the aquatic environment of polluted urban rivers is complex and the bacterial community is affected by a variety of external pollution sources yuan et al 2014 the bacterial community structure and interspecific interactions of urban rivers under the combined effects of industrial agriculture and domestic pollution have been largely ignored the rapid development of metagenomics technology has also brought with it the introduction of many analytical methods to strengthen our comprehension of bacterial communities legendre and gallagher 2001 unfortunately most of these analytical methods focus on only the composition and diversity of bacterial communities hu et al 2018 to characterize the changes in bacterial communities in more circumstantial environments it is important to transcend these basic diversity studies recently co occurrence network analysis has been used to supply important information in addition to sample level comparisons banerjee et al 2016 deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 and has been used as a new tool to explain the interspecific interactions of microbial communities in lakes eiler et al 2012 kara et al 2013 soils berry and widder 2014 ma et al 2016 activated sludge ju et al 2014 and the human gut faust and raes 2012 these findings indicate that microorganism communities usually have nonrandom co occurrence patterns and a modular structure strongly suggesting that biological interactions play an important role in controlling community aggregations hu et al 2017 moreover studies have found that central species play a key role in maintaining the structure and function of bacterial communities sazima et al 2010 however little is known about how different types of human activities affect the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities however studies focusing on only the interspecific interactions of bacterial communities have largely ignored the interactions between bacterial communities and chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom within urban river ecosystems dissolved organic matter dom is of great importance because it is the primary carbon and nutrient source for the metabolic activities of bacterial communities hood et al 2009 2015 simultaneously the bacterial community is a critical biogeochemical reagent for the production conversion and mineralization of dom del giorgio and davis 2003 judd et al 2006 therefore understanding the link between bacterial community composition and dom composition is critical to clarify the cycles of carbon and other elements in river ecosystems in the bulk dom pool cdom is an optically active part of dom which can intensely absorb light in the ultraviolet and blue regions of the spectrum zhang et al 2011 2019 and show significant changes in the quantity and quality of various biogeochemical processes hur et al 2014 unfortunately previous studies on cdom in urban river ecosystems have focused on examining the sources or distribution of cdom callahan et al 2004 chen et al 2004 hong et al 2005 huang and chen 2009 and the interaction between cdom and bacterial communities has not been well explored in this study a typical urban river running through chuzhou city was selected as the model and 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing and parallel factor parafac modeling of excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy were used to study the assembly of bacterial communities and the interactions between bacterial communities and cdom in urban rivers influenced by different types of human interference we hypothesized that the bacterial community closely related to biogeochemical processes is intrinsically linked to the cdom composition in urban rivers furthermore we hypothesized that the bacterial communities in urban rivers have nonrandom co occurrence patterns and potential functional genes under the influence of different pollution sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of sampling sites and sample collection the qingliu river 117 59 118 23 e 30 40 32 13 n fig 1 is a typical urban river in chuzhou city anhui province china with a drainage area of 1252 km2 and a total length of 84 km pan et al 2017 and is the left bank tributary of the chuhe river a first order tributary of the yangtze river according to the 2017 census data the current population of the watershed is 0 99 million people approximately 40 of the land use in the watershed is reservoir grasslands pasture or forest while 40 is classified as residential commercial or industrial and 25 5 is classified as agricultural land use wang 2004 in recent years with the rapid increase in the urban population and artificial pressure on river banks the qingliu river has suffered from serious pollution and eutrophication problems in this study twelve specific sampling points n 3 were selected from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the qingliu river and the sampling points were divided into three different types of pollution sources the steel pipe factory ggw food factory spw textile factory fzw and lighting factory zmw represent industrial pollution sources the wastewater generated by these pollution sources is discharged into river water bodies through pipes vegetable fields scw rice fields sdw pig farms yzw and fish ponds ytw represent agricultural activities the wastewater from these agricultural pollution sources is discharged into river water bodies through agricultural drains schools xxw residential areas jmw hospitals yyw and hotels jdw represent sources of domestic pollution the four sources of domestic pollution are located in the center of the city and sewage is discharged into the river water body through pipes the residential area covers an area of 2 5 km2 and has a permanent population of 4900 people schools and hospitals are densely populated and the discharged wastewater contains a large amount of chemicals and drugs sampling was carried out in may 2019 surface water samples were manually collected using a plexiglass instrument at a depth of 20 cm all sampling sites were 10 m from shore three subsamples were randomly obtained at 3 m intervals from each sampling site a multiparameter water quality sonde ysi 6600v2 usa was used to measure dissolved oxygen do water temperature t and ph at each site during sampling water samples were stockpiled in sterile polyethylene bottles and transported to the laboratory within 10 h and conserved at 20 c before any further processing then 300 400 ml subsamples of each water sample were filtered through a 0 2 Î¼m filter membrane and stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction fuhrman 2009 woodhouse et al 2016 2 2 monitoring of environmental parameters chemical analyses ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod of the water samples were measured in the laboratory according to standard methods jin and tu 1990 2 3 cdom fluorescence measurements water samples were filtered using a pre burned whatman gf f filter 0 7 Î¼m porosity burning at 450 c for 4 h passed through a prewashed 0 22 Î¼m millipore membrane cellulose filter at low pressure and injected into a pre burned burned at 450 c for 4 h and acid cleaned glass bottle fluorescence measurements of cdom samples were performed at room temperature using an f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan and a 700 voltage xenon lamp the excitation ex scan range was 200 450 nm 5 nm interval and the emission em scan range was 250 600 nm 1 nm interval the excitation emission matrix eem scanning speed was 2400 nm min 1 water raman scatter peaks were removed by subtracting the eem from the milli q water blank rayleigh scatter effects were calibrated by interpolation using the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 use the absorption spectrum obtained from a shimadzu uv 2450pc spectrophotometer matched 5 cm quartz cuvette and milli q water as a reference to correct for the effects of the internal filter on the eem measurements mcknight et al 2001 zhang et al 2010 2019 more information on cdom absorption measurements can be found in zhou et al 2016 all eems were calibrated to the water raman signals excitation 350 nm and then the data were normalized to raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 before further analysis data gathered at excitation wavelengths lower than 230 nm and emission wavelengths lower than 300 nm and higher than 550 nm were omitted to eliminate the effects of the worsening signal to noise ratio the dreem toolbox version 0 2 0 was used for parafac analysis modeling in matlab r2015b murphy et al 2013 the dreem toolbox uses the parafac algorithm from the n way toolbox andersson and bro 2000 the data set was divided into six random data set halves three calibration three validation and each half develop four to six ingredient models resulting in three s4c6t3 verification tests murphy et al 2013 through the split half procedure random initialization analysis and residual analysis andersson and bro 2000 murphy et al 2013 the three ingredient model was well verified and it was found that the model was sufficient to represent the entire eem data array 2 4 dna extraction and pcr amplification the total dna from the water sample was extracted with a dna extraction kit tiangen dp302 and checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis dna was quantified using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer eppendorf germany dna was stored at 20 c until further processing keshri et al 2018 universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 specific to the v3 to v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were used for pcr amplification pcr was performed in triplicate in 20 ml reactions the pcr protocol was 94 c for 5 min 30 cycles at 94 c for 30 s 54 c

product was then stored at 20 c and transported to majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china for illumina miseq sequencing 2 5 sequencing data optimization and otu clustering we merged the paired end 16s reads trimmed primers and distal bases and used usearch version 7 0 http drive5 com uparse for quality filtering and the removal of singletons edgar 2010 in order to obtain the otu corresponding to the classified information for each species the rdp classifier version 2 2 http sourceforge net projects rdp classifier bayesian algorithm confidence threshold 0 7 was used on 97 of the otu classification using the qiime platform http qime org instal index html samarajeewa et al 2015 for bioinformatic analysis of the community composition in each sample the raw sequencing data have been submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive under the project accession codes srp242043 srp242041 and srp241744 2 6 statistical analyses combining the otus and the three cdom components a network was constructed to clarify the correlation between the cdom fluorescence components and the bacterial community the r package imisc pair was used to calculate the spearman rank coefficient p between the relative abundance of the otus exceeding 20 occurrence and the ratio of cdom components of the samples otus with significant p 0 05 and robust p 0 6 correlations were selected subsequently gephi is used to analyze network visualization and modularity http gephi github io gephi determined the average path length the average number of steps along the shortest path for all possible network node pairs and the topological properties of each node including betweenness centrality number of shortest paths through nodes and degree number of adjacent edges in co occurrence networks nodes with low betweenness centrality values and high degrees were defined as keystone species berry and widder 2014 which is similar to central species used in other studies ma et al 2016 the size of each node is directly proportional to the relative abundance of the bacterial community 1og n 1 picrust software was used to predict the functional gene and metabolic pathways of the bacterial communities langille et al 2013 the online analysis platform https cloud majorbio com provides specific steps for the analysis the relationship between microbial community composition and environmental factors was explained through the redundancy analysis rda function of the vegan package using r language oksanen et al 2018 spearman correlation between the percentage of three fluorescent components and the relative abundance of bacterial communities was performed using r 3 5 1 3 results 3 1 alpha diversity and composition of bacterial communities in our study 36 water samples from the qingliu river were analyzed by illumina high throughput sequencing and 818 208 high quality sequences were obtained with an average read length of approximately 418 bp of these after the clustering and alignment of 36 water samples 33 586 otus were obtained according to the standard of 0 97 similarity the coverage of each sample was higher than 0 97 table s1 which indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient and that some rare species were included all of the rarefaction curves reached saturation levels and the sequencing depth was sufficient to cover the entire bacterial diversity fig s1 a the chao 1 index indicated that the bacterial richness of the industrially polluted water samples was higher than that of the agriculturally and domestically polluted water samples fig s1 b while the shannon diversity index of bacterial communities in the domestically polluted water samples was higher than that in the industrially and agriculturally polluted water samples fig s1 c a total of 16 major bacterial phyla were detected in water samples collected at different locations fig s2 the bacterial community was dominated by proteobacteria 41 8 of the reads specifically gammaproteobacteria 15 1 of the reads alphaproteobacteria 13 9 of the reads and betaproteobacteria 11 14 of the reads followed by firmicutes 16 9 of the reads actinobacteria 15 2 of the reads bacteroidetes 11 46 of the reads and cyanobacteria 7 12 of the reads fig s2 when contrasting the relative abundance of specific genera of bacteria at different sampling points most genera showed significant differences the genera exiguobacterium and chryseobacterium were enriched in the domestically polluted water samples especially in the hotel jdw 46 81 and residential area jmw 36 5 samples respectively in the industrially polluted water samples the genera acinetobacter limnohabitans and synechococcus had a high relative abundance especially in steel pipe plant ggw 65 5 food plant spw 15 03 and textile mill fzw 23 6 samples respectively nevertheless the genera flavobacterium brevundimonas and acinetobacter were the dominant genera in the agriculturally polluted water samples fig 2 the water chemical parameters including ph t do tn tp and nh4 n are listed in table s2 the concentration of nh4 n differed in water samples of different pollution types the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in agricultural and domestic polluted water samples was generally higher than that in industrial polluted water samples and the highest concentration was observed in the pig farm yzw samples 1 99 0 29 mg l the same phenomenon was observed for tn concentration and the highest was observed in yzw 3 30 0 03 mg l 3 2 cdom characteristics in urban rivers parafac modeling can identify and verify three fluorescent components fig 3 the spectral characteristics of these three components were matched with the online spectral library openfluor and the results showed that cl had an excitation maximum of 250 nm and an emission maximum of 420 nm these samples were described as humic of terrestrial origin enriched with fulvic acids that are often linked to anthropogenic activities coble 1996 graeber et al 2012 stedmon et al 2011 yamashita et al 2010 the components c2 230 285 348 nm and c3 275 316 nm were classified as protein like tryptophan like fluorophores related to amino acids and were presumably derived from plankton and therefore related to autochthonous production stedmon et al 2007 2011 terrestrial humic like c1 represented 34 1 9 9 mean sd of the cdom fluorescence in the urban river samples as measured by fluorescence especially in the yzw samples 49 6 0 09 fig s4 the two protein like components c2 and c3 accounted for a combined total of 65 2 9 56 of the three components the percentages of tryptophan like c2 were higher in school xxw samples than in the other samples 3 3 relationship between bacterial groups and cdom composition in urban rivers spearman correlation between the percentage of the three fluorescent components and the relative abundance of bacterial communities in urban river samples indicated that negativicutes was significantly positively correlated with c1 c2 and c3 fig 4 epsilonproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and clostridia were clustered together and had a significant positive correlation with c2 p 0 05 the abundant genera candidatus rhodoluna alpinimonas limnohabitans and polynucleobacter showed a strong relationship with c1 p 0 01 fig 4 the genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas exhibited a significant positive correlation with c2 p 0 05 c3 had a significant positive relationship with only acidovorax p 0 05 the genera norank c cyanobacteria mycobacterium norank f mng7 hgcl clade synechococcus cl500 29 marine group and deinococcus were clustered together and were significantly negatively correlated with c2 p 0 05 fig 4 the correlation between the environmental variables and otu reads was determined by rda at different spatial levels industrially agriculturally and domestically polluted water samples in domestically polluted water samples the six main factors affecting the bacterial community composition were ph tp tn nh4 n do and c1 in industrially polluted water samples ph and c2 were the dominant factors affecting the bacterial community composition in agriculturally polluted water samples do c2 and c3 were the key factors fig 5 3 4 co occurrence network analysis based on the correlation between spearman s otus and three fluorescent components a co occurrence network was constructed to further assess the interactivity with bacterial communities according to the analysis results 3047 edges were captured among 288 nodes that described significant correlations between species r 0 6 p 0 05 fig 6 and the positive correlation was much higher than the negative correlation the values of the average path length network diameter clustering coefficient and modularity were higher than those in the erdos renyi random network table s4 indicating that there was a modular structure and small world topology in the network the nodes in the network were divided into 7 bacterial phyla in the network among them proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes accounted for 83 71 of all nodes and they were also the dominant bacterial phyla in the community composition keystone species play a unique role in correcting microbial community interactions and functions i e species with high degree 50 and low betweenness centrality 500 values in co occurrence networks in our study the genus limnohabitans and the families alcaligenaceae and methylophilaceae were identified as keystone taxa when the node distribution was modularized all nodes were mainly divided into six modules each module consisted of a set of otu nodes and the interconnections among these nodes were more frequent than the nodes in other modules the otus from module i primarily belonged to proteobacteria and acidobacteria and tended to appear in xxw and yzw the otus from module â± primarily belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and had a high relative abundance in spw and lighting plants zmw module vi included betaproteobacteria clostridia and actinobacteria which were associated with humic like c1 gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria bacilli and flavobacteriia were clustered with the tryptophan like c3 components in module â² fig 6 b 3 5 prediction of bacterial metabolism function picrust analysis showed that the genes related to energy production and conversion coenzyme transport and metabolism carbohydrate transport and metabolism amino acid transport and metabolism secondary metabolite biosynthesis and transport and catabolism were the main categories of the urban river water samples fig s5 the metabolic genes and pathways related to carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling and heterogeneous biodegradation metabolism were studied table s3 according to the genome kegg enzyme profiles in this study major functional genes associated with c n p and s cycling were identified in urban river water samples all water samples were rich in c cycle genes such as alpha amylase and isocitrate lyase which are related to starch decomposition and the decomposition of aromatic substances respectively some functional genes were associated with c fixation such as phosphoribulokinase and propionyl coa carboxylase the main functional genes of the n cycle were mainly related to denitrification nitrification and assimilation such as nitric oxide reductase nitrite reductase and nitrate reductase table s3 according to the kegg pathway profiles in the water samples the abundance of heterologous biodegradable genes was highest in the industrially polluted water samples indicating increased industrial emissions in urban rivers as the key mediator of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah biodegradation genes related to ethylbenzene and aminobenzoate were the most abundant of the various xenobiotic degradation genes in all samples moreover the degradation genes encoding cytochrome p450 enzymes that play an important role in hydrocarbon biodegradation alhawash et al 2018 li et al 2001 were also observed in drug metabolism cytochrome p450 was found in high abundance in the rice fields sdw fish pond ytw and food factory spw samples table s3 4 discussion 4 1 differences in bacterial communities under different pollution sources in this study the primary bacterial phyla in urban rivers were proteobacteria 41 8 of the reads firmicutes 16 9 of the reads actinobacteria 15 2 of the reads bacteroidetes 11 46 of the reads and cyanobacteria 7 12 of the reads fig s2 further research found that at the genus level the genera with elevated abundance in the industrially polluted water samples included acinetobacter 65 5 and synechococcus 23 6 fig 2 the genus acinetobacter can be used to determine the biotoxicity of heavy metal polluted wastewater samples such as waters polluted by lead and cadmium abd el haleem et al 2006 the genus synechococcus can degrade some new organic compounds as a source of nitrogen and phosphorus ma and jiao 2004 the relative advantages of these two genera in the textile mill fzw and steel pipe plant ggw samples may reflect increased levels of organic pollutants and metal ions emitted by textile mills and steel pipe mills this result is supported by the observation of more organic degradation genes in ggw and fzw table s3 compared with industrially polluted water samples the taxa with a high abundance in the domestically polluted water samples can degrade organic matter the genus exiguobacterium is an important source of hydrolase production such as proteases that catalyze the hydrolysis of proteins into small peptides and amino acids kasana and pandey 2018 rajaei et al 2014 the genus chryseobacterium is active in organic rich environments and plays an important role in the degradation of carbohydrates bernardet et al 2006 the sewage discharged from the residential quarters and hotels into the river contained a large amount of organic matter and protein such as cooking oil and food residues wang et al 2018b this result indicates that these pollutants are an important factor driving the enrichment of these genera in the residential area jmw and hotel jdw samples these results indicated that different types of pollution may select different bacterial species which leads to different spatial distributions of the bacterial community 4 2 roles of microbes in shaping urban river cdom the cdom in the qingliu river water samples was mainly composed of protein like tryptophan like fluorophores which are associated with microbial processes hur and cho 2012 song et al 2019 this result coincides with the fact that the relative abundance of protein like substances in urban river samples was higher than the relative abundance of terrestrial humic like substances fig s4 the terrestrial humic like substances in urban rivers may be derived from land plant debris and soil and the molecular characteristics of dom from terrestrial sources have been reported in other river ecosystems jaffÃ© et al 2014 in addition the modification of protein like substances by microorganisms may produce humus like substances in rivers thus increasing the ratio of humus like substances and reducing the ratio of protein like substances similar changes have been found in incubation experiments of ice samples from the antarctic region and tibetan plateau smith et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 therefore when autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria coexist in a river ecosystem the production and degradation of cdom may occur simultaneously 4 3 the interactions between bacterial composition and cdom components our research shows that different cdom optical components are potentially important drivers of the bacterial community composition in urban rivers the rda results showed that the terrestrial humic like c1 and tryptophan like c2 and c3 were significantly related to the spatial changes in bacterial communities and c1 and c2 could be used to interpret the high variations in the percentages in the industrially agriculturally and domestically polluted water samples fig 5 this result is similar to the results of previous studies of temperate lakes suggesting that humus like components can affect bacterial communities jones et al 2009 sometimes only briefly haukka et al 2005 the difference in the correlation between the percentage of each fluorescent component and the relative abundance of the bacterial community at the class and genus levels may mirror the different preferences of the bacterial community for different cdom components fig 4 our research found that the genera limnohabitans and polynucleobacter were significantly positively correlated with terrestrial humic like c1 fig 4 which was consistent with previous research showing that limnohabitans and polynucleobacter tended to prefer terrestrial humus in aquatic environments isaac 2015 steinberg 2014 gammaproteobacteria specifically the genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas in gammaproteobacteria were significantly related to the tryptophan like c2 probably because they are able to break down protein like substances hagen 1966 sun et al 2018 4 4 co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities in urban rivers network analysis can identify the interactions between bacterial communities and screen key indicator taxa berry and widder 2014 to explore the nonrandom community assembly of bacteria under different types of pollution a network boundary was built to display the topological and taxonomic characteristics of the co occurrence pattern of microorganisms fig 6 in this study the genus limnohabitans and the families alcaligenaceae and methylophilaceae were considered central taxa due to their low betweenness centrality values 500 and high degrees 50 the genus limnohabitans exists in various freshwater ecosystems and participates in the oxidation of s and n compounds luo et al 2018 the family methylophilaceae plays a main role in the degradation of naphthalene dong et al 2019 the family alcaligenaceae has excellent metabolic activity in fresh water and is able to use multiple compounds in wwtps sharuddin et al 2017 therefore these keystone taxa may play a pivotal role in the c n and s cycles in an urban river ecosystem considering the network results some members of gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria bacilli and flavobacteriia primarily disintegrated or produced tryptophan like dom in contrast humic like dom was primarily degraded or produced by some members of betaproteobacteria clostridia and actinobacteria the co occurrence model was explored to provide a deeper understanding of microbial interactions consistent with the results of previous studies barberÃ¡n et al 2012 horner devine et al 2007 our study showed that in rivers affected by anthropogenic impacts the co occurrence trend in microorganisms was less than expected by chance that is they showed species isolation the modular structure could be used to divide the entire network into six main modules and the different modules executed different functions newman 2003 in the network of module i industrial pollution and agricultural pollution become dominant and some bacteria were involved in the n cycle and metal oxidation for example the family coriobacteriaceae which was dominant in ggw fig s3 plays an important role in nitrate reduction noguchi et al 2014 the genus rhodobacter is capable of mn oxidation brÃ¤uer et al 2011 the genus devosia can completely convert don in feedstuff into a main product 3 epi don and a secondary product 3 keto don zhao et al 2016 in addition these bacteria were mainly enriched in the ggw and pig farm yzw samples suggesting that metal and n elements contained in steel pipe plant and pig farm wastewater were the key factors driving the assembly and co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities the taxonomic units in module â± were mainly related to nitrification and denitrification and these members were mainly enriched in food plant spw and lighting plant zmw samples fig s3 the family microbacteriaceae can reduce nitrate to nitrite and is related to the oxidation reaction of the same substrate used under aerobic conditions they are all very effective denitrifying agents vaz moreira et al 2008 the family burkholderiaceae plays an important role in nitrification peura et al 2015 there is no doubt that the nitrate and nitric acid contained in the wastewater discharged from food factories and lighting factories were the key factors driving these bacteria therefore the co occurrence patterns observed in the different locations corresponded to the different types of pollution which revealed the impact of environmental filtration and niche differentiation on microbial communities li et al 2019 4 5 functional characteristics of bacterial communities in urban rivers the geochemistry cycles of c n p and s are significant in the functioning of sustainable ecosystems and the abundance of genes related to their metabolism promotes the nutrient cycles in urban rivers some studies have suggested that there is a certain correlation between the abundance of xenobiotic degradation genes and the biodegradation rate of xenobiotic genes kansole and lin 2016 pagÃ© et al 2015 and that biodegradable genes serve as indicators of the presence of xenobiotics and their metabolites in addition an increase in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs degrading bacteria was observed in industrially polluted water samples such as the genus mycobacterium fig 2 the genus mycobacterium can mineralize some refractory pah compounds with low water solubility and low bioavailability jazestani and prasher 2011 the enrichment of mycobacterium in the fzw samples may indicate an increased discharge of pahs from the textile industry moreover genes related to drug and antimicrobial metabolism were found in the water samples table s3 indicating that antimicrobial agents and pharmaceuticals might be included in agricultural sewage antimicrobials exert selective pressure and may thus favor the emergence and spread of resistance among indigenous bacteria by horizontal gene transfer baquero et al 2008 cattoir et al 2008 which could further transfer it to susceptible allochthonous and possibly pathogenic bacteria mazel and davies 1999 previous studies have reported that important functional genes related to the c cycle involve carbon degradation and fixation and methane production and oxidation cong et al 2015 in the urban river water samples the total abundance of c cycle genes showed differences table s3 c bioavailability is an important factor affecting the growth and metabolism of aquatic bacteria berggren et al 2009 phosphoribulokinase is a major enzyme in the autotrophic bacterial community which is helpful for the absorption of co by autotrophic bacteria marsden and codd 1984 in our study this enzyme was detected in a large number of water samples from urban rivers table s3 in addition denitrification genes e g nitrate reductase and nitric oxide reductase were found in this study but anammox genes were rarely found which implied that in terms of nitrate and nitrite removal in rivers denitrification had the highest contribution in general the picrust algorithm determined the predicted functions of the bacterial community providing a general overview of the functional potential within the community however rarefaction of pooled dna samples failed to capture the full extent of the diversity present within the system which was likely reflected in the predicted functional profile roberto et al 2018 to fully evaluate the gene categories deeper sequencing is needed fierer et al 2012 picrust neither replaces nor goes beyond deep metagenomic sequencing langille et al 2013 overall our research provides new insights into the spatial distribution co occurrence patterns and interactions with cdom of bacterial communities in urban rivers under the influence of different human activities however the interpretation of these results must be approached with caution changes in microbial composition have been found to be related to seasonal changes in the physicochemical properties of water duarte et al 2016 moss et al 2006 yannarell et al 2003 alterations in river temperature light penetration and organic and inorganic concentrations in the water body over the annual period may result in the change observed in the community composition of aquatic bacteria in the river systems furthermore the complexities of the microbial ecological networks were found to be highest during the normal water season and lowest during the wet season kara et al 2013 ma et al 2016 indicating that microbial co occurrence relationships change with the hydrological seasons to comprehensively evaluate the distribution and co occurrence patterns of aquatic bacterial communities in urban rivers at the spatial and temporal scales future research will require sampling over multiple seasonal scales or time series 5 conclusion we investigated the cdom optical properties bacterial community composition and functional gene diversity in urban river water samples experiencing different types of pollution and performed network analysis to reveal the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities and their interaction with cdom in urban river environments our results showed that different human activities had a great impact on the aquatic bacterial community structure in an urban river the main protein like components were closely related to the microbial sources and protein like and terrestrial humus like cdom played different roles in shaping the bacterial community structure in the urban river furthermore the occurrence of nonrandom co occurrence and ecological function driven modular patterns provides a new perspective on the microbial assembly of urban rivers with different types of pollution our results deepen our understanding of the carbon and microbial cycles in urban rivers and future work will require biological incubation experiments to expound the precise mechanism of the interaction between dom and aquatic bacterial communities seasonal scales or time series sampling should be considered to better characterize the dynamic modes in bacterial assemblies under different

17655,aquatic bacterial communities play an important role in biogeochemical cycling in river ecosystems however knowledge of the linkages between bacterial communities and dissolved organic matter dom in urban rivers is limited here 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and parallel factor parafac modeling of excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy were used to analyze the compositions co occurrence patterns and interactions with chromophoric dom cdom of bacterial communities in urban river water samples influenced by different human activities the results revealed that two protein like components accounted for 65 2 9 56 of the total variability in all three fluorescence components which suggests that cdom in urban rivers is mainly a microbial source in addition to ph and do cdom is also an important factor affecting bacterial community structure and the main classes gammaproteobacteria and clostridia and genera limnohabitans and alpinimonas showed strong positive correlations with terrestrial humic like c1 and tryptophan like c2 respectively when autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria coexist in urban rivers the production and degradation of cdom will occur simultaneously furthermore the riverine bacterial co occurrence network had a nonrandom modular structure which was mainly driven by classification correlation and bacterial function the high abundance of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism carbon metabolism and nitrogen metabolism in the urban river indicated that anthropogenic activity may be the dominant selective force altering the bacterial communities overall our results provide a novel view for the assembly of bacterial communities in urban river ecosystems under the influence of different human activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban polluted river bacterial community cdom co occurrence network functional genus 1 introduction human activities have significantly changed the biochemical cycles of n p and other nutrients in aquatic atmospheric and terrestrial ecosystems over past decades resulting in serious ecological problems camargo and alonso 2006 he et al 2011 for example nutrient concentrations in obstructed urban river ecosystems have caused a wide variety of ecological impacts including cyanobacteria outbreaks oxygen depletion and loss of biodiversity dudgeon et al 2006 woodward et al 2012 as an important part of urban river ecosystems the bacterial community plays an important role in biogeochemical processes and nutrient recycling bai et al 2014 battin et al 2009 and is an ideal variable that can be used to monitor the ecological impacts of human activities on the functional characteristics of the river water environment lear et al 2009 due to their responses to even small chemical and physical changes the composition of aquatic bacterial communities may vary spatially in response to environmental changes resulting from human activities paerl et al 2014 schwermer et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 most studies focusing on microbial communities in urban aquatic ecosystems have studied the effects of wastewater from wastewater treatment plants drury et al 2013 roberto et al 2018 rain runoff ibekwe et al 2016 urban landscapes wang et al 2018a or hydropower station construction wang et al 2016 on bacterial communities in urban rivers however the aquatic environment of polluted urban rivers is complex and the bacterial community is affected by a variety of external pollution sources yuan et al 2014 the bacterial community structure and interspecific interactions of urban rivers under the combined effects of industrial agriculture and domestic pollution have been largely ignored the rapid development of metagenomics technology has also brought with it the introduction of many analytical methods to strengthen our comprehension of bacterial communities legendre and gallagher 2001 unfortunately most of these analytical methods focus on only the composition and diversity of bacterial communities hu et al 2018 to characterize the changes in bacterial communities in more circumstantial environments it is important to transcend these basic diversity studies recently co occurrence network analysis has been used to supply important information in addition to sample level comparisons banerjee et al 2016 deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 and has been used as a new tool to explain the interspecific interactions of microbial communities in lakes eiler et al 2012 kara et al 2013 soils berry and widder 2014 ma et al 2016 activated sludge ju et al 2014 and the human gut faust and raes 2012 these findings indicate that microorganism communities usually have nonrandom co occurrence patterns and a modular structure strongly suggesting that biological interactions play an important role in controlling community aggregations hu et al 2017 moreover studies have found that central species play a key role in maintaining the structure and function of bacterial communities sazima et al 2010 however little is known about how different types of human activities affect the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities however studies focusing on only the interspecific interactions of bacterial communities have largely ignored the interactions between bacterial communities and chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom within urban river ecosystems dissolved organic matter dom is of great importance because it is the primary carbon and nutrient source for the metabolic activities of bacterial communities hood et al 2009 2015 simultaneously the bacterial community is a critical biogeochemical reagent for the production conversion and mineralization of dom del giorgio and davis 2003 judd et al 2006 therefore understanding the link between bacterial community composition and dom composition is critical to clarify the cycles of carbon and other elements in river ecosystems in the bulk dom pool cdom is an optically active part of dom which can intensely absorb light in the ultraviolet and blue regions of the spectrum zhang et al 2011 2019 and show significant changes in the quantity and quality of various biogeochemical processes hur et al 2014 unfortunately previous studies on cdom in urban river ecosystems have focused on examining the sources or distribution of cdom callahan et al 2004 chen et al 2004 hong et al 2005 huang and chen 2009 and the interaction between cdom and bacterial communities has not been well explored in this study a typical urban river running through chuzhou city was selected as the model and 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing and parallel factor parafac modeling of excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy were used to study the assembly of bacterial communities and the interactions between bacterial communities and cdom in urban rivers influenced by different types of human interference we hypothesized that the bacterial community closely related to biogeochemical processes is intrinsically linked to the cdom composition in urban rivers furthermore we hypothesized that the bacterial communities in urban rivers have nonrandom co occurrence patterns and potential functional genes under the influence of different pollution sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of sampling sites and sample collection the qingliu river 117 59 118 23 e 30 40 32 13 n fig 1 is a typical urban river in chuzhou city anhui province china with a drainage area of 1252 km2 and a total length of 84 km pan et al 2017 and is the left bank tributary of the chuhe river a first order tributary of the yangtze river according to the 2017 census data the current population of the watershed is 0 99 million people approximately 40 of the land use in the watershed is reservoir grasslands pasture or forest while 40 is classified as residential commercial or industrial and 25 5 is classified as agricultural land use wang 2004 in recent years with the rapid increase in the urban population and artificial pressure on river banks the qingliu river has suffered from serious pollution and eutrophication problems in this study twelve specific sampling points n 3 were selected from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the qingliu river and the sampling points were divided into three different types of pollution sources the steel pipe factory ggw food factory spw textile factory fzw and lighting factory zmw represent industrial pollution sources the wastewater generated by these pollution sources is discharged into river water bodies through pipes vegetable fields scw rice fields sdw pig farms yzw and fish ponds ytw represent agricultural activities the wastewater from these agricultural pollution sources is discharged into river water bodies through agricultural drains schools xxw residential areas jmw hospitals yyw and hotels jdw represent sources of domestic pollution the four sources of domestic pollution are located in the center of the city and sewage is discharged into the river water body through pipes the residential area covers an area of 2 5 km2 and has a permanent population of 4900 people schools and hospitals are densely populated and the discharged wastewater contains a large amount of chemicals and drugs sampling was carried out in may 2019 surface water samples were manually collected using a plexiglass instrument at a depth of 20 cm all sampling sites were 10 m from shore three subsamples were randomly obtained at 3 m intervals from each sampling site a multiparameter water quality sonde ysi 6600v2 usa was used to measure dissolved oxygen do water temperature t and ph at each site during sampling water samples were stockpiled in sterile polyethylene bottles and transported to the laboratory within 10 h and conserved at 20 c before any further processing then 300 400 ml subsamples of each water sample were filtered through a 0 2 Î¼m filter membrane and stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction fuhrman 2009 woodhouse et al 2016 2 2 monitoring of environmental parameters chemical analyses ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod of the water samples were measured in the laboratory according to standard methods jin and tu 1990 2 3 cdom fluorescence measurements water samples were filtered using a pre burned

min 1 water raman scatter peaks were removed by subtracting the eem from the milli q water blank rayleigh scatter effects were calibrated by interpolation using the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 use the absorption spectrum obtained from a shimadzu uv 2450pc spectrophotometer matched 5 cm quartz cuvette and milli q water as a reference to correct for the effects of the internal filter on the eem measurements mcknight et al 2001 zhang et al 2010 2019 more information on cdom absorption measurements can be found in zhou et al 2016 all eems were calibrated to the water raman signals excitation 350 nm and then the data were normalized to raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 before further analysis data gathered at excitation wavelengths lower than 230 nm and emission wavelengths lower than 300 nm and higher than 550 nm were omitted to eliminate the effects of the worsening signal to noise ratio the dreem toolbox version 0 2 0 was used for parafac analysis modeling in matlab r2015b murphy et al 2013 the dreem toolbox uses the parafac algorithm from the n way toolbox andersson and bro 2000 the data set was divided into six random data set halves three calibration three validation and each half develop four to six ingredient models resulting in three s4c6t3 verification tests murphy et al 2013 through the split half procedure random initialization analysis and residual analysis andersson and bro 2000 murphy et al 2013 the three ingredient model was well verified and it was found that the model was sufficient to represent the entire eem data array 2 4 dna extraction and pcr amplification the total dna from the water sample was extracted with a dna extraction kit tiangen dp302 and checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis dna was quantified using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer eppendorf germany dna was stored at 20 c until further processing keshri et al 2018 universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 specific to the

product was then stored at 20 c and transported to majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china for illumina miseq sequencing 2 5 sequencing data optimization and otu clustering we merged the paired end 16s reads trimmed primers and distal bases and used usearch version 7 0 http drive5 com uparse for quality filtering and the removal of singletons edgar 2010 in order to obtain the otu corresponding to the classified information for each species the rdp classifier version 2 2 http sourceforge net projects rdp classifier bayesian algorithm confidence threshold 0 7 was used on 97 of the otu classification using the qiime platform http qime org instal index html samarajeewa et al 2015 for bioinformatic analysis of the community composition in each sample the raw sequencing data have been submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive under the project accession codes srp242043 srp242041 and srp241744 2 6 statistical analyses combining the otus and the three cdom components a network was constructed to clarify the correlation between the cdom fluorescence components and the bacterial community the r package imisc pair was used to calculate the spearman rank coefficient p between the relative abundance of the otus exceeding 20 occurrence and the ratio of cdom components of the samples otus with significant p 0 05 and robust p 0 6 correlations were selected subsequently gephi is used to analyze network visualization and modularity http gephi github io gephi determined the average path length the average number of steps along the shortest path for all possible network node pairs and the topological properties of each node including betweenness centrality number of shortest paths through nodes and degree number of adjacent edges in co occurrence networks nodes with low betweenness centrality values and high degrees were defined as keystone species berry and widder 2014 which is similar to central species used in other studies ma et al 2016 the size of each node is directly proportional to the relative abundance of the bacterial community 1og n 1 picrust software was used to predict the functional gene and metabolic pathways of the bacterial communities langille et al 2013 the online analysis platform https cloud majorbio com provides specific steps for the analysis the relationship between microbial community composition and environmental factors was explained through the redundancy analysis rda function of the vegan package using r language oksanen et al 2018 spearman correlation between the percentage of three fluorescent components and the relative abundance of bacterial communities was performed using r 3 5 1 3 results 3 1 alpha diversity and composition of bacterial communities in our study 36 water samples from the qingliu river were analyzed by illumina high throughput sequencing and 818 208 high quality sequences were obtained with an average read length of approximately 418 bp of these after the clustering and alignment of 36 water samples 33 586 otus were obtained according to the standard of 0 97 similarity the coverage of each sample was higher than 0 97 table s1 which indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient and that some rare species were included all of the rarefaction curves reached saturation levels and the sequencing depth was sufficient to cover the entire bacterial diversity fig s1 a the chao 1 index indicated that the bacterial richness of the industrially polluted water samples was higher than that of the agriculturally and domestically polluted water samples fig s1 b while the shannon diversity index of bacterial communities in the domestically polluted water samples was higher than that in the industrially and agriculturally polluted water samples fig s1 c a total of 16 major bacterial phyla were detected in water samples collected at different locations fig s2 the bacterial community was dominated by proteobacteria 41 8 of the reads specifically gammaproteobacteria 15 1 of the reads alphaproteobacteria 13 9 of the reads and betaproteobacteria 11 14 of the reads followed by firmicutes 16 9 of the reads actinobacteria 15 2 of the reads bacteroidetes 11 46 of the reads and cyanobacteria 7 12 of the reads fig s2 when contrasting the relative abundance of specific genera of bacteria at different sampling points most genera showed significant differences the genera exiguobacterium and chryseobacterium were enriched in the domestically polluted water samples especially in the hotel jdw 46 81 and residential area jmw 36 5 samples respectively in the industrially polluted water samples the genera acinetobacter limnohabitans and synechococcus had a high relative abundance especially in steel pipe plant ggw 65 5 food plant spw 15 03 and textile mill fzw 23 6 samples respectively nevertheless the genera flavobacterium brevundimonas and acinetobacter were the dominant genera in the agriculturally polluted water samples fig 2 the water chemical parameters including ph t do tn tp and nh4 n are listed in table s2 the concentration of nh4 n differed in water samples of different pollution types the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in agricultural and domestic polluted water samples was generally higher than that in industrial polluted water samples and the highest concentration was observed in the pig farm yzw samples 1 99 0 29 mg l the same phenomenon was observed for tn concentration and the highest was observed in yzw 3 30 0 03 mg l 3 2 cdom characteristics in urban rivers parafac modeling can identify and verify three fluorescent components fig 3 the spectral characteristics of these three components were matched with the online spectral library openfluor and the results showed that cl had an excitation maximum of 250 nm and an emission maximum of 420 nm these samples were described as humic of terrestrial origin enriched with fulvic acids that are often linked to anthropogenic activities coble 1996 graeber et al 2012 stedmon et al 2011 yamashita et al 2010 the components c2 230 285 348 nm and c3 275 316 nm were classified as protein like tryptophan like fluorophores related to amino acids and were presumably derived from plankton and therefore related to autochthonous production stedmon et al 2007 2011 terrestrial humic like c1 represented 34 1 9 9 mean sd of the cdom fluorescence in the urban river samples as measured by fluorescence especially in the yzw samples 49 6 0 09 fig s4 the two protein like components c2 and c3 accounted for a combined total of 65 2 9 56 of the three components the percentages of tryptophan like c2 were higher in school xxw samples than in the other samples 3 3 relationship between bacterial groups and cdom composition in urban rivers spearman correlation between the percentage of the three fluorescent components and the relative abundance of bacterial communities in urban river samples indicated that negativicutes was significantly positively correlated with c1 c2 and c3 fig 4 epsilonproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and clostridia were clustered together and had a significant positive correlation with c2 p 0 05 the abundant genera candidatus rhodoluna alpinimonas limnohabitans and polynucleobacter showed a strong relationship with c1 p 0 01 fig 4 the genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas exhibited a significant positive correlation with c2 p 0 05 c3 had a significant positive relationship with only acidovorax p 0 05 the genera norank c cyanobacteria mycobacterium norank f mng7 hgcl clade synechococcus cl500 29 marine group and deinococcus were clustered together and were significantly negatively correlated with c2 p 0 05 fig 4 the correlation between the environmental variables and otu reads was determined by rda at different spatial levels industrially agriculturally and domestically polluted water samples in domestically polluted water samples the six main factors affecting the bacterial community composition were ph tp tn nh4 n do and c1 in industrially polluted water samples ph and c2 were the dominant factors affecting the bacterial community composition in agriculturally polluted water samples do c2 and c3 were the key factors fig 5 3 4 co occurrence network analysis based on the correlation between spearman s otus and three fluorescent components a co occurrence network was constructed to further assess the interactivity with bacterial communities according to the analysis results 3047 edges were captured among 288 nodes that described significant correlations between species r 0 6 p 0 05 fig 6 and the positive correlation was much higher than the negative correlation the values of the average path length network diameter clustering coefficient and modularity were higher than those in the erdos renyi random network table s4 indicating that there was a modular structure and small world topology in the network the nodes in the network were divided into 7 bacterial phyla in the network among them proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes accounted for 83 71 of all nodes and they were also the dominant bacterial phyla in the community composition keystone species play a unique role in correcting microbial community interactions and functions i e species with high degree 50 and low betweenness centrality 500 values in co occurrence networks in our study the genus limnohabitans and the families alcaligenaceae and methylophilaceae were identified as keystone taxa when the node distribution was modularized all nodes were mainly divided into six modules each module consisted of a set of otu nodes and the interconnections among these nodes were more frequent than the nodes in other modules the otus from module i primarily belonged to proteobacteria and acidobacteria and tended to appear in xxw and yzw the otus from module â± primarily belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and had a high relative abundance in spw and lighting plants zmw module vi included betaproteobacteria clostridia and actinobacteria which were associated with humic like c1 gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria bacilli and flavobacteriia were clustered with the tryptophan like c3 components in module â² fig 6 b 3 5 prediction of bacterial metabolism function picrust analysis showed that the genes related to energy production and conversion coenzyme transport and metabolism carbohydrate transport and metabolism amino acid transport and metabolism secondary metabolite biosynthesis and transport and catabolism were the main categories of the urban river water samples fig s5 the metabolic genes and pathways related to carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling and heterogeneous biodegradation metabolism were studied table s3 according to the genome kegg enzyme profiles in this study major functional genes associated with c n p and s cycling were identified in urban river water samples all water samples were rich in c cycle genes such as alpha amylase and isocitrate lyase which are related to starch decomposition and the decomposition of aromatic substances respectively some functional genes were associated with c fixation such as phosphoribulokinase and propionyl coa carboxylase the main functional genes of the n cycle were mainly related to denitrification nitrification and assimilation such as nitric oxide reductase nitrite reductase and nitrate reductase table s3 according to the kegg pathway profiles in the water samples the abundance of heterologous biodegradable genes was highest in the industrially polluted water samples indicating increased industrial emissions in urban rivers as the key mediator of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah biodegradation genes related to ethylbenzene and aminobenzoate were the most abundant of the various xenobiotic degradation genes in all samples moreover the degradation genes encoding cytochrome p450 enzymes that play an important role in hydrocarbon biodegradation alhawash et al 2018 li et al 2001 were also observed in drug metabolism cytochrome p450 was found in high abundance in the rice fields sdw fish pond ytw and food factory spw samples table s3 4 discussion 4 1 differences in bacterial communities under different pollution sources in this study the primary bacterial phyla in urban rivers were proteobacteria 41 8 of the reads firmicutes 16 9 of the reads actinobacteria 15 2 of the reads bacteroidetes 11 46 of the reads and cyanobacteria 7 12 of the reads fig s2 further research found that at the genus level the genera with elevated abundance in the industrially polluted water samples included acinetobacter 65 5 and synechococcus 23 6 fig 2 the genus acinetobacter can be used to determine the biotoxicity of heavy metal polluted wastewater samples such as waters polluted by lead and cadmium abd el haleem et al 2006 the genus synechococcus can degrade some new organic compounds as a source of nitrogen and phosphorus ma and jiao 2004 the relative advantages of these two genera in the textile mill fzw and steel pipe plant ggw samples may reflect increased levels of organic pollutants and metal ions emitted by textile mills and steel pipe mills this result is supported by the observation of more organic degradation genes in ggw and fzw table s3 compared with industrially polluted water samples the taxa with a high abundance in the domestically polluted water samples can degrade organic matter the genus exiguobacterium is an important source of hydrolase production such as proteases that catalyze the hydrolysis of proteins into small peptides and amino acids kasana and pandey 2018 rajaei et al 2014 the genus chryseobacterium is active in organic rich environments and plays an important role in the degradation of carbohydrates bernardet et al 2006 the sewage discharged from the residential quarters and hotels into the river contained a large amount of organic matter and protein such as cooking oil and food residues wang et al 2018b this result indicates that these pollutants are an important factor driving the enrichment of these genera in the residential area jmw and hotel jdw samples these results indicated that different types of pollution may select different bacterial species which leads to different spatial distributions of the bacterial community 4 2 roles of microbes in shaping urban river cdom the cdom in the qingliu river water samples was mainly composed of protein like tryptophan like fluorophores which are associated with microbial processes hur and cho 2012 song et al 2019 this result coincides with the fact that the relative abundance of protein like substances in urban river samples was higher than the relative abundance of terrestrial humic like substances fig s4 the terrestrial humic like substances in urban rivers may be derived from land plant debris and soil and the molecular characteristics of dom from terrestrial sources have been reported in other river ecosystems jaffÃ© et al 2014 in addition the modification of protein like substances by microorganisms may produce humus like substances in rivers thus increasing the ratio of humus like substances and reducing the ratio of protein like substances similar changes have been found in incubation experiments of ice samples from the antarctic region and tibetan plateau smith et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 therefore when autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria coexist in a river ecosystem the production and degradation of cdom may occur simultaneously 4 3 the interactions between bacterial composition and cdom components our research shows that different cdom optical components are potentially important drivers of the bacterial community composition in urban rivers the rda results showed that the terrestrial humic like c1 and tryptophan like c2 and c3 were significantly related to the spatial changes in bacterial communities and c1 and c2 could be used to interpret the high variations in the percentages in the industrially agriculturally and domestically polluted water samples fig 5 this result is similar to the results of previous studies of temperate lakes suggesting that humus like components can affect bacterial communities jones et al 2009 sometimes only briefly haukka et al 2005 the difference in the correlation between the percentage of each fluorescent component and the relative abundance of the bacterial community at the class and genus levels may mirror the different preferences of the bacterial community for different cdom components fig 4 our research found that the genera limnohabitans and polynucleobacter were significantly positively correlated with terrestrial humic like c1 fig 4 which was consistent with previous research showing that limnohabitans and polynucleobacter tended to prefer terrestrial humus in aquatic environments isaac 2015 steinberg 2014 gammaproteobacteria specifically the genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas in gammaproteobacteria were significantly related to the tryptophan like c2 probably because they are able to break down protein like substances hagen 1966 sun et al 2018 4 4 co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities in urban rivers network analysis can identify the interactions between bacterial communities and screen key indicator taxa berry and widder 2014 to explore the nonrandom community assembly of bacteria under different types of pollution a network boundary was built to display the topological and taxonomic characteristics of the co occurrence pattern of microorganisms fig 6 in this study the genus limnohabitans and the families alcaligenaceae and methylophilaceae were considered central taxa due to their low betweenness centrality values 500 and high degrees 50 the genus limnohabitans exists in various freshwater ecosystems and participates in the oxidation of s and n compounds luo et al 2018 the family methylophilaceae plays a main role in the degradation of naphthalene dong et al 2019 the family alcaligenaceae has excellent metabolic activity in fresh water and is able to use multiple compounds in wwtps sharuddin et al 2017 therefore these keystone taxa may play a pivotal role in the c n and s cycles in an urban river ecosystem considering the network results some members of gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria bacilli and flavobacteriia primarily disintegrated or produced tryptophan like dom in contrast humic like dom was primarily degraded or produced by some members of betaproteobacteria clostridia and actinobacteria the co occurrence model was explored to provide a deeper understanding of microbial interactions consistent with the results of previous studies barberÃ¡n et al 2012 horner devine et al 2007 our study showed that in rivers affected by anthropogenic impacts the co occurrence trend in microorganisms was less than expected by chance that is they showed species isolation the modular structure could be used to divide the entire network into six main modules and the different modules executed different functions newman 2003 in the network of module i industrial pollution and agricultural pollution become dominant and some bacteria were involved in the n cycle and metal oxidation for example the family coriobacteriaceae which was dominant in ggw fig s3 plays an important role in nitrate reduction noguchi et al 2014 the genus rhodobacter is capable of mn oxidation brÃ¤uer et al 2011 the genus devosia can completely convert don in feedstuff into a main product 3 epi don and a secondary product 3 keto don zhao et al 2016 in addition these bacteria were mainly enriched in the ggw and pig farm yzw samples suggesting that metal and n elements contained in steel pipe plant and pig farm wastewater were the key factors driving the assembly and co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities the taxonomic units in module â± were mainly related to nitrification and denitrification and these members were mainly enriched in food plant spw and lighting plant zmw samples fig s3 the family microbacteriaceae can reduce nitrate to nitrite and is related to the oxidation reaction of the same substrate used under aerobic conditions they are all very effective denitrifying agents vaz moreira et al 2008 the family burkholderiaceae plays an important role in nitrification peura et al 2015 there is no doubt that the nitrate and nitric acid contained in the wastewater discharged from food factories and lighting factories were the key factors driving these bacteria therefore the co occurrence patterns observed in the different locations corresponded to the different types of pollution which revealed the impact of environmental filtration and niche differentiation on microbial communities li et al 2019 4 5 functional characteristics of bacterial communities in urban rivers the geochemistry cycles of c n p and s are significant in the functioning of sustainable ecosystems and the abundance of genes related to their metabolism promotes the nutrient cycles in urban rivers some studies have suggested that there is a certain correlation between the abundance of xenobiotic degradation genes and the biodegradation rate of xenobiotic genes kansole and lin 2016 pagÃ© et al 2015 and that biodegradable genes serve as indicators of the presence of xenobiotics and their metabolites in addition an increase in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs degrading bacteria was observed in industrially polluted water samples such as the genus mycobacterium fig 2 the genus mycobacterium can mineralize some refractory pah compounds with low water solubility and low bioavailability jazestani and prasher 2011 the enrichment of mycobacterium in the fzw samples may indicate an increased discharge of pahs from the textile industry moreover genes related to drug and antimicrobial metabolism were found in the water samples table s3 indicating that antimicrobial agents and pharmaceuticals might be included in agricultural sewage antimicrobials exert selective pressure and may thus favor the emergence and spread of resistance among indigenous bacteria by horizontal gene transfer baquero et al 2008 cattoir et al 2008 which could further transfer it to susceptible allochthonous and possibly pathogenic bacteria mazel and davies 1999 previous studies have reported that important functional genes related to the c cycle involve carbon degradation and fixation and methane production and oxidation cong et al 2015 in the urban river water samples the total abundance of c cycle genes showed differences table s3 c bioavailability is an important factor affecting the growth and metabolism of aquatic bacteria berggren et al 2009 phosphoribulokinase is a major enzyme in the autotrophic bacterial community which is helpful for the absorption of co by autotrophic bacteria marsden and codd 1984 in our study this enzyme was detected in a large number of water samples from urban rivers table s3 in addition denitrification genes e g nitrate reductase and nitric oxide reductase were found in this study but anammox genes were rarely found which implied that in terms of nitrate and nitrite removal in rivers denitrification had the highest contribution in general the picrust algorithm determined the predicted functions of the bacterial community providing a general overview of the functional potential within the community however rarefaction of pooled dna samples failed to capture the full extent of the diversity present within the system which was likely reflected in the predicted functional profile roberto et al 2018 to fully evaluate the gene categories deeper sequencing is needed fierer et al 2012 picrust neither replaces nor goes beyond deep metagenomic sequencing langille et al 2013 overall our research provides new insights into the spatial distribution co occurrence patterns and interactions with cdom of bacterial communities in urban rivers under the influence of different human activities however the interpretation of these results must be approached with caution changes in microbial composition have been found to be related to seasonal changes in the physicochemical properties of water duarte et al 2016 moss et al 2006 yannarell et al 2003 alterations in river temperature light penetration and organic and inorganic concentrations in the water body over the annual period may result in the change observed in the community composition of aquatic bacteria in the river systems furthermore the complexities of the microbial ecological networks were found to be highest during the normal water season and lowest during the wet season kara et al 2013 ma et al 2016 indicating that microbial co occurrence relationships change with the hydrological seasons to comprehensively evaluate the distribution and co occurrence patterns of aquatic bacterial communities in urban rivers at the spatial and temporal scales future research will require sampling over multiple seasonal scales or time series 5 conclusion we investigated the cdom optical properties bacterial community composition and functional gene diversity in urban river water samples experiencing different types of pollution and performed network analysis to reveal the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities and their interaction with cdom in urban river environments our results showed that different human activities had a great impact on the aquatic bacterial community structure in an urban river the main protein like components were closely related to the microbial sources and protein like and terrestrial humus like cdom played different roles in shaping the bacterial community structure in the urban river furthermore the occurrence of nonrandom co occurrence and ecological function driven modular patterns provides a new perspective on the microbial assembly of urban rivers with different types of pollution our results deepen our understanding of the carbon and microbial cycles in urban rivers and future work will require biological incubation experiments to expound the precise mechanism of the interaction between dom and aquatic bacterial communities seasonal scales or time series sampling should be considered to better characterize the dynamic modes in bacterial assemblies under different

17656,wildfire could alter both the quantity and composition of terrestrial organic matter exported into source water and water treatability of fire impacted dissolved organic matter dom could be different from its unburned counterpart currently there is no standard protocol to treat wildfire impacted source water to identify the best treatment practices in handling post fire runoffs we conducted a systematic controlled study using leachates of unburned white fir abies concolor and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and black and white ashes collected immediately and one year after the 2013 rim fire california to evaluate coagulation and oxidation strategies for controlling disinfection byproducts dbps formation results showed that the efficiency of alum coagulation in removing dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire alum coagulation was less effectiveness in removing dom and dbp precursors in ash leachates compared to litter leachates this may be attributed to the loss of side chains and the decrease of dom molecular weight during the wildfire thus inducing lower removal efficiency of the dom and dbp precursors during the alum coagulation considering use of brominated flame retardants by firefighters the addition of bromide br 100 Î¼g l greatly increased the formation of haloacetonitriles by chlorine and this increase was relatively lower in ash leachates the influence of reaction time and ph on dom reactivity was similar among the leachates of litter and ash samples our results show that alum coagulation followed by chloramination at alkaline ph is an effective strategy for reducing post fire dbp formation in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords

optimized to reduce dbp formation to reduce the regulated carbonaceous dbps such as thms and haas drinking water facilities have been increasingly shifting from chlorination to chloramination in the us potentially increasing the formation of n dbps which have greater health risks as compared to the regulated dbps bond et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 bromide br is oxidized by chlorine chloramine to bromine species hobr obr resulting in the shift of chlorinated dbps to brominated ones with significantly higher health risks hansen et al 2012 hua and reckhow 2012 sharma et al 2014 the increase in br level was reported in laboratory studies using water extracts of wildfire ash wang et al 2015 and field studies using water intakes from the burned watershed uzun et al 2020 such increases could be caused by a widespread use of brominated flame retardants by firefighters zhang et al 2016 whereas atmospheric deposition seawater intrusion could be another reason for their presence in coastal forest ecosystems with close proximity to ocean chow et al 2007 however the influence of the presence of br coupled with wildfire induced dom on source water safety has not been thoroughly studied and emphasized overall limited studies have evaluated the influence of wildfire induced dom on the water treatment process emelko et al 2011 writer et al 2014 an investigation on the influence of operational conditions on removing fire derived dom and dbp precursors will benefit water treatment professionals during post fire periods systematic studies examining the removal of wildfire impacted dom and dbp precursors via alum coagulation and subsequent dbp formation under typical distribution conditions with different oxidation strategies i e chlorination vs chloramination oxidant contact time and water ph are limited in the literature currently there are no standard protocols for treating wildfire impacted source water to identify the best treatment practices in handling post fire runoffs we conducted a systematic investigation by using leachates of unburned and burned samples from the 2013 rim fire immediately and one year after the wildfire event the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the effectiveness of alum coagulation in the removal of dom and dbp precursors from leachates of litters versus wildfire ashes 2 determine the effect of br presence on dbp speciation and formation in fire impacted treated waters and 3 examine the effects of different operational factors i e oxidant type chlorination vs chloramination reaction time 12 24 and 72 h and water ph 6 5 7

and methods 2 1 sample collections rim fire august 17 september 6 2013 one of the largest fires in california history consumed about 1050 km2 of forest consisting primarily of mixed conifers i e incense cedar calocedrus decurrens ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and white fir abies concolor the details on the fire incidence can be found in wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 to test the effect of high intensity burning on the reactivity of dom and precursors of dbps we collected the composite samples of black ash b1 and white ash w1 visually determined from burned areas site 1 in fig s1 and fir and pine from adjacent unburned areas on october 2 2013 no rainfall was recorded between fire incidence and the sample collection date another set of black ash b2 and white ash w2 samples was collected at the same burned sites site 1 in fig s1 on august 5 2014 after cumulative precipitation of 617 mm http www cnrfc noaa gov arc search php we observed the total mortality of vegetation and total o horizon consumption at site 1 and estimated the burn severity of 3 high severity and 97 moderate severity at this site based on white vs black ash distribution the ash depth was generally 5 cm thick with the white ash samples somewhat thicker than the black ash samples wang et al 2015 we used a stainless steel hand shovel to separate and collect the surficial ash from the underlying soil considering the spatial variability the composite sample consisted of three subsamples collected within a 10 m radius detritus from unburned sites dominated by ponderosa pine or white fir were collected from a forest located about 2 km north of the northern most burned area sampling site site 1 in fig s1 near cherry lake see supporting information the black and white ash samples were visually identified in the field and were considered as two end members recognizing that the landscape level ash layer displayed great short range spatial variability in both horizontal and vertical dimensions bodi et al 2014 white ash is usually generated at higher burning temperature with more aromatic compounds compared to black ash bodÃ­ et al 2014 ku et al 2018 pereira et al 2012 and total ash content consisted of 90 and 10 black and white ashes after the rim fire respectively to eliminate moisture and microbial survival the composite samples were air dried immediately after collection at room temperature 22 1 c until constant weight was reached samples were then ground and passed through a 2 mm screen and stored in sealed jars under a ventilated and dry indoor environment 2 2 leachate and treatability around 120 l of rainwater was collected at anderson south carolina in glass containers between march and may 2017 filtered with 0 45 Î¼m pre washed filters supor polyethersulfone membrane immediately and stored at 4 c before the leaching tests after the preliminary experiments we soaked 5 06 5 06 57 31 545 and 1212 g of sieved fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 in 23 l collected rainwater respectively by shaking at 30 rpm for 24 h and filtered via 0 7 Î¼m glass microfiber filters whatman 934 ah the doc concentrations in the raw leachates were diluted to 8 60 1 16 mg l for the alum coagulation 9 03 8 86 7 57 7 8 10 6 and 7 72 mg l for fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 respectively to determine the optimum alum dose mg l the preliminary treatability tests were conducted on

determined for the litter ash leachates according to their doc removal trends fig s1 after the optimum alum coagulation the doc concentrations in the treated leachates of fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 were 5 12 5 09 5 05 5 32 8 46 and 6 61 mg l respectively 2 3 chemical analyses all the filtered water samples were analyzed by a shimadzu toc vchs analyzer to determine the concentrations of doc and dissolved total nitrogen dtn the levels of nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n and br were determined by dionex ics 2100 thermo fisher scientific ma following the us environmental protection agency epa method 300 while phosphate po4 3 and ammonia nh4 n concentrations were detected by hach test kit using us epa phosver 3 asorbic acid method and salicylate method respectively uzun 2016 table s1 the don

after analysis by 3d spectrofluorometry rf5301 shimadzu japan for the fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem we divided the peak area under the emission wavelengths em of 435 480 nm by the peak area under em 300 345 nm at the excitation wavelength ex 254 nm to calculate the humification index hix ohno 2002 the fluorescence index fi as a ratio of fluorescence intensity at em 470 nm 520 nm at ex 370 nm was used to differentiate the dom origins i e terrestrial 1 2 or microbial origins 1 8 cory and mcknight 2005 using fluorescence regional integration based on simpson s rule eem was operationally divided into five regions i tyrosine like proteins ii tryptophan like proteins iii fulvic acid like organics iv soluble microbial byproducts and v humic acid like organics chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 the fluorescence response in region i pi n was obtained by dividing the area normalized volume in region i with that in all five regions the dbp formation potential fp test was carried at ph 7 5 and 22 1 c for 72 h using excess amounts of chlorine cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh4 10 krasner et al 2004 or pre formed monochloramine nh2cl 100 mg l and cl2 n 4 on the leachates of fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 before and after alum coagulation removal of fps was calculated by using the following formula craw ctreated craw 100 where craw and ctreated were the formed dbp concentrations before and after the alum coagulation to mimic the dbp formation under typical us water distribution conditions the uniform formation conditions ufc test was performed at 22 1 c using a relatively lower amount of oxidants uzun et al 2019 which were determined by preliminary tests for keeping certain amounts of residual oxidants 1 5 0 25 mg l cl2 or 2 5 0 5 mg l nh2cl in each sample after 72 h of incubation time the ufc tests were conducted on treated leachates of fir pine b1 and w1 after alum coagulation under the conditions of 1 regular ufc test reaction time 24 h at ph 7 5 2 formation kinetic tests reaction time 12 24 and 72 h at ph 7 5 and 3 ph effect tests reaction time 24 h at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 the doc concentrations in the treated leachates of b2 and w2 were diluted to 4 92 and 5 02 mg l using the rainwater for the ufc tests in addition we ran replicate samples without and with the addition of br in the fp and ufc tests to determine the changes in the levels of formed dbps by increasing bromide br by 100 Î¼g l we quantified volatile dbps including four thms six hans and chloral hydrate chd c2h3cl3o2 and non volatile dbps including nine haas following us epa methods 551 1 i

monochloroacetic caa c2h3clo2 dichloroacetic dcaa c2h2cl2o2 and trichloroacetic tcaa c2hcl3o2 acids in the category of haas and 3 dibromo dban c2hbr2n bromochloro bcan c2hbrcln bromo ban c2h2brn chloro can c2h2cln dichloro dcan c2hcl2n and trichloro tcan c2cl3n acetonitriles in the category of hans 3 results and discussion 3 1 fire reduced dissolved organic matter treatability by alum coagulation we measured the general water quality before and after the fire and found that the yields mg g material of po4 3 nh4 n and dtn followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire table s2 specifically we observed that the br yields in the leachates of ash were higher than in the leachates of litter which were consistent with the findings of our previous study wang et al 2015 the yields mg g material and removal percentages of doc and don followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire table 1 the wildfire reduced the amount of exported doc per gram of materials through the combustion of organic rich soil horizons and vegetation mass wang et al 2015 increases in the amounts of sediments doc and don in source water from burned watersheds were commonly observed in previous studies emelko et al 2011 writer et al 2014 this result can be explained by the fact that forest biomass soil especially o horizon which can filter dom from water ramos et al 2018 and act as a sink for organic compounds khan et al 2015 is combusted almost completely during wildfires chow et al 2019 resulting in the export of a large amount of sediments and dom to downstream waters emelko et al 2011 the doc exported from ash was further reduced one year after the fires possibly due to soil leaching and surface runoff during the post fire rainfall events wang et al 2016 our recent study uzun et al 2020 on the 2015 wragg fire found significant decreases in doc concentrations in stream water from the burned watershed during the second post fire rain season relative to the initial flashes we concluded that more mobile doc generated by fire through consumption of a large amount of litter vegetation is quickly flushed 1 year from a burned watershed during the post fire rainy season the positively charged al species are efficient when dom is dominated by negatively charged functional groups because organic compounds with negatively charged functional groups e g phenolic and carboxylic can be neutralized by the hydrolysis products of alum i e al oh 2 and al oh 2 resulting in the decrease of their solubility and the promotion of their precipitation sillanpaa et al 2018 during the fire those functional groups as the side chains were sheared with the enrichment of poly aromatic structures alexis et al 2010 gonzalez perez et al 2004 kaal and rumpel 2009 therefore the lower removal percentages in the ash leachates immediately after the fire compared to litter leachates possibly resulted from the loss of negatively charged side chains during the fire the doc don ratios before alum coagulation with the order of litters ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire indicates that fire resulted in the relative accumulation of organic nitrogen in dom which was further enhanced one year after the fire the lower doc don ratio from ash leachates is consistent with the findings of previous laboratory wang et al 2015 and field hohner et al 2016 uzun et al 2020 studies suva254 decreased after alum coagulation indicating the decrease in dom aromaticity karanfil et al 2002 in general high suva254 value 4 l mg c m indicates the relative high faction of hydrophobic dom whereas low suva254 value 2 3 l mg c m suggests the high fraction of hydrophilic dom the removal percentage of suva254 by alum coagulation followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire table 1 this result suggests that the fire produced ash materials contain more hydrophobic dom with lower removal performance during alum coagulation due to the loss of side chains writer et al 2014 the changes of suva254 before and immediately after a fire could be related to fire severity relative to the reference the suva254 in water intakes in the first rainy reason from the burned watershed was not significant in the rocky fire but 31 17 higher in the wragg fire with relatively high severity estimated to be medium severity uzun et al 2020 wang et al 2015 found the suva254 in water extracts followed the order of white ash high burn severity unburned detritus black ash low burn severity due to the less soluble aromatic fraction in black ash after the loss of oh and or cooh groups the hix positively correlated with the humification degree higher hix more humified materials fellman et al 2010 lavonen et al 2015 decreased for fir pine and w1 but increased for b1 b2 and w2 after alum coagulation alum coagulation was effective in removing the humified fraction indicated by hix in litter other than ash leachates the e2 e3 ratio inversely correlated to dom molecular weight mw wang et al 2009 was higher in raw ash leachates relative to raw litter leachates indicating dom after the fire with lower mw hohner et al 2016 this ratio increased except b2 after alum coagulation suggesting that compounds with high molecular weight hmw were preferred as the alum targets writer et al 2014 with a slight variety 22 9 1 92 on removal percentage by alum coagulation fi increased with the order of litter 1 40 1 42 ash immediately after the fire 1 73 1 77 ash one year after the fire 1 84 2 08 indicating the increasing ratio of microbial to terrestrial originated compounds in dom we observed the increase of tyrosine like proteins region i 133 47 4 tryptophan like proteins region ii 31 9 28 0 soluble microbial byproducts region iv 76 6 53 8 and the decrease of fulvic acid like region iii 31 9 46 4 and humic acid like region v 28 9 42 3 organics in litter leachates after alum coagulation suggesting the preferable removal of fulvic humic acid like organics by alum coagulation sanchez et al 2013 yang et al 2015 differently the results showed relatively small changes in the five fluorescence components of ash leachates 18 1 14 1 except tyrosine like proteins region i in b1 247 and w2 24 7 during alum coagulation mainly due to the alternation of chemical structures by high intensity fire 3 2 fire reduced the removal of dbp precursors during alum coagulation the dbp precursor yields Î¼g g material in the leachates of ash immediately after the fire were one order of magnitude lower than those in the litter leachates but higher than those in the leachates of ash one year after the fire for all the studied dbp categories except chd using chloramine no chd formed in pine b1 or w1 fig 1 and table s3 for example the thm yield Î¼g g material using chlorine was 4 135 3 614 227 408 27 and 9 in fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 respectively this result indicates that dbp precursors in the litter were eliminated by the high intensity fire which were further reduced via the biogeochemical processes such as soil erosion during the one year after the fire the consumption of organic matter through the burning in wildland fires wang et al 2015 contributed significantly to the reduction of dbp fps the yields Î¼g g material of all the studied dbp categories were positively related to both doc mg g material and don mg g material table s4 indicating doc and don as the simple and rapid surrogates for the dbp levels in samples related to fire xue et al 2014 our previous study wang et al 2016 also found a decrease in doc and dbp fps in water extracts of wildfire ash with an increase in the amount of sequential leaching additionally the dbp precursor yields using chlorine were higher for thms haas and chd but lower for han compared to those using chloramine this result is consistent with the traditional view that chlorine produces more c and o dbps but fewer n dbps compared to chloramine chuang et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 compared to litter leachates the alum coagulation was less effective for ash leachates in reducing both dbp fps Î¼g g material except for haa fps by chloramine and specific dbp fps sdbp fp Î¼g mg doc except for han by chloramine and haa for example the removal percentages for thm fps by chlorine were 74 2 72 2 41 8 37 0 36 5 and 11 5 in fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 respectively the lower removal percentage for sdbp fps in ash leachates was because that the loss of side chains alexis et al 2010 sillanpaa et al 2018 and the decrease of dom mw hohner et al 2016 writer et al 2014 by the high intensity fire induced dbp precursors more recalcitrant during alum coagulation writer et al 2014 reported the lower efficiency of alum coagulation in reducing organic matter with hill slope sediments and charred materials deposited in the river after the 2012 high park wildfire colorado especially following the first post fire flash thunderstorms hohner et al 2019 found a poor performance of alum coagulation in removing turbidity and doc from leachates of heated surface soil and litter samples by a laboratory furnace even at high coagulation doses possibly due to the reduction of dom mw moreover the increases of doc don and turbidity especially during the first postfire year were widely reported in water intakes from burned watersheds bladon et al 2008 hohner et al 2016 uzun et al 2020 which increases the water utility challenges emelko et al 2011 more efficient techniques or strategies in removing doc and don and dbp precursors will be needed in post fire drinking water facilities interestingly the removal percentages for specific han fps shan fps Î¼g mg doc by chloramine followed the order of ash one year after the fire litter ash immediately after the fire indicating the increase of shan fps one year after the fire in addition before alum coagulation the leachates of ash immediately and one year after the fire had lower doc don ratio and higher dom reactivity in forming hans compared to litter leachates our previous study wang et al 2015 also found the increase of shan fps Î¼g mg doc using chlorine with the order of water extracts from control unburned black ash and white ash due to the decrease of c n ratio and the shift of organic nitrogen from amide peptide to heteroaromatic forms 3 3 fire reduced the increase of han fp by the addition of 100 Î¼g l br compared to other dbp species the level of hans formed by chlorine increased greatly after the addition of 100 Î¼g l br because hans had much higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than regulated thms and haas muellner et al 2007 the significant increase of hans in drinking water will cause potential health risks adding 100 Î¼g l br increased the concentration of hans in both raw and treated leachates and a greater increase in treated leachates was observed compared to raw leachates using chlorine on the leachates of fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 han fps Î¼m g material increased from 0 17 to 0 72 0 17 to 0 69 0 02 to 0 09 0 04 to 0 17 0 01 to 0 01 and 0 01 to 0 01 in raw leachates and from 0 04 to 0 74 0 03 to 0 65 0 01 to 0 07 0 02 to 0 12 0 01 to 0 01 and 0 01 to 0 01 in treated leachates after the alum coagulation fig 2 and table s5 the increase in the levels of hans by adding 100 Î¼g l br was primarily due to the increase of bcan the relatively higher changes in treated leachates 50 0 1 833 compared to raw leachates 47 4 452 suggest dom fractions in treated leachates as more active bcan precursors in the presence of br moreover after alum coagulation the percentage changes achieved by adding 100 Î¼g l br were greater in treated litter leachates of fir from 0 04 to 0 74 Î¼m g material 1 579 and pine from 0 03 to 0 65 Î¼m g material 1 833 compared to treated ash leachates of b1 512 w1 424 b2 300 and w2 50 0 possibly due to the differences in doc don ratio and dom optical properties this result suggests that the increase of han levels by adding 100 Î¼g l br on treated leachates was mitigated to some extents by the thermal burning in fire the changes achieved by adding 100 Î¼g l br were not great for hans using chloramine and other dbp categories though studies liu et al 2018 sun et al 2009 reported the increase of thm and haa yields with the initial br concentration during chlorination our study observed relatively low changes in thms 37 0 7 26 and haas 17 4 21 7 using chlorine compared to those in hans previous studies chu et al 2011 roccaro et al 2013 reported that dhans including dcan c2hcl2n bcan c2hbrcln and dban c2hbr2n were readily incorporated into bromine to form brominated dbps obolensky and singer 2005 used 160 sample records from five wtps using free chlorine in the us and found that dhans had relatively higher bromine incorporation compared to thms and dhaas including dcaa bcaa and dbaa our previous study ersan et al 2019 also found that bromine substitution factor bsf followed the order of dhans haas thms the influence of the increase by 100 Î¼g l br on chd fp was slight with the changes of 19 8 25 9 using chlorine and no chd formed in pine b1 and w1 using chloramine notably even though the changes in the levels of formed hans achieved by adding 100 Î¼g l br were great their yields were still lower compared to those of formed thms for example by adding 100 Î¼g l br the yields Î¼g g material from the raw leachate of fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 changed from 9 22 4 135 to 8 73 3 690 for thms and from 0 25 19 8 to 0 97 83 7 for hans when using chlorine table s6 3 4 adding 100 Î¼g l br changed the speciation of thms and hans br could present in wildfire affected forest ecosystems due to the widespread use of brominated flame retardants by firefighters zhang et al 2016 and in coastal forest ecosystems due to close proximity to ocean and atmospheric deposition seawater intrusion chow et al 2007 the addition of 100 Î¼g l br in either litter or ash leachates changed the speciation of thms and hans fig 3 with increases in bsf fig s2 the addition of br shifted dbp categories to brominated species due to the higher reactivity of bromine species hobr obr compared to that of chlorine species for thms tcm chcl3 was dominated before adding br with the relative percentage of 76 0 100 using chlorine and 66 7 100 using chloramine except w2 after adding br the percentages of dcmb chbrcl2 increased from 0 19 2 to 2 96 31 2 using chlorine and from 0 to 9 00 except w2 to 11 7 52 3 using chloramine while dbcm chbr2cl had a relatively high percentage of 12 2 26 3 using chloramine for hans dcan c2hcl2n was dominated before adding br with 63 3 94 3 using chlorine except w2 and 68 6 100 using chloramine after adding br bcan c2hbrcln with 59 1 94 0 was dominated using chlorine though dcan with 47 0 93 8 was still the major species using chloramine the percentages of bcan c2hbrcln increased from 0 28 1 to 4 71 51 5 after adding br dhans were readily incorporated into bromine to form brominated dbps chu et al 2011 roccaro et al 2013 and their speciation shifted from dcan to bcan and then to dban with the increase of br concentration bond et al 2011 interestingly we observed the high percentage of 85 1 and 72 7 using chlorine and 27 0 and 28 1 using chloramine in formed bcan in both raw and treated w2 leachates possibly due to the high br concentrations of 231 Î¼g l in the raw and treated w2 leachates before adding 100 Î¼g l br table s2 moreover before adding 100 Î¼g l br relatively high bsf values for thms haas and hans were observed in the w2 leachate compared to other leachates 3 5 chloramination at alkaline ph as an option to control post fire dbp formation the fp test employs a high disinfectant dose and long reaction time to estimate the potency of water in forming dbps which maximizes dbp formation the simulated distribution system sds uses the site specific conditions of the distribution system and can accurately represent dbp formation in a specific distribution system however the sds test is greatly influenced by the conditions of a distribution system such as detention time ph seasonal temperature and limits the comparisons of performances among utilities in formation and speciation of dbps summers et al 1996 based on a comprehensive survey summers et al 1996 developed the ufc test which represents the average distribution system conditions in the us thus ufc test was selected and employed to examine dbp formation and speciation in this study an increase in ph including 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 resulted in a significant decrease in dom reactivity Î¼g mg doc in forming thms by chloramine haas and hans in both litter and ash leachates fig 4 and table s7 this tendency in dom reactivity with ph was not significantly different among the leachates of litter and ash samples relative to ph 6 5 the levels of formed thms using chloramine were 60 8 94 1 at ph 7 5 and 28 0 64 8 at ph 8 5 this decrease possibly resulted from the decreased hydrolysis rate of chloramine to free chlorine doederer et al 2014 yang et al 2007 the levels of formed hans and haas also decreased with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 5 with the ph 8 5 ph 6 5 percentages of 25 1 45 4 and 65 5 95 8 using chlorine and 28 9 51 6 and 43 8 92 3 using chloramine respectively jia et al 2016 reported the decrease of formed hans with increasing ph from 6 to 9 due to the decrease in the yields of tcan and dcan the decrease of hans in our study was mainly due to the decrease of dcan which accounted for 82 2 100 in hans fig s4 yang et al 2007 indicated that dcan undergoes the base catalyzed decomposition and its degradation rate was enhanced by increasing ph conversely the formed thms using chlorine had the ph 7 5 ph 6 5 and ph 8 5 ph 6 5 percentages of 131 175 and 166 230 with the corresponding percentages of 60 8 94 1 and 28 0 64 9 using chloramine respectively studies reported the increase of formed thms with the ph value increasing from 6 5 to 8 5 ye et al 2009 and from 6 to 8 hong et al 2013 due to the alkaline condition favoring the hydrolysis reactions of intermediate dbps to thms additionally there was no chd formed by chloramine and the level of formed chd by chlorine increased to 106 145 at ph 7 5 and 136 171 at ph 8 5 compared to those at ph 6 5 overall using chloramine at alkaline ph facilitates the control of ufc dbp formation during drinking water disinfection for treating wildfire impacted source waters after alum coagulation the dom reactivity of both litter and ash leachates in forming ufc dbps greatly increased with reaction time including 12 24 and 72 h except for hans by chlorine fig 4 and table s7 we did not find obvious different tendencies in dom reactivity among the leachates of litter and ash samples studies hong et al 2013 yang et al 2007 reported the increase of formed dbps with reaction time though the increase rates become slow after a certain time due to the decrease of disinfectants and reactive groups in dom though the percentage on formed thms in 72 h relative to 12 h was 161 196 by chlorine much lower than 311 403 by chloramine we still observed higher dom reactivity of 34 1 47 8 Î¼g mg doc in forming ufc thms by chlorine in 72 h compared to 0 75 1 31 Î¼g mg doc by chloramine similarly sakai et al 2016 found the 4 day 1 day percentage for thms was 150 by chlorine and 420 by chloramine and dom reactivity in forming thms after 4 days by chloramine was lower compared to that by chlorine compared to 12 h the percentage on formed haas in 72 h was 207 602 by chlorine and 134 303 by chloramine there was no chd formed by chloramine with reaction times of 12 and 24 h and dom reactivity in forming chd by chlorine increased with reaction time with the 24 h 12 h and 72 h 12 h percentages of 104 135 and 158 264 respectively differently the levels of formed hans by chlorine increased when reaction time changed from 12 h to 24 h but decreased when reaction time increased from 24 h to 72 h compared to 12 h the percentages of formed hans in 24 h and 72 h were 124 372 and 60 66 by chlorine and 120 374 and 160 663 by chloramine tian et al 2013 also observed that the concentrations of hans decreased using cl2 but increased using nh2cl with reaction time 30 min 24 h and 72 h possibly due to the degradation and or transformation of initially formed hans in the late reaction with chlorine the nitrile carbon in hans could be attacked by hydroxide and hypochlorite to form haloacetamides and haas as primary intermediates and end products reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 similarly with the increase of 100 Î¼g l br we observed the increase of bsf using the ufc tests figs s5 and s6 for example by the increase of 100 Î¼g l br the bsf values increased from 0 5 29 to 0 48 4 at ph 6 5 8 5 and 0 4 21 except 19 2 in hans from pine at 12 h using chloramine to 0 48 2 at 12 72 h after the increase of 100 Î¼g l br the bsf values decreased and increased with reaction time for ufc thms using chlorine and chloramine respectively compared to other conditions including disinfectants and reaction time the bsf values for ufc thms were relatively high at 24 and 72 h but low at 12 h when using chloramine fig s5b indicating chloramine with short reaction time as an option for controlling the ufc thms the bsf values generally decreased with ph for thms and hans using chloramine but increased with ph for hans using chlorine and the lowest bsf values for both ufc thms and hans were observed under the condition of chloramine and ph 8 5 figs s6b and f under both reaction time and water ph conditions figs s5b d f and s6b d f chlorine generated higher bsf values for both haas and hans compared to chloramine in addition the bsf values for hans were lower in the treated leachates of b1 and w1 relative to fire and pine indicating the less brominated hans formed in the ash leachates overall when br exists in the water distribution system chloramine at high ph could represent a viable strategy for controlling the formation of brominated dbp species providing a means to treat wildfire impacted source waters after alum coagulation 4 conclusions this study showed that removal percentages of doc and don by the alum coagulation followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire alum coagulation was less effective in removing doc and don and reducing both dbp fps and dom chlorine chloramine reactivity in ash leachates compared to litter leachates this result was possibly due to the loss of side chains and the decrease of dom mw during the wildfire making the dom and dbp precursors more recalcitrant during alum coagulation therefore more efficient techniques or strategies in removing doc and don and dbp precursors will be needed when drinking water facilities using alum coagulation receive water from watersheds burned by wildfire elevated br levels were frequently reported in water extracts of wildfire ash and downstream waters from burned watersheds possibly due to the wide use of brominated flame retardants and or atmospheric deposition seawater intrusion into coastal forest ecosystems an increase by 100 Î¼g l br in both litter and ash leachates shifted the studied dbps into more brominated species as previously reported and greatly increased the formation of hans by chlorine this increase was relatively lower in ash leachates this result indicates that the increase of hans formation using chlorine by increasing 100 Î¼g l br in treated leachates was mitigated to some extents by wildfire burning using ufc tests we observed that the dom reactivity in forming the studied dbps generally increased with reaction time and decreased with ph in both litter and ash leachates fig 5 suggesting disinfection using chloramine at alkaline ph as an option for controlling the studied dbp in our work the influence of reaction time and ph in dom reactivity was similar among the leachates of litter and ash samples chloramination at alkaline ph produced relatively low brominated dbp species in the treated leachates of both litter fir and pine and ash b1 and w1 after the increase of 100 Î¼g l br as quantified by the bsf values fig 5 overall chloramination at alkaline ph is an effective strategy and regulatory compliance for controlling

17656,wildfire could alter both the quantity and composition of terrestrial organic matter exported into source water and water treatability of fire impacted dissolved organic matter dom could be different from its unburned counterpart currently there is no standard protocol to treat wildfire impacted source water to identify the best treatment practices in handling post fire runoffs we conducted a systematic controlled study using leachates of unburned white fir abies concolor and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and black and white ashes collected immediately and one year after the 2013 rim fire california to evaluate coagulation and oxidation strategies for controlling disinfection byproducts dbps formation results showed that the efficiency of alum coagulation in removing dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire alum coagulation was less effectiveness in removing dom and dbp precursors in ash leachates compared to litter leachates this may be attributed to the loss of side chains and the decrease of dom molecular weight during the wildfire thus inducing lower removal efficiency of the dom and dbp precursors during the alum coagulation considering use of brominated flame retardants by firefighters the addition of bromide br 100 Î¼g l greatly increased the formation of haloacetonitriles by chlorine and this increase was relatively lower in ash leachates the influence of reaction time and ph on dom reactivity was similar among the leachates of litter and ash samples our results show that alum coagulation followed by chloramination at alkaline ph is an effective strategy for reducing post fire dbp formation in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords

bromine species hobr obr resulting in the shift of chlorinated dbps to brominated ones with significantly higher health risks hansen et al 2012 hua and reckhow 2012 sharma et al 2014 the increase in br level was reported in laboratory studies using water extracts of wildfire ash wang et al 2015 and field studies using water intakes from the burned watershed uzun et al 2020 such increases could be caused by a widespread use of brominated flame retardants by firefighters zhang et al 2016 whereas atmospheric deposition seawater intrusion could be another reason for their presence in coastal forest ecosystems with close proximity to ocean chow et al 2007 however the influence of the presence of br coupled with wildfire induced dom on source water safety has not been thoroughly studied and emphasized overall limited studies have evaluated the influence of wildfire induced dom on the water treatment process emelko et al 2011 writer et al 2014 an investigation on the influence of

runoffs we conducted a systematic investigation by using leachates of unburned and burned samples from the 2013 rim fire immediately and one year after the wildfire event the objectives of this study

incense cedar calocedrus decurrens ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and white fir abies concolor the details on the fire incidence can be found in wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 to test the effect of high intensity burning on the reactivity of dom and precursors of dbps we collected the composite samples of black ash b1 and white ash w1 visually determined from burned areas site 1 in fig s1 and fir and pine from adjacent unburned areas on october 2 2013 no rainfall was recorded between fire incidence and the sample collection date another set of black ash b2 and white ash w2 samples was collected at the same burned sites site 1 in fig s1 on august 5 2014 after cumulative precipitation of 617 mm http www cnrfc noaa gov arc search php we observed the total mortality of vegetation and total o horizon consumption at site 1 and estimated the burn severity of 3 high severity and 97 moderate severity at this site based on white vs black ash distribution the ash depth was generally 5 cm thick with the white ash samples somewhat thicker than the black ash samples wang et al 2015 we used a stainless steel hand shovel to separate and collect the surficial ash from the underlying soil considering the spatial variability the composite sample consisted of three subsamples collected within a 10 m radius detritus from unburned sites dominated by ponderosa pine or white fir were collected from a forest located about 2 km north of the northern most burned area sampling site site 1 in fig s1 near cherry lake see supporting information the black and white ash samples were visually identified in the field and were considered as two end members recognizing that the landscape level ash layer displayed great short range spatial variability in both horizontal and vertical dimensions bodi et al 2014 white ash is usually generated at higher burning temperature with more aromatic compounds compared to black ash bodÃ­ et al 2014 ku et al 2018 pereira et al 2012 and total ash content consisted of 90 and 10 black and white ashes after the rim fire respectively to eliminate moisture and microbial survival the composite samples were air dried immediately after collection at room temperature 22 1 c until constant weight was reached samples were then ground and passed through a 2 mm screen and stored in sealed jars under a ventilated and dry indoor environment 2 2

w1 b2 and w2 before and after alum coagulation removal of fps was calculated by using the following formula craw ctreated craw 100 where craw and ctreated were the formed dbp concentrations before and after the alum coagulation to mimic the dbp formation under typical us water distribution conditions the uniform formation conditions ufc test was performed at 22 1 c using a relatively lower amount

using the rainwater for the ufc tests in addition we ran replicate samples without and with the addition of br in the fp and ufc tests to determine the changes in the levels of formed dbps by increasing bromide br by 100 Î¼g l we quantified volatile dbps including four thms six hans and chloral hydrate chd c2h3cl3o2 and non volatile dbps including nine haas following us epa methods 551 1 i

monochloroacetic caa c2h3clo2 dichloroacetic dcaa c2h2cl2o2 and trichloroacetic tcaa c2hcl3o2 acids in the category of haas and 3 dibromo dban c2hbr2n bromochloro bcan c2hbrcln bromo ban c2h2brn chloro can c2h2cln dichloro dcan c2hcl2n and trichloro tcan c2cl3n acetonitriles in the category of hans 3 results and discussion 3 1 fire reduced dissolved organic matter treatability by alum coagulation we measured the general water quality before and after the fire and found that the yields mg g material of po4 3 nh4 n and dtn followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire table s2 specifically we observed that the br yields in the leachates of ash were higher than in the leachates of litter which were consistent with the findings of our previous study wang et al 2015 the yields mg g material and removal percentages of doc and don followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire table 1 the wildfire reduced the amount of exported doc per gram of materials through the combustion of organic rich soil horizons and vegetation mass wang et al 2015 increases in the amounts of sediments doc and don in source water from burned watersheds were commonly observed in previous studies emelko et al 2011 writer et al 2014 this result can be explained by the fact that forest biomass soil especially o horizon which can filter dom from water ramos et al 2018 and act as a sink for organic compounds khan et al 2015 is combusted almost completely during wildfires chow et al 2019 resulting in the export of a large amount of sediments and dom to downstream waters emelko et al 2011 the doc exported from ash was further reduced one year after the fires possibly due to soil leaching and surface runoff during the post fire rainfall events wang et al 2016 our recent study uzun et al 2020 on the 2015 wragg fire found significant decreases in doc concentrations in stream water from the burned watershed during the second post fire rain season relative to the initial flashes we concluded that more mobile doc generated by fire through consumption of a large amount of litter vegetation is quickly flushed 1 year from a burned watershed during the post fire rainy season the positively charged al species are efficient when dom is dominated by negatively charged functional groups because organic compounds with negatively charged functional groups e g phenolic and carboxylic can be neutralized by the hydrolysis products of alum i e al oh 2 and al oh 2 resulting in the decrease of their solubility and the promotion of their precipitation sillanpaa et al 2018 during the fire those functional groups as the side chains were sheared with the enrichment of poly aromatic structures alexis et al 2010 gonzalez perez et al 2004 kaal and rumpel 2009 therefore the lower removal percentages in the ash leachates immediately after the fire compared to litter leachates possibly resulted from the loss of negatively charged side chains during the fire the doc don ratios before alum coagulation with the order of litters ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire indicates that fire resulted in the relative accumulation of organic nitrogen in dom which was further enhanced one year after the fire the lower doc don ratio from ash leachates is consistent with the findings of previous laboratory wang et al 2015 and field hohner et al 2016 uzun et al 2020 studies suva254 decreased after alum coagulation indicating the decrease in dom aromaticity karanfil et al 2002 in general high suva254 value 4 l mg c m indicates the relative high faction of hydrophobic dom whereas low suva254 value 2 3 l mg c m suggests the high fraction of hydrophilic dom the removal percentage of suva254 by alum coagulation followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire table 1 this result suggests that the fire produced ash materials contain more hydrophobic dom with lower removal performance during alum coagulation due to the loss of side chains writer et al 2014 the changes of suva254 before and immediately after a fire could be related to fire severity relative to the reference the suva254 in water intakes in the first rainy reason from the burned watershed was not significant in the rocky fire but 31 17 higher in the wragg fire with relatively high severity estimated to be medium severity uzun et al 2020 wang et al 2015 found the suva254 in water extracts followed the order of white ash high burn severity unburned detritus black ash low burn severity due to the less soluble aromatic fraction in black ash after the loss of oh and or cooh groups the hix positively correlated with the humification degree higher hix more humified materials fellman et al 2010 lavonen et al 2015 decreased for fir pine and w1 but increased for b1 b2 and w2 after alum coagulation alum coagulation was effective in removing the humified fraction indicated by hix in litter other than ash leachates the e2 e3 ratio inversely correlated to dom molecular weight mw wang et al 2009 was higher in raw ash leachates relative to raw litter leachates indicating dom after the fire with lower mw hohner et al 2016 this ratio increased except b2 after alum coagulation suggesting that compounds with high molecular weight hmw were preferred as the alum targets writer et al 2014 with a slight variety 22 9 1 92 on removal percentage by alum coagulation fi increased with the order of litter 1 40 1 42 ash immediately after the fire 1 73 1 77 ash one year after the fire 1 84 2 08 indicating the increasing ratio of microbial to terrestrial originated compounds in dom we observed the increase of tyrosine like proteins region i 133 47 4 tryptophan like proteins region ii 31 9 28 0 soluble microbial byproducts region iv 76 6 53 8 and the decrease of fulvic acid like region iii 31 9 46 4 and humic acid like region v 28 9 42 3 organics in litter leachates after alum coagulation suggesting the preferable removal of fulvic humic acid like organics by alum coagulation sanchez et al 2013 yang et al 2015 differently the results showed relatively small changes in the five fluorescence components of ash leachates 18 1 14 1 except tyrosine like proteins region i in b1 247 and w2 24 7 during alum coagulation mainly due to the alternation of chemical structures by high intensity fire 3 2 fire reduced the removal of dbp precursors during alum coagulation the dbp precursor yields Î¼g g material in the leachates of ash immediately after the fire were one order of magnitude lower than those in the litter leachates but higher than those in the leachates of ash one year after the fire for all the studied dbp categories except chd using chloramine no chd formed in pine b1 or w1 fig 1 and table s3 for example the thm yield Î¼g g material using chlorine was 4 135 3 614 227 408 27 and 9 in fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 respectively this result indicates that dbp precursors in the litter were eliminated by the high intensity fire which were further reduced via the biogeochemical processes such as soil erosion during the one year after the fire the consumption of organic matter through the burning in wildland fires wang et al 2015 contributed significantly to the reduction of dbp fps the yields Î¼g g material of all the studied dbp categories were positively related to both doc mg g material and don mg g material table s4 indicating doc and don as the simple and rapid surrogates for the dbp levels in samples related to fire xue et al 2014 our previous study wang et al 2016 also found a decrease in doc and dbp fps in water extracts of wildfire ash with an increase in the amount of sequential leaching additionally the dbp precursor yields using chlorine were higher for thms haas and chd but lower for han compared to those using chloramine this result is consistent with the traditional view that chlorine produces more c and o dbps but fewer n dbps compared to chloramine chuang et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 compared to litter leachates the alum coagulation was less effective for ash leachates in reducing both dbp fps Î¼g g material except for haa fps by chloramine and specific dbp fps sdbp fp Î¼g mg doc except for han by chloramine and haa for example the removal percentages for thm fps by chlorine were 74 2 72 2 41 8 37 0 36 5 and 11 5 in fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 respectively the lower removal percentage for sdbp fps in ash leachates was because that the loss of side chains alexis et al 2010 sillanpaa et al 2018 and the decrease of dom mw hohner et al 2016 writer et al 2014 by the high intensity fire induced dbp precursors more recalcitrant during alum coagulation writer et al 2014 reported the lower efficiency of alum coagulation in reducing organic matter with hill slope sediments and charred materials deposited in the river after the 2012 high park wildfire colorado especially following the first post fire flash thunderstorms hohner et al 2019 found a poor performance of alum coagulation in removing turbidity and doc from leachates of heated surface soil and litter samples by a laboratory furnace even at high coagulation doses possibly due to the reduction of dom mw moreover the increases of doc don and turbidity especially during the first postfire year were widely reported in water intakes from burned watersheds bladon et al 2008 hohner et al 2016 uzun et al 2020 which increases the water utility challenges emelko et al 2011 more efficient techniques or strategies in removing doc and don and dbp precursors will be needed in post fire drinking water facilities interestingly the removal percentages for specific han fps shan fps Î¼g mg doc by chloramine followed the order of ash one year after the fire litter ash immediately after the fire indicating the increase of shan fps one year after the fire in addition before alum coagulation the leachates of ash immediately and one year after the fire had lower doc don ratio and higher dom reactivity in forming hans compared to litter leachates our previous study wang et al 2015 also found the increase of shan fps Î¼g mg doc using chlorine with the order of water extracts from control unburned black ash and white ash due to the decrease of c n ratio and the shift of organic nitrogen from amide peptide to heteroaromatic forms 3 3 fire reduced the increase of han fp by the addition of 100 Î¼g l br compared to other dbp species the level of hans formed by chlorine increased greatly after the addition of 100 Î¼g l br because hans had much higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than regulated thms and haas muellner et al 2007 the significant increase of hans in drinking water will cause potential health risks adding 100 Î¼g l br increased the concentration of hans in both raw and treated leachates and a greater increase in treated leachates was observed compared to raw leachates using chlorine on the leachates of fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 han fps Î¼m g material increased from 0 17 to 0 72 0 17 to 0 69 0 02 to 0 09 0 04 to 0 17 0 01 to 0 01 and 0 01 to 0 01 in raw leachates and from 0 04 to 0 74 0 03 to 0 65 0 01 to 0 07 0 02 to 0 12 0 01 to 0 01 and 0 01 to 0 01 in treated leachates after the alum coagulation fig 2 and table s5 the increase in the levels of hans by adding 100 Î¼g l br was primarily due to the increase of bcan the relatively higher changes in treated leachates 50 0 1 833 compared to raw leachates 47 4 452 suggest dom fractions in treated leachates as more active bcan precursors in the presence of br moreover after alum coagulation the percentage changes achieved by adding 100 Î¼g l br were greater in treated litter leachates of fir from 0 04 to 0 74 Î¼m g material 1 579 and pine from 0 03 to 0 65 Î¼m g material 1 833 compared to treated ash leachates of b1 512 w1 424 b2 300 and w2 50 0 possibly due to the differences in doc don ratio and dom optical properties this result suggests that the increase of han levels by adding 100 Î¼g l br on treated leachates was mitigated to some extents by the thermal burning in fire the changes achieved by adding 100 Î¼g l br were not great for hans using chloramine and other dbp categories though studies liu et al 2018 sun et al 2009 reported the increase of thm and haa yields with the initial br concentration during chlorination our study observed relatively low changes in thms 37 0 7 26 and haas 17 4 21 7 using chlorine compared to those in hans previous studies chu et al 2011 roccaro et al 2013 reported that dhans including dcan c2hcl2n bcan c2hbrcln and dban c2hbr2n were readily incorporated into bromine to form brominated dbps obolensky and singer 2005 used 160 sample records from five wtps using free chlorine in the us and found that dhans had relatively higher bromine incorporation compared to thms and dhaas including dcaa bcaa and dbaa our previous study ersan et al 2019 also found that bromine substitution factor bsf followed the order of dhans haas thms the influence of the increase by 100 Î¼g l br on chd fp was slight with the changes of 19 8 25 9 using chlorine and no chd formed in pine b1 and w1 using chloramine notably even though the changes in the levels of formed hans achieved by adding 100 Î¼g l br were great their yields were still lower compared to those of formed thms for example by adding 100 Î¼g l br the yields Î¼g g material from the raw leachate of fir pine b1 w1 b2 and w2 changed from 9 22 4 135 to 8 73 3 690 for thms and from 0 25 19 8 to 0 97 83 7 for hans when using chlorine table s6 3 4 adding 100 Î¼g l br changed the speciation of thms and hans br could present in wildfire affected forest ecosystems due to the widespread use of brominated flame retardants by firefighters zhang et al 2016 and in coastal forest ecosystems due to close proximity to ocean and atmospheric deposition seawater intrusion chow et al 2007 the addition of 100 Î¼g l br in either litter or ash leachates changed the speciation of thms and hans fig 3 with increases in bsf fig s2 the addition of br shifted dbp categories to brominated species due to the higher reactivity of bromine species hobr obr compared to that of chlorine species for thms tcm chcl3 was dominated before adding br with the relative percentage of 76 0 100 using chlorine and 66 7 100 using chloramine except w2 after adding br the percentages of dcmb chbrcl2 increased from 0 19 2 to 2 96 31 2 using chlorine and from 0 to 9 00 except w2 to 11 7 52 3 using chloramine while dbcm chbr2cl had a relatively high percentage of 12 2 26 3 using chloramine for hans dcan c2hcl2n was dominated before adding br with 63 3 94 3 using chlorine except w2 and 68 6 100 using chloramine after adding br bcan c2hbrcln with 59 1 94 0 was dominated using chlorine though dcan with 47 0 93 8 was still the major species using chloramine the percentages of bcan c2hbrcln increased from 0 28 1 to 4 71 51 5 after adding br dhans were readily incorporated into bromine to form brominated dbps chu et al 2011 roccaro et al 2013 and their speciation shifted from dcan to bcan and then to dban with the increase of br concentration bond et al 2011 interestingly we observed the high percentage of 85 1 and 72 7 using chlorine and 27 0 and 28 1 using chloramine in formed bcan in both raw and treated w2 leachates possibly due to the high br concentrations of 231 Î¼g l in the raw and treated w2 leachates before adding 100 Î¼g l br table s2 moreover before adding 100 Î¼g l br relatively high bsf values for thms haas and hans were observed in the w2 leachate compared to other leachates 3 5 chloramination at alkaline ph as an option to control post fire dbp formation the fp test employs a high disinfectant dose and long reaction time to estimate the potency of water in forming dbps which maximizes dbp formation the simulated distribution system sds uses the site specific conditions of the distribution system and can accurately represent dbp formation in a specific distribution system however the sds test is greatly influenced by the conditions of a distribution system such as detention time ph seasonal temperature and limits the comparisons of performances among utilities in formation and speciation of dbps summers et al 1996 based on a comprehensive survey summers et al 1996 developed the ufc test which represents the average distribution system conditions in the us thus ufc test was selected and employed to examine dbp formation and speciation in this study an increase in ph including 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 resulted in a significant decrease in dom reactivity Î¼g mg doc in forming thms by chloramine haas and hans in both litter and ash leachates fig 4 and table s7 this tendency in dom reactivity with ph was not significantly different among the leachates of litter and ash samples relative to ph 6 5 the levels of formed thms using chloramine were 60 8 94 1 at ph 7 5 and 28 0 64 8 at ph 8 5 this decrease possibly resulted from the decreased hydrolysis rate of chloramine to free chlorine doederer et al 2014 yang et al 2007 the levels of formed hans and haas also decreased with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 5 with the ph 8 5 ph 6 5 percentages of 25 1 45 4 and 65 5 95 8 using chlorine and 28 9 51 6 and 43 8 92 3 using chloramine respectively jia et al 2016 reported the decrease of formed hans with increasing ph from 6 to 9 due to the decrease in the yields of tcan and dcan the decrease of hans in our study was mainly due to the decrease of dcan which accounted for 82 2 100 in hans fig s4 yang et al 2007 indicated that dcan undergoes the base catalyzed decomposition and its degradation rate was enhanced by increasing ph conversely the formed thms using chlorine had the ph 7 5 ph 6 5 and ph 8 5 ph 6 5 percentages of 131 175 and 166 230 with the corresponding percentages of 60 8 94 1 and 28 0 64 9 using chloramine respectively studies reported the increase of formed thms with the ph value increasing from 6 5 to 8 5 ye et al 2009 and from 6 to 8 hong et al 2013 due to the alkaline condition favoring the hydrolysis reactions of intermediate dbps to thms additionally there was no chd formed by chloramine and the level of formed chd by chlorine increased to 106 145 at ph 7 5 and 136 171 at ph 8 5 compared to those at ph 6 5 overall using chloramine at alkaline ph facilitates the control of ufc dbp formation during drinking water disinfection for treating wildfire impacted source waters after alum coagulation the dom reactivity of both litter and ash leachates in forming ufc dbps greatly increased with reaction time including 12 24 and 72 h except for hans by chlorine fig 4 and table s7 we did not find obvious different tendencies in dom reactivity among the leachates of litter and ash samples studies hong et al 2013 yang et al 2007 reported the increase of formed dbps with reaction time though the increase rates become slow after a certain time due to the decrease of disinfectants and reactive groups in dom though the percentage on formed thms in 72 h relative to 12 h was 161 196 by chlorine much lower than 311 403 by chloramine we still observed higher dom reactivity of 34 1 47 8 Î¼g mg doc in forming ufc thms by chlorine in 72 h compared to 0 75 1 31 Î¼g mg doc by chloramine similarly sakai et al 2016 found the 4 day 1 day percentage for thms was 150 by chlorine and 420 by chloramine and dom reactivity in forming thms after 4 days by chloramine was lower compared to that by chlorine compared to 12 h the percentage on formed haas in 72 h was 207 602 by chlorine and 134 303 by chloramine there was no chd formed by chloramine with reaction times of 12 and 24 h and dom reactivity in forming chd by chlorine increased with reaction time with the 24 h 12 h and 72 h 12 h percentages of 104 135 and 158 264 respectively differently the levels of formed hans by chlorine increased when reaction time changed from 12 h to 24 h but decreased when reaction time increased from 24 h to 72 h compared to 12 h the percentages of formed hans in 24 h and 72 h were 124 372 and 60 66 by chlorine and 120 374 and 160 663 by chloramine tian et al 2013 also observed that the concentrations of hans decreased using cl2 but increased using nh2cl with reaction time 30 min 24 h and 72 h possibly due to the degradation and or transformation of initially formed hans in the late reaction with chlorine the nitrile carbon in hans could be attacked by hydroxide and hypochlorite to form haloacetamides and haas as primary intermediates and end products reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 similarly with the increase of 100 Î¼g l br we observed the increase of bsf using the ufc tests figs s5 and s6 for example by the increase of 100 Î¼g l br the bsf values increased from 0 5 29 to 0 48 4 at ph 6 5 8 5 and 0 4 21 except 19 2 in hans from pine at 12 h using chloramine to 0 48 2 at 12 72 h after the increase of 100 Î¼g l br the bsf values decreased and increased with reaction time for ufc thms using chlorine and chloramine respectively compared to other conditions including disinfectants and reaction time the bsf values for ufc thms were relatively high at 24 and 72 h but low at 12 h when using chloramine fig s5b indicating chloramine with short reaction time as an option for controlling the ufc thms the bsf values generally decreased with ph for thms and hans using chloramine but increased with ph for hans using chlorine and the lowest bsf values for both ufc thms and hans were observed under the condition of chloramine and ph 8 5 figs s6b and f under both reaction time and water ph conditions figs s5b d f and s6b d f chlorine generated higher bsf values for both haas and hans compared to chloramine in addition the bsf values for hans were lower in the treated leachates of b1 and w1 relative to fire and pine indicating the less brominated hans formed in the ash leachates overall when br exists in the water distribution system chloramine at high ph could represent a viable strategy for controlling the formation of brominated dbp species providing a means to treat wildfire impacted source waters after alum coagulation 4 conclusions this study showed that removal percentages of doc and don by the alum coagulation followed the order of litter ash immediately after the fire ash one year after the fire alum coagulation was less effective in removing doc and don and reducing both dbp fps and dom chlorine chloramine reactivity in ash leachates compared to litter leachates this result was possibly due to the loss of side chains and the decrease of dom mw during the wildfire making the dom and dbp precursors more recalcitrant during alum coagulation therefore more efficient techniques or strategies in removing doc and don and dbp precursors will be needed when drinking water facilities using alum coagulation receive water from watersheds burned by wildfire elevated br levels were frequently reported in water extracts of wildfire ash and downstream waters from burned watersheds possibly due to the wide use of brominated flame retardants and or atmospheric deposition seawater intrusion into coastal forest ecosystems an increase by 100 Î¼g l br in both litter and ash leachates shifted the studied dbps into more brominated species as previously reported and greatly increased the formation of hans by chlorine this increase was relatively lower in ash leachates this result indicates that the increase of hans formation using chlorine by increasing 100 Î¼g l br in treated leachates was mitigated to some extents by wildfire burning using ufc tests we observed that the dom reactivity in forming the studied dbps generally increased with reaction time and decreased with ph in both litter and ash leachates fig 5 suggesting disinfection using chloramine at alkaline ph as an option for controlling the studied dbp in our work the influence of reaction time and ph in dom reactivity was similar among the leachates of litter and ash samples chloramination at alkaline ph produced relatively low brominated dbp species in the treated leachates of both litter fir and pine and ash b1 and w1 after the increase of 100 Î¼g l br as quantified by the bsf values fig 5 overall chloramination at alkaline ph is an effective strategy and regulatory compliance for controlling the formation of the studied dbps while treating wildfire impacted water sources after alum coagulation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17657,the conversion mechanisms of chlorine species including free chlorine monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine and total chlorine nitrogen species including ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 as well as the formation of disinfection by products dbps in a uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system in water were investigated in this work the consumption rates of free chlorine and nh2cl were significantly promoted in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system especially in the presence of uv irradiation moreover the transformation forms of nitrogen in both ultrapure and ha containing waters were considerably affected by uv irradiation and the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl no3 and no2 can be easily produced under uv irradiation and the removal efficiency of total nitrogen with uv was obvious higher than that without uv when the initial ratio of hocl nh2cl was less than 1 the roles of different radicals in the degradation of free chlorine nh2cl and nh4 were also considered in such a uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system the results indicated that oh was important to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl and showed negligible influence on the consumption of nh4 besides the changes of doc and uv254 in ha containing water in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system indicated that the removal efficiency of doc 24 was much lower than that of uv254 94 the formation of dbps in a mixed chlorine chloramines system was also evaluated the yields of dbps decreased significantly as the mass ratio of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 moreover compared to the conditions without uv irradiation higher dbps yields and dbp associated calculated toxicity were observed during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine process graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorine and nitrogen transformation free chlorine monochloramine uv irradiation disinfection by products dbps 1 introduction chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectants in water treatment processes however free chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom to form disinfection by products dbps allard et al 2015 dbps have been confirmed to have negative impacts on public human health because of their cyto and geno toxicity plewa and wagner 2015 during disinfection free chlorine can also be converted to inorganic chloramines including monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 through the reaction with ammonia which widely exists in raw water margerum et al 1978 morris and isaac 1981 vikesland et al 2001 moreover different forms of chloramines can transform mutually which is significantly influenced by the mass ratio of chlorine to nitrogen and ph li and blatchley 2009 among these inorganic chloramines nh2cl and nhcl2 are relatively more powerful oxidants while ncl3 has the worst oxidizing ability in addition nhcl2 and ncl3 can cause odorous problem with low odor threshold concentrations of 0 15 and 0 02 mg cl2 l respectively heeb et al 2017 compared with chlorine nh2cl is known to be a less reactive but more stable disinfectant and generates less trihalomethanes thms than chlorine in water duirk et al 2005 thus nh2cl is often used as an alternative disinfectant in large scale drinking water treatment plants dwtps and long distance distribution systems li and blatchley 2009 however nh2cl usually coexisted with other chlorine species including free chlorine nhcl2 and even ncl3 in urban water distribution system for some reasons such as the unreasonable adding methods of free chlorine and ammonium salt in dwtps booster chlorination and nitrification in pipe network and influence of water quality ammonia nature organic matter ph etc margerum et al 1978 vikesland et al 2001 lipponen et al 2002 zhang et al 2015 for examples lipponen et al 2002 reported that free chlorine could occupy 44 of total chlorine in the chloraminated finished water with the retention time of 31 h in our previous study free chlorine nh2cl nhcl2 and even organic chloramines were all detected in both finished and tap water zhang et al 2015 therefore the mixed chlorine chloramines system should be a common situation for users of urban water supply networks it is of great interest to mitigate the chlorinous odor problems caused by chloramine conversion during the water distribution and improve the drinking water quality in recent years uv irradiation has emerged as an important alternative treatment process because it can effectively inactivate a wide range of waterborne pathogens such as giardia species and cryptosporidium parvum which are resistant to the commonly used disinfectants including free chlorine and chloramines li and blatchley 2009 weng and blatchley 2011 uv irradiation can also combine with free chlorine or nh2cl as uv related advanced oxidation processes aops to promote micropollutant degradation or sterilization by generating strong oxidative free radicals including hydroxyl oh chlorine cl dichloride anion cl2 chlorine oxide clo and amino radical nh2 fang et al 2014 2017 patton et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a for instance uv chlorination has been currently proven to be effective in degrading pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps qin et al 2014 guo et al 2017 and even dbps such as iodoform and diiodoacetamide wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 uv nh2cl process has been also demonstrated to be effective for the removal of carbamazepine bu et al 2018 besides during these aops both free chlorine and chloramines can be degraded by uv irradiation for examples gao et al 2019 reported that the photolysis of free chlorine was greatly promoted by uv irradiation other previous studies reported that uv irradiation had obvious photolysis effect on both organic chloramines and inorganic chloramines in drinking water treatment soltermann et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 2019b in addition zhang et al 2019c also illustrated that ammonia can be effectively removed by uv nh2cl process in brief uv irradiation is expected to be an effective method to control the risk of chloramine problems during water treatment process considering that the mixed chlorine chloramines system commonly occurred in the tap water with long retention time especially in water pools or roof tanks during secondary water supply the application of uv irradiation device in these parts not only can effectively deal with chloramine odorous problems but also can prevent microbial growth in water pools or roof tanks in the end of pipe network however the mechanisms in the mixed hocl nh2cl system activated by uv irradiation still remain unclear different ratios of hocl nh2cl should be a potential important factor on radical production chlorine nitrogen species transformation and even dbp generation under uv irradiation therefore it is necessary to gain a thorough insight into a chlorine chloramines coexistence system during uv irradiation which will provide a specific and in depth theoretical basis for the control of odorous problem caused by chloramine transformation removal of pollutants such as ammonia and reduction of dbp formation risk therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the mechanisms and pathways of chlorine and nitrogen conversion in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system 2 to evaluate contribution of the reactive species to the consumption of free chlorine nh2cl and transformation of nitrogen species including nh4 no2 and no3 in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system and 3 to assess the dbp formation risk in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals were at least of analytical grade except as specially noted potassium iodide ki 99 0

s1 displays the uv irradiation device xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china used in this study a low pressure lp hg uv lamp 11w 4p se philips netherland was fixed in the centerline of a quartz sleeve to generate quasi parallel uv irradiation at the wavelength 254 nm the quartz sleeve containing the lp hg uv lamp was placed in the center of the uv irradiation system and was encircled by 12 quartz reactors the sample was placed in each 50 ml sealed quartz reactor with a stirring rotor at the bottom a water circulating system was applied to control the reaction temperature at 25 1 c the effective path length l and fluence rate value i0 of the uv system were determined as 8 2 cm and 3 25 10 7 e s 1 l 1 respectively in our previous research by using hydrogen peroxide and atrazine as actinometers wang et al 2017 the uv intensity of the lp hg uv lamp was measured using an ultraviolet radiometer photoelectric instrument factory beijing normal university model uv c at 254 nm and calibrated as 0 28 mw cm2 the uv fluence mj cm2 was calculated by multiplying the exposure time and the uv intensity rosenfeldt et al 2006 yuan et al 2009 2 3 experimental procedures all experiments were conducted in the 50 ml photoreactors described above the uv lamp was warmed up at least 30 min in advance then experiments were performed by spiking a specific amount of disinfectants to make the total concentration of 10 mg cl2 l mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl as 1 0 4 1 1 1 1 4 and 0 1 in the solutions due to the fast decay and conversion of chlorine nitrogen under uv irradiation and limitations of detection limits higher initial total chlorine dose 10 mg cl2 l than practical situation was designed in this experiment to obtain reliable results the solution ph value was buffered at 7 0 a typical value in practical water treatment conditions using 10 mm phosphate and adjusted with small amounts of 0 01 0 1 or 1 m naoh and h2so4 solutions in order to ensure the uniformity and comparability of experiments control experiments were performed using the similar approach without uv irradiation samples from each photoreactor were collected at designed reaction time i e 15 30 45 and 60 min in sequence measured for free total chlorine and nh2cl concentrations and then quenched using na2s2o3 with 20 excess of the initial total chlorine concentration to analyze the concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 as soon as possible besides samples were withdrawn and 10 ml of each solution was quenched with overdosed ascorbic acid at the molar ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine as 1 5 1 then the samples were extracted and analyzed for dbps concentrations immediately to avoid any hydrolytic loss all the tests were conducted in duplicate with the averaged values being reported 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of free and total chlorine were determined according to the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 nh2cl concentration was detected using the monochlorf method lee and westerhoff 2009 according to the previous study nh2cl can be distinguished from other chlorine species and specially quantified by the monochlorf method lee et al 2007 lee and westerhoff 2009 ncl3 concentration was negligible at neutral or slightly alkaline conditions shang and blatchley 1999 thus the concentration of nhcl2 was obtained by subtracting the concentrations of free chlorine and nh2cl from total chlorine all of measurements above mentioned should be performed as soon as possible to avoid any changes of residual chlorine in a solution the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were measured by using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan and the detection limit was 0 1 mg l for both toc and tn no2 and no3 concentrations were measured by using their corresponding hach test kits with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 at the wavelengths of 507 and 500 nm respectively and nh4 was measured according to the salicylic acid cyanuric acid salt colorimetric method zhang et al 2016b 2019b the dissolved organic nitrogen don value was calculated by subtracting nh4 no2 and no3 from tn lee and westerhoff 2005 the value of uv254 was measured by using a spectrophotometer sq 4802 unico shanghai china at the wavelength of 254 nm solution ph was measured by using a ph meter fe20 fiveeasy mettler toledo switzerland which was regularly calibrated using standard buffer solutions the method of dbps quantification was modified from the usepa method 551 1 all dbps were measured using a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu japan which was equipped with a hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 Î¼m film thickness j w usa and an electron capture detector the detector and injector temperatures were 290 and 200 c respectively the nitrogen carrier gas was at the pressure of 69 8 kpa with the flow rate of 30 ml min the temperature program was at 37 c for 10 min ramped to 50 c at 5 c min and held for 5 min and then ramped to 260 c at 15 c min and held for 10 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of chlorine species in ultrapure and ha containing water the concentrations of free chlorine nh2cl and total chlorine in the presence or absence of uv irradiation were measured and the results of the variation of chlorine species as a function of reaction time in ultrapure water are displayed in fig 1 uv irradiation significantly enhanced the degradation of chlorine compared to the scenario without uv irradiation fig 1 a e especially the removal rates of total chlorine were up to 77 96 fig s2 a at different mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl treated at 1000 mj cm2 uv fluence but the removal rates were only 9 47 fig s2 b without uv irradiation from the reactions summarized in table s1 the reason may be due to the fact that uv irradiation accelerated the photolysis of all types of chlorine free chlorine nh2cl and nhcl2 rxns 1 3 and resulted in the production of various radicals such as oh cl and nh2 buxton et al 1988 feng et al 2007 patton et al 2017 which can further accelerate the consumption of chlorine species rxns 4 7 as shown in fig 1 b free chlorine was also produced at the mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl at 0 1 by the hydrolysis of nh2cl vikesland et al 2001 moreover the concentration of free chlorine produced under uv irradiation increased up to nearly 1 mg cl2 l at 15 min and then decreased with increasing uv fluence while the formation of free chlorine was negligible in the absence of uv irradiation according to our previous study zhang et al 2019b uv irradiation can enhance the release of free chlorine by the degradation of organic chloramines thus similar phenomenon should also exist during the degradation of inorganic chloramines under uv irradiation based on the above assumption free chlorine might be quickly produced first and then rapidly decomposed again when high concentration level of nh2cl irradiated by uv light in addition the consumption rate of free chlorine was higher than the generation rate with the decreasing concentration of nh2cl it should also be noted that the compositions of chlorine were more complicated in a mixed chlorine system compared with that in a single chlorine or chloramine system for the samples dosed with free chlorine and nh2cl nhcl2 was also formed through the reactions displayed in table s1 rxns 8 9 the nhcl2 formed would further promote the formation of hocl and nh2cl by hydrolysis reaction table s1 rxn 10 or the specific reaction with reactive intermediate table s1 rxn 11 nhcl2 can also react with nh2cl which in turn accelerates the decomposition of nh2cl table s1 rxn 12 it was also obvious that the consumption rates of free chlorine and nh2cl could be promoted synergistically especially under uv irradiation according to the rxn 8 in table s1 free chlorine can react with nh2cl in order to investigate the effect of uv irradiation and mass ratios of hocl to nh2cl on the distribution percent of chlorine we evaluated the formation process of each disinfectant species as displayed in fig s3 the variations of distribution percent of chlorine were negligible in a single chlorine or chloramine system either in the presence of uv irradiation or not moreover in the absence of uv irradiation the distribution percent of free chlorine and nh2cl decreased slightly while the distribution of nhcl2 exhibited opposite trend with the increasing reaction time in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system fig s3 c e however in the presence of uv irradiation the distribution percent of chlorine decreased substantially in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system fig s3 c e this can be ascribed to the generation of free radicals see in section 3 3 in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system in sum the concentrations of free chlorine and nh2cl will both be reduced when they coexist in water and uv irradiation can further accelerate their degradation resulting in the decrease of disinfectant concentrations below expected levels nom is widespread in aqueous environments and can easily react with different chlorine species and radicals among them humic substance is one of the major components which is derived from the decomposition of animals and plants nagao et al 2011 as a typical humic substance ha has been proved to be an important precursor of dbps and sensitive under uv irradiation and oxidation of free radicals li et al 2016 due to low content of nitrogen in ha the interference to nitrogen transformation in the complicated chlorine chloramines mixed system is low therefore ha was selected as a typical background organic matter in this work fig 2 displays the variations of chlorine species as a function of reaction time in ha containing water which exhibited similar trends as those in ultrapure water fig 1 however the concentration of each disinfectant is lower than that in ultrapure water because free chlorine nh2cl and nhcl2 could be consumed by nom leading to the formation of dbps we also analyzed the formation process of each disinfectant species at different uv fluences and mass ratios of hocl to nh2cl the results indicated that the variation of distribution percent of chlorine exhibited similar trends to that in ultrapure water fig s4 considering the variations of chlorine species in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system which have great impacts on subsequent disinfection it is vital for water plants to monitor the concentrations and forms of chlorine in water in real time so as to achieve the desired disinfection efficacy based on the results mentioned above the reaction system is much complex compared to the individual uv chlorine or uv nh2cl system because it includes not only the chlor am ine degradation but also the transformation of different forms of chloramines therefore more systematic research should be conducted in the near future 3 2 transformation of nitrogen species in ultrapure and ha containing water the concentrations of total nitrogen nh4 no2 and no3 were measured in the presence or absence of uv irradiation within the reaction time of 0 60 min and the results are displayed in fig 3 only nh4 mainly derived from the acidification of nh2cl table s1 rxn 9 was detected in the samples without uv irradiation for the samples exposed to uv irradiation all of nh4 no2 and no3 were identified the results indicated that uv irradiation transformed the nitrogen species and promoted the formation of no2 and no3 from the rxns 2 16 in table s2 nh2cl under uv irradiation can derive various nitrogen species including nh4 no2 and no3 on the other hand no3 was also the major product during the photolysis of nhcl2 whereas nh4 and no2 were not detected li and blatchley 2009 the concentrations of no2 and no3 increased with increasing reaction time and the increase of no3 was much more significant compared to that of no2 in contrast the concentration of nh4 showed a declining trend with increasing reaction time fig 3 compared to the condition without uv irradiation the degradation of total nitrogen was much more significant under uv irradiation this can be explained by the fact that large amounts of nitrogen were consumed and transformed into n2 and n2o table s2 rxns 16 24 during the photolysis of nh2cl the formation of n2o would also contribute the nitrogen loss during photodegradation of nhcl2 li and blatchley 2009 li and blatchley iii 2009 have reported that n2 and n2o were the stable products resulting from the photolysis of inorganic chloramine which was the dominant contribution to the loss of nitrogen in this work especially n2o despite its low toxicity is a major greenhouse gas and also needs more attention in our future work moreover the removal of total nitrogen was mainly due to the degradation of nh4 which was consistent with the results of a previous study zhang et al 2019c under the condition without uv irradiation relatively less decrease of total nitrogen was observed at the mass ratios of chlorine to nh2cl at 0 1 1 1 and 1 4 fig 3 a c it can be attributed to the auto decomposition of a few amount of nh2cl which can lead to the oxidation of nitrogen and the formation of n2 valentine and wilber 1987 however the concentration of the total nitrogen mainly nh4 decreased much significantly at the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl at 4 1 it was likely because most of ammonia was converted into n2 via the breakpoint chlorination process which can be summarized in eq 1 driss and bouhelassa 2014 1 3hocl 2nh3 n2 3h 3cl 3h2o the results mentioned above indicates that uv irradiation plays a leading role in the transformation of nitrogen in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system under the conditions of uv irradiation the removal rates of total nitrogen increased significantly as the mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl varied from 0 1 to 4 1 especially it was found that almost 70 of total nitrogen was removed within 15 min at the mass ratio of 4 1 fig s5 a the results could be owing to the production of large amounts of free radicals it will be discussed in section 3 3 during the reactions fig 4 displays the variations the concentrations of nitrogen species as a function of reaction time in ha containing water which also shows similar trends as those in ultrapure water fig 3 the stable products included nh4 no2 no3 and don in which nh4 was the common product for each condition notably in background of ha solution all the don values during the reactions were lower than the quantification limit besides the results indicated that the removal percentage of total nitrogen 42 86 fig s5 c was slightly lower than that in ultrapure water 48 90 fig s5 a it could be due to the inhibitory effect of ha which could act as a radical scavenger during the removal of nitrogen cimetiere and de laat 2014 moreover the existence of ha also inhibited the auto decomposition of nh2cl contributing to less loss of nitrogen duirk et al 2005 the experimental results in figs 3 4 indicated that the transformation of nitrogen species in ultrapure and ha containing waters were both significantly affected by uv irradiation and the mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl therefore it is necessary to monitor the proportion of free chlorine to nh2cl and the fluence of uv in practical applications in order to better understand the existence of nitrogen species nh4 no2 and no3 in water which might be harmful to human health at a certain level sindelar and milkowski 2012 3 3 roles of radicals in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system radicals including oh rcs and nh2 can be formed during uv chlor am ination in which oh and rcs have strong oxidizing ability while nh2 is relatively unreactive chuang et al 2017 to confirm the roles of the various radicals in the consumption of free chlorine nh2cl and nh4 three radical scavengers nb tba and hco3 were dosed into the solutions during uv chlor am ination in this study nb has a high reaction rate with oh knb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but its scavenging effect on cl is negligible watts and linden 2007 hco3 can scavenge oh cl2 and cl nist 2016 while its reaction with clo is negligible wu et al 2017 simultaneously co3 can be concurrently generated which is also a reactive radical tba can scavenge oh clo and cl but not cl2 wu et al 2017 therefore it is assumed that most of the oh was scavenged and rcs became the dominant radicals in the system during uv chlor am ination with the excess dosage of 10 Î¼m nb based on previous studies yin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 after 10 mm hco3 was added in this system only co3 and clo should be present while when 5 mm tba was added only cl2 should exist in this system wu et al 2017 fig 5 displays the effects of nb tba and hco3 on the consumption rate of free chlorine nh2cl and nh4 the consumption rate of free chlorine kfree chlorine fig 5 a and nh2cl k nh 2 cl fig 5 b significantly decreased in the presence of nb tba and hco3 however there was no obvious decrease for the consumption rate of nh4 k nh 4 fig 5 c the k values for free chlorine and nh2cl decreased significantly from 0 1343 to 0 0337 min 1 and from 0 0758 to 0 0401 min 1 respectively in the presence of nb the inserted figures in fig 5 meanwhile these k values decreased to 0 0325 and 0 029 min 1 respectively in the presence of tba the significant rate inhibition of free chlorine and nh2cl by nb and tba indicated that oh was the primary radicals responsible for the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl notably although the consumption rate of free chlorine and nh2cl was suppressed in the presence of hco3 it was still higher than those in the presence of nb and tba according to previous studies wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019c there was little contribution of hco3 to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl besides co3 can be concurrently generated with the addition of hco3 therefore the inhibition of free chlorine and nh2cl by hco3 also indicated that co3 may contribute their consumption to a certain degree for nh4 the k value for the degradation by radicals displayed no obvious decrease in the presence of nb tba and hco3 indicating the negligible role played by oh in sum oh is important to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl but not for nh4 3 4 changes of doc and uv254 in ha containing water in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system doc is a common indicator for organic matter content in water weishaar et al 2003 uv254 is a universal parameter of the aromaticity of dissolved organic matter dom and usually used as the surrogate for doc in aqueous environment weishaar et al 2003 therefore the changes of doc and uv254 of ha containing water during uv chlor am ine process were displayed in fig 6 considering that the changes of doc and uv254 during chlor am ination alone was negligible the doc and uv254 concentration shown in fig 6 during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines process was considered as the primary objective as shown in fig 6 the doc concentration and uv254 decreased with the increasing reaction time in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system which is similar to the previous reports in the uv based advanced oxidation process sanly et al 2007 phong and hur 2015 compared with doc results uv254 displayed obvious decreasing trends over the irradiation time the results indicate that the chromophores and or uv absorbing substances in dom which are mainly composed of large size aromatic molecules can be quickly broken down into non aromatic by products with smaller sizes sanly et al 2007 besides the removal efficiency of doc 24 was much lower than that of uv254 94 fig s6 which suggests that some aromatic components were partially degraded into non uv absorbing structures such as alcohols organic acids and some other non aromatic compounds sanly et al 2007 hur et al 2011 the changes of these organic precursors will naturally affect the formation of dbps during uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system 3 5 dbp formation and toxicity evaluation in different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl considering the transformation of chlorine and nitrogen in different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl in presence or absence of uv irradiation its influence on dbp formation also needs to be investigated fig 7 displayed the formation of carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps during different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl in presence or absence of uv irradiation only three c dbps including cf dcp and tcp and one n dbp dcan were detected as displayed in fig 7 the c dbps especially cf were the major products compared to n dbps this may be due to that less n dbp precursors such as don discussed in fig 4 were available in samples besides the formation of nh4 during the mixed chlorine chloramines system also contributed to the less formation of dcan yang et al 2010 the concentrations of cf dcp and tcp increased with increasing reaction time for all the different conditions while dcan was slightly suppressed at high uv fluence 1000 mj cm2 at the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl as 1 0 this implied that increasing reaction time can enhance the dbp formation via the reactions of disinfectants or rcs with ha except the mineralization of dcan precursors by ho at high uv fluence gao et al 2019 besides the decrease of dcan was also attributable to its oxidation and hydrolysis by chlorine yang et al 2007 interestingly the removal rate of total nitrogen was the highest at the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl at 4 1 fig s5 c while the amount of the corresponding n dbps such as dcan was not significantly reduced on the contrary the concentration of dcan is much higher than those at other different mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl the results indicated that the application of the uv based aops to remove total nitrogen still faced the risk of the formation of n dbps the yields of dbps decreased significantly as the mass ratios of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 at the same reaction time in the presence or absence of uv irradiation it can be explained by the fact that the reactivity of free chlorine with organic compounds was much higher than that of nh2cl hu et al 2019 besides the yield of cl during uv hocl process is higher than that of uv nh2cl resulting in more dbps formation by halogenation reaction with organics feng et al 2007 li and blatchley 2009 in addition higher dbp yields were observed during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine process than chlor am ination for all the different conditions mass ratios of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 this is due to the generation of the strong oxidizing cl during uv irradiation which has stronger reactive activity for dbp formation hua et al 2019 in addition the strong oxidizing reactive radicals such as oh and cl also alter the structure of organic precursors and further promote the dbp formation hua et al 2019 with the decrease of the initial concentration of free chlorine in the mixed chlorine system the difference of the dbps formation was relatively small between uv and without uv irradiation which indicated that the uv chloramine system had no obvious promotion effect on the production of dbps given the ubiquitous existence of uv irradiation combined with chlor am ination in water treatment and its vital influence on the dbps formation more detailed research should be conducted in order to better control the yields of dbps in future since there is a direct relation between toxicity and human health a comprehensive assessment of toxicity for measured dbps under different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl was also investigated therefore the cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti are calculated in this study to compare the integrated toxicity of several dbps this method has been applied to evaluate the toxicity of detected dbps and assess their contribution to the total dbp associated toxicity plewa et al 2008a 2008b wagner and plewa 2017 zhang et al 2019d according to the previous studies plewa et al 2008a 2008b wagner and plewa 2017 zhang et al 2019d cti and gti were the sum of cti and gti of each dbp compound which were presented in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 c t i x 1 n 1 c 1 2 x c x 3 g t i x 1 n 1 g e n o t o x i c i t y p o t e n c y x c x where c1 2x and genotoxic potency x are defined as the cyto and genotoxicity of each dbp and the c1 2x and genotoxic potency x are listed in table s3 cx is defined as the concentration m of each dbp x is defined as the specific dbp cf and dcan as displayed in fig 8 both the cti and gti values are much higher during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines process than that without uv irradiation in addition as for the conditions at mass ratios of hocl nh2cl at 4 1 to 0 1 the cti and gti values increased with the increasing reaction time in contrast the cti values showed increasing trend and then decreased at mass ratios of hocl nh2cl at 1 0 under uv irradiation it could be due to the less formation of dcan at high uv fluence which exhibits much higher toxicity than the other dbps plewa et al 2004 however the increasing trend was always observed without uv irradiation the phenomenon mentioned above was consistent with the changes of dbps formation during different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl fig 7 besides the above mentioned results also indicated that better control of cti and gti can be achieved during chloramination compared to chlorination in the presence or absence of uv irradiation the calculated toxicity of cti and gti was based on the measured dbps and more research of the toxicity control about the dbps during mixed chlorine chloramine system may be conducted in future 4 conclusions the coexistence of free chlorine and nh2cl has significant effects on the transformation of chlorine and nitrogen species under the uv irradiation the results indicated that the consumption rates of free chlorine and nh2cl could be promoted synergistically especially under uv irradiation besides uv irradiation also complicated the nitrogen species and enhanced the formation of no2 and no3 which might be harmful to public health furthermore the results also indicated that oh was important to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl and showed negligible influence on the consumption of nh4 the removal efficiency of doc 24 was much lower than that of uv254 94 in ha containing water in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system notably the yields of dbps decreased significantly as the mass ratio of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 moreover in comparison with the conditions without uv irradiation higher dbps yields and dbp associated calculated toxicity were observed during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine process in sum the influence of the coexistence of hocl and nh2cl on the water quality such as the odor problems should be further assessed considering the effective removal of chlorinous odor problems and ammonium in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine system higher uv fluence was needed during the water treatment processes however the dbps generation was also increased with the increasing uv fluence thus in order to balance the removal efficiency of chlorinous odor problems and ammonium and the formation of dbps an appropriate uv fluence was crucial and more detailed study should be further explored in the near future declaration of competing interest the

17657,the conversion mechanisms of chlorine species including free chlorine monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine and total chlorine nitrogen species including ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 as well as the formation of disinfection by products dbps in a uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system in water were investigated in this work the consumption rates of free chlorine and nh2cl were significantly promoted in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system especially in the presence of uv irradiation moreover the transformation forms of nitrogen in both ultrapure and ha containing waters were considerably affected by uv irradiation and the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl no3 and no2 can be easily produced under uv irradiation and the removal efficiency of total nitrogen with uv was obvious higher than that without uv when the initial ratio of hocl nh2cl was less than 1 the roles of different radicals in the degradation of free chlorine nh2cl and nh4 were also considered in such a uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system the results indicated that oh was important to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl and showed negligible influence on the consumption of nh4 besides the changes of doc and uv254 in ha containing water in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system indicated that the removal efficiency of doc 24 was much lower than that of uv254 94 the formation of dbps in a mixed chlorine chloramines system was also evaluated the yields of dbps decreased significantly as the mass ratio of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 moreover compared to the conditions without uv irradiation higher dbps yields and dbp associated calculated toxicity were observed during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine process graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorine and nitrogen transformation free chlorine monochloramine uv irradiation disinfection by products dbps 1 introduction chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectants in water treatment processes however free chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom to form disinfection by products dbps allard et al 2015 dbps have been confirmed to have negative impacts on public human health because of their cyto and geno toxicity plewa and wagner 2015 during disinfection free chlorine can also be converted to inorganic chloramines including monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 through the reaction with ammonia which widely exists in raw water margerum et al 1978 morris and isaac 1981 vikesland et al 2001 moreover different forms of chloramines can transform mutually which is significantly influenced by the mass ratio of chlorine to nitrogen and ph li and blatchley 2009 among these inorganic chloramines nh2cl and nhcl2 are relatively more powerful oxidants while ncl3 has the worst oxidizing ability in addition nhcl2 and ncl3 can cause odorous problem with low odor threshold concentrations of 0 15 and 0 02 mg cl2 l respectively heeb et al 2017 compared with chlorine nh2cl is known to be a less reactive but more stable disinfectant and generates less trihalomethanes thms than chlorine in water duirk et al 2005 thus nh2cl is often used as an alternative disinfectant in large scale drinking water treatment plants dwtps and long distance distribution systems li and blatchley 2009 however nh2cl usually coexisted with other chlorine species including free chlorine nhcl2 and even ncl3 in urban water distribution system for some reasons such as the unreasonable adding methods of free chlorine and ammonium salt in dwtps booster chlorination and nitrification in pipe network and influence of water quality ammonia nature organic matter ph etc margerum et al 1978 vikesland et al 2001 lipponen et al 2002 zhang et al 2015 for examples lipponen et al 2002 reported that free chlorine could occupy 44 of total chlorine in the chloraminated finished water with the retention time of 31 h in our previous study free chlorine nh2cl nhcl2 and even organic chloramines were all detected in both finished and tap water zhang et al 2015 therefore the mixed chlorine chloramines system should be a common situation for users of urban water supply networks it is of great interest to mitigate the chlorinous odor problems caused by chloramine conversion during the water distribution and improve the drinking water quality in recent years uv irradiation has emerged as an important alternative treatment process because it can effectively inactivate a wide range of waterborne pathogens such as giardia species and cryptosporidium parvum which are resistant to the commonly used disinfectants including free chlorine and chloramines li and blatchley 2009 weng and blatchley 2011 uv irradiation can also combine with free chlorine or nh2cl as uv related advanced oxidation processes aops to promote micropollutant degradation or sterilization by generating strong oxidative free radicals including hydroxyl oh chlorine cl dichloride anion cl2 chlorine oxide clo and amino radical nh2 fang et al 2014 2017 patton et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a for instance uv chlorination has been currently proven to be effective in degrading pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps qin et al 2014 guo et al 2017 and even dbps such as iodoform and diiodoacetamide wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 uv nh2cl process has been also demonstrated to be effective for the removal of carbamazepine bu et al 2018 besides during these aops both free chlorine and chloramines can be degraded by uv irradiation for examples gao et al 2019 reported that the photolysis of free chlorine was greatly promoted by uv irradiation other previous studies reported that uv irradiation had obvious photolysis effect on both organic chloramines and inorganic chloramines in drinking water treatment soltermann et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 2019b in addition zhang et al 2019c also illustrated that ammonia can be effectively removed by uv nh2cl process in brief uv irradiation is expected to be an effective method to control the risk of chloramine problems during water treatment process considering that the mixed chlorine chloramines system commonly occurred in the tap water with long retention time especially in water pools or roof tanks during secondary water supply the application of uv irradiation device in these parts not only can effectively deal with chloramine odorous problems but also can prevent microbial growth in water pools or roof tanks in the end of pipe network however the mechanisms in the mixed hocl nh2cl system activated by uv irradiation still remain unclear different ratios of hocl nh2cl should be a potential important factor on radical production chlorine nitrogen species transformation and even dbp generation under uv irradiation therefore it is necessary to gain a thorough insight into a chlorine chloramines coexistence system during uv irradiation which will provide a specific and in depth theoretical basis for the control of odorous problem caused by chloramine transformation removal of pollutants such as ammonia and reduction of dbp formation risk therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the mechanisms and pathways of chlorine and nitrogen conversion in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system 2 to evaluate contribution of the reactive species to the consumption of free chlorine nh2cl and transformation of nitrogen species including nh4 no2 and no3 in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system and 3 to assess the dbp formation risk in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals were at least of analytical grade except as specially noted potassium iodide ki 99 0

s1 displays the uv irradiation device xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china used in this study a low pressure lp hg uv lamp 11w 4p se philips netherland was fixed in the centerline of a quartz sleeve to generate quasi parallel uv irradiation at the wavelength 254 nm the quartz sleeve containing the lp hg uv lamp was placed in the center of the uv irradiation system and was encircled by 12 quartz reactors the sample was placed in each 50 ml sealed quartz reactor with a stirring rotor at the bottom a water circulating system was applied to control the reaction temperature at 25 1 c the effective path length l and fluence rate value i0 of the uv system were determined as 8 2 cm and 3 25 10 7 e s 1 l 1 respectively in our previous research by using hydrogen peroxide and atrazine as actinometers wang et al 2017 the uv intensity of the lp hg uv lamp was measured using an ultraviolet radiometer photoelectric instrument factory beijing normal university model uv c at 254 nm and calibrated as 0 28 mw cm2 the uv fluence mj cm2 was calculated by multiplying the exposure time and the uv intensity rosenfeldt et al 2006 yuan et al 2009 2 3 experimental procedures all experiments were conducted in the 50 ml photoreactors described above the uv lamp was warmed up at least 30 min in advance then experiments were performed by spiking a specific amount of disinfectants to make the total concentration of 10 mg cl2 l mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl as 1 0 4 1 1 1 1 4 and 0 1 in the solutions due to the fast decay and conversion of chlorine nitrogen under uv irradiation and limitations of detection limits higher initial total chlorine dose 10 mg cl2 l than practical situation was designed in this experiment to obtain reliable results the solution ph value was buffered at 7 0 a typical value in practical water treatment conditions using 10 mm phosphate and adjusted with small amounts of 0 01 0 1 or 1 m naoh and h2so4 solutions in order to ensure the uniformity and comparability of experiments control experiments were performed using the similar approach without uv irradiation samples from each photoreactor were collected at designed reaction time i e 15 30 45 and 60 min in sequence measured for free total chlorine and nh2cl concentrations and then quenched using na2s2o3 with 20 excess of the initial total chlorine concentration to analyze the concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 as soon as possible besides samples were withdrawn and 10 ml of each solution was quenched with overdosed ascorbic acid at the molar ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine as 1 5 1 then the samples were extracted and analyzed for dbps concentrations immediately to avoid any hydrolytic loss all the tests were conducted in duplicate with the averaged values being reported 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of free and total chlorine were determined according to the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 nh2cl concentration was detected using the monochlorf method lee and westerhoff 2009 according to the previous study nh2cl can be distinguished from other chlorine species and specially quantified by the monochlorf method lee et al 2007 lee and westerhoff 2009 ncl3 concentration was negligible at neutral or slightly alkaline conditions shang and blatchley 1999 thus the concentration of nhcl2 was obtained by subtracting the concentrations of free chlorine and nh2cl from total chlorine all of measurements above mentioned should be performed as soon as possible to avoid any changes of residual chlorine in a solution the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were measured by using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan and the detection limit was 0 1 mg l for both toc and tn no2 and no3 concentrations were measured by using their corresponding hach test kits with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 at the wavelengths of 507 and 500 nm respectively and nh4 was measured according to the salicylic acid cyanuric acid salt colorimetric method zhang et al 2016b 2019b the dissolved organic nitrogen don value was calculated by subtracting nh4 no2 and no3 from tn lee and westerhoff 2005 the value of uv254 was measured by using a spectrophotometer sq 4802 unico shanghai china at the wavelength of 254 nm solution ph was measured by using a ph meter fe20 fiveeasy mettler toledo switzerland which was regularly calibrated using standard buffer solutions the method of dbps quantification was modified from the usepa method 551 1 all dbps were measured using a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu japan which was equipped with a hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 Î¼m film thickness j w usa and an electron capture detector the detector and injector temperatures were 290 and 200 c respectively the nitrogen carrier gas was at the pressure of 69 8 kpa with the flow rate of 30 ml min the temperature program was at 37 c for 10 min ramped to 50 c at 5 c min and held for 5 min and then ramped to 260 c at 15 c min and held for 10 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of chlorine species in ultrapure and ha containing water the concentrations of free chlorine nh2cl and total chlorine in the presence or absence of uv irradiation were measured and the results of the variation of chlorine species as a function of reaction time in ultrapure water are displayed in fig 1 uv irradiation significantly enhanced the degradation of chlorine compared to the scenario without uv irradiation fig 1 a e especially the removal rates of total chlorine were up to 77 96 fig s2 a at different mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl treated at 1000 mj cm2 uv fluence but the removal rates were only 9 47 fig s2 b without uv irradiation from the reactions summarized in table s1 the reason may be due to the fact that uv irradiation accelerated the photolysis of all types of chlorine free chlorine nh2cl and nhcl2 rxns 1 3 and resulted in the production of various radicals such as oh cl and nh2 buxton et al 1988 feng et al 2007 patton et al 2017 which can further accelerate the consumption of chlorine species rxns 4 7 as shown in fig 1 b free chlorine was also produced at the mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl at 0 1 by the hydrolysis of nh2cl vikesland et al 2001 moreover the concentration of free chlorine produced under uv irradiation increased up to nearly 1 mg cl2 l at 15 min and then decreased with increasing uv fluence while the formation of free chlorine was negligible in the absence of uv irradiation according to our previous study zhang et al 2019b uv irradiation can enhance the release of free chlorine by the degradation of organic chloramines thus similar phenomenon should also exist during the degradation of inorganic chloramines under uv irradiation based on the above assumption free chlorine might be quickly produced first and then rapidly decomposed again when high concentration level of nh2cl irradiated by uv light in addition the consumption rate of free chlorine was higher than the generation rate with the decreasing concentration of nh2cl it should also be noted that the compositions of chlorine were more complicated in a mixed chlorine system compared with that in a single chlorine or chloramine system for the samples dosed with free chlorine and nh2cl nhcl2 was also formed through the reactions displayed in table s1 rxns 8 9 the nhcl2 formed would further promote the formation of hocl and nh2cl by hydrolysis reaction table s1 rxn 10 or the specific reaction with reactive intermediate table s1 rxn 11 nhcl2 can also react with nh2cl which in turn accelerates the decomposition of nh2cl table s1 rxn 12 it was also obvious that the consumption rates of free chlorine and nh2cl could be promoted synergistically especially under uv irradiation according to the rxn 8 in table s1 free chlorine can react with nh2cl in order to investigate the effect of uv irradiation and mass ratios of hocl to nh2cl on the distribution percent of chlorine we evaluated the formation process of each disinfectant species as displayed in fig s3 the variations of distribution percent of chlorine were negligible in a single chlorine or chloramine system either in the presence of uv irradiation or not moreover in the absence of uv irradiation the distribution percent of free chlorine and nh2cl decreased slightly while the distribution of nhcl2 exhibited opposite trend with the increasing reaction time in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system fig s3 c e however in the presence of uv irradiation the distribution percent of chlorine decreased substantially in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system fig s3 c e this can be ascribed to the generation of free radicals see in section 3 3 in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system in sum the concentrations of free chlorine and nh2cl will both be reduced when they coexist in water and uv irradiation can further accelerate their degradation resulting in the decrease of disinfectant concentrations below expected levels nom is widespread in aqueous environments and can easily react with different chlorine species and radicals among them humic substance is one of the major components which is derived from the decomposition of animals and plants nagao et al 2011 as a typical humic substance ha has been proved to be an important precursor of dbps and sensitive under uv irradiation and oxidation of free radicals li et al 2016 due to low content of nitrogen in ha the interference to nitrogen transformation in the complicated chlorine chloramines mixed system is low therefore ha was selected as a typical background organic matter in this work fig 2 displays the variations of chlorine species as a function of reaction time in ha containing water which exhibited similar trends as those in ultrapure water fig 1 however the concentration of each disinfectant is lower than that in ultrapure water because free chlorine nh2cl and nhcl2 could be consumed by nom leading to the formation of dbps we also analyzed the formation process of each disinfectant species at different uv fluences and mass ratios of hocl to nh2cl the results indicated that the variation of distribution percent of chlorine exhibited similar trends to that in ultrapure water fig s4 considering the variations of chlorine species in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system which have great impacts on subsequent disinfection it is vital for water plants to monitor the concentrations and forms of chlorine in water in real time so as to achieve the desired disinfection efficacy based on the results mentioned above the reaction system is much complex compared to the individual uv chlorine or uv nh2cl system because it includes not only the chlor am ine degradation but also the transformation of different forms of chloramines therefore more systematic research should be conducted in the near future 3 2 transformation of nitrogen species in ultrapure and ha containing water the concentrations of total nitrogen nh4 no2 and no3 were measured in the presence or absence of uv irradiation within the reaction time of 0 60 min and the results are displayed in fig 3 only nh4 mainly derived from the acidification of nh2cl table s1 rxn 9 was detected in the samples without uv irradiation for the samples exposed to uv irradiation all of nh4 no2 and no3 were identified the results indicated that uv irradiation transformed the nitrogen species and promoted the formation of no2 and no3 from the rxns 2 16 in table s2 nh2cl under uv irradiation can derive various nitrogen species including nh4 no2 and no3 on the other hand no3 was also the major product during the photolysis of nhcl2 whereas nh4 and no2 were not detected li and blatchley 2009 the concentrations of no2 and no3 increased with increasing reaction time and the increase of no3 was much more significant compared to that of no2 in contrast the concentration of nh4 showed a declining trend with increasing reaction time fig 3 compared to the condition without uv irradiation the degradation of total nitrogen was much more significant under uv irradiation this can be explained by the fact that large amounts of nitrogen were consumed and transformed into n2 and n2o table s2 rxns 16 24 during the photolysis of nh2cl the formation of n2o would also contribute the nitrogen loss during photodegradation of nhcl2 li and blatchley 2009 li and blatchley iii 2009 have reported that n2 and n2o were the stable products resulting from the photolysis of inorganic chloramine which was the dominant contribution to the loss of nitrogen in this work especially n2o despite its low toxicity is a major greenhouse gas and also needs more attention in our future work moreover the removal of total nitrogen was mainly due to the degradation of nh4 which was consistent with the results of a previous study zhang et al 2019c under the condition without uv irradiation relatively less decrease of total nitrogen was observed at the mass ratios of chlorine to nh2cl at 0 1 1 1 and 1 4 fig 3 a c it can be attributed to the auto decomposition of a few amount of nh2cl which can lead to the oxidation of nitrogen and the formation of n2 valentine and wilber 1987 however the concentration of the total nitrogen mainly nh4 decreased much significantly at the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl at 4 1 it was likely because most of ammonia was converted into n2 via the breakpoint chlorination process which can be summarized in eq 1 driss and bouhelassa 2014 1 3hocl 2nh3 n2 3h 3cl 3h2o the results mentioned above indicates that uv irradiation plays a leading role in the transformation of nitrogen in a hocl nh2cl coexisting system under the conditions of uv irradiation the removal rates of total nitrogen increased significantly as the mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl varied from 0 1 to 4 1 especially it was found that almost 70 of total nitrogen was removed within 15 min at the mass ratio of 4 1 fig s5 a the results could be owing to the production of large amounts of free radicals it will be discussed in section 3 3 during the reactions fig 4 displays the variations the concentrations of nitrogen species as a function of reaction time in ha containing water which also shows similar trends as those in ultrapure water fig 3 the stable products included nh4 no2 no3 and don in which nh4 was the common product for each condition notably in background of ha solution all the don values during the reactions were lower than the quantification limit besides the results indicated that the removal percentage of total nitrogen 42 86 fig s5 c was slightly lower than that in ultrapure water 48 90 fig s5 a it could be due to the inhibitory effect of ha which could act as a radical scavenger during the removal of nitrogen cimetiere and de laat 2014 moreover the existence of ha also inhibited the auto decomposition of nh2cl contributing to less loss of nitrogen duirk et al 2005 the experimental results in figs 3 4 indicated that the transformation of nitrogen species in ultrapure and ha containing waters were both significantly affected by uv irradiation and the mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl therefore it is necessary to monitor the proportion of free chlorine to nh2cl and the fluence of uv in practical applications in order to better understand the existence of nitrogen species nh4 no2 and no3 in water which might be harmful to human health at a certain level sindelar and milkowski 2012 3 3 roles of radicals in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system radicals including oh rcs and nh2 can be formed during uv chlor am ination in which oh and rcs have strong oxidizing ability while nh2 is relatively unreactive chuang et al 2017 to confirm the roles of the various radicals in the consumption of free chlorine nh2cl and nh4 three radical scavengers nb tba and hco3 were dosed into the solutions during uv chlor am ination in this study nb has a high reaction rate with oh knb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but its scavenging effect on cl is negligible watts and linden 2007 hco3 can scavenge oh cl2 and cl nist 2016 while its reaction with clo is negligible wu et al 2017 simultaneously co3 can be concurrently generated which is also a reactive radical tba can scavenge oh clo and cl but not cl2 wu et al 2017 therefore it is assumed that most of the oh was scavenged and rcs became the dominant radicals in the system during uv chlor am ination with the excess dosage of 10 Î¼m nb based on previous studies yin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 after 10 mm hco3 was added in this system only co3 and clo should be present while when 5 mm tba was added only cl2 should exist in this system wu et al 2017 fig 5 displays the effects of nb tba and hco3 on the consumption rate of free chlorine nh2cl and nh4 the consumption rate of free chlorine kfree chlorine fig 5 a and nh2cl k nh 2 cl fig 5 b significantly decreased in the presence of nb tba and hco3 however there was no obvious decrease for the consumption rate of nh4 k nh 4 fig 5 c the k values for free chlorine and nh2cl decreased significantly from 0 1343 to 0 0337 min 1 and from 0 0758 to 0 0401 min 1 respectively in the presence of nb the inserted figures in fig 5 meanwhile these k values decreased to 0 0325 and 0 029 min 1 respectively in the presence of tba the significant rate inhibition of free chlorine and nh2cl by nb and tba indicated that oh was the primary radicals responsible for the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl notably although the consumption rate of free chlorine and nh2cl was suppressed in the presence of hco3 it was still higher than those in the presence of nb and tba according to previous studies wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019c there was little contribution of hco3 to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl besides co3 can be concurrently generated with the addition of hco3 therefore the inhibition of free chlorine and nh2cl by hco3 also indicated that co3 may contribute their consumption to a certain degree for nh4 the k value for the degradation by radicals displayed no obvious decrease in the presence of nb tba and hco3 indicating the negligible role played by oh in sum oh is important to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl but not for nh4 3 4 changes of doc and uv254 in ha containing water in uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system doc is a common indicator for organic matter content in water weishaar et al 2003 uv254 is a universal parameter of the aromaticity of dissolved organic matter dom and usually used as the surrogate for doc in aqueous environment weishaar et al 2003 therefore the changes of doc and uv254 of ha containing water during uv chlor am ine process were displayed in fig 6 considering that the changes of doc and uv254 during chlor am ination alone was negligible the doc and uv254 concentration shown in fig 6 during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines process was considered as the primary objective as shown in fig 6 the doc concentration and uv254 decreased with the increasing reaction time in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system which is similar to the previous reports in the uv based advanced oxidation process sanly et al 2007 phong and hur 2015 compared with doc results uv254 displayed obvious decreasing trends over the irradiation time the results indicate that the chromophores and or uv absorbing substances in dom which are mainly composed of large size aromatic molecules can be quickly broken down into non aromatic by products with smaller sizes sanly et al 2007 besides the removal efficiency of doc 24 was much lower than that of uv254 94 fig s6 which suggests that some aromatic components were partially degraded into non uv absorbing structures such as alcohols organic acids and some other non aromatic compounds sanly et al 2007 hur et al 2011 the changes of these organic precursors will naturally affect the formation of dbps during uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system 3 5 dbp formation and toxicity evaluation in different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl considering the transformation of chlorine and nitrogen in different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl in presence or absence of uv irradiation its influence on dbp formation also needs to be investigated fig 7 displayed the formation of carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps during different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl in presence or absence of uv irradiation only three c dbps including cf dcp and tcp and one n dbp dcan were detected as displayed in fig 7 the c dbps especially cf were the major products compared to n dbps this may be due to that less n dbp precursors such as don discussed in fig 4 were available in samples besides the formation of nh4 during the mixed chlorine chloramines system also contributed to the less formation of dcan yang et al 2010 the concentrations of cf dcp and tcp increased with increasing reaction time for all the different conditions while dcan was slightly suppressed at high uv fluence 1000 mj cm2 at the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl as 1 0 this implied that increasing reaction time can enhance the dbp formation via the reactions of disinfectants or rcs with ha except the mineralization of dcan precursors by ho at high uv fluence gao et al 2019 besides the decrease of dcan was also attributable to its oxidation and hydrolysis by chlorine yang et al 2007 interestingly the removal rate of total nitrogen was the highest at the mass ratio of free chlorine to nh2cl at 4 1 fig s5 c while the amount of the corresponding n dbps such as dcan was not significantly reduced on the contrary the concentration of dcan is much higher than those at other different mass ratios of free chlorine to nh2cl the results indicated that the application of the uv based aops to remove total nitrogen still faced the risk of the formation of n dbps the yields of dbps decreased significantly as the mass ratios of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 at the same reaction time in the presence or absence of uv irradiation it can be explained by the fact that the reactivity of free chlorine with organic compounds was much higher than that of nh2cl hu et al 2019 besides the yield of cl during uv hocl process is higher than that of uv nh2cl resulting in more dbps formation by halogenation reaction with organics feng et al 2007 li and blatchley 2009 in addition higher dbp yields were observed during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine process than chlor am ination for all the different conditions mass ratios of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 this is due to the generation of the strong oxidizing cl during uv irradiation which has stronger reactive activity for dbp formation hua et al 2019 in addition the strong oxidizing reactive radicals such as oh and cl also alter the structure of organic precursors and further promote the dbp formation hua et al 2019 with the decrease of the initial concentration of free chlorine in the mixed chlorine system the difference of the dbps formation was relatively small between uv and without uv irradiation which indicated that the uv chloramine system had no obvious promotion effect on the production of dbps given the ubiquitous existence of uv irradiation combined with chlor am ination in water treatment and its vital influence on the dbps formation more detailed research should be conducted in order to better control the yields of dbps in future since there is a direct relation between toxicity and human health a comprehensive assessment of toxicity for measured dbps under different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl was also investigated therefore the cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti are calculated in this study to compare the integrated toxicity of several dbps this method has been applied to evaluate the toxicity of detected dbps and assess their contribution to the total dbp associated toxicity plewa et al 2008a 2008b wagner and plewa 2017 zhang et al 2019d according to the previous studies plewa et al 2008a 2008b wagner and plewa 2017 zhang et al 2019d cti and gti were the sum of cti and gti of each dbp compound which were presented in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 c t i x 1 n 1 c 1 2 x c x 3 g t i x 1 n 1 g e n o t o x i c i t y p o t e n c y x c x where c1 2x and genotoxic potency x are defined as the cyto and genotoxicity of each dbp and the c1 2x and genotoxic potency x are listed in table s3 cx is defined as the concentration m of each dbp x is defined as the specific dbp cf and dcan as displayed in fig 8 both the cti and gti values are much higher during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines process than that without uv irradiation in addition as for the conditions at mass ratios of hocl nh2cl at 4 1 to 0 1 the cti and gti values increased with the increasing reaction time in contrast the cti values showed increasing trend and then decreased at mass ratios of hocl nh2cl at 1 0 under uv irradiation it could be due to the less formation of dcan at high uv fluence which exhibits much higher toxicity than the other dbps plewa et al 2004 however the increasing trend was always observed without uv irradiation the phenomenon mentioned above was consistent with the changes of dbps formation during different mass ratios of hocl nh2cl fig 7 besides the above mentioned results also indicated that better control of cti and gti can be achieved during chloramination compared to chlorination in the presence or absence of uv irradiation the calculated toxicity of cti and gti was based on the measured dbps and more research of the toxicity control about the dbps during mixed chlorine chloramine system may be conducted in future 4 conclusions the coexistence of free chlorine and nh2cl has significant effects on the transformation of chlorine and nitrogen species under the uv irradiation the results indicated that the consumption rates of free chlorine and nh2cl could be promoted synergistically especially under uv irradiation besides uv irradiation also complicated the nitrogen species and enhanced the formation of no2 and no3 which might be harmful to public health furthermore the results also indicated that oh was important to the consumption of free chlorine and nh2cl and showed negligible influence on the consumption of nh4 the removal efficiency of doc 24 was much lower than that of uv254 94 in ha containing water in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramines system notably the yields of dbps decreased significantly as the mass ratio of hocl nh2cl varied from 1 0 to 0 1 moreover in comparison with the conditions without uv irradiation higher dbps yields and dbp associated calculated toxicity were observed during the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine process in sum the influence of the coexistence of hocl and nh2cl on the water quality such as the odor problems should be further assessed considering the effective removal of chlorinous odor problems and ammonium in the uv activated mixed chlorine chloramine system higher uv fluence was needed during the water treatment processes however the dbps generation was also increased with the increasing uv fluence thus in order to balance the removal efficiency of chlorinous odor problems and ammonium and the formation of dbps an appropriate uv fluence was crucial and more detailed study should be further explored in the near future declaration of competing interest the

17658,microplastic mp has been identified as an emerging vector that transports hydrophobic organic compounds hocs across aquatic environments due to its hydrophobic surfaces and small size however it is also recognized that environmental factors affect mp s chemical vector effects and that attached biofilms could play a major role although the specific mechanisms remain unclear to explore this issue an in situ experiment was conducted at xiangshan bay of southeastern china and dynamics of hocs i e polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and bacterial communities related to the model mp i e pe fibers were analyzed and compared through bacterial characterizations including the 16s rrna approach higher summer temperatures 31 4 1 07 c were found to promote colonizing bacterial assemblages with larger biomasses higher activity and more degrading bacteria than winter temperatures 13 3 2 49 c consequently some sorbed pollutants underwent significant decline in the summer and this decline was particularly the case for pahs with low 2 3 rings and median 4 rings molecular weights such as phenanthrene 59 4 1 6 chrysene 70 6 4 2 fluoranthene 77 1 13 3 and benz a anthracene 71 5 11 0 in our winter test however most pollutants underwent a consistent increase throughout the 8 week exposure period moreover more biorefractory pollutants including pcbs and high molecular weight 5 6 rings pahs accumulated regardless of bacterial characteristics two putative pah degrading bacteria appeared with high relative abundances during the summer test i e family rhodobacteraceae 18 6 0 5 and genus sphingomicrobium 22 4 3 6 associated with drastic decreases in low 45 2 0 4 and median 66 0 2 5 molecular weight pahs respectively bacterial degradation effects of biofilms on pahs are also supported by the correlative dynamics of salicylic acid an important degradation intermediate of pahs the results of this study indicate that mp s hoc vector effects are essentially determined by interactions between attached pollutants and microbial assemblages which are further related to bacterial activity and pollutant features further studies of biofilm effects on mp toxicity and on the metabolic pathways of mp attached hocs are required graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic debris biofouling sorption biodegradation pollutant carrier 1 introduction microplastic mp has attracted considerable attention not only due to its potential threats to organisms wright et al 2013 but also given its unclear biogeochemical roles in aquatic environments rummel et al 2017 in addition to the toxic effects of plastic itself cole et al 2013 and those of additives koelmans et al 2014 the vector effects of microplastics in enriching and transferring hazardous chemicals and microorganisms have been a major concern koelmans et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 this concern is reflected by the rapid increase in the number of studies published on this issue in recent years from assessments of microplastic s chemical sorption capacities based on laboratory tests guo and wang 2019 zuo et al 2019 and field collected samples chen et al 2018b gauquie et al 2015 to the characterization of plastic colonizing microbial assemblages for identifying alien taxa and pathogenic microbes gregory 1999 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 the published data provide clear evidence showing that hydrophobic and rough surfaces can facilitate microplastics serving as effective substratum for hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs wang et al 2018 and various suspended microbes rummel et al 2017 in seawater compared to natural suspended solids e g sediment and wood some unique vector effects of mp have been detected such as the much higher uptake of hocs beckingham and ghosh 2017 and the distinctive biofilm communities oberbeckmann et al 2018 through vector effects regional hazardous substances can be transported long distances syberg et al 2015 and into a broad food web setÃ¤lÃ¤ et al 2014 which may aggravate the ecological risks associated with microplastic in fact concerns regarding the hoc vector effects of marine plastic debris were raised before the term microplastic was first defined in 2004 thompson et al 2004 mato et al 2001 even conducted an in situ study 7 days on how resin pellets may serve as a transport medium for toxic chemicals in 2001 over the past few years abundant sorption data on virgin microplastics and contaminants wang et al 2018 have become available and the relevant sorption mechanisms have been investigated liu et al 2019 laboratory tests can serve as an initial means to understand microplastic s theoretical sorption characteristics but they are not sufficient in conducting an accurate assessment of microplastic s vector effects on aquatic environments laboratory tests can miss essential links of biological chemical and physical processes as microplastic is transported through aquatic environments and a lack of understanding of biofilm effects could constitute a major shortcoming rummel et al 2017 biofilm formation i e biofouling is the consequence of frequent and rapid interactions between microplastics and aquatic environments loeb and neihof 1975 biofilms are composed of diverse communities of microbes such as bacteria algae protozoans and fungi which are mostly embedded in an abundant extracellular polymeric substance eps rummel et al 2017 biofouling turns plastic particles into a dual domain i e a plastic core with an outer shell of organic matter endo and koelmans 2019 and in turn many biogeochemical behaviors of mp such as vertical transport pollutant microorganism transport and toxicity can consequently change rummel et al 2017 recently the knowledge gap regarding how biofilms impact the uptake and fate of mp associated pollutants has been highlighted rochman et al 2013 rummel et al 2017 zettler et al 2013 and in situ experiments considering environmentally relevant factors have been suggested rummel et al 2017 relative to studies focused on mp associated microbial assemblages oberbeckmann et al 2015 fewer in situ studies have been conducted on the dynamics of mp associated pollutants moreover due to a lack of combinative analyses on the dynamics of attached pollutants and microbial communities the mechanisms of biofilm effects on pollutants remain underexplored based on the results of passive sampling tests feng et al 2016 biofilm formation may constitute an obstacle to the uptake of hocs on surfaces of plastic samplers rochman et al 2013 found sorptive concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs with low and median molecular weights to decrease significantly after one month moreover a recent incubation experiment showed that colonizing microbes can more significantly and quickly degrade mp sorbed polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs than sediment sorbed ones rosato et al 2020 currently in situ data showing simultaneous variations of mp attached pollutants and microorganisms are not available resulting in a poor understanding of the role of biofilms this study aims to reveal mechanisms underlying biofilm s impacts on mp sorbed hocs through an in situ experiment examining temporal variations of bacterial communities and hocs most of the few available in situ studies on mp sorption have been conducted in regions characterized by cold weather and light pollution loads mato et al 2001 rochman et al 2013 and thus do not focus theoretical understanding of biofilms development oberbeckmann et al 2018 rao 2010 in contrast we selected xiangshan bay a subtropical bay in southeastern china suffering from high pollutant levels gu and xiang 2002 resulting from land and mariculture activities as an exposure site to ensure substantial biofilm growth in the model mp i e polyethylene pe fibers obtained from fishing nets experiments were designed with three objectives 1 targeting pollutants with different physicochemical properties i e pahs and pcbs to examine how different hocs respond to biofilm development 2 using the 16s rrna approach and quantifying degrading intermediates to explore how biofilms affect the fate of mp sorbed hocs and provide chemical evidence and 3 conducting comparative experiments in the summer and winter to evaluate the influence of temperature dependent bacterial activity we hypothesized that interactions between hocs and biofilms on mp would vary among pollutants and bacterial communities leading to different hoc vector effects we expected the data derived from this in situ study to address basic uncertainties concerning biofilm effects on sorbed hocs and to provide useful insights for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site an enclosure type mariculture farm located in the interior area of xiangshan bay figs 1a and s1a a semi enclosed narrow bay along the southeastern coast of china was selected as the field site for the in situ test of microplastic xiangshan bay suffers from a high nutrient load due to slow water exchange and anthropogenic inputs during the studied period july 2018 to january 2019 high nutrient concentrations were examined in seawater from the site table s2 the bay was also affected by contaminants from a shipyard positioned close to the study site as shown in figs 1a and s1b an unregulated leakage of machine oil and diesel was observed during our previous sampling cruise potentially representing a point source of pahs

composition were characterized by the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy fig s2 each rope was composed of fifteen twisted fibers of 0 22 mm in diameter a pe cluster was formed with ten sticks of 20 cm pe rope i e containing 150 pe fibers with a total weight of 0 900 1 100 g the ropes were burned together with a 1 cm bonded end each pe rope was then manually loosened to fully separate the fibers from each other figs 1b and s1c to remove potentially adhered organic compounds the pe clusters were soaked in methanol for 24 h followed by 10 min of supersonic treatment and air dried under ambient temperature three dried pe bunches were then tied together as a pe fiber set i e for use as three replicates for a temporal test fig s1c 2 2 2 model mp deployment and recovery the pe fiber set was tied to a wooden pole at a fixed immersion depth in the seawater fig 1 b the wooden poles were firmly inserted into the sediment and the depth of the pe fiber set varied from 0 5 to 3 5 m below the water surface depending on tide levels the sets were installed in july and november of 2018 representing the summer and winter seasons respectively exposure times were set to 1 2 3 4 and 8 weeks at each time point one pole was removed and three pe bunches were recovered and separately packed into premade aluminum bags the chemical and bacterial data for the pe biofilm assemblages were determined based on the three replicates meanwhile 5 l of the ambient seawater were collected and stored in a pre combusted brown glass bottle for the determination of hoc concentrations and water quality indices data shown in tables s2 3 and figs s3 5 all of the plastic and seawater samples were stored on ice during their transport to the laboratory the recovered pe fibers were frozen at 80 c

concentrations of attached hocs 3 1 1 total concentrations across the two seasons studied sorbed concentrations of pahs 704 5 201 9 ng g 1 n 10 were approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of pcbs 85 1 21 0 ng g 1 n 10 fig 2 a and b concentrations of sorbed pahs increased before decreasing over the two seasons maximum values of 1 092 5 93 0 ng g 1 week 3 and 826 0 50 3 ng g 1 week 4 were reached in the summer and winter respectively in the winter pcb levels increased before decreasing to a maximum value of 122 2 0 5 ng g 1 in week 4 and varied irregularly during the summer test 3 1 2 individual compounds the congeners of pahs and pcbs were further grouped according to the number of benzene rings and chlorine atoms in the summer the number of low lmw 2 3 rings and median molecular weight mmw 4 rings pahs dramatically decreased after reaching the highest sorption concentrations fig 2c on average lmw and mmw pah levels decreased by 45 2 0 4 n 6 and 66 0 2 5 n 4 respectively among these congeners phe 59 4 1 6 chr 77 1 13 3 flt 70 9 0 4 and baa 71 5 11 0 underwent especially strong decreases fig 2c in the winter decreases were less pronounced lmw 14 0 5 7 mmw 20 8 9 7 and occurred later on all occurred during the last exposure relative to the summer test on the other hand most of the high molecular weight hmw 5 6 rings pahs underwent a consistent increase fig 2c and e on average hmw pah levels increased by 91 1 5 2 and 675 8 298 9 in the summer and winter respectively for pcbs the average sorbed concentrations of cb 52 were approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of the other congeners fig 2d and f during the summer test with the exception of cb 101 and cb 194 most congeners reached their highest concentrations in the first week which was followed by differing levels of decline in the winter test temporal patterns were reversed with the exception of cb 101 and cb 194 most congeners showed a cumulative increase 3 2 biomass and diversity dynamics of the attached biofilms in both seasons od595 values continuously increased p 0 005 anova fig 3 a attached biofilms showed significantly higher od595 values in the summer than in the winter p 0 005 paired t test this result corroborates our field observations of visibly thicker and darker biofilms in the summer than in the winter based on the 16s rrna sequencing data the richness of bacterial communities in biofilms was assessed by otu number and the chao1 index fig 3b and c in contrast to the biomass results more otus i e the total number of otus in the season were found in the winter 3 783 than in the summer 2 944 we found no significant difference p 0 111 paired t test in the number of otus between seasons the chao1 index shows a similar trend in the number of otus and the winter test shows statistically higher numbers than the summer test p 0 005 paired t test additionally temporal trends of the shannon diversity index fig 3d were found to mimic otu quantities and chao1 index values but no significant differences were found between seasons p 0 263 paired t test compositional variations in the pe attached bacterial community over the two seasons were assessed by calculating the bray curtis similarity index and visualizing the resulting distance matrix via nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds fig 3e when comparing all of the times series datasets a clear cluster separating the summer and winter tests is observed with a significant difference anosim r 0 613 p 0 001 table s4 within individual seasons no significant differences were found between any paired tests 3 3 temporal variations in bacterial community composition in terms of taxonomic compositions bacterial communities were composed differently between the two seasons at the phylum level fig s6 proteobacteria dominated all bacterial communities in both the summer 53 3 19 4 and winter 58 8 7 6 tests firmicutes exhibited an exceptionally high relative abundance 67 6 37 0 in the first week of the summer and a moderate abundance in the second week of the winter test 11 2 3 5 at the family level fig s7 the three most abundant families were erythrobacteraceae rhodobacteraceae and flavobacteriaceae notably in the summer test the relative abundance of sphingomonadaceae increased dramatically to 22 6 3 6 in the fourth week and then decreased to 7 8 3 5 during the final exposure at the genus level fig s8 erythrobacter accounted for 17 6 8 6 and 22 3 15 1 of bacterial communities in the summer and winter respectively a high relative abundance 22 4 3 6 of sphingomicrobium appeared in week 4 of the summer test significantly discriminant taxa that may explain the variations found between bacterial communities in the different samples were explored with a linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse segata et al 2011 a lefse analysis fig 4 and table s5 identified significantly discriminative taxa as biomarkers across all of the exposure data most biomarkers appeared in bacterial communities during the summer test and especially in later stage of the tests from week 3 to week 8 in contrast the communities included much fewer discriminants during the winter 3 4 concentrations of pah degradation intermediate as a typical pah biodegradation intermediate salicylic acid sa was examined to further verify the biodegradation of the sorbed pahs cumulative decreases in pahs were calculated see further information given in the si section and are illustrated with sa production trends in fig 5 in both seasons sa showed relatively low concentrations 0 09 0 22 nmol g 1 within the first three weeks then a strong increase in sa and decrease in pahs appeared from week 4 during the summer test moreover decreases in pahs during the summer were significantly more pronounced than increases in sa observed from week 4 to week 8 in contrast sa concentrations underwent only a slight increase in the last exposure during the winter 0 8 nmol g 1 and decreases in pahs and increases in sa were very similar throughout the winter test 4 discussion 4 1 hocs exhibited diverse dynamics in pe fibers regardless of how hocs varied temporally attached pahs performed approximately an order of magnitude more uptake than pcbs p 0 001 paired t test regardless of seasonal and environmental factors this difference is approximately comparable with that between the background concentrations of pahs and pcbs in the seawater figs s3 4 indicating the influence of background concentration this phenomenon has been widely observed in microplastics in the oceans bouhroum et al 2019 gauquie et al 2015 rios et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 and might reflect the fact that pcbs have been found in lower concentrations than pahs since the ban of 1970 rochman et al 2013 notably pollutant concentrations found in this study closely mimic mp data for the northern chinese coastline zhang et al 2015 among the temporal variations in hocs observed sorbed pahs in the summer were the most distinctive undergoing a significant increase until week 3 followed by a drastic decrease to week 8 this phenomenon corroborates our expectation that some attached hocs can be degraded by colonizing microorganisms from the few published in situ studies on this issue we found similar trends from a one year field exposure test conducted in san diego bay rochman et al 2013 among their target hocs i e pahs and pcbs concentrations of lmw and mmw pahs showed clear decreases after reaching sorption peaks whereas concentrations of hmw pahs increased throughout this result reflects the well known fact that the biodegradability of pahs declines with an increase in molecular weight haritash and kaushik 2009 peng et al 2008 rochman et al 2014 examined various metals in mps but found no such decrease which could also be attributed to the bioinert features of metals singh and cameotra 2004 results from our summer test also indicate that lmw pah concentrations reached a sorption maximum and began to decrease earlier on than the mmw pahs this trend is consistent with previous sorption studies showing that less hydrophobic pahs reach equilibrium at a faster rate mÃ¼ller et al 2001 in the winter test however temporal variations of all of the pahs showed a consistently increasing trend throughout the exposure period hmw pahs underwent a more significant increase than in the summer and bbf did not undergo the same decrease observed during the summer test while little published data on seasonal differences in hoc uptake are available a break in the decline in mmw pah levels during the winter is described in rochman et al 2013 as a result a clear temporal change in pah compositions was observed fig s9 in the first week of both seasons pah compositions were comparable as follows lmw 48 3 vs 49 5 summer vs winter mmw 40 4 vs 42 0 hmw 11 3 vs 8 6 low and similar biomasses of attached biofilms should be the main reason for this trend due to weak biofouling effects feng et al 2016 rios et al 2007 afterwards compositions of pahs shifted towards higher proportions of hmw pahs and compositions during final exposure were comparable this outcome suggests that plastic colonizing microbes may transform pah compositions to a higher proportion of hmw pah congeners which could pose a higher levels of genotoxicity to ingestive marine organisms cerniglia 1993 a further investigation of this transform is needed pcbs underwent irregular and increasing trends during the summer and winter tests respectively with the exception of some congeners with very low concentrations 10 ng g 1 few congeners underwent significant declines during the test despite the irregular temporal variations of pcbs in the seawater fig s5 such as the cb 194 in the summer and the cb 52 in the winter a cumulative increase of the sorbed concentration was achieved this result is consistent with the data of rochman et al 2013 which show an overall increase in all 21 pcbs congeners over one year of exposure this result echoes the trends of hmw pahs specifically pcbs table s6 are characterized by high molecular weights 250 and hydrophobicity log k ow 5 2 which also discriminates hmw pahs from other pahs in terms of bioavailability pcbs have been assessed to present much lower levels than pahs brÃ¤ndli et al 2007 liu et al 2007 an investigation of biofilm effects shows that both pcbs and hmw pahs might serve as relatively high recalcitrant pollutants which benefits the establishment of a good gradient of bioavailability therefore based on the results given above our further discussion of pollutant biodegradation focuses on the dynamics of lmw and hmw pahs moreover the temporal change in pcb compositions fig s10 showed a stable pattern in the summer while an increasing proportion of the 3 4 chlorine pcbs was found in the winter as shown in fig s5 b and d the concentrations of 3 4 chlorine pcbs e g ccb 44 and cb 52 in the seawater were much higher than that in the summer which could explain the increasingly high proportion of the sorbed 3 4 chlorine pcbs 4 2 the critical role of biofilm development the od595 values obtained quantitatively demonstrate a rapid growth in biomass and particularly during the summer test biofilms were not only found in higher levels p 0 001 wilcoxon rank sum test but also showed a higher growth rate in the summer than in the winter it should be noted that the nutrients i e ammonia tn and tp tables s2 3 in the seawater were significantly higher p 0 005 paired t test in the winter than in the summer in addition to temperature and nutrient light condition should also be considered due to its promotion effect on the growth of phototrophs such as algae in shallow waters yeh et al 2011 the average solar irradiance in the summer 28 w m 2 was higher than that in the winter 15 w m 2 but the relative abundance of a major phototroph detected in this study i e cyanobacteria showed no significant difference p 0 572 paired t test between the seasons the weak effect of light on cyanobacteria could be attributed to a strong light attenuation caused by the high turbidity of xiangshan bay 91 112 ntu and the water depth of plastic 0 5 3 5 m this result demonstrates that temperature was a more central factor in governing microbial growth than other environmental factors rao 2010 consistently a similar seasonal trend in biofilms was observed in a one year exposure test conducted in the north sea de tender et al 2017 apparently larger biomasses can directly correlate with aromatic hydrocarbon degradation due to more active microbial metabolism and respiration romero et al 1998 moreover a large biomass serves as the basic evaluative criterion for efficient biofilm reactor operation in environmental engineering deng et al 2016 therefore the higher biomass of biofilms tested can be identified as one of the factors spurring the greater decline in pahs during the summer test conversely the bacterial community showed a higher level of taxa richness in the winter than in summer as exhibited by the larger number of bacterial otus found within the first two weeks higher nutrient levels tables s2 3 and figs s3 5 and moderate temperatures 13 7 16 3 c week 1 2 may have promoted faster biofilm formation in the early winter test oberbeckmann et al 2018 after that however a rapid decrease of otu number was found along with an obvious decrease of temperature 9 6 14 4 c week 3 5 the chao1 index was significantly lower p 0 01 paired t test in the summer than in the winter further corroborating the lower level of bacterial richness found in the summer as noted by zettler et al 2013 a lower richness can be expected in more selective and metabolically active populations of bacteria on a plastic surface thus it can be inferred that microbial activity was lower in the winter than in the summer we also observed more dispersion in nmds ordination space in the summer than in the winter suggesting a higher level of microbial community succession liang et al 2015 vergeynst et al 2018 found the main effect of low temperatures on the biodegradation of hydrocarbons to involve delayed microbial community succession and consequently lower microbial activity and slower degradation rates furthermore a co occurrence network analysis fig s11 and table s7 suggests that while the summer test covered a smaller network i e node number the microbial interactions of pe attached bacterial community was more complex and active in the summer as indicated by a higher clustering coefficient and shorter average path length faust and raes 2012 zhou et al 2010 it is reasonable to infer that the more complex and efficient bacterial community in the summer encouraged pah degradation due to stronger cooperation with pollutants and environmental changes the results of this study demonstrate that high temperatures led to higher levels of bacterial activity for the biofilms corresponding to a stronger degradation of the attached contaminants in addition to bacterial activity the presence of degrading bacteria constitutes another critical factor in determining the extent and rate of hoc biodegradation haritash and kaushik 2009 mcgenity et al 2012 we hypothesized that high concentrations of pahs enriched by mp could stimulate the succession of pah degrading bacteria harrison et al 2011 roager and sonnenschein 2019 some putative pah degrading bacteria were indeed detected in this study including members of families erythrobacteraceae erythrobacter harwati et al 2007 zhuang et al 2015 rhodobacteraceae gallego et al 2014 gutierrez et al 2011 pinyakong et al 2012 sphingomonadaceae luo et al 2012 sohn et al 2004 ye et al 1996 planococcaceae planococcus labuzek et al 2003 bacillaceae bacillus bisht et al 2014 and exiguobacterium edlund and jansson 2008 moraxellaceae yuan et al 2014 and pseudomonadaceae pseudomonas niepceron et al 2009 members of family sphingomonadaceae sphingomicrobium are well known pah degraders and were particularly characterized by a capacity to degrade mmw pahs and some hmw pahs luo et al 2012 sohn et al 2004 ye et al 1996 members of family rhodobacteraceae have been reported to play an important role in pah degradation in marine environments gallego et al 2014 gutierrez et al 2011 pinyakong et al 2012 and they have mostly been reported to affect the degradation of lmw pahs gutierrez et al 2011 we found that the largest decreases in lmw pahs and mmw pahs during the summer test occurred just after family rhodobacteraceae and genus sphingomicrobium reached their highest relative abundances respectively fig 6 a b this result supports the hypothesis that some sorbed hocs can be degraded by degradation bacteria moreover the highest levels of rhodobacteraceae appeared in week 3 when genus sphingomicrobium was still at a low abundance but this outcome also corresponded with a slight decrease in mmw pahs in week 4 an analysis based on individual congeners indicates that flt represented a major proportion 39 4 5 6 of the observed decline in mmw pahs compared to other mmw pahs flt has been reported to degrade more easily zhou et al 2008 this result further supports our expectation that rhodobacteraceae prefers to degrade lmw pahs rather than mmw and hmw pahs for hmw pahs however it is obvious that neither degrading bacteria were capable of effectively reducing concentrations during the exposure period fig 6c corroborating similar results of a previous study rochman et al 2013 sorbed hmw pahs show strong resistance against biodegradation even under the high temperature and nutrient conditions in xiangshan bay 4 3 further evidence showing biofilm effects on hocs analyzing the biodegradation pathways of hocs is beyond the scope of this work however tracking concentrations of degradation intermediate can facilitate a deeper understanding of pah dynamics in both seasons concentrations of sa were positively related to the decreases in pahs supporting the presence of biodegradation processes moreover a lower molar value of sa increase than pah decrease was observed this phenomenon is reasonable given that sa was only one of the multiple intermediates involved and it cannot reflect all degraded pahs cao et al 2015 the higher levels of bacterial degradation observed in the summer may be reflected not only by higher levels of sa production but also by the greater difference between sa increase and pah decrease since pahs can be degraded more fully than sa on the other hand an inhibition of temperature during bacterial degradation can be observed from low sa concentrations measured during the winter test 5 conclusions among the multiple concerns over microplastic s potential roles in aquatic ecosystems its vector role in hazardous chemicals has attracted much inquiry with understanding of microplastic s biogeochemical processes is deepening it has been recognized that the formation of biofilms may lead to an uncertain deviation from data obtained on virgin mp sorption the present study based on an in situ investigation of xiangshan bay in china confirms this deviation interactions between attached microorganisms and pollutants in the plastisphere can vary significantly and essentially depending on microbial activity and pollutant features the great difference in sorption dynamics driven by microbial activity observed in this study implies that the assessment of microplastic s pollutant vector effects may be a complex task microbial degradation was strong enough to change the sorption dynamics of certain contaminants whereas this change would be not the case for refractory pollutants or under low temperatures it can be inferred that the pollutant vector effect of microplastic could be much stronger in frigid oligotrophic water than in warm eutrophic bays therefore more in situ studies conducted across broad geographical scales are necessary at a micro level the metabolic pathways of contaminants involving various attached aquatic microorganisms and the resulting change in toxicology induced by selective biodegradation also require further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17658,microplastic mp has been identified as an emerging vector that transports hydrophobic organic compounds hocs across aquatic environments due to its hydrophobic surfaces and small size however it is also recognized that environmental factors affect mp s chemical vector effects and that attached biofilms could play a major role although the specific mechanisms remain unclear to explore this issue an in situ experiment was conducted at xiangshan bay of southeastern china and dynamics of hocs i e polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and bacterial communities related to the model mp i e pe fibers were analyzed and compared through bacterial characterizations including the 16s rrna approach higher summer temperatures 31 4 1 07 c were found to promote colonizing bacterial assemblages with larger biomasses higher activity and more degrading bacteria than winter temperatures 13 3 2 49 c consequently some sorbed pollutants underwent significant decline in the summer and this decline was particularly the case for pahs with low 2 3 rings and median 4 rings molecular weights such as phenanthrene 59 4 1 6 chrysene 70 6 4 2 fluoranthene 77 1 13 3 and benz a anthracene 71 5 11 0 in our winter test however most pollutants underwent a consistent increase throughout the 8 week exposure period moreover more biorefractory pollutants including pcbs and high molecular weight 5 6 rings pahs accumulated regardless of bacterial characteristics two putative pah degrading bacteria appeared with high relative abundances during the summer test i e family rhodobacteraceae 18 6 0 5 and genus sphingomicrobium 22 4 3 6 associated with drastic decreases in low 45 2 0 4 and median 66 0 2 5 molecular weight pahs respectively bacterial degradation effects of biofilms on pahs are also supported by the correlative dynamics of salicylic acid an important degradation intermediate of pahs the results of this study indicate that mp s hoc vector effects are essentially determined by interactions between attached pollutants and microbial assemblages which are further related to bacterial activity and pollutant features further studies of biofilm effects on mp toxicity and on the metabolic pathways of mp attached hocs are required graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic debris biofouling sorption biodegradation pollutant carrier 1 introduction microplastic mp has attracted considerable attention not only due to its potential threats to organisms wright et al 2013 but also given its unclear biogeochemical roles in aquatic environments rummel et al 2017 in addition to the toxic effects of plastic itself cole et al 2013 and those of additives koelmans et al 2014 the vector effects of microplastics in enriching and transferring hazardous chemicals and microorganisms have been a major concern koelmans et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 this concern is reflected by the rapid increase in the number of studies published on this issue in recent years from assessments of microplastic s chemical sorption capacities based on laboratory tests guo and wang 2019 zuo et al 2019 and field collected samples chen et al 2018b gauquie et al 2015 to the characterization of plastic colonizing microbial assemblages for identifying alien taxa and pathogenic microbes gregory 1999 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 the published data provide clear evidence showing that hydrophobic and rough surfaces can facilitate microplastics serving as effective substratum for hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs wang et al 2018 and various suspended microbes rummel et al 2017 in seawater compared to natural suspended solids e g sediment and wood some unique vector effects of mp have been detected such as the much higher uptake of hocs beckingham and ghosh 2017 and the distinctive biofilm communities oberbeckmann et al 2018 through vector effects regional hazardous substances can be transported long distances syberg et al 2015 and into a broad food web setÃ¤lÃ¤ et al 2014 which may aggravate the ecological risks associated with microplastic in fact concerns regarding the hoc vector effects of marine plastic debris were raised before the term microplastic was first defined in 2004 thompson et al 2004 mato et al 2001 even conducted an in situ study 7 days on how resin pellets may serve as a transport medium for toxic chemicals in 2001 over the past few years abundant sorption data on virgin microplastics and contaminants wang et al 2018 have become available and the relevant sorption mechanisms have been investigated liu et al 2019 laboratory tests can serve as an initial means to understand microplastic s theoretical sorption characteristics but they are not sufficient in conducting an accurate assessment of microplastic s vector effects on aquatic environments laboratory tests can miss essential links of biological chemical and physical processes as microplastic is transported through aquatic environments and a lack of understanding of biofilm effects could constitute a major shortcoming rummel et al 2017 biofilm formation i e biofouling is the consequence of frequent and rapid interactions between microplastics and aquatic environments loeb and neihof 1975 biofilms are composed of diverse communities of microbes such as bacteria algae protozoans and fungi which are mostly embedded in an abundant extracellular polymeric substance eps rummel et al 2017 biofouling turns plastic particles into a dual domain i e a plastic core with an outer shell of organic matter endo and koelmans 2019 and in turn many biogeochemical behaviors of mp such as vertical transport pollutant microorganism transport and toxicity can consequently change rummel et al 2017 recently the knowledge gap regarding how biofilms impact the uptake and fate of mp associated pollutants has been highlighted rochman et al 2013 rummel et al 2017 zettler et al 2013 and in situ experiments considering environmentally relevant factors have been suggested rummel et al 2017 relative to studies focused on mp associated microbial assemblages oberbeckmann et al 2015 fewer in situ studies have been conducted on the dynamics of mp associated pollutants moreover due to a lack of combinative analyses on the dynamics of attached pollutants and microbial communities the mechanisms of biofilm effects on pollutants remain underexplored based on the results of passive sampling tests feng et al 2016 biofilm formation may constitute an obstacle to the uptake of hocs on surfaces of plastic samplers rochman et al 2013 found sorptive concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs with low and median molecular weights to decrease significantly after one month moreover a recent incubation experiment showed that colonizing microbes can more significantly and quickly degrade mp sorbed polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs than sediment sorbed ones rosato et al 2020 currently in situ data showing simultaneous variations of mp attached pollutants and microorganisms are not available resulting in a poor understanding of the role of biofilms this study aims to reveal mechanisms underlying biofilm s impacts on mp sorbed hocs through an in situ experiment examining temporal variations of bacterial communities and hocs most of the few available in situ studies on mp sorption have been conducted in regions characterized by cold weather and light pollution loads mato et al 2001 rochman et al 2013 and thus do not focus theoretical understanding of biofilms development oberbeckmann et al 2018 rao 2010 in contrast we selected xiangshan bay a subtropical bay in southeastern china suffering from high pollutant levels gu and xiang 2002 resulting from land and mariculture activities as an exposure site to ensure substantial biofilm growth in the model mp i e polyethylene pe fibers obtained from fishing nets experiments were designed with three objectives 1 targeting pollutants with different physicochemical properties i e pahs and pcbs to examine how different hocs respond to biofilm development 2 using the 16s rrna approach and quantifying degrading intermediates to explore how biofilms affect the fate of mp sorbed hocs and provide chemical evidence and 3 conducting comparative experiments in the summer and winter to evaluate the influence of temperature dependent bacterial activity we hypothesized that interactions between hocs and biofilms on mp would vary among pollutants and bacterial communities leading to different hoc vector effects we expected the data derived from this in situ study to address basic uncertainties concerning biofilm effects on sorbed hocs and to provide useful insights for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site an enclosure type mariculture farm located in the interior area of xiangshan bay figs 1a and s1a a semi enclosed narrow bay along the southeastern coast of china was selected as the field site for the in situ test of microplastic xiangshan bay suffers from a high nutrient load due to slow water exchange and anthropogenic inputs during the studied period july 2018 to january 2019 high nutrient concentrations were examined in seawater from the site table s2 the bay was also affected by contaminants from a shipyard positioned close to the study site as shown in figs 1a and s1b an unregulated leakage of machine oil and diesel was observed during our previous sampling cruise potentially representing a point source of pahs for the bay the studied mariculture farm was mainly used for crab culture which was enclosed with pe nets as shown in fig s1a a total of 20 1 0 2 mean sd n 2 mp items per m3 of water with a lower size

2 2 1 model mp preparation high density polyethylene hdpe hereinafter referred to as pe nets are widely employed in xiangshan bay and particularly to enclose culture due to their high levels in the previous studies chen et al 2018a iÃ±iguez et al 2017 hdpe fibers were used as a surrogate of mp in this study hdpe ropes were first obtained from a local fishing gear company and their chemical composition were characterized by the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy fig s2 each rope was composed of fifteen twisted fibers of 0 22 mm in diameter a pe cluster was formed with ten sticks of 20 cm pe rope i e containing 150 pe fibers with a total weight of 0 900 1 100 g the ropes were burned together with a 1 cm bonded end each pe rope was then manually loosened to fully separate the fibers from each other figs 1b and s1c to remove potentially adhered organic compounds the pe clusters were soaked in methanol for 24 h followed by 10 min of supersonic treatment and air dried under ambient temperature three dried pe bunches were then tied together as a pe fiber set i e for use as three replicates for a temporal test fig s1c 2 2 2 model mp deployment and recovery the pe fiber set was tied to a wooden pole at a fixed immersion depth in the seawater fig 1 b the wooden poles were firmly inserted into the sediment and the depth of the pe fiber set varied from 0 5 to 3 5 m below the water surface depending on tide levels the sets were installed in july and november of 2018 representing the summer and winter seasons respectively exposure times were set to 1 2 3 4 and 8 weeks at each time point one pole was removed and three pe bunches were recovered and separately packed into premade aluminum bags the chemical and bacterial data for the pe biofilm assemblages were determined based on the three replicates meanwhile 5 l of the ambient seawater were collected and stored in a pre combusted brown glass bottle for the determination of hoc concentrations and water quality indices data shown in tables s2 3 and figs s3 5 all of the plastic and seawater samples were stored on ice during their transport to the laboratory the recovered pe fibers were frozen at 80 c

across samples for downstream analysis alpha diversity indices chao1 index and shannon diversity index were then computed using the diversity function available through the vegan package of r version

concentrations of attached hocs 3 1 1 total concentrations across the two seasons studied sorbed concentrations of pahs 704 5 201 9 ng g 1 n 10 were approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of pcbs 85 1 21 0 ng g 1 n 10 fig 2 a and b concentrations of sorbed pahs increased before decreasing over the two seasons maximum values of 1 092 5 93 0 ng g 1 week 3 and 826 0 50 3 ng g 1 week 4 were reached in the summer and winter respectively in the winter pcb levels increased before decreasing to a maximum value of 122 2 0 5 ng g 1 in week 4 and varied irregularly during the summer test 3 1 2 individual compounds the congeners of pahs and pcbs were further grouped according to the number of benzene rings and chlorine atoms in the summer the number of low lmw 2 3 rings and median molecular weight mmw 4 rings pahs dramatically decreased after reaching the highest sorption concentrations fig 2c on average lmw and mmw pah levels decreased by 45 2 0 4 n 6 and 66 0 2 5 n 4 respectively among these congeners phe 59 4 1 6 chr 77 1 13 3 flt 70 9 0 4 and baa 71 5 11 0 underwent especially strong decreases fig 2c in the winter decreases were less pronounced lmw 14 0 5 7 mmw 20 8 9 7 and occurred later on all occurred during the last exposure relative to the summer test on the other hand most of the high molecular weight hmw 5 6 rings pahs underwent a consistent increase fig 2c and e on average hmw pah levels increased by 91 1 5 2 and 675 8 298 9 in the summer and winter respectively for pcbs the average sorbed concentrations of cb 52 were approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of the other congeners fig 2d and f during the summer test with the exception of cb 101 and cb 194 most congeners reached their highest concentrations in the first week which was followed by differing levels of decline in the winter test temporal patterns were reversed with the exception of cb 101 and cb 194 most congeners showed a cumulative increase 3 2 biomass and diversity dynamics of the attached biofilms in both seasons od595 values continuously increased p 0 005 anova fig 3 a attached biofilms showed significantly higher od595 values in the summer than in the winter p 0 005 paired t test this result corroborates our field observations of visibly thicker and darker biofilms in the summer than in the winter based on the 16s rrna sequencing data the richness of bacterial communities in biofilms was assessed by otu number and the chao1 index fig 3b and c in contrast to the biomass results more otus i e the total number of otus in the season were found in the winter 3 783 than in the summer 2 944 we found no significant difference p 0 111 paired t test in the number of otus between seasons the chao1 index shows a similar trend in the number of otus and the winter test shows statistically higher numbers than the summer test p 0 005 paired t test additionally temporal trends of the shannon diversity index fig 3d were found to mimic otu quantities and chao1 index values but no significant differences were found between seasons p 0 263 paired t test compositional variations in the pe attached bacterial community over the two seasons were assessed by calculating the bray curtis similarity index and visualizing the resulting distance matrix via nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds fig 3e when comparing all of the times series datasets a clear cluster separating the summer and winter tests is observed with a significant difference anosim r 0 613 p 0 001 table s4 within individual seasons no significant differences were found between any paired tests 3 3 temporal variations in bacterial community composition in terms of taxonomic compositions bacterial communities were composed differently between the two seasons at the phylum level fig s6 proteobacteria dominated all bacterial communities in both the summer 53 3 19 4 and winter 58 8 7 6 tests firmicutes exhibited an exceptionally high relative abundance 67 6 37 0 in the first week of the summer and a moderate abundance in the second week of the winter test 11 2 3 5 at the family level fig s7 the three most abundant families were erythrobacteraceae rhodobacteraceae and flavobacteriaceae notably in the summer test the relative abundance of sphingomonadaceae increased dramatically to 22 6 3 6 in the fourth week and then decreased to 7 8 3 5 during the final exposure at the genus level fig s8 erythrobacter accounted for 17 6 8 6 and 22 3 15 1 of bacterial communities in the summer and winter respectively a high relative abundance 22 4 3 6 of sphingomicrobium appeared in week 4 of the summer test significantly discriminant taxa that may explain the variations found between bacterial communities in the different samples were explored with a linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse segata et al 2011 a lefse analysis fig 4 and table s5 identified significantly discriminative taxa as biomarkers across all of the exposure data most biomarkers appeared in bacterial communities during the summer test and especially in later stage of the tests from week 3 to week 8 in contrast the communities included much fewer discriminants during the winter 3 4 concentrations of pah degradation intermediate as a typical pah biodegradation intermediate salicylic acid sa was examined to further verify the biodegradation of the sorbed pahs cumulative decreases in pahs were calculated see further information given in the si section and are illustrated with sa production trends in fig 5 in both seasons sa showed relatively low concentrations 0 09 0 22 nmol g 1 within the first three weeks then a strong increase in sa and decrease in pahs appeared from week 4 during the summer test moreover decreases in pahs during the summer were significantly more pronounced than increases in sa observed from week 4 to week 8 in contrast sa concentrations underwent only a slight increase in the last exposure during the winter 0 8 nmol g 1 and decreases in pahs and increases in sa were very similar throughout the winter test 4 discussion 4 1 hocs exhibited diverse dynamics in pe fibers regardless of how hocs varied temporally attached pahs performed approximately an order of magnitude more uptake than pcbs p 0 001 paired t test regardless of seasonal and environmental factors this difference is approximately comparable with that between the background concentrations of pahs and pcbs in the seawater figs s3 4 indicating the influence of background concentration this phenomenon has been widely observed in microplastics in the oceans bouhroum et al 2019 gauquie et al 2015 rios et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 and might reflect the fact that pcbs have been found in lower concentrations than pahs since the ban of 1970 rochman et al 2013 notably pollutant concentrations found in this study closely mimic mp data for the northern chinese coastline zhang et al 2015 among the temporal variations in hocs observed sorbed pahs in the summer were the most distinctive undergoing a significant increase until week 3 followed by a drastic decrease to week 8 this phenomenon corroborates our expectation that some attached hocs can be degraded by colonizing microorganisms from the few published in situ studies on this issue we found similar trends from a one year field exposure test conducted in san diego bay rochman et al 2013 among their target hocs i e pahs and pcbs concentrations of lmw and mmw pahs showed clear decreases after reaching sorption peaks whereas concentrations of hmw pahs increased throughout this result reflects the well known fact that the biodegradability of pahs declines with an increase in molecular weight haritash and kaushik 2009 peng et al 2008 rochman et al 2014 examined various metals in mps but found no such decrease which could also be attributed to the bioinert features of metals singh and cameotra 2004 results from our summer test also indicate that lmw pah concentrations reached a sorption maximum and began to decrease earlier on than the mmw pahs this trend is consistent with previous sorption studies showing that less hydrophobic pahs reach equilibrium at a faster rate mÃ¼ller et al 2001 in the winter test however temporal variations of all of the pahs showed a consistently increasing trend throughout the exposure period hmw pahs underwent a more significant increase than in the summer and bbf did not undergo the same decrease observed during the summer test while little published data on seasonal differences in hoc uptake are available a break in the decline in mmw pah levels during the winter is described in rochman et al 2013 as a result a clear temporal change in pah compositions was observed fig s9 in the first week of both seasons pah compositions were comparable as follows lmw 48 3 vs 49 5 summer vs winter mmw 40 4 vs 42 0 hmw 11 3 vs 8 6 low and similar biomasses of attached biofilms should be the main reason for this trend due to weak biofouling effects feng et al 2016 rios et al 2007 afterwards compositions of pahs shifted towards higher proportions of hmw pahs and compositions during final exposure were comparable this outcome suggests that plastic colonizing microbes may transform pah compositions to a higher proportion of hmw pah congeners which could pose a higher levels of genotoxicity to ingestive marine organisms cerniglia 1993 a further investigation of this transform is needed pcbs underwent irregular and increasing trends during the summer and winter tests respectively with the exception of some congeners with very low concentrations 10 ng g 1 few congeners underwent significant declines during the test despite the irregular temporal variations of pcbs in the seawater fig s5 such as the cb 194 in the summer and the cb 52 in the winter a cumulative increase of the sorbed concentration was achieved this result is consistent with the data of rochman et al 2013 which show an overall increase in all 21 pcbs congeners over one year of exposure this result echoes the trends of hmw pahs specifically pcbs table s6 are characterized by high molecular weights 250 and hydrophobicity log k ow 5 2 which also discriminates hmw pahs from other pahs in terms of bioavailability pcbs have been assessed to present much lower levels than pahs brÃ¤ndli et al 2007 liu et al 2007 an investigation of biofilm effects shows that both pcbs and hmw pahs might serve as relatively high recalcitrant pollutants which benefits the establishment of a good gradient of bioavailability therefore based on the results given above our further discussion of pollutant biodegradation focuses on the dynamics of lmw and hmw pahs moreover the temporal change in pcb compositions fig s10 showed a stable pattern in the summer while an increasing proportion of the 3 4 chlorine pcbs was found in the winter as shown in fig s5 b and d the concentrations of 3 4 chlorine pcbs e g ccb 44 and cb 52 in the seawater were much higher than that in the summer which could explain the increasingly high proportion of the sorbed 3 4 chlorine pcbs 4 2 the critical role of biofilm development the od595 values obtained quantitatively demonstrate a rapid growth in biomass and particularly during the summer test biofilms were not only found in higher levels p 0 001 wilcoxon rank sum test but also showed a higher growth rate in the summer than in the winter it should be noted that the nutrients i e ammonia tn and tp tables s2 3 in the seawater were significantly higher p 0 005 paired t test in the winter than in the summer in addition to temperature and nutrient light condition should also be considered due to its promotion effect on the growth of phototrophs such as algae in shallow waters yeh et al 2011 the average solar irradiance in the summer 28 w m 2 was higher than that in the winter 15 w m 2 but the relative abundance of a major phototroph detected in this study i e cyanobacteria showed no significant difference p 0 572 paired t test between the seasons the weak effect of light on cyanobacteria could be attributed to a strong light attenuation caused by the high turbidity of xiangshan bay 91 112 ntu and the water depth of plastic 0 5 3 5 m this result demonstrates that temperature was a more central factor in governing microbial growth than other environmental factors rao 2010 consistently a similar seasonal trend in biofilms was observed in a one year exposure test conducted in the north sea de tender et al 2017 apparently larger biomasses can directly correlate with aromatic hydrocarbon degradation due to more active microbial metabolism and respiration romero et al 1998 moreover a large biomass serves as the basic evaluative criterion for efficient biofilm reactor operation in environmental engineering deng et al 2016 therefore the higher biomass of biofilms tested can be identified as one of the factors spurring the greater decline in pahs during the summer test conversely the bacterial community showed a higher level of taxa richness in the winter than in summer as exhibited by the larger number of bacterial otus found within the first two weeks higher nutrient levels tables s2 3 and figs s3 5 and moderate temperatures 13 7 16 3 c week 1 2 may have promoted faster biofilm formation in the early winter test oberbeckmann et al 2018 after that however a rapid decrease of otu number was found along with an obvious decrease of temperature 9 6 14 4 c week 3 5 the chao1 index was significantly lower p 0 01 paired t test in the summer than in the winter further corroborating the lower level of bacterial richness found in the summer as noted by zettler et al 2013 a lower richness can be expected in more selective and metabolically active populations of bacteria on a plastic surface thus it can be inferred that microbial activity was lower in the winter than in the summer we also observed more dispersion in nmds ordination space in the summer than in the winter suggesting a higher level of microbial community succession liang et al 2015 vergeynst et al 2018 found the main effect of low temperatures on the biodegradation of hydrocarbons to involve delayed microbial community succession and consequently lower microbial activity and slower degradation rates furthermore a co occurrence network analysis fig s11 and table s7 suggests that while the summer test covered a smaller network i e node number the microbial interactions of pe attached bacterial community was more complex and active in the summer as indicated by a higher clustering coefficient and shorter average path length faust and raes 2012 zhou et al 2010 it is reasonable to infer that the more complex and efficient bacterial community in the summer encouraged pah degradation due to stronger cooperation with pollutants and environmental changes the results of this study demonstrate that high temperatures led to higher levels of bacterial activity for the biofilms corresponding to a stronger degradation of the attached contaminants in addition to bacterial activity the presence of degrading bacteria constitutes another critical factor in determining the extent and rate of hoc biodegradation haritash and kaushik 2009 mcgenity et al 2012 we hypothesized that high concentrations of pahs enriched by mp could stimulate the succession of pah degrading bacteria harrison et al 2011 roager and sonnenschein 2019 some putative pah degrading bacteria were indeed detected in this study including members of families erythrobacteraceae erythrobacter harwati et al 2007 zhuang et al 2015 rhodobacteraceae gallego et al 2014 gutierrez et al 2011 pinyakong et al 2012 sphingomonadaceae luo et al 2012 sohn et al 2004 ye et al 1996 planococcaceae planococcus labuzek et al 2003 bacillaceae bacillus bisht et al 2014 and exiguobacterium edlund and jansson 2008 moraxellaceae yuan et al 2014 and pseudomonadaceae pseudomonas niepceron et al 2009 members of family sphingomonadaceae sphingomicrobium are well known pah degraders and were particularly characterized by a capacity to degrade mmw pahs and some hmw pahs luo et al 2012 sohn et al 2004 ye et al 1996 members of family rhodobacteraceae have been reported to play an important role in pah degradation in marine environments gallego et al 2014 gutierrez et al 2011 pinyakong et al 2012 and they have mostly been reported to affect the degradation of lmw pahs gutierrez et al 2011 we found that the largest decreases in lmw pahs and mmw pahs during the summer test occurred just after family rhodobacteraceae and genus sphingomicrobium reached their highest relative abundances respectively fig 6 a b this result supports the hypothesis that some sorbed hocs can be degraded by degradation bacteria moreover the highest levels of rhodobacteraceae appeared in week 3 when genus sphingomicrobium was still at a low abundance but this outcome also corresponded with a slight decrease in mmw pahs in week 4 an analysis based on individual congeners indicates that flt represented a major proportion 39 4 5 6 of the observed decline in mmw pahs compared to other mmw pahs flt has been reported to degrade more easily zhou et al 2008 this result further supports our expectation that rhodobacteraceae prefers to degrade lmw pahs rather than mmw and hmw pahs for hmw pahs however it is obvious that neither degrading bacteria were capable of effectively reducing concentrations during the exposure period fig 6c corroborating similar results of a previous study rochman et al 2013 sorbed hmw pahs show strong resistance against biodegradation even under the high temperature and nutrient conditions in xiangshan bay 4 3 further evidence showing biofilm effects on hocs analyzing the biodegradation pathways of hocs is beyond the scope of this work however tracking concentrations of degradation intermediate can facilitate a deeper understanding of pah dynamics in both seasons concentrations of sa were positively related to the decreases in pahs supporting the presence of biodegradation processes moreover a lower molar value of sa increase than pah decrease was observed this phenomenon is reasonable given that sa was only one of the multiple intermediates involved and it cannot reflect all degraded pahs cao et al 2015 the higher levels of bacterial degradation observed in the summer may be reflected not only by higher levels of sa production but also by the greater difference between sa increase and pah decrease since pahs can be degraded more fully than sa on the other hand an inhibition of temperature during bacterial degradation can be observed from low sa concentrations measured during the winter test 5 conclusions among the multiple concerns over microplastic s potential roles in aquatic ecosystems its vector role in hazardous chemicals has attracted much inquiry with understanding of microplastic s biogeochemical processes is deepening it has been recognized that the formation of biofilms may lead to an uncertain deviation from data obtained on virgin mp sorption the present study based on an in situ investigation of xiangshan bay in china confirms this deviation interactions between attached microorganisms and pollutants in the plastisphere can vary significantly and essentially depending on microbial activity and pollutant features the great difference in sorption dynamics driven by microbial activity observed in this study implies that the assessment of microplastic s pollutant vector effects may be a complex task microbial degradation was strong enough to change the sorption dynamics of certain contaminants whereas this change would be not the case for refractory pollutants or under low temperatures it can be inferred that the pollutant vector effect of microplastic could be much stronger in frigid oligotrophic water than in warm eutrophic bays therefore more in situ studies conducted across broad geographical scales are necessary at a micro level the metabolic pathways of contaminants involving various attached aquatic microorganisms and the resulting change in toxicology induced by selective biodegradation also require further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17659,to maintain the integrity of the internal surfaces of the pipelines in oil and gas industry chemicals including corrosion inhibitors and biocides are commonly dosed to prevent corrosion imidazoline and its derivatives are widely used corrosion inhibitors for the protection of oil pipelines which have been shown effective in reducing general corrosion as an effective biocide free nitrous acid fna is suitable to inhibit microbially influenced corrosion induced by for example sulfate reducing bacteria in this paper we hypothesize that the continuous addition of imidazoline and intermittent dosing of fna when used in combination would yield effective control of both general and pitting corrosions as a typical imidazoline derivative n b hydroxyethyl oleyl imidazoline hei 17 was applied in conjunction with intermittent dosing of fna in the experimental system with the results compared with two control systems one receiving hei 17 only and one receiving no chemical dosing the corrosion properties were monitored with open circuit potential electrochemical impedance spectroscopy linear polarization resistance 3d optical profiling and weight loss measurement following a single dose of fna the general corrosion rates in the experimental reactor dropped up to 50 of that in the reactor receiving continuous hei 17 dosing 0 27 0 04 vs 0 54 0 08 mm y but gradually recovered to 93 4 of that in 2 5 months after the fna treatment the pitting corrosion was decreased by 64 6 compared with continuous hei 17 dosing reactor for a month from measuring the cumulative distribution of the pitting depth hei 17 treatment alone showed moderate pitting corrosion inhibition effect approx 27 and the fna treatment inhibited the formation of deep pits effectively the combined application of hei 17 and fna has shown synergistic effects and high efficiency in mitigating mic in the simulated water injection system this treatment strategy has strong potential to be applied in the practical oilfield operations graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbially influenced corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria free nitrous acid imidazoline derivative pitting corrosion corrosion inhibition 1 introduction since most oilfields in the world are in the middle or late recovery periods corrosion has become a skyrocketing problem in the secondary oil recovery which normally involves water injection microbially influenced corrosion mic refers to the corrosion caused or enhanced by microbial activities which is believed to be responsible for about 40 of pipeline system failures in the oil industry while the percentage could be much higher in water injection systems graves and sullivan 1966 mic could not only be responsible for the localized corrosion and leakage of the pipelines but also lead to decrease of production and potential safety issues zhong et al 2019 the corrosion inhibitors are chemicals that decrease or prevent corrosion when added in small concentrations usually at 1 20 in batch treatment or in the range of 10 1000 ppm continuously raja and sethuraman 2008 the type and amount of corrosion inhibitors required depend on system corrosivity the use of a corrosion inhibitor can achieve a corrosion rate typically less than 0 1 mm year in most cases kermani 2017 corrosion inhibitors are mainly effective in reducing general corrosion inhibition by forming a film on the surface of the steel preventing the surface from corrosive attack hobbs 2014 as widely used corrosion inhibitors in oilfields imidazoline and its derivatives showed their advantages with high inhibition efficiency easy production and low toxicity kelland 2014 imidazoline based corrosion inhibitors have been widely used for the protection of oil pipelines for many years though the inhibitory mechanism hasn t been fully explained wang et al 2011 after being immersed in 2 nacl solution saturated with co2 with 0 08 mmol dm3 1 2 thioureidoethyl 2 alkyl imidazoline for 72 h the corrosion rate of q235 steel coupon was inhibited by 88 6 compared with that submerged in the medium with no imidazoline wang et al 2011 similarly polarization curves showed that 20 ppm hydroxyethyl inhibited 1018 carbon steel corrosion by 87 2 when exposed to 3 nacl medium with 10 diesel for 9 h at 50 c villamizar et al 2007 as mic could induce severe localized corrosion i e pitting corrosion due to the corrosive biofilm biocides are usually applied as they could kill or remove the corrosive microbes javaherdashti 2008 glutaraldehyde is one of the most commonly used commercial biocides which can be used in a wide range of temperatures and ph turkiewicz et al 2013 it could achieve 5 log reduction i e 99 999 killing of bacteria in biofilm at 1000 ppm with 2 h treatment or at 100 ppm with 24 h treatment keasler et al 2011 thps tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate is another maturely used biocide in oilfields which has advantages over other biocides as it has low toxicity and dissolves iron sulfide in pipelines mcilwaine 2005 turkiewicz et al 2013 free nitrous acid fna i e the protonated form of nitrite has been reported to be biocidal to sewage biofilm which was dominated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb e g desulfovibrio vulgaris jiang et al 2011 recently fna has been shown effective to inhibit mic owing to its strong biocidal effect on corrosive biofilm on steel zhong et al 2020 fna decreased the average pitting corrosion rate by 59 with 2 intermittent treatments and 82 day interval over 304 days compared with the pitting corrosion fna showed a moderate inhibitory effect on general corrosion up to 31 considering the complementary nature of the corrosion inhibitors and biocides in practical oil production process the pipelines corrosion is often mitigated through the simultaneous use of multiple chemicals including both corrosion inhibitors and biocides heidersbach 2018 kermani and chevrot 2012 we hypothesize that as a biocide fna may also be used in combination with an inhibitor to achieve simultaneous inhibition of both general corrosion and pitting corrosion different from many other biocides such as glutaraldehyde and thps which need to be dosed daily or added continuously in injection water fna requires intermittent dosing only once every a few months zhong et al 2020 therefore the synergistic effects of fna with a corrosion inhibitor if proven will potentially lead to the development of a more cost effect strategy to mitigate corrosion of oil production systems as a typical imidazoline derivative n b hydroxyethyl oleyl imidazoline hei 17 was selected to be applied with fna in this study to investigate the combined effect on the corrosion behaviour of carbon steel the hypothesis is that hei 17 and fna could show a synergetic effect on mic control as hei 17 could mitigate the general corrosion as a corrosion inhibitor and fna has strong pitting corrosion inhibition efficiency the corrosion properties were investigated by electrochemical measurements including open circuit potential ocp electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and linear polarization resistance lpr the general corrosion rate was calculated by weight loss measurements while the pitting corrosion was analyzed by 3d optical profiling 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and monitoring protocol three bioreactors were operated to simulate the water injection systems in oil production fig s1 each of the acrylic bioreactors height 150 mm inner diameter 130 mm volume 1 99 l were assembled with 6 removable plastic rods holding 4 carbon steel coupons each yangzhou branch of environmental protection equipment limited 20 10 2 mm the carbon steel is composed of by weight 0 43 c 0 58 mn 0 22 si 0 012 p 0 008 s 0 01 cr 0 01 cu 0 01 ni and 98 72 fe the coupons were pretreated to reach an identical surface property including sanded to a certain degree of surface finish using 600 800 and 1200 grit silicon carbide papers degreased ultrasonically in acetone and washed with anhydrous ethanol before stored in a desiccator to sterilize the coupons they were exposed to 30 wattage ultraviolet uv light for 30 min and then carefully labelled and weighed w 0 prior to inserting into the reactors each reactor was set up with an electrochemical cell the working electrode was a square shaped carbon steel coupon that was embedded in epoxy resin with only one surface exposed 1 cm 1 cm a copper wire was soldered to the coupon for electrical connection a saturated ag agcl electrode and a platinum net were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively the reactors were seeded with 200 ml produced water collected from an oilfield at mereenie northern territory australia and then topped up with synthetic seawater recipe shown in section 2 2 one of them was operated as control with neither hei 17 fig s2 for its structure nor fna dosed the other two reactors were operated with constant 20 ppm hei 17 dosage sigma aldrich australia both in the initial medium and the feeding medium one without fna treatment marked as control hei 17 and the other as experimental which was treated once on day 47 with 200 mg n l nitrite at ph 6 for 24 h fna 0 49 mg n l calculated with hno2 n no2 n ka 10ph where ka e 2300 270 t c t 22 c the fna treatment conditions were based on our previous study zhong et al 2020 the concentration of the hei 17 used in this study was selected according to previously published results ortega toledo et al 2010 villamizar et al 2007 from day 1 to day 30 the reactors were operated batch wisely with medium replaced by 200 ml fresh synthetic medium every 4 days from day 9 to supply nutrients on day 30 the reactors were switched to continuous feeding mode with a flow rate of 0 35 ml min by a peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps 323s providing a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 days the reactors were constantly mixed with magnetic stirrer at 120 rpm water samples were taken before and after medium change during the batch mode before day 30 and every 4 days during the continuous feeding mode for the analysis of dissolved sulfur compounds and lactate and acetate concentrations section 2 7 electrochemical measurements were conducted every 24 h during the experiment section 2 3 from day 15 to day 120 two coupons were removed from each of the reactors in an anaerobic chamber every 15 2 days for atp adenosine triphosphate as an indicator of microorganisms in biofilms and corrosion analysis the cellular atp levels of the biofilm on the coupons were analyzed immediately after removed from the reactors aseptically as described in section 2 4 all the coupons were then carefully washed dried and analyzed with weight loss measurements section 2 5 and 3d profiling section 2 6 2 2 synthetic produced water the synthetic produced water was synthesized based on a widely used seawater recipe for the feed medium comprising per l distilled water nacl 20 0 g na2so4 3 0 g mgcl2 6h2o 3 0 g cacl2 2h2o 0 15 g kcl 0 5 g kh2po4 0 2 g nh4cl 0 3 g nahco3 solution 30 ml trace element 1 ml hubert et al 2003 nahco3 and trace element solutions were prepared accordingly widdel and bak 1992 the ph was adjusted to 7 2 with 2 mol l hcl solution lactate was added to the synthetic seawater at 5 mol l to provide the microbes with essential carbon source the synthetic produced water was sparged with pure nitrogen gas for 3 h to remove oxygen before use to keep the system oxygen free one 5 l gas bag containing nitrogen gas was connected to the medium container 2 3 electrochemical measurements an electrochemical workstation bio logic sas was used to conduct the electrochemical tests including ocp eis and lpr ocp represents the potential of the working electrode without affecting the electrochemistry on the electrode surface in electrical cells generally metals with nobler ocp are more thermodynamically stable than materials with less noble ocp the eis and lpr measurements were conducted with small amplitude potential over ocp so they were regarded as non destructive methods for corrosion analysis feng and cheng 2017 both lpr and eis measurements were conducted after ocp reached steady state the lpr measurement was carried out in the potential range from 0 02 v to 0 02 v vs ocp at a sweep rate 0 166 mv s to measure the polarization resistance rp which is the slope of the polarization curve the corrosion rate is revealed as it is inversely correlated with rp during eis measurements a small sinusoidal voltage with amplitude v o 10 mv and variable frequency f of 10 2 to 105 hz f Ï 2Ï where Ï is the angular frequency was applied to the system and the response current i Ï t was measured the impedance z Ï t was calculated z v i based on the nyquist and bode plots constructed the zview2 software scribner inc was used to fit the eis data with suitable equivalent circuit models an equivalent circuit is a theoretical circuit that retains all of the electrical characteristics of the electrochemical cell based on which the corrosion behavior on the working electrode surface could be investigated 2 4 atp level measurement in an anaerobic chamber the coupons were carefully sampled aseptically into 4 ml sterilized phosphate buffered saline pbs 1x ph 7 4 in a 5 ml sterile bottle then the bottle was vortexed for 2 min to fully disperse the biofilm for the following atp tests the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation g8231 was used to measure the atp levels according to the manufacturers instructions a volume of 300 Î¼l of biofilm suspension was transferred to one of the wells in a 96 well flat bottom microplate greiner bio one to bind with 100 Î¼l bactiter glo reagent the luminescence of the well was measured by a multimode plate reader clariostar plus after 90 s incubation at 37 c the luminescence was collected as relative light units and converted to atp concentrations nm using a calibration curve made with a known atp standard promega corporation usa filloux et al 2015 2 5 corrosion rate by weight loss the general corrosion rate was calculated from weight loss measurements which were conducted according to astm d 2688 astm international 2015 after the atp level measurement in 2 4 the coupons were then immersed in clarke s solution a mixture of concentrated hcl 2 antimony trioxide sb2o3 and 5 stannous chloride sncl2 and vortexed for 2 min to remove the surface biofilm and corrosion products javed et al 2015 the coupons were then cleaned thoroughly by sonication for 10 min to remove any remaining debris on the surfaces the coupons were rinsed with distilled water cleaned with anhydrous ethanol and dried under high pressure n2 99 5 the coupon s initial weight was marked as w 0 and the weight of the cleaned coupon was marked as w n corrosion rate cr in mm y was calculated as c r n 8 76 10 4 w 0 w n Ï a t where cr n is corrosion rate mm y w n is weight of coupon g Ï is density g cm3 a is surface area cm2 and t is immersion time in the simulated water system h 2 6 pit depth analysis with 3d optical profiling following the weight loss measurements in section 2 5 a 3d optical profiler zeta 300 was used to obtain 3d images and measure the surface roughness of the corroded coupons optical interference profiling is a well established accurate method of measuring height variations on surfaces using the wavelength of light as the ruler chand et al 2011 the bottom and the top of the surface were located by adjusting the focus of the light and the surface was scanned by the light with a step size of 0 2 Î¼m to generate the 3d images the surface depth distribution was generated by the built in software the cumulative distribution of the pitting depth and the pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution were generated accordingly then the averaged pitting corrosion rate could be calculated by the pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution as follows p c r n 365 d n t where pcr n is pitting corrosion rate Î¼m y d n is pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution Î¼m and t is immersion time in the simulated water system d 2 7 chemical analysis to analyze dissolved inorganic sulfur species sulfide sulfate thiosulfate and sulfite 1 5 ml liquid sample from the reactors was filtered 0 22 Î¼m into 0 5 ml preserving solution of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 samples were then analyzed within 24 h on an ion chromatograph with a uv and a conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 1 ml liquid sample taken from the reactors was filtered for fatty acid lactate and acetate analysis by high performance liquid chromatography perkinelmer inc with an hpx 87h 300 mm 7 8 mm biorad aminex ion exclusion hplc column operated at 65 c fatty acids were monitored because some srb strains such as d vulgaris oxidize lactate incompletely to acetate heidelberg et al 2004 which would then become the main carbon source in the medium 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the organic carbon lactate and acetate concentrations are shown in fig 1 a b generally the changes of the lactate and acetate concentrations were relatively comparable between control hei 17 and experimental before fna addition to experimental on day 47 the lactate concentration fig 1a decreased more quickly between day 0 and day 9 in control than those in the other two reactors in the meantime fig 1b the acetate concentration increased to around 240 mg l in the control hei 17 and experimental reactors in the first 13 days while it stayed at a low level 13 mg l in control these demonstrated that the microbes grew more slowly in the experimental and control hei 17 reactors indicating the bacterial inhibitory effect of hei 17 imidazoline derivatives usually contain an amino group which could inhibit growth of planktonic microbes liu et al 2016 the acetate concentration increased immediately after all the three reactors were switched to the continuous feeding mode on day 30 reaching their respective peak on day 43 before starting to decrease the acetate concentration gradually stabilized at around 22 mg l in control and around 42 mg l in control hei 17 from day 60 to day 120 however the fna treatment on day 47 changed the trends of both lactate and acetate concentration in the experimental reactor the lactate concentration in experimental increased from day 48 to day 52 192 mg l indicating that the microbial activities were inhibited by the fna treatment thereafter the lactate concentration decreased back to 0 again on day 74 and acetate concentration reached a relatively stable level ca 53 mg l on day 79 which indicated the start of the recovery of the microbes in all the three reactors the sulfate concentration decreased generally till day 30 fig 1c however the sulfate concentration was lower in the control reactor than in the other two reactors that received hei 17 suggesting that hei reduced the srb activity after the reactors were switched to continuous feeding mode on day 30 the sulfate concentration in all reactors increased and began to decrease 8 days later it reached a steady state around 410 mg s l after day 65 in control which was about 70 mg s l higher than that in control hei 17 again supporting the inhibition of hei 17 on srb the sulfate concentration in experimental was almost the same as that in control hei 17 before day 47 after the fna treatment on day 47 sulfate concentration gradually increased before day 60 reflecting a lowered srb activity and decreased thereafter and stabilized at around 500 mg s l in accordance to the sulfate concentration changes sulfide concentration generally showed an increasing trend in both control and control hei 17 and it gradually stabilized at around 60 mg s l in control and about 40 mg s l in control hei 17 sulfide concentration in experimental dropped to 0 immediately after fna was dosed then it gradually increased to reach a relatively steady level at approximately around 32 mg s l after day 90 both the sulfate and sulfide profiles strongly suggested that the fna treatment on day 47 substantially reduced the srb activity in the reactor as shown in fig 1e the atp level in control was generally higher than that in control hei 17 over the 120 days supporting that hei 17 had an inhibitory effect on microbes it was found that at low concentrations around 10 ppm imidazoline derivatives could inhibit bacterial growth ghasemi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 in this study hei 17 showed moderate inhibitory effect approx 14 7 after 75 days immersion in control hei 17 compared with control in the experimental reactor the atp level decreased immediately to around 11 of the baseline level before fna treatment after fna treatment with fna addition the microbial activity as measured as atp was inhibited by up to 94 7 compared with control then it gradually recovered to the previous level 28 days after the fna treatment and gradually reached to almost the same level as in control hei 17 approx 81 0 of that in control on day 120 2 5 months after the fna treatment 3 2 general corrosion by weight loss measurements in fig 2 before fna treatment to experimental on day 47 the corrosion rate of the coupons in control hei 17 and experimental were almost the same which was around 70 lower than that in control this indicated the corrosion inhibition effect of the hei 17 as reported previously in other studies villamizar et al 2007 wang et al 2011 the corrosion inhibition efficiency of a selected imidazoline derivative on mic in a co2 containing oilfield produced water was found to be 72 and 68 after 21 days and 43 days incubation respectively liu et al 2016 imidazoline derivatives at 50 ppm could inhibit the corrosion rate by 50 90 in 5 hcl acid after 48 h immersion wang et al 1999 the general corrosion rate in the control reactor reached the highest level on day 47 and remained at this level approximately 1 05 mm y for the remaining period of the experiment in comparison the highest corrosion rate in the control hei 17 reactor was reached on day 60 and remained at this level approximately 0 55 mm y for the remaining period of the experiment the results indicate that hei 17 not only reduced the steady state corrosion rate but also slowed down the development of the corrosion for the experimental reactor after the fna treatment on day 47 the general corrosion rate did not follow the trend of the control hei 17 reactor but rose much more slowly reaching 93 4 of the general corrosion rate in the control hei 17 reactor in 2 5 months this should have been because of the biofilm removal and deactivation by fna which reduced the mic of the coupon surfaces the trends of the corrosion rate in the control hei 17 and experimental reactors resemble the trends of atp fig 1e 3 3 3d optical profiling of corroded coupon surface the cumulative distribution of the corrosion depth in experimental and control reactors fig 3 a g was generated based on 3d images with calculation details shown in fig s3 fig s4 and fig s5 referring to section 2 6 for detailed methods before the fna treatment on day 47 the cumulative distribution of the corrosion depth in experimental was generally comparable to that in control hei 17 fig 3 a b h the corrosion depth in control was higher than the other two reactors which indicated that hei 17 slowed down the pitting corrosion this could be attributed to the lower biofilm viability in control hei 17 and experimental fig 1e following fna treatment the pitting corrosion depths in the experimental reactor became and remained lower than those in the control hei 17 reactor fig 3c g suggesting that fna treatment slowed down pitting corrosion in experimental the 90 ile corrosion depth profile fig 3h in the experimental reactor following fna treatment i e between day 47 and day 120 displayed two distinct slopes fig 3h as a rate of 0 12 0 022 mm y between day 47 and day 90 and 0 25 0 016 mm y between day 90 and day 120 fig 3i the statistical significance of the results was analyzed by t test and the difference was regarded as statistically significant when p 0 05 the pitting corrosion rates of day 47 day 90 in the experimental reactor were significantly reduced compared with the control hei 17 reactor p 0 01 and the control reactor p 0 01 the pitting corrosion rate in the period of day 47 day 90 was 64 6 lower than the rate in the control hei 17 reactor strongly suggesting that fna treatment is effective in reducing pitting corrosion however the rate in the period of day 90 day 120 was comparable to that in the control hei 17 reactor p 0 05 fig 3i suggesting the effect of fna treatment last for several weeks after which fna treatment should be re applied the observed inhibitory effects of fna treatment on pitting corrosion are in line with the microbial measurement as shown in fig 1e the biofilm atp levels in the experimental reactor were substantially lower than those in the control hei 17 reactor between day 47 and day 90 but reached similar levels in the remaining period 3 4 electrochemical measurements fig 4 a shows that the ocp in experimental and control hei 17 was comparable ca 0 64 v which was about 0 07 v higher than that in control usually ocp could be regarded as a thermodynamic parameter which shows the tendency of the metal to be involved in the electrochemical corrosion reactions silverman 2011 the lower ocp in control indicated a higher tendency of the working electrode to corrode which implied that hei 17 could slow down the steel coupons corrosion the fna treatment on day 47 in experimental increased the ocp immediately which was in accordance with the results with sole fna treatment zhong et al 2020 then the ocp started to decrease after the fna treatment and gradually matched with the other 2 reactors around day 79 though experienced a few fluctuations to be noted the ocp in all the 3 reactors eventually reached similar levels at around 0 55 v which was also comparable to the baseline ocp levels in fig 4b rp started at the same level around 1500 2000 Ï cm2 on day 1 in all the 3 reactors and increased thereafter it reached the highest level approximately 37 000 Ï cm2 in experimental and control hei 17 on day 6 while rp in control started to decrease after day 3 and the peaked at around 11 000 Ï cm2 the inhibition efficiency of hei 17 calculated by lpr measurements was 70 3 which was comparable with the efficiency calculated by weight loss measurements in 3 2 after day 13 rp in experimental and control hei 17 started to decrease to a level nearly 2000 Ï cm2 higher than that in control around 4300 Ï cm2 on day 33 the fna dosage on day 47 in experimental increased the rp by almost 2000 Ï cm2 which reduced the corrosion rate by 31 3 compared with the baseline level prior to fna treatment although rp in all the three reactors continued to reduce after day 66 it was approximately 2000 Ï cm2 higher in experimental than that in control hei 17 and around 3000 Ï cm2 higher than that in control at day 118 fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 show the nyquist and bode plots of the working electrodes in experimental control hei 17 and control from day 1 to day 118 respectively from day 1 to day 24 the nyquist plots in experimental fig 5a were arc shaped of which the diameter reached the biggest at day 3 indicating the highest impedance after day 3 the diameter of the nyquist plots gradually decreased this was in accordance with the lpr results in fig 4b in the zoom in plot in fig 5a the nyquist plot changed from arc shaped at day 24 to linear shaped at day 28 in fig 5d the bode plots showed only one time constant of which the phase angle shifted towards higher values at low frequencies 10 2 to 10 1 hz which can be regarded as a trend of transformation of the system to diffusion limitation phenomenon batmanghelich et al 2017 the nyquist and bode diagrams in control hei 17 showed similar trends fig 6 a d compared with experimental indicating that hei 17 had a repeatable influence on carbon steel coupon corrosion behavior in control the highest diameter of the nyquist plots fig 7a was about 4 times lower than that in experimental and control hei 17 which was comparable to the lpr results fig 4b the shape of the nyquist plots changed to linear at day 6 indicating the diffusional effect on the working electrode surface liu and cheng 2018 which was also indicated by the phase angle shift in the bode plots fig 4d which would be due to the low carbon source concentration in control fig 1a and b venzlaff et al 2013 xu and gu 2014 from day 33 to day 47 right before fna treatment the nyquist plots in experimental were linear shaped which changed to arc shaped right after the fna treatment at day 48 with a larger diameter than that at day 47 fig 5b this was a sign of the surface reactions variation due to the deactivation of the biofilm on the coupon surface and the mediation of the electrolyte by the dosage of fna then it changed back to linear shape at day 49 of which the slope was the highest among the plots after day 49 indicating the biggest impedance fig 5b this was in accordance with the lpr results shown in fig 4b at day 70 the nyquist plot shifted to arc shaped which would be due to the re development of biofilm on the electrode surface according to the cellular atp level measurements fig 1e the phase data in bode plots show one time constant from day 33 to day 70 fig 5e the z reached the highest at day 48 which indicated that the fna treatment enlarged the impedance of the system in control hei 17 the nyquist plots were linear shaped from day 33 to day 70 fig 6b which confirmed that the shape change in experimental was due to the fna application fig 5b in control the nyquist plots continued as linear shaped from day 33 to day 57 which however switched to arc shaped at day 66 fig 7b this change would be due to the breakdown of the unstable iron sulfides formed in the absence of oxygen and the diffusion limitation influence was eliminated by the surface change hamilton 2003 walker 2001 the nyquist plots in experimental were relatively stable from day 75 to day 118 except day 79 and day 83 which were arc shaped instead of linear shaped lines fig 5c however the shape of the nyquist plots in control hei 17 changed from straight lines to arcs at day 96 which indicated the breakdown or removal of biofilm or corrosion products layers on the electrode surface this would be due to the instability of the precipitations or the detachment of the microbe clusters during the biofilm development this led to the reduce of z fig 6f which was however still higher than that in the control reactor fig 7f in contrast the nyquist plots in control changed from arc shaped to linear shaped at day 90 fig 7c which would be due to the formation of a compact biofilm on the electrode surface also the carbon source level acetate fig 1b in control was the lowest among all the three reactors implying that the reactions on the working electrode in control were influenced more by the diffusion limitation than the other 2 reactors z continued to decrease to around 70 Ï cm2 at day 118 fig 7f which was almost 5 times lower than that in control hei 17 fig 6f and only 8 3 of that in experimental fig 5f to quantify the eis results two equivalent circuits fig 8 were used to fit the results shown in figs 5 6 and 7 the adequacy of the equivalent circuit models was maintained with fitting errors less than 10 for all fitted parameters the working electrode surface was impossibly smooth but with microscopic roughness so the constant phase element q a non ideal capacitor was used to fit the distributed capacitance instead of an ideal capacitor in the circuit shown as fig 8a the impedance of q z q is calculated by the following equation z q 1 y 0 j Ï n where y 0 and n are frequency independent parameters indicating the deviation of the specimen from an ideal capacity and Ï is the angular frequency of the alternating voltage in rad s 1 in fig 8b a warburg impedance was used to model the diffusional limitation effect warburg impedance is a constant phase component modelling slow diffusion processes abbasi et al 2016 warburg impedance was usually higher at low frequencies as the reactants have to diffuse further than at high frequencies the equivalent circuit in fig 8b was applied to model the system of which the reactions are controlled by the diffusion process and the nyquist plots are linear shaped this indicates that the electrode surface is covered by compact layers of biofilm and corrosion products which severely affect the transport of the reacting substrates to the surface the fitting results of the eis plots in experimental fig 5 control hei 17 fig 6 and control fig 7 were shown in table 1 table 2 and table 3 respectively w r w p and w t are the parameters of the warburg impedance obtained from zview w r represents the diffusion impedance while w p is an exponential factor w t denotes diffusion interpretation which shows the time for the substrates to diffuse the system it could be calculated by the following equation w t l 2 d where l cm2 is the diffusion layer thickness and d cm2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient before day 24 the arc shaped nyquist plots fig 5a were fitted with the one time constant circuit in fig 8a as the fitting results shown in table 1 the resistance of the biofilm on the working electrode surface r f increased sharply in the starting 3 days which then gradually decreased till day 24 the deviation of the double layer capacitance from an ideal capacity n f was in a relatively steady state of approximately 0 85 up to day 19 after which it dropped to 0 7728 at day 24 indicating that the electrode surface was becoming rough and porous sheng et al 2007 on day 28 the parallel combination of a resistance r f and a constant phase q f was unable to fit the linear shaped nyquist plots so warburg element w o was used in the circuit to simulate the diffusional limitation effect in fig 8b the presence of w o was associated with the formation of a biofilm on the working electrode surface liu and cheng 2018 as the nyquist plot at day 48 right after the fna treatment changed to arc shaped fig 5b the eis data of day 48 were simulated with the circuit in fig 8a the shape of the nyquist plot then changed back to linear shaped at day 49 compared with the fitting result of day 47 right before fna treatment both the diffusion impedance w r and the diffusion time w t decreased after the fna treatment results from day 49 to day 66 which indicated that the biofilm on the working electrode surface was becoming thinner and less compact after the fna treatment according to the eis data fig 5 the diffusion limitation effect of the biofilm did not show dominant influence on the working electrode surface from day 70 to day 83 so the equivalent circuit with parallel r f and q f was used fig 8b from then onwards till day 118 the eis data in experimental were fitted with the circuit with w o as the nyquist plots were linear shaped implying that the electrode was diffusion limited by the biofilm table 2 shows that before the fna treatment in experimental at day 47 the surface property and impedance behaviour of the working electrodes in control hei 17 and experimental were fairly comparable this indicated that hei 17 showed repeatable influence on the electrochemical parameters of the working electrode the fitting results showed that the diffusion limitation of the biofilm continued to dominate the reactions on the working electrode surface up to day 83 in control hei 17 from day 90 the biofilm s diffusion limitation effect failed to control the reactions on the electrode surface fig 6c so the eis data were fitted with the circuit in fig 8a the fitting results in the control reactor table 3 showed that the diffusion limitation effect of the biofilm started to dominate the system at an early stage day 6 of the immersion this added to the evidence along with the atp measurements fig 1e that hei 17 had an inhibitory effect on the microbial activity and could eliminate the attachment of the microbes to the metal surface as a surfactant ghasemi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the diffusion limitation effect disappeared at day 66 which was similar to that in control hei 17 on day 90 however the biofilm re developed to form a compact and thick structure hindering the diffusion of the substrates at day 90 in control compared with experimental w r was lower in control which indicated that the resistance of the diffusion film was higher in experimental implying a lower corrosion rate however w t was much higher in control which showed that it consumed more time for the substrates to diffuse to the working electrode surface indicating a much thicker biofilm than in experimental combined with the pitting results in fig 3 a thicker biofilm in control caused much more severe pitting corrosion than in experimental overall the eis results were generally consistent with the lpr measurements the working electrode surface properties and the dominant reactions revealed by eis analysis supported the general fig 2 and pitting fig 3 corrosion results the electrical components in the equivalent circuits interpreted the mechanisms of the mic process on the steel coupon surface 4 discussion compared with the control reactor continuous hei 17 treatment showed strong general corrosion inhibition efficiency of approx 70 according to the weight loss measurements and lpr tests moderate pitting corrosion inhibition effect up to 27 was achieved with hei 17 based on the measured cumulative distribution of the depth which disappeared along with the biofilm development on the carbon steel coupons these results are consistent with previous studies villamizar et al 2007 wang et al 2011 in our previous study we demonstrated that intermittent dosing of fna could significantly reduce the metal corrosion rate in water injection systems zhong et al 2020 with 2 intermittent fna treatments at an 82 day interval over 304 days fna dosing decreased the averaged pitting corrosion rate by a maximum of 58 5 as compared with the control without fna general corrosion was also reduced by up to 31 the intermittent dosing of fna appeared to be complementary to the commonly used corrosion inhibitors in this study the effect of pulse dosing of fna to further reduce corrosion in a simulated water injection system continuously dosed with hei 17 as a corrosion inhibitor was investigated the combination of hei 17 and fna showed complementary effects with higher inhibitory efficiency in both pitting and general corrosion fna showed high compatibility by moderately enhancing hei 17 s strong general corrosion inhibition and complementing its deficient pitting corrosion inhibition compared with sole hei 17 treatment the dosage of fna enhanced the general corrosion inhibition efficiency moderately by up to 49 and improved the pitting corrosion inhibition efficiency by up to 69 to determine whether hei 17 and fna had synergistic inhibitory effect on the carbon steel corrosion the synergism parameter s was calculated which was proposed to determine synergistic effect between two inhibitors murakawa et al 1967 the synergism parameter s of the two tested inhibitors was calculated according to the equation s 1 Î¸ 1 Î¸ 2 Î¸ 1 Î¸ 2 1 Î¸ 12 where Î¸1 and Î¸2 are the degrees of surface coverage observed with substance 1 and 2 acting alone respectively and Î¸ 12 is the degree of surface coverage of the combined usage of inhibitor 1 and 2 solomon et al 2018 if the two chemicals have no effect on each other and influence the metal surface independently s 1 li et al 2009 when the two inhibitors have synergistic effects s 1 otherwise when the two inhibitors antagonise each other s 1 the degree of surface coverage Î¸ could be computed from the inhibition efficiency Î· Ã§alÎ¹Åkan and bilgiÃ§ 2000 Î¸ Î· 100 the inhibition efficiency Î· was calculated by the following equation Î· r b l a n k r i n h r b l a n k 100 where rblank and rinh represent the corrosion rates in the absence and presence of the inhibitors respectively in this study two synergism parameters sg for general corrosion obtained by weight loss measurements and sp for pitting corrosion by 3d profiling were calculated the inhibition efficiencies of fna were derived from a previous study zhong et al 2020 in fig 2 on day 61 14 days after the fna dosage in the experimental reactor sg 1 36 1 indicating the synergistic inhibitory effect of fna and hei 17 on general corrosion according to the pitting corrosion from day 47 to day 90 in fig 3i sp was calculated as 1 173 1 showing the synergism of fna and hei 17 in controlling pitting corrosion the mechanism for the synergistic effects of hei 17 and fna on corrosion inhibition is hypothesized as follows steel is known to be able to adsorb imidazoline and its derivatives onto its surface qiang et al 2016 resulting in the formation of a protective layer on the surface the development of biofilm dominated by srb on the steel surface could potentially damage this layer thus leading to microbially induced corrosion liu et al 2000 the addition of fna removes the biofilm by killing the microbes allowing the re adsorption of hei 17 to the steel surfaces fig 9 also hei 17 exerted its inhibitory effect on the growth of planktonic microbes working synergistically with fna in slowing down the recovery of the biofilm on the re exposed coupon surfaces this slows down both general and pitting corrosion compared to the case with the hei 17 treatment alone and the intermittent fna treatment alone zhong et al 2020 in this study we found that the pitting corrosion enhancement by fna gradually diminished and disappeared around 1 5 months after the dosage this suggests that in practice the frequency of fna dosage should be approximately once per month in practice corrosion inhibitors are usually dosed continuously in the range of 10 1000 ppm in oilfields kermani 2017 at a price of 2 3 usd kg the cost for the use imidazoline derivatives would be in the range 0 02 3 usd m3 of injection water treated the range of the in situ ph of oil reservoirs is from 3 to 7 magot et al 2000 pannekens et al 2019 when the ph is lower than 6 the estimated cost for dosing sodium nitrite to reach the fna level of 0 49 mg hno2 n l for 24 h the level applied in this study applied monthly would be up to 0 015 usd m3 averaged to the total flow over the month which is far lower than the costs for imidazoline unless the latter is used at very low concentrations e g 10 ppm for the upper end of the ph range e g 7 the cost of hydrochloric acid could be up to 0 050 usd m3 yearly averaged zhong et al 2020 considering the significant enhancement to corrosion inhibition achieved the use of intermittent fna dosing to complement continuous imidazoline dosing is likely an economically attractive approach fna is biodegradable after being diluted to low concentrations in the same which means it would not cause secondary pollution unlike most of the commonly used organic biocides 5 conclusions the combined effect of imidazoline derivative hei 17 and fna on carbon steel corrosion in a simulated water injection system was investigated in laboratory tests the key findings are intermittent dosing of fna produces corrosion inhibition effects complementary to those by continuous dosing of corrosion inhibitors such as imidazoline derivatives when applied alone imidazoline derivative hei 17 has a strong inhibition effect on general corrosion and a moderate inhibition effect on pitting corrosion the intermittent dosing of fna substantially enhances the inhibition on pitting corrosion and also moderately enhances the inhibition on general corrosion fna dosing appears to inactivate remove biofilms on steel surfaces and hence its application frequency is determined by the speed of biofilm recovery this study suggests that the fna dosing frequency should be once a month

17659,to maintain the integrity of the internal surfaces of the pipelines in oil and gas industry chemicals including corrosion inhibitors and biocides are commonly dosed to prevent corrosion imidazoline and its derivatives are widely used corrosion inhibitors for the protection of oil pipelines which have been shown effective in reducing general corrosion as an effective biocide free nitrous acid fna is suitable to inhibit microbially influenced corrosion induced by for example sulfate reducing bacteria in this paper we hypothesize that the continuous addition of imidazoline and intermittent dosing of fna when used in combination would yield effective control of both general and pitting corrosions as a typical imidazoline derivative n b hydroxyethyl oleyl imidazoline hei 17 was applied in conjunction with intermittent dosing of fna in the experimental system with the results compared with two control systems one receiving hei 17 only and one receiving no chemical dosing the corrosion properties were monitored with open circuit potential electrochemical impedance spectroscopy linear polarization resistance 3d optical profiling and weight loss measurement following a single dose of fna the general corrosion rates in the experimental reactor dropped up to 50 of that in the reactor receiving continuous hei 17 dosing 0 27 0 04 vs 0 54 0 08 mm y but gradually recovered to 93 4 of that in 2 5 months after the fna treatment the pitting corrosion was decreased by 64 6 compared with continuous hei 17 dosing reactor for a month from measuring the cumulative distribution of the pitting depth hei 17 treatment alone showed moderate pitting corrosion inhibition effect approx 27 and the fna treatment inhibited the formation of deep pits effectively the combined application of hei 17 and fna has shown synergistic effects and high efficiency in mitigating mic in the simulated water injection system this treatment strategy has strong potential to be applied in the practical oilfield operations graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbially influenced corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria free nitrous acid imidazoline derivative pitting corrosion corrosion inhibition 1 introduction since most oilfields in the world are in the middle or late recovery periods corrosion has become a skyrocketing problem in the secondary oil recovery which normally involves water injection microbially influenced corrosion mic refers to the corrosion caused or enhanced by microbial activities which is believed to be responsible for about 40 of pipeline system failures in the oil industry while the percentage could be much higher in water injection systems graves and sullivan 1966 mic could not only be responsible for the localized corrosion and leakage of the pipelines but also lead to decrease of production and potential safety issues zhong et al 2019 the corrosion inhibitors are chemicals that decrease or prevent corrosion when added in small concentrations usually at 1 20 in batch treatment or in the range of 10 1000 ppm continuously raja and sethuraman 2008 the type and amount of corrosion inhibitors required depend on system corrosivity the use of a corrosion inhibitor can achieve a corrosion rate typically less than 0 1 mm year in most cases kermani 2017 corrosion inhibitors are mainly effective in reducing general corrosion inhibition by forming a film on the surface of the steel preventing the surface from corrosive attack hobbs 2014 as widely used corrosion inhibitors in oilfields imidazoline and its derivatives showed their advantages with high inhibition efficiency easy production and low toxicity kelland 2014 imidazoline based corrosion inhibitors have been widely used for the protection of oil pipelines for many years though the inhibitory mechanism hasn t been fully explained wang et al 2011 after being immersed in 2 nacl solution saturated with co2 with 0 08 mmol dm3 1 2 thioureidoethyl 2 alkyl imidazoline for 72 h the corrosion rate of q235 steel coupon was inhibited by 88 6 compared with that submerged in the medium with no imidazoline wang et al 2011 similarly polarization curves showed that 20 ppm hydroxyethyl inhibited 1018 carbon steel corrosion by 87 2 when exposed to 3 nacl medium with 10 diesel for 9 h at 50 c villamizar et al 2007 as mic could induce severe localized corrosion i e pitting corrosion due to the corrosive biofilm biocides are usually applied as they could kill or remove the corrosive microbes javaherdashti 2008 glutaraldehyde is one of the most commonly used commercial biocides which can be used in a wide range of temperatures and ph turkiewicz et al 2013 it could achieve 5 log reduction i e 99 999 killing of bacteria in biofilm at 1000 ppm with 2 h treatment or at 100 ppm with 24 h treatment keasler et al 2011 thps tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate is another maturely used biocide in oilfields which has advantages over other biocides as it has low toxicity and dissolves iron sulfide in pipelines mcilwaine 2005 turkiewicz et al 2013 free nitrous acid fna i e the protonated form of nitrite has been reported to be biocidal to sewage biofilm which was dominated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb e g desulfovibrio vulgaris jiang et al 2011 recently fna has been shown effective to inhibit mic owing to its strong biocidal effect on corrosive biofilm on steel zhong et al 2020 fna decreased the average pitting corrosion rate by 59 with 2 intermittent treatments and 82 day interval over 304 days compared with the pitting corrosion fna showed a moderate inhibitory effect on general corrosion up to 31 considering the complementary nature of the corrosion inhibitors and biocides in practical oil production process the pipelines corrosion is often mitigated through the simultaneous use of multiple chemicals including both corrosion inhibitors and biocides heidersbach 2018 kermani and chevrot 2012 we hypothesize that as a biocide fna may also be used in combination with an inhibitor to achieve simultaneous inhibition of both general corrosion and pitting corrosion different from many other biocides such as glutaraldehyde and thps which need to be dosed daily or added continuously in injection water fna requires intermittent dosing only once every a few months zhong et al 2020 therefore the synergistic effects of fna with a corrosion inhibitor if proven will potentially lead to the development of a more cost effect strategy to mitigate corrosion of oil production systems as a typical imidazoline derivative n b hydroxyethyl oleyl imidazoline hei 17 was selected to be applied with fna in this study to investigate the combined effect on the corrosion behaviour of carbon steel the hypothesis is that hei 17 and fna could show a synergetic effect on mic control as hei 17 could mitigate the general corrosion as a corrosion inhibitor and fna has strong pitting corrosion inhibition efficiency the corrosion properties were investigated by electrochemical measurements including open circuit potential ocp electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and linear polarization resistance lpr the general corrosion rate was calculated by weight loss measurements while the pitting corrosion was analyzed by 3d optical profiling 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and monitoring protocol three bioreactors were operated to simulate the water injection systems in oil production fig s1 each of the acrylic bioreactors height 150 mm inner diameter 130 mm volume 1 99 l were assembled with 6 removable plastic rods holding 4 carbon steel coupons each yangzhou branch of environmental protection equipment limited 20 10 2 mm the carbon steel is composed of by weight 0 43 c 0 58 mn 0 22 si 0 012 p 0 008 s 0 01 cr 0 01 cu 0 01 ni and 98 72 fe the coupons were pretreated to reach an identical surface property including sanded to a certain degree of surface finish using 600 800 and 1200 grit silicon carbide papers degreased ultrasonically in acetone and washed with anhydrous ethanol before stored in a desiccator to sterilize the coupons they were exposed to 30 wattage ultraviolet uv light for 30 min and then carefully labelled and weighed w 0 prior to inserting into the reactors each reactor was set up with an electrochemical cell the working electrode was a square shaped carbon steel coupon that was embedded in epoxy resin with only one surface exposed 1 cm 1 cm a copper wire was soldered to the coupon for electrical connection a saturated ag agcl electrode and a platinum net were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively the reactors were seeded with 200 ml produced water collected from an oilfield at mereenie northern territory australia and then topped up with synthetic seawater recipe shown in section 2 2 one of them was operated as control with neither hei 17 fig s2 for its structure nor fna dosed the other two reactors were operated with constant 20 ppm hei 17 dosage sigma aldrich australia both in the initial medium and the feeding medium one without fna treatment marked as control hei 17 and the other as experimental which was treated once on day 47 with 200 mg n l nitrite at ph 6 for 24 h fna 0 49 mg n l calculated with hno2 n no2 n ka 10ph where ka e 2300 270 t c t 22 c the fna treatment conditions were based on our previous study zhong et al 2020 the concentration of the hei 17 used in this study was selected according to previously published results ortega toledo et al 2010 villamizar et al 2007 from day 1 to day 30 the reactors were operated batch wisely with medium replaced by 200 ml fresh synthetic medium every 4 days from day 9 to supply nutrients on day 30 the reactors were switched to continuous feeding mode with a flow rate of 0 35 ml min by a peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps 323s providing a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 days the reactors were constantly mixed with magnetic stirrer at 120 rpm water samples were taken before and after medium change during the batch mode before day 30 and every 4 days during the continuous feeding mode for the analysis of dissolved sulfur compounds and lactate and acetate concentrations section 2 7 electrochemical measurements were conducted every 24 h during the experiment section 2 3 from day 15 to day 120 two coupons were removed from each of the reactors in an anaerobic chamber every 15 2 days for atp adenosine triphosphate as an indicator of microorganisms in biofilms and corrosion analysis the cellular atp levels of the biofilm on the coupons were analyzed immediately after removed from the reactors aseptically as described in section 2 4 all the coupons were then carefully washed dried and analyzed with weight loss measurements section 2 5 and 3d profiling section 2 6 2 2 synthetic produced water the synthetic produced water was synthesized based on a widely used seawater recipe for the feed medium comprising per l distilled water nacl 20 0 g na2so4 3 0 g mgcl2 6h2o 3 0 g cacl2 2h2o 0 15 g kcl 0 5 g kh2po4 0 2 g nh4cl 0 3 g nahco3 solution 30 ml trace element 1 ml hubert et al 2003 nahco3 and trace element solutions were prepared accordingly widdel and bak 1992 the ph was adjusted to 7 2 with 2 mol l hcl solution lactate was added to the synthetic seawater at 5 mol l to provide the microbes with essential carbon source the synthetic produced water was sparged with pure nitrogen gas for 3 h to remove oxygen before use to keep the system oxygen free one 5 l gas bag containing nitrogen gas was connected to the medium container 2 3 electrochemical measurements an electrochemical workstation bio logic sas was used to conduct the electrochemical tests including ocp eis and lpr ocp represents the potential of the working electrode without affecting the electrochemistry on the electrode surface in electrical cells generally metals with nobler ocp are more thermodynamically stable than materials with less noble ocp the eis and lpr measurements were conducted with small amplitude potential over ocp so they were regarded as non destructive methods for corrosion analysis feng and cheng 2017 both lpr and eis measurements were conducted after ocp reached steady state the lpr measurement was carried out in the potential range from 0 02 v to 0 02 v vs ocp at a sweep rate 0 166 mv s to measure the polarization resistance rp which is the slope of the polarization curve the corrosion rate is revealed as it is inversely correlated with rp during eis measurements a small sinusoidal voltage with amplitude v o 10 mv and variable frequency f of 10 2 to 105 hz f Ï 2Ï where Ï is the angular frequency was applied to the system and the response current i Ï t was measured the impedance z Ï t was calculated z v i based on the nyquist and bode plots constructed the zview2 software scribner inc was used to fit the eis data with suitable equivalent circuit models an equivalent circuit is a theoretical circuit that retains all of the electrical characteristics of the electrochemical cell based on which the corrosion behavior on the working electrode surface could be investigated 2 4 atp level measurement in an anaerobic chamber the coupons were carefully sampled aseptically into 4 ml sterilized phosphate buffered saline pbs 1x ph 7 4 in a 5 ml sterile bottle then the bottle was vortexed for 2 min to fully disperse the biofilm for the following atp tests the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation g8231 was used to measure the atp levels according to the manufacturers instructions a volume of 300 Î¼l of biofilm suspension was transferred to one of the wells in a 96 well flat bottom microplate greiner bio one to bind with 100 Î¼l bactiter glo reagent the luminescence of the well was measured by a multimode plate reader clariostar plus after 90 s incubation at 37 c the luminescence was collected as relative light units and converted to atp concentrations nm using a calibration curve made with a known atp standard promega corporation usa filloux et al 2015 2 5 corrosion rate by weight loss the general corrosion rate was calculated from weight loss measurements which were conducted according to astm d 2688 astm international 2015 after the atp level measurement in 2 4 the coupons were then immersed in clarke s solution a mixture of concentrated hcl 2 antimony trioxide sb2o3 and 5 stannous chloride sncl2 and vortexed for 2 min to remove the surface biofilm and corrosion products javed et al 2015 the coupons were then cleaned thoroughly by sonication for 10 min to remove any remaining debris on the surfaces the coupons were rinsed with distilled water cleaned with anhydrous ethanol and dried under high pressure n2 99 5 the coupon s initial weight was marked as w 0 and the weight of the cleaned coupon was marked as w n corrosion rate cr in mm y was calculated as c r n 8 76 10 4 w 0 w n Ï a t where cr n is corrosion rate mm y w n is weight of coupon g Ï is density g cm3 a is surface area cm2 and t is immersion time in the simulated water system h 2 6 pit depth analysis with 3d optical profiling following the weight loss measurements in section 2 5 a 3d optical profiler zeta 300 was used to obtain 3d images and measure the surface roughness of the corroded coupons optical interference profiling is a well established accurate method of measuring height variations on surfaces using the wavelength of light as the ruler chand et al 2011 the bottom and the top of the surface were located by adjusting the focus of the light and the surface was scanned by the light with a step size of 0 2 Î¼m to generate the 3d images the surface depth distribution was generated by the built in software the cumulative distribution of the pitting depth and the pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution were generated accordingly then the averaged pitting corrosion rate could be calculated by the pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution as follows p c r n 365 d n t where pcr n is pitting corrosion rate Î¼m y d n is pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution Î¼m and t is immersion time in the simulated water system d 2 7 chemical analysis to analyze dissolved inorganic sulfur species sulfide sulfate thiosulfate and sulfite 1 5 ml liquid sample from the reactors was filtered 0 22 Î¼m into 0 5 ml preserving solution of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 samples were then analyzed within 24 h on an ion chromatograph with a uv and a conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 1 ml liquid sample taken from the reactors was filtered for fatty acid lactate and acetate analysis by high performance liquid chromatography perkinelmer inc with an hpx 87h 300 mm 7 8 mm biorad aminex ion exclusion hplc column operated at 65 c fatty acids were monitored because some srb strains such as d vulgaris oxidize lactate incompletely to acetate heidelberg et al 2004 which would then become the main carbon source in the medium 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the organic carbon lactate and acetate concentrations are shown in fig 1 a b generally the changes of the lactate and acetate concentrations were relatively comparable between control hei 17 and experimental before fna addition to experimental on day 47 the lactate concentration fig 1a decreased more quickly between day 0 and day 9 in control than those in the other two reactors in the meantime fig 1b the acetate concentration increased to around 240 mg l in the control hei 17 and experimental reactors in the first 13 days while it stayed at a low level 13 mg l in control these demonstrated that the microbes grew more slowly in the experimental and control hei 17 reactors indicating the bacterial inhibitory effect of hei 17 imidazoline derivatives usually contain an amino group which could inhibit growth of planktonic microbes liu et al 2016 the acetate concentration increased immediately after all the three reactors were switched to the continuous feeding mode on day 30 reaching their respective peak on day 43 before starting to decrease the acetate concentration gradually stabilized at around 22 mg l in control and around 42 mg l in control hei 17 from day 60 to day 120 however the fna treatment on day 47 changed the trends of both lactate and acetate concentration in the experimental reactor the lactate concentration in experimental increased from day 48 to day 52 192 mg l indicating that the microbial activities were inhibited by the fna treatment thereafter the lactate concentration decreased back to 0 again on day 74 and acetate concentration reached a relatively stable level ca 53 mg l on day 79 which indicated the start of the recovery of the microbes in all the three reactors the sulfate concentration decreased generally till day 30 fig 1c however the sulfate concentration was lower in the control reactor than in the other two reactors that received hei 17 suggesting that hei reduced the srb activity after the reactors were switched to continuous feeding mode on day 30 the sulfate concentration in all reactors increased and began to decrease 8 days later it reached a steady state around 410 mg s l after day 65 in control which was about 70 mg s l higher than that in control hei 17 again supporting the inhibition of hei 17 on srb the sulfate concentration in experimental was almost the same as that in control hei 17 before day 47 after the fna treatment on day 47 sulfate concentration gradually increased before day 60 reflecting a lowered srb activity and decreased thereafter and stabilized at around 500 mg s l in accordance to the sulfate concentration changes sulfide concentration generally showed an increasing trend in both control and control hei 17 and it gradually stabilized at around 60 mg s l in control and about 40 mg s l in control hei 17 sulfide concentration in experimental dropped to 0 immediately after fna was dosed then it gradually increased to reach a relatively steady level at approximately around 32 mg s l after day 90 both the sulfate and sulfide profiles strongly suggested that the fna treatment on day 47 substantially reduced the srb activity in the reactor as shown in fig 1e the atp level in control was generally higher than that in control hei 17 over the 120 days supporting that hei 17 had an inhibitory effect on microbes it was found that at low concentrations around 10 ppm imidazoline derivatives could inhibit bacterial growth ghasemi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 in this study hei 17 showed moderate inhibitory effect approx 14 7 after 75 days immersion in control hei 17 compared with control in the experimental reactor the atp level decreased immediately to around 11 of the baseline level before fna treatment after fna treatment with fna addition the microbial activity as measured as atp was inhibited by up to 94 7 compared with control then it gradually recovered to the previous level 28 days after the fna treatment and gradually reached to almost the same level as in control hei 17 approx 81 0 of that in control on day 120 2 5 months after the fna treatment 3 2 general corrosion by weight loss measurements in fig 2 before fna treatment to experimental on day 47 the corrosion rate of the coupons in control hei 17 and experimental were almost the same which was around 70 lower than that in control this indicated the corrosion inhibition effect of the hei 17 as reported previously in other studies villamizar et al 2007 wang et al 2011 the corrosion inhibition efficiency of a selected imidazoline derivative on mic in a co2 containing oilfield produced water was found to be 72 and 68 after 21 days and 43 days incubation respectively liu et al 2016 imidazoline derivatives at 50 ppm could inhibit the corrosion rate by 50 90 in 5 hcl acid after 48 h immersion wang et al 1999 the general corrosion rate in the control reactor reached the highest level on day 47 and remained at this level approximately 1 05 mm y for the remaining period of the experiment in comparison the highest corrosion rate in the control hei 17 reactor was reached on day 60 and remained at this level approximately 0 55 mm y for the remaining period of the experiment the results indicate that hei 17 not only reduced the steady state corrosion rate but also slowed down the development of the corrosion for the experimental reactor after the fna treatment on day 47 the general corrosion rate did not follow the trend of the control hei 17 reactor but rose much more slowly reaching 93 4 of the general corrosion rate in the control hei 17 reactor in 2 5 months this should have been because of the biofilm removal and deactivation by fna which reduced the mic of the coupon surfaces the trends of the corrosion rate in the control hei 17 and experimental reactors resemble the trends of atp fig 1e 3 3 3d optical profiling of corroded coupon surface the cumulative distribution of the corrosion depth in experimental and control reactors fig 3 a g was generated based on 3d images with calculation details shown in fig s3 fig s4 and fig s5 referring to section 2 6 for detailed methods before the fna treatment on day 47 the cumulative distribution of the corrosion depth in experimental was generally comparable to that in control hei 17 fig 3 a b h the corrosion depth in control was higher than the other two reactors which indicated that hei 17 slowed down the pitting corrosion this could be attributed to the lower biofilm viability in control hei 17 and experimental fig 1e following fna treatment the pitting corrosion depths in the experimental reactor became and remained lower than those in the control hei 17 reactor fig 3c g suggesting that fna treatment slowed down pitting corrosion in experimental the 90 ile corrosion depth profile fig 3h in the experimental reactor following fna treatment i e between day 47 and day 120 displayed two distinct slopes fig 3h as a rate of 0 12 0 022 mm y between day 47 and day 90 and 0 25 0 016 mm y between day 90 and day 120 fig 3i the statistical significance of the results was analyzed by t test and the difference was regarded as statistically significant when p 0 05 the pitting corrosion rates of day 47 day 90 in the experimental reactor were significantly reduced compared with the control hei 17 reactor p 0 01 and the control reactor p 0 01 the pitting corrosion rate in the period of day 47 day 90 was 64 6 lower than the rate in the control hei 17 reactor strongly suggesting that fna treatment is effective in reducing pitting corrosion however the rate in the period of day 90 day 120 was comparable to that in the control hei 17 reactor p 0 05 fig 3i suggesting the effect of fna treatment last for several weeks after which fna treatment should be re applied the observed inhibitory effects of fna treatment on pitting corrosion are in line with the microbial measurement as shown in fig 1e the biofilm atp levels in the experimental reactor were substantially lower than those in the control hei 17 reactor between day 47 and day 90 but reached similar levels in the remaining period 3 4 electrochemical measurements fig 4 a shows that the ocp in experimental and control hei 17 was comparable ca 0 64 v which was about 0 07 v higher than that in control usually ocp could be regarded as a thermodynamic parameter which shows the tendency of the metal to be involved in the electrochemical corrosion reactions silverman 2011 the lower ocp in control indicated a higher tendency of the working electrode to corrode which implied that hei 17 could slow down the steel coupons corrosion the fna treatment on day 47 in experimental increased the ocp immediately which was in accordance with the results with sole fna treatment zhong et al 2020 then the ocp started to decrease after the fna treatment and gradually matched with the other 2 reactors around day 79 though experienced a few fluctuations to be noted the ocp in all the 3 reactors eventually reached similar levels at around 0 55 v which was also comparable to the baseline ocp levels in fig 4b rp started at the same level around 1500 2000 Ï cm2 on day 1 in all the 3 reactors and increased thereafter it reached the highest level approximately 37 000 Ï cm2 in experimental and control hei 17 on day 6 while rp in control started to decrease after day 3 and the peaked at around 11 000 Ï cm2 the inhibition efficiency of hei 17 calculated by lpr measurements was 70 3 which was comparable with the efficiency calculated by weight loss measurements in 3 2 after day 13 rp in experimental and control hei 17 started to decrease to a level nearly 2000 Ï cm2 higher than that in control around 4300 Ï cm2 on day 33 the fna dosage on day 47 in experimental increased the rp by almost 2000 Ï cm2 which reduced the corrosion rate by 31 3 compared with the baseline level prior to fna treatment although rp in all the three reactors continued to reduce after day 66 it was approximately 2000 Ï cm2 higher in experimental than that in control hei 17 and around 3000 Ï cm2 higher than that in control at day 118 fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 show the nyquist and bode plots of the working electrodes in experimental control hei 17 and control from day 1 to day 118 respectively from day 1 to day 24 the nyquist plots in experimental fig 5a were arc shaped of which the diameter reached the biggest at day 3 indicating the highest impedance after day 3 the diameter of the nyquist plots gradually decreased this was in accordance with the lpr results in fig 4b in the zoom in plot in fig 5a the nyquist plot changed from arc shaped at day 24 to linear shaped at day 28 in fig 5d the bode plots showed only one time constant of which the phase angle shifted towards higher values at low frequencies 10 2 to 10 1 hz which can be regarded as a trend of transformation of the system to diffusion limitation phenomenon batmanghelich et al 2017 the nyquist and bode diagrams in control hei 17 showed similar trends fig 6 a d compared with experimental indicating that hei 17 had a repeatable influence on carbon steel coupon corrosion behavior in control the highest diameter of the nyquist plots fig 7a was about 4 times lower than that in experimental and control hei 17 which was comparable to the lpr results fig 4b the shape of the nyquist plots changed to linear at day 6 indicating the diffusional effect on the working electrode surface liu and cheng 2018 which was also indicated by the phase angle shift in the bode plots fig 4d which would be due to the low carbon source concentration in control fig 1a and b venzlaff et al 2013 xu and gu 2014 from day 33 to day 47 right before fna treatment the nyquist plots in experimental were linear shaped which changed to arc shaped right after the fna treatment at day 48 with a larger diameter than that at day 47 fig 5b this was a sign of the surface reactions variation due to the deactivation of the biofilm on the coupon surface and the mediation of the electrolyte by the dosage of fna then it changed back to linear shape at day 49 of which the slope was the highest among the plots after day 49 indicating the biggest impedance fig 5b this was in accordance with the lpr results shown in fig 4b at day 70 the nyquist plot shifted to arc shaped which would be due to the re development of biofilm on the electrode surface according to the cellular atp level measurements fig 1e the phase data in bode plots show one time constant from day 33 to day 70 fig 5e the z reached the highest at day 48 which indicated that the fna treatment enlarged the impedance of the system in control hei 17 the nyquist plots were linear shaped from day 33 to day 70 fig 6b which confirmed that the shape change in experimental was due to the fna application fig 5b in control the nyquist plots continued as linear shaped from day 33 to day 57 which however switched to arc shaped at day 66 fig 7b this change would be due to the breakdown of the unstable iron sulfides formed in the absence of oxygen and the diffusion limitation influence was eliminated by the surface change hamilton 2003 walker 2001 the nyquist plots in experimental were relatively stable from day 75 to day 118 except day 79 and day 83 which were arc shaped instead of linear shaped lines fig 5c however the shape of the nyquist plots in control hei 17 changed from straight lines to arcs at day 96 which indicated the breakdown or removal of biofilm or corrosion products layers on the electrode surface this would be due to the instability of the precipitations or the detachment of the microbe clusters during the biofilm development this led to the reduce of z fig 6f which was however still higher than that in the control reactor fig 7f in contrast the nyquist plots in control changed from arc shaped to linear shaped at day 90 fig 7c which would be due to the formation of a compact biofilm on the electrode surface also the carbon source level acetate fig 1b in control was the lowest among all the three reactors implying that the reactions on the working electrode in control were influenced more by the diffusion limitation than the other 2 reactors z continued to decrease to around 70 Ï cm2 at day 118 fig 7f which was almost 5 times lower than that in control hei 17 fig 6f and only 8 3 of that in experimental fig 5f to quantify the eis results two equivalent circuits fig 8 were used to fit the results shown in figs 5 6 and 7 the adequacy of the equivalent circuit models was maintained with fitting errors less than 10 for all fitted parameters the working electrode surface was impossibly smooth but with microscopic roughness so the constant phase element q a non ideal capacitor was used to fit the distributed capacitance instead of an ideal capacitor in the circuit shown as fig 8a the impedance of q z q is calculated by the following equation z q 1 y 0 j Ï n where y 0 and n are frequency independent parameters indicating the deviation of the specimen from an ideal capacity and Ï is the angular frequency of the alternating voltage in rad s 1 in fig 8b a warburg impedance was used to model the diffusional limitation effect warburg impedance is a constant phase component modelling slow diffusion processes abbasi et al 2016 warburg impedance was usually higher at low frequencies as the reactants have to diffuse further than at high frequencies the equivalent circuit in fig 8b was applied to model the system of which the reactions are controlled by the diffusion process and the nyquist plots are linear shaped this indicates that the electrode surface is covered by compact layers of biofilm and corrosion products which severely affect the transport of the reacting substrates to the surface the fitting results of the eis plots in experimental fig 5 control hei 17 fig 6 and control fig 7 were shown in table 1 table 2 and table 3 respectively w r w p and w t are the parameters of the warburg impedance obtained from zview w r represents the diffusion impedance while w p is an exponential factor w t denotes diffusion interpretation which shows the time for the substrates to diffuse the system it could be calculated by the following equation w t l 2 d where l cm2 is the diffusion layer thickness and d cm2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient before day 24 the arc shaped nyquist plots fig 5a were fitted with the one time constant circuit in fig 8a as the fitting results shown in table 1 the resistance of the biofilm on the working electrode surface r f increased sharply in the starting 3 days which then gradually decreased till day 24 the deviation of the double layer capacitance from an ideal capacity n f was in a relatively steady state of approximately 0 85 up to day 19 after which it dropped to 0 7728 at day 24 indicating that the electrode surface was becoming rough and porous sheng et al 2007 on day 28 the parallel combination of a resistance r f and a constant phase q f was unable to fit the linear shaped nyquist plots so warburg element w o was used in the circuit to simulate the diffusional limitation effect in fig 8b the presence of w o was associated with the formation of a biofilm on the working electrode surface liu and cheng 2018 as the nyquist plot at day 48 right after the fna treatment changed to arc shaped fig 5b the eis data of day 48 were simulated with the circuit in fig 8a the shape of the nyquist plot then changed back to linear shaped at day 49 compared with the fitting result of day 47 right before fna treatment both the diffusion impedance w r and the diffusion time w t decreased after the fna treatment results from day 49 to day 66 which indicated that the biofilm on the working electrode surface was becoming thinner and less compact after the fna treatment according to the eis data fig 5 the diffusion limitation effect of the biofilm did not show dominant influence on the working electrode surface from day 70 to day 83 so the equivalent circuit with parallel r f and q f was used fig 8b from then onwards till day 118 the eis data in experimental were fitted with the circuit with w o as the nyquist plots were linear shaped implying that the electrode was diffusion limited by the biofilm table 2 shows that before the fna treatment in experimental at day 47 the surface property and impedance behaviour of the working electrodes in control hei 17 and experimental were fairly comparable this indicated that hei 17 showed repeatable influence on the electrochemical parameters of the working electrode the fitting results showed that the diffusion limitation of the biofilm continued to dominate the reactions on the working electrode surface up to day 83 in control hei 17 from day 90 the biofilm s diffusion limitation effect failed to control the reactions on the electrode surface fig 6c so the eis data were fitted with the circuit in fig 8a the fitting results in the control reactor table 3 showed that the diffusion limitation effect of the biofilm started to dominate the system at an early stage day 6 of the immersion this added to the evidence along with the atp measurements fig 1e that hei 17 had an inhibitory effect on the microbial activity and could eliminate the attachment of the microbes to the metal surface as a surfactant ghasemi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the diffusion limitation effect disappeared at day 66 which was similar to that in control hei 17 on day 90 however the biofilm re developed to form a compact and thick structure hindering the diffusion of the substrates at day 90 in control compared with experimental w r was lower in control which indicated that the resistance of the diffusion film was higher in experimental implying a lower corrosion rate however w t was much higher in control which showed that it consumed more time for the substrates to diffuse to the working electrode surface indicating a much thicker biofilm than in experimental combined with the pitting results in fig 3 a thicker biofilm in control caused much more severe pitting corrosion than in experimental overall the eis results were generally consistent with the lpr measurements the working electrode surface properties and the dominant reactions revealed by eis analysis supported the general fig 2 and pitting fig 3 corrosion results the electrical components in the equivalent circuits interpreted the mechanisms of the mic process on the steel coupon surface 4 discussion compared with the control reactor continuous hei 17 treatment showed strong general corrosion inhibition efficiency of approx 70 according to the weight loss measurements and lpr tests moderate pitting corrosion inhibition effect up to 27 was achieved with hei 17 based on the measured cumulative distribution of the depth which disappeared along with the biofilm development on the carbon steel coupons these results are consistent with previous studies villamizar et al 2007 wang et al 2011 in our previous study we demonstrated that intermittent dosing of fna could significantly reduce the metal corrosion rate in water injection systems zhong et al 2020 with 2 intermittent fna treatments at an 82 day interval over 304 days fna dosing decreased the averaged pitting corrosion rate by a maximum of 58 5 as compared with the control without fna general corrosion was also reduced by up to 31 the intermittent dosing of fna appeared to be complementary to the commonly used corrosion inhibitors in this study the effect of pulse dosing of fna to further reduce corrosion in a simulated water injection system continuously dosed with hei 17 as a corrosion inhibitor was investigated the combination of hei 17 and fna showed complementary effects with higher inhibitory efficiency in both pitting and general corrosion fna showed high compatibility by moderately enhancing hei 17 s strong general corrosion inhibition and complementing its deficient pitting corrosion inhibition compared with sole hei 17 treatment the dosage of fna enhanced the general corrosion inhibition efficiency moderately by up to 49 and improved the pitting corrosion inhibition efficiency by up to 69 to determine whether hei 17 and fna had synergistic inhibitory effect on the carbon steel corrosion the synergism parameter s was calculated which was proposed to determine synergistic effect between two inhibitors murakawa et al 1967 the synergism parameter s of the two tested inhibitors was calculated according to the equation s 1 Î¸ 1 Î¸ 2 Î¸ 1 Î¸ 2 1 Î¸ 12 where Î¸1 and Î¸2 are the degrees of surface coverage observed with substance 1 and 2 acting alone respectively and Î¸ 12 is the degree of surface coverage of the combined usage of inhibitor 1 and 2 solomon et al 2018 if the two chemicals have no effect on each other and influence the metal surface independently s 1 li et al 2009 when the two inhibitors have synergistic effects s 1 otherwise when the two inhibitors antagonise each other s 1 the degree of surface coverage Î¸ could be computed from the inhibition efficiency Î· Ã§alÎ¹Åkan and bilgiÃ§ 2000 Î¸ Î· 100 the inhibition efficiency Î· was calculated by the following equation Î· r b l a n k r i n h r b l a n k 100 where rblank and rinh represent the corrosion rates in the absence and presence of the inhibitors respectively in this study two synergism parameters sg for general corrosion obtained by weight loss measurements and sp for pitting corrosion by 3d profiling were calculated the inhibition efficiencies of fna were derived from a previous study zhong et al 2020 in fig 2 on day 61 14 days after the fna dosage in the experimental reactor sg 1 36 1 indicating the synergistic inhibitory effect of fna and hei 17 on general corrosion according to the pitting corrosion from day 47 to day 90 in fig 3i sp was calculated as 1 173 1 showing the synergism of fna and hei 17 in controlling pitting corrosion the mechanism for the synergistic effects of hei 17 and fna on corrosion inhibition is hypothesized as follows steel is known to be able to adsorb imidazoline and its derivatives onto its surface qiang et al 2016 resulting in the formation of a protective layer on the surface the development of biofilm dominated by srb on the steel surface could potentially damage this layer thus leading to microbially induced corrosion liu et al 2000 the addition of fna removes the biofilm by killing the microbes allowing the re adsorption of hei 17 to the steel surfaces fig 9 also hei 17 exerted its inhibitory effect on the growth of planktonic microbes working synergistically with fna in slowing down the recovery of the biofilm on the re exposed coupon surfaces this slows down both general and pitting corrosion compared to the case with the hei 17 treatment alone and the intermittent fna treatment alone zhong et al 2020 in this study we found that the pitting corrosion enhancement by fna gradually diminished and disappeared around 1 5 months after the dosage this suggests that in practice the frequency of fna dosage should be approximately once per month in practice corrosion inhibitors are usually dosed continuously in the range of 10 1000 ppm in oilfields kermani 2017 at a price of 2 3 usd kg the cost for the use imidazoline derivatives would be in the range 0 02 3 usd m3 of injection water treated the range of the in situ ph of oil reservoirs is from 3 to 7 magot et al 2000 pannekens et al 2019 when the ph is lower than 6 the estimated cost for dosing sodium nitrite to reach the fna level of 0 49 mg hno2 n l for 24 h the level applied in this study applied monthly would be up to 0 015 usd m3 averaged to the total flow over the month which is far lower than the costs for imidazoline unless the latter is used at very low concentrations e g 10 ppm for the upper end of the ph range e g 7 the cost of hydrochloric acid could be up to 0 050 usd m3 yearly averaged zhong et al 2020 considering the significant enhancement to corrosion inhibition achieved the use of intermittent fna dosing to complement continuous imidazoline dosing is likely an economically attractive approach fna is biodegradable after being diluted to low concentrations in the same which means it would not cause secondary pollution unlike most of the commonly used organic biocides 5 conclusions the combined effect of imidazoline derivative hei 17 and fna on carbon steel corrosion in a simulated water injection system was investigated in laboratory tests the key findings are intermittent dosing of fna produces corrosion inhibition effects complementary to those by continuous dosing of corrosion inhibitors such as imidazoline derivatives when applied alone imidazoline derivative hei 17 has a strong inhibition effect on general corrosion and a moderate inhibition effect on pitting corrosion the intermittent dosing of fna substantially enhances the inhibition on pitting corrosion and also moderately enhances the inhibition on general corrosion fna dosing appears to inactivate remove biofilms on steel surfaces and hence its application frequency is determined by the speed of biofilm recovery this study suggests that the fna dosing frequency should be once a month
