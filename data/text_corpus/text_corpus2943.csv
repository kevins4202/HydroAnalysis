coastal regions shallower than 20m according to both the field observations and the jma satellite data fig s 2a and b we observed bottom hypoxia fig 2a over an area of 387 km2 of the shelf between the 20m and 30m isobaths which is beyond the hypoxia area induced by plume induced om according to historical observations and numerical simulations li et al 2021 yu et al 2021 furthermore and of particular note the hypoxia occurred on the offshore side of the plume region where scm reached fig 2b the hypoxia accompanied by the scm that we observed in a large estuary has not been reported before and it raises the question of what role the scm plays in the formation of bottom hypoxia the vertical distributions of physical and biogeochemical variables along cross shore sections showed that the scm contributed to the hypoxia formation fig 3 the offshore generated scm and associated om were transported onshore by persistent upslope upwelling circulation and accumulated in the bottom confluent zones at the edge of the plume where the scm intersected the sloping topography consequently the scm with chl a 2 µg l was observed at a depth between 15m and 25m referred to as the scm layer hereafter along these cross shore transects the linkage between scm and upslope transport is shown by the large n2 where sub pycnocline existed 20m depth fig 3g i affected by the terrestrial input and plume induced eutrophication the poc and doc dots in fig 3a f were high within the plume regions and decreased offshore due to dilution degradation and decreasing surface primary production li et al 2018 wu et al 2017 meanwhile a relatively higher concentration of poc was found within the scm layer and decreased sharply with depth while the doc was not obviously higher in the scm layer due to our low sampling resolution the existence of local sub pycnocline and enrichment of om from scm provided favorable conditions for the formation of the hypoxia along sections f2 p4 and f3 fig 3d f apart from the cross shore sections the vertical distributions of chl a n2 do and no3 along the 30m isobath provide more direct evidence for the scm occurrence and its contribution to hypoxia formation fig 4 a high concentration of chl a was observed at the depths of 15m to 25m with the highest value 5 2 µg l at the western pre near f204 fig 4a this higher concentration was related to the enhanced cross shore upwelling as shown by stronger n2 and colder bottom water fig 4b and s3 correspondingly we observed higher concentrations of poc and doc within the scm layer dots in fig 4a and c except that doc peaked at the surface for plume affected stations i e f204 p403 and f305 remineralization beneath the pycnocline led to a decrease in do fig 4c and an increase in no3 fig 4d at the bottom higher chl a and lower do in the scm layer were found in the western part of the section the spatial differences in the scm and do distribution support the conclusion that the do decline was positively related to the chl a concentration within the scm layer during the cruise of 2021 l3 to further support our conjecture we calculated the correlation between the minimum do and maximum chl a in the subsurface deeper than 15m at the depth of 30m with a total of 155 samples from the fourteen cruises fig 5 a we found that minimum do is negatively correlated with the subsurface chl a maximum with r 0 42 p 0 001 indicating that scm and associated om contribute to the do consumption although variable physical and biogeochemical processes among different stations make r less than 1 data from 2021 l3 highlighted by the blue dots generally follow the trend 3 2 quantification of the scm s contribution although it is not yet possible to directly quantify the in situ oxygen consumption caused by the scm associated om due to limited observations the empirical relationship of chl a and do differences between stations with scm referred to as scm stations n 43 and without scm referred to as no scm stations n 112 selected from historical cruise data cruise numbers 1 to 13 listed in table s1 can be used to estimate the potential do consumption during cruise 2021 l3 fig 5b c shows the averaged profiles of chl a and do at different stations red and magenta lines indicate the averaged profiles of scm stations along the 30m and 40m isobaths referred to as 30m stations and 40m stations respectively blue and cyan lines indicate the profiles of no scm stations at 30m stations and 40m stations respectively the averaged profiles of 2021 l3 cruise number 14 in table s1 at 30m stations are shown separately by the green lines referred to as scm 2021 l3 contrasting with the no scm stations where chl a peaked at the surface for scm stations the maximum chl a appeared at the sub pycnocline or in benthic water fig 5b the scm was stronger for the 30m stations than the 40m stations primarily because the enriched nutrients enhanced the scm and the upslope transported scm accumulated in the nearshore regions chen and zhao 2021 li et al 2020 the do depletion through remineralization exceeded the do supply through photosynthesis and vertical mixing leading to lower do within the scm layer fig 5c moreover do was higher at 40m stations than at 30m stations fig 5c confirming that local intensified do consumption is the dominant factor of hypoxia formation rather than onshore advection of low do water the averaged profiles of the scm 2021 l3 stations green lines resembled the scm 30m stations red lines however the bottom do was much lower or reached hypoxia at some stations although the chl a was less than scm 30m stations fig 5b c the impact of scm on do depletion can be quantified by examining the difference of the averaged chl a and do profiles between scm and no scm stations under the consideration that the do fluxes induced by physical and biogeochemical processes are consistent and have a small difference between scm and no scm stations in the averaged results thus the difference of the averaged chl a and do profiles between these two kinds of stations has excluded or non scm effect is minimized we also adopted the previous findings that the ratio between chl a and do consumption is constant in the diatom dominant pre sathyendranath et al 2009 wang et al 2011 upon these considerations we compared the averaged chl a and do profiles of the scm stations and scm 2021 l3 with no scm stations and calculate their depth integrated values below the pycnocline deeper than 15m fig 6 a b the difference shows that chl a difference δ chl a ranging from 1 47 1 89 µg l and associated om led to a decrease of 0 56 0 92 mg l in do δ do below the pycnocline for the scm 30m stations magenta lines in fig 6a b the depth integrated do consumption δ doint beneath the pycnocline reached 9 29 g m2 cyan dashed line mainly attributed to the enrichment of chl a induced by scm δ chl aint 21 03 mg m2 cyan dashed line in other words the relationship between δ chl aint mg m2 and δ doint g m2 based on 155 samples from repeatedly sampling stations in the 13 cruises is 1 δ d o int 0 44 δ chl a int here means the averaged result of historical cruise data and subscript int refers to the depth integration below the pycnocline although oxygen dynamics are regulated by many processes such as the remineralization rate of the om residence time horizontal advection vertical mixing etc differences in do fluxes induced by these processes are excluded or minimized in the averaged profiles for scm and no scm stations besides δ doint and δ chl aint are significantly correlated with r 0 36 p 0 05 figure not shown therefore the averaged relationship between δ chl aint and δ doint equation 1 is practical to estimate the contribution of scm to hypoxia that is 2 contribution δ chl a int δ d o int δ d o int δ chl a int 100 0 44 δ chl a int δ d o int 100 nonetheless it is important to note that physical and biogeochemical processes exhibited variability in different stations and cruises and that the differences between scm and non scm stations thus varied accordingly compared to scm 30m stations the scm 2021 l3 stations were characterized by a smaller δ chl a with a peak of 1 1 µg l and a larger δ do with a maximum of 1 87 mg l red lines in fig 6a b thus the δ chl aint was about half 9 59 mg m2 of the scm 30m stations but the δ doint reached 16 05 g m2 blue dashed lines in fig 6a b suggesting that scm induced om accounted for 26 contribution 9 59 16 05 0 44 100 26 of the do decline under the pycnocline for scm 2021 l3 stations this value might be underestimated considering the relatively weak influence of plume induced eutrophication during 2021 l3 compared with the general conditions i e no scm 30m stations moreover the contribution of the scm to the do consumption varied among 30m stations with different minimum do concentrations during 2021 l3 fig 6c specifically the contribution decreased with the decreasing δ chl aint and δ doint compared to their empirical relationship equation 1 green dashed line largely determined by the location or distance away from the river plume shown in fig 4a b the scm s contribution ranged from 6 9 at f701 to 81 at a14 with a standard deviation of 23 although the contribution of scm in the hypoxic stations p303 p403 j304 is less important 23 numbers shown in fig 6c from equation 2 than other do sinks e g degradation of plume induced om in the water column sediment oxygen consumption etc the presence of the scm in combination with strong stratification could enhance do consumption and shift the system from normoxia to hypoxia an illustration of the significant role of the scm in triggering hypoxia can be seen at station p403 where the domin is measured to be 1 9 mg l with a contribution of 20 from the scm fig 6c if the scm induced depletion was removed in δ doint 15 1 20 3 1 g m2 which corresponds to an increase of 0 2 mg l in do at the subsurface we find that the resulting domin would be 2 1 mg l surpassing the critical level for hypoxia similarly an increase of 0 3 mg l in do is found at station p303 and p403 such a change would have significant consequences for the aquatic ecological environments 4 discussion in situ measurement of do consumption induced by om from scm and river plume e g terrestrial om marine om from surface eutrophication is challenging descriptive statistics are applied to quantify the role of the scm in hypoxia formation based on data collected from 14 cruises and on our holistic understanding of coupled physical biogeochemical processes in the region two reasonable assumptions or considerations are made to obtain the relationship between chl a and do depletion 1 do fluxes induced by physical and biogeochemical processes remain constant in the averaged profiles for scm and no scm stations 2 the ratio between chl a and related do consumption is constant in pre some uncertainties may arise from the assumptions but they are expected to be small with justifications by sufficient field data of 155 samples from the 13 cruises and by previous findings the accuracy of the quantification can be further refined with possible in situ measurement of do consumption by om in the scm the river plume can affect the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry of the estuary shelf ecosystem yet during our survey in 2021 the plume was confined within the coastal regions with a distinct surface plume front along the 20m isobath as mentioned in section 3 1 the coastally trapped plume and its om induced by the episodic downwelling favorable wind was not the typical scenario in the summer with the prevailing upwelling favorable wind such a plume front characterized by convergent flow and a downward velocity was important for distributing surface chl a and om because it trapped biomass near the frontal convergent zones off the estuaries kilcher and nash 2010 zhang et al 2020 the observations also showed a higher concentration of poc below the surface plume front especially at stations f202 and f302 fig 3 the persistent upslope transport in the pre gan et al 2015 fueled additional om from the scm offshore to form the hypoxia which otherwise might not have occurred with the coastally trapped and weak plume fig 7 summarizes schematically the formation of hypoxia contributed by the om from the river and the scm in a large estuary shelf system the freshwater and onshore transported saline water converged near the bottom of plume front as shown in fig 3 this favored the accumulation of terrestrial and autochthonous om originating from both the surface eutrophication and the scm the convergent zones were thus shown to be favorable for hypoxia formation due to the characteristics of strong stratification and long residence time li et al 2020 it is also notable that hypoxia was absent in the nearshore coastal regions during 2021 l3 compared to previous observations fig 2b this is also partly attributed to the low river discharge under the downwelling favorable wind the plume confined the freshwater within the narrow coastal waters with a deep halocline fig s1c transported the nutrients to the west and reduced residence time in the nearshore region this together with diminished surface eutrophication deterred the formation of bottom hypoxia in the plume affected waters li et al 2021 the variations in salinity no3 chl a and do at depths of 3 m and 6 m measured from a buoy moored near the western coast shown by the green cross in fig 2a further confirmed the conclusion fig s1 the salinity decreased and no3 increased throughout the water column from 25 august when the wind changed from upwelling favorable wind to downwelling favorable wind the surface chl a which affects surface do through photosynthesis decreased after a slight increase due to the short residence time during downwelling favorable wind the bottom do varied in the same phase as the surface do for the enhanced mixing in the shallow coastal regions evidently bottom hypoxia cannot be established for such a short residence time and enhanced vertical mixing under downwelling favorable wind despite the high poc and doc in the plume influenced nearshore region this study firstly reports the contribution of the om from scm to triggering hypoxia under physical conditions that are not favorable for plume induced eutrophication and hypoxia based on coherent evidence from multiple observations and consistent physical and biogeochemical reasoning this study enriches our understanding of the mechanisms for coastal hypoxia formation the presence of the scm in combination with strong stratification could shift the system from normoxia to hypoxia and significantly affect biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in the coastal waters off the pre which likely occurs in other hypoxic regions cullen 2015 márquez artavia et al 2019 medina silva et al 2018 reductions in nutrient loads have improved oxygen conditions in some estuarine hypoxic systems where surface eutrophication is a dominant factor kemp et al 2009 however hypoxia has not been diminished by management efforts in many other areas especially in coastal systems where the scm might contribute to hypoxia formation pasqueron de fommervault et al 2017 wang et al 2019 5 conclusions we report the presence of the scm off the pre in august 2021 and examine the scm s contribution to hypoxia formation based on the data from 14 historical cruises conducted from 2014 to 2021 our result shows that the scm and associated oxygen consumption by the scm derived om contributed to the unique hypoxia formation under low river discharge and coastally trapped plume due to downwelling favorable wind conditions the scm and associated om are carried onshore by persistent upslope transport over the adjacent shelf and accumulate at the convergent zone of the plume front this zone is characterized by stable water columns and long residence time based on the observationally derived relationship between depth integrated chl a and do difference under the pycnocline the do consumption induced by the scm related om is estimated to contribute an average of 26 23 to the observed do decline ranging from 6 9 to 81 for scm 2021 l3 staions along the 30m isobath moreover the hypoxia accompanied by the scm is located at a depth between 20m and 30m on the offshore side of the surface river plume and eutrophication which indicates the necessary contribution of scm to the formation of hypoxia when riverine om and other processes of do consumption alone are not sufficient for the formation this study provides new and insightful information for understanding the formation of hypoxia in estuary shelf systems

20m and 30m isobaths which is beyond the hypoxia area induced by plume induced om according to historical observations and numerical simulations li et al 2021 yu et al 2021 furthermore and of particular note the hypoxia occurred on the offshore side of the plume region where scm reached fig 2b the hypoxia accompanied by the scm that we observed in a large estuary has not been reported before and it raises the question of what role the scm plays in the formation of bottom hypoxia the vertical distributions of physical and biogeochemical variables along cross shore sections showed that the scm contributed to the hypoxia formation fig 3 the offshore generated scm and associated om were transported onshore by persistent upslope upwelling circulation and accumulated in the bottom confluent zones at the edge of the plume where the scm intersected the sloping topography consequently the scm with chl a 2 µg l was observed at a depth between 15m and 25m referred to as the scm layer hereafter along these cross shore transects the linkage between scm and upslope transport is shown by the large n2 where sub pycnocline existed 20m depth fig 3g i affected by the terrestrial input and plume induced eutrophication the poc and doc dots in fig 3a f were high within the plume regions and decreased offshore due to dilution degradation and decreasing surface primary production li et al 2018 wu et al 2017 meanwhile a relatively higher concentration of poc was found within the scm layer and decreased sharply with depth while the doc was not obviously higher in the scm layer due to our low sampling resolution the existence of local sub pycnocline and enrichment of om from scm provided favorable conditions for the formation of the hypoxia along sections f2 p4 and f3 fig 3d f apart from the cross shore sections the vertical distributions of chl a n2 do and no3 along the 30m isobath provide more direct evidence for the scm occurrence and its contribution to hypoxia formation fig 4 a high concentration of chl a was observed at the depths of 15m to 25m with the highest value 5 2 µg l at the western pre near f204 fig 4a this higher concentration was related to the enhanced cross shore upwelling as shown by stronger n2 and colder bottom water fig 4b and s3 correspondingly we observed higher concentrations of poc and doc within the scm layer dots in fig 4a and c except that doc peaked at the surface for plume affected stations i e f204 p403 and f305 remineralization beneath the pycnocline led to a decrease in do fig 4c and an increase in no3 fig 4d at the bottom higher chl a and lower do in the scm layer were found in the western part of the section the spatial differences in the scm and do distribution support the conclusion that the do decline was positively related to the chl a concentration within the scm layer during the cruise of 2021 l3 to further support our conjecture we calculated the correlation between the minimum do and maximum chl a in the subsurface deeper than 15m at the depth of 30m with a total of 155 samples from the fourteen cruises fig 5 a we found that minimum do is negatively correlated with the subsurface chl a maximum with r 0 42 p 0 001 indicating that scm and associated om contribute to the do consumption although variable physical and biogeochemical processes among different stations make r less than 1 data from 2021 l3 highlighted by the blue dots generally follow the trend 3 2 quantification of the scm s contribution although it is not yet possible to directly quantify the in situ oxygen consumption caused by the scm associated om due to limited observations the empirical relationship of chl a and do differences between stations with scm referred to as scm stations n 43 and without scm referred to as no scm stations n 112 selected from historical cruise data cruise numbers 1 to 13 listed in table s1 can be used to estimate the potential do consumption during cruise 2021 l3 fig 5b c shows the averaged profiles of chl a and do at different stations red and magenta lines indicate the averaged profiles of scm stations along the 30m and 40m isobaths referred to as 30m stations and 40m stations respectively blue and cyan lines indicate the profiles of no scm stations at 30m stations and 40m stations respectively the averaged profiles of 2021 l3 cruise number 14 in table s1 at 30m stations are shown separately by the green lines referred to as scm 2021 l3 contrasting with the no scm stations where chl a peaked at the surface for scm stations the maximum chl a appeared at the sub pycnocline or in benthic water fig 5b the scm was stronger for the 30m stations than the 40m stations primarily because the enriched nutrients enhanced the scm and the upslope transported scm accumulated in the nearshore regions chen and zhao 2021 li et al 2020 the do depletion through remineralization exceeded the do supply through photosynthesis and vertical mixing leading to lower do within the scm layer fig 5c moreover do was higher at 40m stations than at 30m stations fig 5c confirming that local intensified do consumption is the dominant factor of hypoxia formation rather than onshore advection of low do water the averaged profiles of the scm 2021 l3 stations green lines resembled the scm 30m stations red lines however the bottom do was much lower or reached hypoxia at some stations although the chl a was less than scm 30m stations fig 5b c the impact of scm on do depletion can be quantified by examining the difference of the averaged chl a and do profiles between scm and no scm stations under the consideration that the do fluxes induced by physical and biogeochemical processes are consistent and have a small difference between scm and no scm stations in the averaged results thus the difference of the averaged chl a and do profiles between these two kinds of stations has excluded or non scm effect is minimized we also adopted the previous findings that the ratio between chl a and do consumption is constant in the diatom dominant pre sathyendranath et al 2009 wang et al 2011 upon these considerations we compared the averaged chl a and do profiles of the scm stations and scm 2021 l3 with no scm stations and calculate their depth integrated values below the pycnocline deeper than 15m fig 6 a b the difference shows that chl a difference δ chl a ranging from 1 47 1 89 µg l and associated om led to a decrease of 0 56 0 92 mg l in do δ do below the pycnocline for the scm 30m stations magenta lines in fig 6a b the depth integrated do consumption δ doint beneath the pycnocline reached 9 29 g m2 cyan dashed line mainly attributed to the enrichment of chl a induced by scm δ chl aint 21 03 mg m2 cyan dashed line in other words the relationship between δ chl aint mg m2 and δ doint g m2 based on 155 samples from repeatedly sampling stations in the 13 cruises is 1 δ d o int 0 44 δ chl a int here means the averaged result of historical cruise data and subscript int refers to the depth integration below the pycnocline although oxygen dynamics are regulated by many processes such as the remineralization rate of the om residence time horizontal advection vertical mixing etc differences in do fluxes induced by these processes are excluded or minimized in the averaged profiles for scm and no scm stations besides δ doint and δ chl aint are significantly correlated with r 0 36 p 0 05 figure not shown therefore the averaged relationship between δ chl aint and δ doint equation 1 is practical to estimate the contribution of scm to hypoxia that is 2 contribution δ chl a int δ d o int δ d o int δ chl a int 100 0 44 δ chl a int δ d o int 100 nonetheless it is important to note that physical and biogeochemical processes exhibited variability in different stations and cruises and that the differences between scm and non scm stations thus varied accordingly compared to scm 30m stations the scm 2021 l3 stations were characterized by a smaller δ chl a with a peak of 1 1 µg l and a larger δ do with a maximum of 1 87 mg l red lines in fig 6a b thus the δ chl aint was about half 9 59 mg m2 of the scm 30m stations but the δ doint reached 16 05 g m2 blue dashed lines in fig 6a b suggesting that scm induced om accounted for 26 contribution 9 59 16 05 0 44 100 26 of the do decline under the pycnocline for scm 2021 l3 stations this value might be underestimated considering the relatively weak influence of plume induced eutrophication during 2021 l3 compared with the general conditions i e no scm 30m stations moreover the contribution of the scm to the do consumption varied among 30m stations with different minimum do concentrations during 2021 l3 fig 6c specifically the contribution decreased with the decreasing δ chl aint and δ doint compared to their empirical relationship equation 1 green dashed line largely determined by the location or distance away from the river plume shown in fig 4a b the scm s contribution ranged from 6 9 at f701 to 81 at a14 with a standard deviation of 23 although the contribution of scm in the hypoxic stations p303 p403 j304 is less important 23 numbers shown in fig 6c from equation 2 than other do sinks e g degradation of plume induced om in the water column sediment oxygen consumption etc the presence of the scm in combination with strong stratification could enhance do consumption and shift the system from normoxia to hypoxia an illustration of the significant role of the scm in triggering hypoxia can be seen at station p403 where the domin is measured to be 1 9 mg l with a contribution of 20 from the scm fig 6c if the scm induced depletion was removed in δ doint 15 1 20 3 1 g m2 which corresponds to an increase of 0 2 mg l in do at the subsurface we find that the resulting domin would be 2 1 mg l surpassing the critical level for hypoxia similarly an increase of 0 3 mg l in do is found at station p303 and p403 such a change would have significant consequences for the aquatic ecological environments 4 discussion in situ measurement of do consumption induced by om from scm and river plume e g terrestrial om marine om from surface eutrophication is challenging descriptive statistics are applied to quantify the role of the scm in hypoxia formation based on data collected from 14 cruises and on our holistic understanding of coupled physical biogeochemical processes in the region two reasonable assumptions or considerations are made to obtain the relationship between chl a and do depletion 1 do fluxes induced by physical and biogeochemical processes remain constant in the averaged profiles for scm and no scm stations 2 the ratio between chl a and related do consumption is constant in pre some uncertainties may arise from the assumptions but they are expected to be small with justifications by sufficient field data of 155 samples from the 13 cruises and by previous findings the accuracy of the quantification can be further refined with possible in situ measurement of do consumption by om in the scm the river plume can affect the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry of the estuary shelf ecosystem yet during our survey in 2021 the plume was confined within the coastal regions with a distinct surface plume front along the 20m isobath as mentioned in section 3 1 the coastally trapped plume and its om induced by the episodic downwelling favorable wind was not the typical scenario in the summer with the prevailing upwelling favorable wind such a plume front characterized by convergent flow and a downward velocity was important for distributing surface chl a and om because it trapped biomass near the frontal convergent zones off the estuaries kilcher and nash 2010 zhang et al 2020 the observations also showed a higher concentration of poc below the surface plume front especially at stations f202 and f302 fig 3 the persistent upslope transport in the pre gan et al 2015 fueled additional om from the scm offshore to form the hypoxia which otherwise might not have occurred with the coastally trapped and weak plume fig 7 summarizes schematically the formation of hypoxia contributed by the om from the river and the scm in a large estuary shelf system the freshwater and onshore transported saline water converged near the bottom of plume front as shown in fig 3 this favored the accumulation of terrestrial and autochthonous om originating from both the surface eutrophication and the scm the convergent zones were thus shown to be favorable for hypoxia formation due to the characteristics of strong stratification and long residence time li et al 2020 it is also notable that hypoxia was absent in the nearshore coastal regions during 2021 l3 compared to previous observations fig 2b this is also partly attributed to the low river discharge under the downwelling favorable wind the plume confined the freshwater within the narrow coastal waters with a deep halocline fig s1c transported the nutrients to the west and reduced residence time in the nearshore region this together with diminished surface eutrophication deterred the formation of bottom hypoxia in the plume affected waters li et al 2021 the variations in salinity no3 chl a and do at depths of 3 m and 6 m measured from a buoy moored near the western coast shown by the green cross in fig 2a further confirmed the conclusion fig s1 the salinity decreased and no3 increased throughout the water column from 25 august when the wind changed from upwelling favorable wind to downwelling favorable wind the surface chl a which affects surface do through photosynthesis decreased after a slight increase due to the short residence time during downwelling favorable wind the bottom do varied in the same phase as the surface do for the enhanced mixing in the shallow coastal regions evidently bottom hypoxia cannot be established for such a short residence time and enhanced vertical mixing under downwelling favorable wind despite the high poc and doc in the plume influenced nearshore region this study firstly reports the contribution of the om from scm to triggering hypoxia under physical conditions that are not favorable for plume induced eutrophication and hypoxia based on coherent evidence from multiple observations and consistent physical and biogeochemical reasoning this study enriches our understanding of the mechanisms for coastal hypoxia formation the presence of the scm in combination with strong stratification could shift the system from normoxia to hypoxia and significantly affect biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in the coastal waters off the pre which likely occurs in other hypoxic regions cullen 2015 márquez artavia et al 2019 medina silva et al 2018 reductions in nutrient loads have improved oxygen conditions in some estuarine hypoxic systems where surface eutrophication is a dominant factor kemp et al 2009 however hypoxia has not been diminished by management efforts in many other areas especially in coastal systems where the scm might contribute to hypoxia formation pasqueron de fommervault et al 2017 wang et al 2019 5 conclusions we report the presence of the scm off the pre in august 2021 and examine the scm s contribution to hypoxia formation based on the data from 14 historical cruises conducted from 2014 to 2021 our result shows that the scm and associated oxygen consumption by the scm derived om contributed to the unique hypoxia formation under low river discharge and coastally trapped plume due to downwelling favorable wind conditions the scm and associated om are carried onshore by persistent upslope transport over the adjacent shelf and accumulate at the convergent zone of the plume front this zone is characterized by stable water columns and long residence time based on the observationally derived relationship between depth integrated chl a and do difference under the pycnocline the do consumption induced by the scm related om is estimated to contribute an average of 26 23 to the observed do decline ranging from 6 9 to 81 for scm 2021 l3 staions along the 30m isobath moreover the hypoxia accompanied by the scm is located at a depth between 20m and 30m on the offshore side of the surface river plume and eutrophication which indicates the necessary contribution of scm to the formation of hypoxia when riverine om and other processes of do consumption alone are not sufficient for the formation this study provides new and insightful information for understanding the formation of hypoxia in estuary shelf systems

14716,pfass and chlorinated solvents are the common co contaminants in soil and groundwater at firefighter training areas ftas although pfass mixtures could have adverse impacts on bioremediation of trichloroethylene tce by inhibiting dehalococcoides dhc little is known about the effect and contribution of pfoa or pfos on dechlorination of tce by non dhc organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb to study this pfoa and pfos were amended to the growth medium of a non dhc ohrb containing enrichment culture to determine the impact on dechlorination this study demonstrated that high levels of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 inhibited tce dechlorination in four non dhc ohrb containing community including geobacter desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter but low levels of pfoa or pfos 10 mg l 1 enhanced tce dechlorination four non dhc ohrb were less inhibited by pfoa than that by pfos and high level of pfos killed desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter and decreased the biodiversity of bacterial community although most fermenters were killed by the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos two important co cultures desulfovibrio and sedimentibacter of ohrb were enriched indicating that the syntrophic relationships between ohrb and co cultures still remained and pfoa or pfos inhibited tce dechlorination by directly repressing non dhc ohrb our results highlight that the bioattenuation of chloroethene contamination could be confounded by non dhc ohrb in high levels of pfos contaminated subsurface environments at ftas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trichloroethylene pfas reductive dechlorination inhibition biodiversity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the co contamination of chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce and poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in groundwater and soil at historic firefighter training areas ftas has increasingly received attention due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation guelfo and higgins 2013 harding marjanovic et al 2016 mcguire et al 2014 mckenzie et al 2016 weathers et al 2016 pfass can reduce surface tension and facilitate foam spreading and fire smothering thus they have been added into aqueous film forming foams afffs moody and field 2000 the chlorinated solvents were frequently ignited as the flammable component in the training exercises moody and field 2000 the application of afffs to extinguish chlorinated solvent fueled fires has led to the co contamination of pfass and tce in groundwater and soil at ftas although biodegradation of pfass is not expected in most cases according to the published articles huang and jaffé 2019 liu and mejia avendaño 2013 there are concerns regarding the potential adverse effects from pfass exposure on subsurface microbial communities and co contaminant degradability cao et al 2022 fitzgerald et al 2019 qiao et al 2018 weathers et al 2016 pfass played an important role in shaping bacterial community and high level of pfass 100 μg kg 1 dw reduced the biodiversity and connectivity of soil bacteria at ftas cao et al 2022 a experiment showed that exposure of 10 mg kg 1 perfluorosulfonic acid pfos reduced soil sucrase by 30 and damaged the soil ammonia oxidation process qiao et al 2018 when an anaerobic digester community were exposed to pfos 50 mg l 1 and a co contaminant 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp pfass altered the toxicity of dcp inhibited dcp degradation and decreased the number of methanogens fitzgerald et al 2019 in situ bioremediation isb of chlorinated ethenes has been considered to be a feasible remediation technology for plume and low strength source zones as well as a polishing technology for higher strength sources after more aggressive approaches have been used stroo et al 2014 in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes generally relies on a class of organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb which are responsible for the key process of reductive dechlorination adrian and löffler 2016 among the ohrb strains within dehalococcoides dhc play a pivotal role in isb of chlorinated ethenes due to their ability to respire with dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc ding et al 2020 he et al 2003b however dehalococcoides are extremely sensitive to environmental factors such as co contaminants adrian and löffler 2016 ding et al 2020 which can lead to the failure of in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes experiments amended with afff derived pfass showed that pfass inhibited tce dechlorination by a dehalococcoides mccartyi containing microbial community and the inhibition depends on pfass concentration and structure harding marjanovic et al 2016 also tce dechlorination was inhibited by repressing the axenic cultures of dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 when exposed to concentrations representative of pfass source zones total of 66 mg l 1 for 11 pfass analytes 6 mg l 1 each weathers et al 2016 several non dhc ohrb are also involved in the initial steps in dechlorination such as dechlorinating pce tce to cis dce büsing et al 2020 liang et al 2021 nelson et al 2014 the previous studies merely focused on the toxicity of pfass to the genus dehalococcoides which limits the understanding of non dhc ohrb behaviors response to pfass exposure harding marjanovic et al 2016 weathers et al 2016 however this information is critical to design a remediation plan for in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes as dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents by ohrb was reported to be sensitive to the presence of co contaminants perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and pfos are the most prevalent pfass species and are persistent in groundwater and soil at the ftas reported for all the studies baduel et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 cao et al 2022 houtz et al 2013 the maximum reported concentrations for pfoa ranged from 2 to 50 000 μg kg 1 dw while ranged from 381 to 373 000 μg kg 1 dw for pfos brusseau et al 2020 cao et al 2022 pfoa and pfos have been linked to adverse impacts on microbial processes liu et al 2016 but the contribution of their respective toxicity to the effect of microbial reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes is unclear pfoa and pfos as a kind of surfactant moody and field 2000 trier et al 2011 can also promote the desorption and solubility of adsorbed tce in soil and may increase the bioavailability for ohrb abriola et al 2005 jordan and cunningham 1999 rothmel et al 1998 in addition pfoa and pfos may not affect the microorganisms due to the super stability of characteristic and low levels of concentration rosal et al 2010 weathers et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b the objective of this study was to address these uncertainties that how pfoa or pfos may impact microbial communities relevant to tce bioremediation involving non dhc ohrb the soil from a tce contaminated site was cultivated in the presence of various concentrations of pfoa or pfos to evaluate the rates of tce dechlorination we also compared the community structure of these microcosms to investigate ecological shifts and syntrophic relationships within this consortium that could be attributed to pfoa or pfos presence our results will provide useful information about the impact of the prevalent pfass including pfoa and pfos on in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes and deepen the understanding of the impact of pfass on non dhc ohrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents pfoa 98 purity cas 335 67 1 was purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd and pfos 98 purity cas

a total of 50 μmoles of tce per bottle was added as the electron acceptor by microliter syringe hamilton usa 2 3 reductive dechlorination of tce the experiments of dechlorination tce were divided into three steps firstly the soil used for inoculum was collected from a chlorinated solvents contaminated site in tianjin china in september 2019 the topsoil below 10 cm was stored in 50 ml sterile falcon tubes and transported to the lab in the same day soil samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until use approximately 5 g fresh soil was inoculated into medium in october 2019 batch systems containing tce lactate and pfoa or pfos were conducted to evaluate microbial degradation rates reductive dechlorination experiments contained triplicate sets of 0 10 or 100 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos all microcosms were incubated in the dark at 30 c the aim of the second step experiment was to verify the phenomenon that 10 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos may enhance reductive dechlorination of tce in the first experiment to evaluate the impact of low levels of pfoa or pfos on tce dechlorination the mixed cultures grown without pfas from the first experiment were transferred to fresh mediums with low levels of pfoa or pfos reductive dechlorination experiments contained duplicate sets of 0 5 10 or 20 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos the third step experiment was to explain why only the genus desulfitobacterium was highly enriched by the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa and the rates of tce dechlorination were compared by a desulfitobacterium containing community in the presence of 50 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos after tce dechlorination profiles were generated the medium was collected by extracting 1 ml of well mixed culture into a 1 ml pp centrifuge tube centrifuging at 14 500 rpm for 15 min the 850 μl supernatant was transferred into a pp vial for verification of pfoa and pfos concentrations and the residual was stored at 20 c for high throughput sequencing 2 4 analytical methods tce cis dce vc and ethene were

2 2 μm 2 1 mm 100 mm as described previously cao et al 2022 according to equilibrium mass distribution calculations amount of pfoa and pfos in water was one order of magnitude larger than that at soil

contaminated site were incubated with various concentrations of pfoa or pfos 0 100 mg l 1 to reveal how pfoa or pfos impact the process of tce dechlorination at concentration of 10 mg l 1 pfoa and pfos showed similar promoting effect on tce dechlorination tce dechlorination and cis dce production rates were not affected in initial 10 days and then enhanced after day 10 fig 1 inhibitory effect on dechlorination of tce was observed in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa along with a decrease in cis dce production rates fig 1 dechlorination of tce were completely inhibited in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos and no accumulation of cis dce was observed fig 1 this result suggested that 100 mg l 1 pfos was more toxic than pfoa for dechlorination of tce cis dce was the only product and no further dechlorination of cis dce was observed during 40 days incubation also no biodegradation of pfoa or pfos was observed by lc ms fig s1 these results indicated that high level of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 had an obvious inhibition on dechlorination of tce but low level of pfoa or pfos 10 mg l 1 may enhance dechlorination of tce analogous inhibition to dechlorination of tce has been previously observed in a dehalococcoides mccartyi containing microbial community with 110 mg l 1 pfass mixtures but how each pfas contributed to the inhibition of tce dechlorination was unknown weathers et al 2016 our study indicated that pfos was more toxic than pfoa for dechlorination of tce at the concentration of 100 mg l 1 however this conclusion was inconsistent with previous results that the rate of tce dechlorination was inhibited by a dehalococcoides mccartyi containing community only in the presence of 11 component perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas mixture where equivalent concentrations of only perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas mixture were not affected harding marjanovic et al 2016 this suggests that there may be completely different response between dhc ohrb and non dhc ohrb when exposed to pfass to determine the threshold of pfas concentration for the enhancement effect on tce dechlorination lower concentrations of pfoa or pfos 5 10 20 mg l 1 were further investigated dechlorination of tce was enhanced when the concentrations of pfoa was 20 mg l 1 while the concentrations for pfos was 10 mg l 1 fig s2 pfos of 20 mg l 1 already showed inhibition effect on tce dechlorination which further indicates that this process was less inhibited by pfoa than that by pfos lc ms result showed that no biodegradation of pfoa or pfos was observed during the process of tce dechlorination either with lower pfas concentrations fig s3 there are few researches on the effect of pfas on the rate of microbial reductive dechlorination here we found that low levels of pfass 20 mg l 1 enhanced tce dechlorination in a non dhc ohrb containing community but inhibited tce dechlorination under higher concentrations of pfass previous studies showed that treatments containing 50 mg l 1 pfos inhibited 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp dechlorination in an anaerobic microbial community and the other pfass tested perfluorobutanesulfonate perfluorobutanoic acid pfoa did not significantly delay dcp dechlorination fitzgerald et al 2019 so far it has not been reported that low concentrations of pfass can enhance microbial reduction dechlorination researches have demonstrated that surfactants such as tween 80 and brijs can enhance biogas production h2 and ch4 and bioremediation by increasing the bioavailability or desorbing of the organic contaminants elsamadony et al 2015 he et al 2019 seo and bishop 2007 van hoof and jafvert 1996 tween 80 decreased dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene hcb at concentrations significantly above the critical micelle concentration cmc 1500 5000 mg l 1 but increased hcb dechlorination rate constants four to fivefold at concentrations closer to the cmc 300 1200 mg l 1 in acclimated slurries also additions of tween 80 at or below the cmc 3 30 300 and 911 mg l 1 enhanced dechlorination activity in unacclimated slurries that exhibited very little activity in unamended controls van hoof and jafvert 1996 in this study pfoa and pfos serve as a kind of fluorinated surfactant guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2016 moody and field 2000 trier et al 2011 thus they may enhance the bioavailability of tce for non dhc ohrb in a case pfos increased the aqueous solubility of tce by approximately 35 for concentrations of 100 mg l 1 and greater van glubt and brusseau 2021 however high levels of pfass could be more toxic than enhancement of bioavailability to non dhc ohrb in subsurface locations where pfass occur with chlorinated solvents polyoxyethylene alcohols brijs significantly reduced hcb dechlorination activity at concentrations above the cmc and no effect was observed for brijs at sub cmc levels van hoof and jafvert 1996 3 2 less inhibition of pfoa to non dhc ohrb than pfos at high concentrations all ohrb relevant to tce dechlorination to cis dce were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing which showed different responses of various non dhc ohrb to pfoa or pfos exposure four non dhc ohrb desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and geobacter capable of dechlorinating tce to cis dce table s1 were enriched during the process of tce dechlorination with the presence of pfas the bacterial communities in the tce fed cultures changed significantly at the genus level when compared to the no tce control cultures fig s4 the relative abundances of four non dhc ohrb desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and geobacter in the tce fed cultures were higher than that in no tce control cultures which indicated that these dechlorinating populations were involved in the tce reduction fig s5 however desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium and geobacter also presented in the no tce fed control cultures since these populations could harvest energy for cell growth from fermentation heijthuijsen and hansen 1989 kruse et al 2017 lovley and phillips 1988 the relative abundances of these non dhc ohrb exposed to pfoa were generally higher than those exposed to pfos except for geobacter in the presence of 10 mg l 1 pfos fig 2 the relative abundances of desulfuromonas dehalobacter and geobacter decreased with increasing concentration of pfoa or pfos from 10 to 100 mg l 1 notably only genus desulfitobacterium was highly enriched when exposed to 100 mg l 1 pfoa which relative abundance increased by 3 fold with increasing concentration of pfoa with 100 mg l 1 pfos desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter disappeared the relative abundance of desulfitobacterium increased from 2 1 to 7 1 with increasing concentration of pfoa fig 2b which implies that pfoa may have no or a weak effect on desulfitobacterium to further investigate the effect of pfoa on desulfitobacterium a desulfitobacterium containing community was transferred to a fresh medium 2 v v with tce and 50 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos with the presence of 50 mg l 1 pfoa tce dechlorination rate and cis dce production rate were very similar to those without pfas fig 3 a and b however 50 mg l 1 pfos appreciably inhibited reductive dechlorination of tce by repressing desulfitobacterium because the relative abundance of desulfitobacterium decreased from 33 4 0 2 to 6 3 3 5 in the presence of 50 mg l 1 pfos fig 3c the pcoa analysis of desulfitobacterium containing community showed all samples can be categorized into three groups fig 3d inoculum samples without pfas or 50 ppm pfoa and samples with 50 ppm pfos these results confirmed that high level of pfoa 50 mg l 1 had little impact on desulfitobacterium thus only the desulfitobacterium was highly enriched when exposed to high levels of pfoa so far there is no consistent conclusion about the toxicity comparison between pfoa and pfos in this study tce dechlorination was less inhibited by pfoa than by pfos in the four non dhc ohrb containing community additionally the desulfitobacterium containing community proved that pfoa as high as 50 mg l 1 had little impact on tce dechlorination however much higher toxicity to escherichia coli was observed for pfoa than pfos with the 3 h half growth inhibition concentrations ic50 determined to be 10 6 1 0 mg l 1 for pfoa and 374 3 mg l 1 for pfos liu et al 2016 also pfos was more toxic than pfoa for four freshwater species including dugesia japonica physa acuta daphnia magna and neocaridina denticulate li 2009 microbial toxicity was positively correlated to fluorinated chain length suggesting that longer chain length pfas were more likely to influence co contaminant degradation fitzgerald et al 2019 soil microbial activity showed that the sulfonic pfass expressed higher toxicity than the carboxylic pfass cai et al 2019 suggesting that the sulfonic group was more toxic than the carboxylic group pfos has 8 fluorinated chains with a sulfonic group while pfoa has only 7 fluorinated chains a carboxylic group which possibly also contributed to the higher toxicity of pfos compared to pfoa 3 3 the effect of pfoa or pfos on bacterial biodiversity high level of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 decreased the biodiversity of bacterial community but less affected by pfoa than by pfos the alpha diversity indices of each enrichment culture showed an obvious decrease in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos the chao 1 index was used to estimate the number of otus richness of bacterial community contained in the sample which decreased by 35 3 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos and decreased by 17 0 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa fig 4 a consequently the number of species of each enriched culture showed an obvious concentration dependent variation the number of species decreased from 3057 to 1957 with increasing concentration of pfoa which had a larger decrease from 3057 to 1493 with presence of pfos fig s6 the shannon index also decreased by 33 1 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos and by 16 7 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa fig 4b unlike the toxicity comparison between pfoa and pfos almost all studies have concluded that high levels of pfass have a negative impact on biodiversity of bacterial community bao et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b our previous research also demonstrated that pfass above 100 μg kg 1 dw reduced the biodiversity of soil bacteria at ftas cao et al 2022 a similar study further showed that the existence of pfass and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons co contamination in groundwater resulted in a considerable decrease in the diversity of microbial communities tang et al 2022 the shannon index in a freshwater pond with 5 mg l 1 pfoa 2 83 0 06 was significantly lower than that without pfoa 3 86 0 08 zhang et al 2019a while the shannon and chao 1 index in soils with 10 mg kg 1 pfos were lower than those in soils with pfos ranging from 10 to 1000 μg kg 1 qiao et al 2018 notably 10 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos did not appreciably affect the biodiversity both chao 1 index and shannon index of bacterial community in this study with higher concentration than those mentioned above the main reason of the inconsistency was that the community in this study had been acclimated to dechlorination with the selective pressure of tce presence where 10 mg l 1 pfass enhanced tce dechlorination instead of destroying the dechlorinating community showing little impact on the community diversity however exposure to high level of pfass can kill some sensitive bacterial species on site leading to decreased biodiversity of bacterial community in natural environment 3 4 the syntrophic relationships between non dhc ohrb and co cultures with the presence of pfass to understand how pfoa or pfos affected the bacterial community community composition and putative functionalities of species were explored by high throughput sequencing to reveal the syntrophic relationships between non dhc ohrb and co cultures potential bacteria associated with tce dechlorination sulfate reduction and lactate fermentation occupied the majority of the bacterial population in each enrichment culture table s2 the predominant genera in each enrichment culture except for that with 100 ppm pfos were sedimentibacter unclassified genus from family rhodocyclaceae clostridium sensu stricto 7 and desulfovibrio fig 5 a these four representative genera accounted for 22 1 36 3 of the total bacterial population in each enrichment culture sedimentibacter clostridium sensu stricto 7 and desulfovibrio were commonly found to co exist with ohrb in enrichment cultures and natural environments cheng et al 2009 grostern and edwards elizabeth 2006 maphosa et al 2012 van doesburg et al 2005 wen et al 2017 and played important roles in supporting the growth of ohrb such as dehalobacter by producing growth factors grostern and edwards elizabeth 2006 the heat map at the genus level graphically shows that bacterial communities in 100 mg l 1 pfos changed significantly at the genus level when compared to no pfas and 10 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos fig 5b which was consistent with the result of pcoa analysis fig s7 most of fermenters clostridium sensu stricto 7 fonticella cryptanaerobacter gracilibacter brassicibacter alkaliphilus fang et al 2012 lee et al 2006 li et al 2022 li et al 2013 wen et al 2017 zhilina et al 2009 were killed by the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos these results suggest that there is a complex interaction between pfass and bacteria in bioremediation communities that varied depending on the type of pfass and species which should be further investigated in the future although 100 mg l 1 pfos killed most of ferments in the mixed culture hydrogen and acetate producing fermenters of enterobacter and desulfovibrio were enriched the largest relative abundance of desulfovibrio 9 0 was observed in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos desulfovibrio can ferment lactate to provide h2 and acetate for ohrb growth along with potential benefits from proton translocation cobalamin salvaging and amino acid biosynthesis men et al 2011 in addition cobalamin producing bacteria sedimentibacter was present in all enrichment cultures the sedimentibacter was positively correlated with concentrations of pfoa or pfos and took up 20 5 of the total bacterial population with the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos sedimentibacter is capable of synthesizing cobalamin that is an essential cofactor of reductive dehalogenases maphosa et al 2012 therefore all the factors including hydrogen acetate and cobalamin required for maintaining growth of non dhc ohrb desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and geobacter were present this indicated that the syntrophic relationships between ohrb and co cultures still remained with high concentration of pfos thus the inhibition to dechlorination of tce was directly affected by repressing non dhc ohrb pfoa and pfos are anionic surfactants and anionic surfactants often result in microbial toxicity mcguire and hughes 2003 surfactant interactions with proteins especially membrane bound enzymes such as those involved in respiratory processes are a known mechanism of surfactant toxicity toward microorganisms rouse et al 1994 at lower surfactant concentrations enhancement of chemical transport across biological membranes has been observed but higher surfactant concentrations are useful for solubilizing membrane components helenius and simons 1975 rosen 1984 in this study low level of pfoa or pfos can enhance chemical transport across biological membranes but high level of pfoa or pfos may disrupt the structure of microbial membranes three pathogens including aeromonas tyzzerella and terrisporobacter were highly enriched only in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos fig 5b the genus aeromonas is regarded not only as an important disease causing pathogen of animals but also as the etiologic agent responsible for a variety of infectious complications in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons janda and abbott 2010 tyzzerella piliformis is recognized as the causative agent of tyzzer s disease an often fatal enterohepatic disease which has been described for a wide range of domestic laboratory and wild animal species riley et al 1990 members of terrisporobacter are an emerging anaerobic pathogen associated with diarrhea cheng et al 2016 although the reason why these three genera were only enriched with the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos was unclear this result suggests that sites with high levels of pfos contamination may be at risk for such pathogens 4 conclusions understanding the effect of pfass on reductive dechlorination is critical to design a bioremediation plan for chlorinated solvents due to the common co occurrence of pfass and chlorinated solvents at ftas and the reliance on microbiological processes for chlorinated solvents attenuation this study investigated that how pfoa or pfos may impact microbial communities relevant to tce bioremediation involving non dhc ohrb our study demonstrated that high levels of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 inhibited tce dechlorination in four non dhc orhb containing community including geobacter desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter but low levels of pfoa or pfos 10 mg l 1 enhanced tce dechlorination pfos showed a stronger inhibitory effect on reductive dechlorination than pfoa with non dhc ohrb in this study high level of pfos killed desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and most fermenters and decreased the biodiversity of bacterial community these results highlight the need for comprehensive site investigation monitoring and management to ensure success bioattenuation of chlorinated solvent in sites that are co contaminated with pfass

14716,pfass and chlorinated solvents are the common co contaminants in soil and groundwater at firefighter training areas ftas although pfass mixtures could have adverse impacts on bioremediation of trichloroethylene tce by inhibiting dehalococcoides dhc little is known about the effect and contribution of pfoa or pfos on dechlorination of tce by non dhc organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb to study this pfoa and pfos were amended to the growth medium of a non dhc ohrb containing enrichment culture to determine the impact on dechlorination this study demonstrated that high levels of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 inhibited tce dechlorination in four non dhc ohrb containing community including geobacter desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter but low levels of pfoa or pfos 10 mg l 1 enhanced tce dechlorination four non dhc ohrb were less inhibited by pfoa than that by pfos and high level of pfos killed desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter and decreased the biodiversity of bacterial community although most fermenters were killed by the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos two important co cultures desulfovibrio and sedimentibacter of ohrb were enriched indicating that the syntrophic relationships between ohrb and co cultures still remained and pfoa or pfos inhibited tce dechlorination by directly repressing non dhc ohrb our results highlight that the bioattenuation of chloroethene contamination could be confounded by non dhc ohrb in high levels of pfos contaminated subsurface environments at ftas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trichloroethylene pfas reductive dechlorination inhibition biodiversity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the co contamination of chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce and poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in groundwater and soil at historic firefighter training areas ftas has increasingly received attention due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation guelfo and higgins 2013 harding marjanovic et al 2016 mcguire et al 2014 mckenzie et al 2016 weathers et al 2016 pfass can reduce surface tension and facilitate foam spreading and fire smothering thus they have been added into aqueous film forming foams afffs moody and field 2000 the chlorinated solvents were frequently ignited as the flammable component in the training exercises moody and field 2000 the application of afffs to extinguish chlorinated solvent fueled fires has led to the co contamination of pfass and tce in groundwater and soil at ftas although biodegradation of pfass is not expected in most cases according to the published articles huang and jaffé 2019 liu and mejia avendaño 2013 there are concerns regarding the potential adverse effects from pfass exposure on subsurface microbial communities and co contaminant degradability cao et al 2022 fitzgerald et al 2019 qiao et al 2018 weathers et al 2016 pfass played an important role in shaping bacterial community and high level of pfass 100 μg kg 1 dw reduced the biodiversity and connectivity of soil bacteria at ftas cao et al 2022 a experiment showed that exposure of 10 mg kg 1 perfluorosulfonic acid pfos reduced soil sucrase by 30 and damaged the soil ammonia oxidation process qiao et al 2018 when an anaerobic digester community were exposed to pfos 50 mg l 1 and a co contaminant 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp pfass altered the toxicity of dcp inhibited dcp degradation and decreased the number of methanogens fitzgerald et al 2019 in situ bioremediation isb of chlorinated ethenes has been considered to be a feasible remediation technology for plume and low strength source zones as well as a polishing technology for higher strength sources after more aggressive approaches have been used stroo et al 2014 in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes generally relies on a class of organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb which are responsible for the key process of reductive dechlorination adrian and löffler 2016 among the ohrb strains within dehalococcoides dhc play a pivotal role in isb of chlorinated ethenes due to their ability to respire with dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc ding et al 2020 he et al 2003b however dehalococcoides are extremely sensitive to environmental factors such as co contaminants adrian and löffler 2016 ding et al 2020 which can lead to the failure of in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes experiments amended with afff derived pfass showed that pfass inhibited tce dechlorination by a dehalococcoides mccartyi containing microbial community and the inhibition depends on pfass concentration and structure harding marjanovic et al 2016 also tce dechlorination was inhibited by repressing the axenic cultures of dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 when exposed to concentrations representative of pfass source zones total of 66 mg l 1 for 11 pfass analytes 6 mg l 1 each weathers et al 2016 several non dhc ohrb are also involved in the initial steps in dechlorination such as dechlorinating pce tce to cis dce büsing et al 2020 liang et al 2021 nelson et al 2014 the previous studies merely focused on the toxicity of pfass to the genus dehalococcoides which limits the understanding of non dhc ohrb behaviors response to pfass exposure harding marjanovic et al 2016 weathers et al 2016 however this information is critical to design a remediation plan for in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes as dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents by ohrb was reported to be sensitive to the presence of co contaminants perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and pfos are the most prevalent pfass species and are persistent in groundwater and soil at the ftas reported for all the studies baduel et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 cao et al 2022 houtz et al 2013 the maximum reported concentrations for pfoa ranged from 2 to 50 000 μg kg 1 dw while ranged from 381 to 373 000 μg kg 1 dw for pfos brusseau et al 2020 cao et al 2022 pfoa and pfos have been linked to adverse impacts on microbial processes liu et al 2016 but the contribution of their respective toxicity to the effect of microbial reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes is unclear pfoa and pfos as a kind of surfactant moody and field 2000 trier et al 2011 can also promote the desorption and solubility of adsorbed tce in soil and may increase the bioavailability for ohrb abriola et al 2005 jordan and cunningham 1999 rothmel et al 1998 in addition pfoa and pfos may not affect the microorganisms due to the super stability of characteristic and low levels of concentration rosal et al 2010 weathers et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b the objective of this study was to address these uncertainties that how pfoa or pfos may impact microbial communities relevant to tce bioremediation involving non dhc ohrb the soil from a tce contaminated site was cultivated in the presence of various concentrations of pfoa or pfos to evaluate the rates of tce dechlorination we also compared the community structure of these microcosms to investigate ecological shifts and syntrophic relationships within this consortium that could be attributed to pfoa or pfos presence our results will provide useful information about the impact of the prevalent pfass including pfoa and pfos on in situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes and deepen the understanding of the impact of pfass on non dhc ohrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents pfoa 98 purity cas 335 67 1 was purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd and pfos 98 purity cas 2795 39 3 tce and cis dce were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd pudong shanghai china pfoa pfos and vinyl chloride vc standards of 1000 mg l 1 dissolved in methanol were purchased from tianjin alta scientific co ltd first standard tianjin china pfoa and pfos salts were dissolved in a 70 30 v v methanol water solution to prepare 5 g l 1 pfoa and pfos stock solutions all stock standards and solutions were stored in polypropylene pp tubes at 20 c water used in this study was produced from a milli q system millipore usa with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 1 2 2 growth conditions experiments were conducted in 100 ml glass serum bottles filled with 50 ml of a reduced anaerobic medium which contained vitamins 1 μg l 1 vitamin b12 lactate 10 mm and resazurin 0 1 solution as previously described yan et al 2015 the resazurin served as a redox indicator he et al 2003a pfoa or pfos was added to sterile glass serum bottles with a sterile pp syringe bd 1 ml disposable syringe a total of 50 μmoles of tce per bottle was added as the electron acceptor by microliter syringe hamilton usa 2 3 reductive dechlorination of tce the experiments of dechlorination tce were divided into three steps firstly the soil used for inoculum was collected from a chlorinated solvents contaminated site in tianjin china in september 2019 the topsoil below 10 cm was stored in 50 ml sterile falcon tubes and transported to the lab in the same day soil samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until use approximately 5 g fresh soil was inoculated into medium in october 2019 batch systems containing tce lactate and pfoa or pfos were conducted to evaluate microbial degradation rates reductive dechlorination experiments contained triplicate sets of 0 10 or 100 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos all microcosms were incubated in the dark at 30 c the aim of the second step experiment was to verify the phenomenon that 10 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos may enhance reductive dechlorination of tce in the first experiment to evaluate the impact of low levels of pfoa or pfos on tce dechlorination the mixed cultures grown without pfas from the first experiment were transferred to fresh mediums with low levels of pfoa or pfos reductive dechlorination experiments contained duplicate sets of 0 5 10 or 20 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos the third step experiment was to explain why only the genus desulfitobacterium was highly enriched by the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa and the rates of tce dechlorination were compared by a desulfitobacterium containing community in the presence of 50 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos after tce dechlorination profiles were generated the medium was collected by extracting 1 ml of well mixed culture into a 1 ml pp centrifuge tube centrifuging at 14 500 rpm for 15 min the 850 μl supernatant was transferred into a pp vial for verification of pfoa and pfos concentrations and the residual was stored at 20 c for high throughput sequencing 2 4 analytical methods tce cis dce vc and ethene were measured by an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm hp 5 agilent technologies usa the oven temperature was initially held at 33 c for 3 min and then increased at 30 c min 1 to 140 c headspace samples of 200 μl were withdrawn with gas tight 1 ml hamilton glass syringes and manually injected into a split injector operated at a split ratio of 10 1 pfoa and pfos were analyzed via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ultimate 3000 isq ec thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with an acclaim rslc 120 c18 column 2 2 μm 2 1 mm 100 mm as described previously cao et al 2022 according to equilibrium mass distribution calculations amount of pfoa and pfos in water was one order of magnitude larger than that at soil phase so we neglect the pfoa or pfos adsorbed on the soil briefly the supernatants from section 2 3 were diluted 100 fold with 50 50 methanol water all samples were analyzed in 1000 μl of 50 50 methanol water milli q water containing 10 mm ammonium acetate was used as the aqueous phase a and the organic phase b was acetonitrile the flow velocity of the mobile phase was 0 3 ml min 1 the injection volume was set at 25 μl and the column temperature at 30 c the eluent gradient started with 35 b for 0 5 min followed by a linear increase in phase b from 35 to 60 0 5 10 min the 60 phase b was held for 2 min 10 12 min and eventually returned to the initial conditions within 1 min and held for 2 min for equilibration during the injection interval detection was done by a heated electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode v 4 5 kv the nebulizing gas temperature was set at 450 c ms spectrometry parameters of target compounds were set at m z 413 for pfoa and m z 499 for pfos the limits of detection for pfoa is 0 45 μg l 1 and for pfos is 0 15 μg l 1 2 5 high throughput sequencing dna was extracted as described in the manual of the fast dna spin kit for soil mpbio usa

platform of majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com 3 results and discussions 3 1 dual effects of pfoa or pfos on tce dechlorination the collected soil samples from a chlorinated solvents contaminated site were incubated with various concentrations of pfoa or pfos 0 100 mg l 1 to reveal how pfoa or pfos impact the process of tce dechlorination at concentration of 10 mg l 1 pfoa and pfos showed similar promoting effect on tce dechlorination tce dechlorination and cis dce production rates were not affected in initial 10 days and then enhanced after day 10 fig 1 inhibitory effect on dechlorination of tce was observed in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa along with a decrease in cis dce production rates fig 1 dechlorination of tce were completely inhibited in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos and no accumulation of cis dce was observed fig 1 this result suggested that 100 mg l 1 pfos was more toxic than pfoa for dechlorination of tce cis dce was the only product and no further dechlorination of cis dce was observed during 40 days incubation also no biodegradation of pfoa or pfos was observed by lc ms fig s1 these results indicated that high level of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 had an obvious inhibition on dechlorination of tce but low level of pfoa or pfos 10 mg l 1 may enhance dechlorination of tce analogous inhibition to dechlorination of tce has been previously observed in a dehalococcoides mccartyi containing microbial community with 110 mg l 1 pfass mixtures but how each pfas contributed to the inhibition of tce dechlorination was unknown weathers et al 2016 our study indicated that pfos was more toxic than pfoa for dechlorination of tce at the concentration of 100 mg l 1 however this conclusion was inconsistent with previous results that the rate of tce dechlorination was inhibited by a dehalococcoides mccartyi containing community only in the presence of 11 component perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas mixture where equivalent concentrations of only perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas mixture were not affected harding marjanovic et al 2016 this suggests that there may be completely different response between dhc ohrb and non dhc ohrb when exposed to pfass to determine the threshold of pfas concentration for the enhancement effect on tce dechlorination lower concentrations of pfoa or pfos 5 10 20 mg l 1 were further investigated dechlorination of tce was enhanced when the concentrations of pfoa was 20 mg l 1 while the concentrations for pfos was 10 mg l 1 fig s2 pfos of 20 mg l 1 already showed inhibition effect on tce dechlorination which further indicates that this process was less inhibited by pfoa than that by pfos lc ms result showed that no biodegradation of pfoa or pfos was observed during the process of tce dechlorination either with lower pfas concentrations fig s3 there are few researches on the effect of pfas on the rate of microbial reductive dechlorination here we found that low levels of pfass 20 mg l 1 enhanced tce dechlorination in a non dhc ohrb containing community but inhibited tce dechlorination under higher concentrations of pfass previous studies showed that treatments containing 50 mg l 1 pfos inhibited 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp dechlorination in an anaerobic microbial community and the other pfass tested perfluorobutanesulfonate perfluorobutanoic acid pfoa did not significantly delay dcp dechlorination fitzgerald et al 2019 so far it has not been reported that low concentrations of pfass can enhance microbial reduction dechlorination researches have demonstrated that surfactants such as tween 80 and brijs can enhance biogas production h2 and ch4 and bioremediation by increasing the bioavailability or desorbing of the organic contaminants elsamadony et al 2015 he et al 2019 seo and bishop 2007 van hoof and jafvert 1996 tween 80 decreased dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene hcb at concentrations significantly above the critical micelle concentration cmc 1500 5000 mg l 1 but increased hcb dechlorination rate constants four to fivefold at concentrations closer to the cmc 300 1200 mg l 1 in acclimated slurries also additions of tween 80 at or below the cmc 3 30 300 and 911 mg l 1 enhanced dechlorination activity in unacclimated slurries that exhibited very little activity in unamended controls van hoof and jafvert 1996 in this study pfoa and pfos serve as a kind of fluorinated surfactant guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2016 moody and field 2000 trier et al 2011 thus they may enhance the bioavailability of tce for non dhc ohrb in a case pfos increased the aqueous solubility of tce by approximately 35 for concentrations of 100 mg l 1 and greater van glubt and brusseau 2021 however high levels of pfass could be more toxic than enhancement of bioavailability to non dhc ohrb in subsurface locations where pfass occur with chlorinated solvents polyoxyethylene alcohols brijs significantly reduced hcb dechlorination activity at concentrations above the cmc and no effect was observed for brijs at sub cmc levels van hoof and jafvert 1996 3 2 less inhibition of pfoa to non dhc ohrb than pfos at high concentrations all ohrb relevant to tce dechlorination to cis dce were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing which showed different responses of various non dhc ohrb to pfoa or pfos exposure four non dhc ohrb desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and geobacter capable of dechlorinating tce to cis dce table s1 were enriched during the process of tce dechlorination with the presence of pfas the bacterial communities in the tce fed cultures changed significantly at the genus level when compared to the no tce control cultures fig s4 the relative abundances of four non dhc ohrb desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and geobacter in the tce fed cultures were higher than that in no tce control cultures which indicated that these dechlorinating populations were involved in the tce reduction fig s5 however desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium and geobacter also presented in the no tce fed control cultures since these populations could harvest energy for cell growth from fermentation heijthuijsen and hansen 1989 kruse et al 2017 lovley and phillips 1988 the relative abundances of these non dhc ohrb exposed to pfoa were generally higher than those exposed to pfos except for geobacter in the presence of 10 mg l 1 pfos fig 2 the relative abundances of desulfuromonas dehalobacter and geobacter decreased with increasing concentration of pfoa or pfos from 10 to 100 mg l 1 notably only genus desulfitobacterium was highly enriched when exposed to 100 mg l 1 pfoa which relative abundance increased by 3 fold with increasing concentration of pfoa with 100 mg l 1 pfos desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter disappeared the relative abundance of desulfitobacterium increased from 2 1 to 7 1 with increasing concentration of pfoa fig 2b which implies that pfoa may have no or a weak effect on desulfitobacterium to further investigate the effect of pfoa on desulfitobacterium a desulfitobacterium containing community was transferred to a fresh medium 2 v v with tce and 50 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos with the presence of 50 mg l 1 pfoa tce dechlorination rate and cis dce production rate were very similar to those without pfas fig 3 a and b however 50 mg l 1 pfos appreciably inhibited reductive dechlorination of tce by repressing desulfitobacterium because the relative abundance of desulfitobacterium decreased from 33 4 0 2 to 6 3 3 5 in the presence of 50 mg l 1 pfos fig 3c the pcoa analysis of desulfitobacterium containing community showed all samples can be categorized into three groups fig 3d inoculum samples without pfas or 50 ppm pfoa and samples with 50 ppm pfos these results confirmed that high level of pfoa 50 mg l 1 had little impact on desulfitobacterium thus only the desulfitobacterium was highly enriched when exposed to high levels of pfoa so far there is no consistent conclusion about the toxicity comparison between pfoa and pfos in this study tce dechlorination was less inhibited by pfoa than by pfos in the four non dhc ohrb containing community additionally the desulfitobacterium containing community proved that pfoa as high as 50 mg l 1 had little impact on tce dechlorination however much higher toxicity to escherichia coli was observed for pfoa than pfos with the 3 h half growth inhibition concentrations ic50 determined to be 10 6 1 0 mg l 1 for pfoa and 374 3 mg l 1 for pfos liu et al 2016 also pfos was more toxic than pfoa for four freshwater species including dugesia japonica physa acuta daphnia magna and neocaridina denticulate li 2009 microbial toxicity was positively correlated to fluorinated chain length suggesting that longer chain length pfas were more likely to influence co contaminant degradation fitzgerald et al 2019 soil microbial activity showed that the sulfonic pfass expressed higher toxicity than the carboxylic pfass cai et al 2019 suggesting that the sulfonic group was more toxic than the carboxylic group pfos has 8 fluorinated chains with a sulfonic group while pfoa has only 7 fluorinated chains a carboxylic group which possibly also contributed to the higher toxicity of pfos compared to pfoa 3 3 the effect of pfoa or pfos on bacterial biodiversity high level of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 decreased the biodiversity of bacterial community but less affected by pfoa than by pfos the alpha diversity indices of each enrichment culture showed an obvious decrease in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos the chao 1 index was used to estimate the number of otus richness of bacterial community contained in the sample which decreased by 35 3 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos and decreased by 17 0 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa fig 4 a consequently the number of species of each enriched culture showed an obvious concentration dependent variation the number of species decreased from 3057 to 1957 with increasing concentration of pfoa which had a larger decrease from 3057 to 1493 with presence of pfos fig s6 the shannon index also decreased by 33 1 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos and by 16 7 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfoa fig 4b unlike the toxicity comparison between pfoa and pfos almost all studies have concluded that high levels of pfass have a negative impact on biodiversity of bacterial community bao et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b our previous research also demonstrated that pfass above 100 μg kg 1 dw reduced the biodiversity of soil bacteria at ftas cao et al 2022 a similar study further showed that the existence of pfass and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons co contamination in groundwater resulted in a considerable decrease in the diversity of microbial communities tang et al 2022 the shannon index in a freshwater pond with 5 mg l 1 pfoa 2 83 0 06 was significantly lower than that without pfoa 3 86 0 08 zhang et al 2019a while the shannon and chao 1 index in soils with 10 mg kg 1 pfos were lower than those in soils with pfos ranging from 10 to 1000 μg kg 1 qiao et al 2018 notably 10 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos did not appreciably affect the biodiversity both chao 1 index and shannon index of bacterial community in this study with higher concentration than those mentioned above the main reason of the inconsistency was that the community in this study had been acclimated to dechlorination with the selective pressure of tce presence where 10 mg l 1 pfass enhanced tce dechlorination instead of destroying the dechlorinating community showing little impact on the community diversity however exposure to high level of pfass can kill some sensitive bacterial species on site leading to decreased biodiversity of bacterial community in natural environment 3 4 the syntrophic relationships between non dhc ohrb and co cultures with the presence of pfass to understand how pfoa or pfos affected the bacterial community community composition and putative functionalities of species were explored by high throughput sequencing to reveal the syntrophic relationships between non dhc ohrb and co cultures potential bacteria associated with tce dechlorination sulfate reduction and lactate fermentation occupied the majority of the bacterial population in each enrichment culture table s2 the predominant genera in each enrichment culture except for that with 100 ppm pfos were sedimentibacter unclassified genus from family rhodocyclaceae clostridium sensu stricto 7 and desulfovibrio fig 5 a these four representative genera accounted for 22 1 36 3 of the total bacterial population in each enrichment culture sedimentibacter clostridium sensu stricto 7 and desulfovibrio were commonly found to co exist with ohrb in enrichment cultures and natural environments cheng et al 2009 grostern and edwards elizabeth 2006 maphosa et al 2012 van doesburg et al 2005 wen et al 2017 and played important roles in supporting the growth of ohrb such as dehalobacter by producing growth factors grostern and edwards elizabeth 2006 the heat map at the genus level graphically shows that bacterial communities in 100 mg l 1 pfos changed significantly at the genus level when compared to no pfas and 10 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos fig 5b which was consistent with the result of pcoa analysis fig s7 most of fermenters clostridium sensu stricto 7 fonticella cryptanaerobacter gracilibacter brassicibacter alkaliphilus fang et al 2012 lee et al 2006 li et al 2022 li et al 2013 wen et al 2017 zhilina et al 2009 were killed by the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos these results suggest that there is a complex interaction between pfass and bacteria in bioremediation communities that varied depending on the type of pfass and species which should be further investigated in the future although 100 mg l 1 pfos killed most of ferments in the mixed culture hydrogen and acetate producing fermenters of enterobacter and desulfovibrio were enriched the largest relative abundance of desulfovibrio 9 0 was observed in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos desulfovibrio can ferment lactate to provide h2 and acetate for ohrb growth along with potential benefits from proton translocation cobalamin salvaging and amino acid biosynthesis men et al 2011 in addition cobalamin producing bacteria sedimentibacter was present in all enrichment cultures the sedimentibacter was positively correlated with concentrations of pfoa or pfos and took up 20 5 of the total bacterial population with the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos sedimentibacter is capable of synthesizing cobalamin that is an essential cofactor of reductive dehalogenases maphosa et al 2012 therefore all the factors including hydrogen acetate and cobalamin required for maintaining growth of non dhc ohrb desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and geobacter were present this indicated that the syntrophic relationships between ohrb and co cultures still remained with high concentration of pfos thus the inhibition to dechlorination of tce was directly affected by repressing non dhc ohrb pfoa and pfos are anionic surfactants and anionic surfactants often result in microbial toxicity mcguire and hughes 2003 surfactant interactions with proteins especially membrane bound enzymes such as those involved in respiratory processes are a known mechanism of surfactant toxicity toward microorganisms rouse et al 1994 at lower surfactant concentrations enhancement of chemical transport across biological membranes has been observed but higher surfactant concentrations are useful for solubilizing membrane components helenius and simons 1975 rosen 1984 in this study low level of pfoa or pfos can enhance chemical transport across biological membranes but high level of pfoa or pfos may disrupt the structure of microbial membranes three pathogens including aeromonas tyzzerella and terrisporobacter were highly enriched only in the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos fig 5b the genus aeromonas is regarded not only as an important disease causing pathogen of animals but also as the etiologic agent responsible for a variety of infectious complications in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons janda and abbott 2010 tyzzerella piliformis is recognized as the causative agent of tyzzer s disease an often fatal enterohepatic disease which has been described for a wide range of domestic laboratory and wild animal species riley et al 1990 members of terrisporobacter are an emerging anaerobic pathogen associated with diarrhea cheng et al 2016 although the reason why these three genera were only enriched with the presence of 100 mg l 1 pfos was unclear this result suggests that sites with high levels of pfos contamination may be at risk for such pathogens 4 conclusions understanding the effect of pfass on reductive dechlorination is critical to design a bioremediation plan for chlorinated solvents due to the common co occurrence of pfass and chlorinated solvents at ftas and the reliance on microbiological processes for chlorinated solvents attenuation this study investigated that how pfoa or pfos may impact microbial communities relevant to tce bioremediation involving non dhc ohrb our study demonstrated that high levels of pfoa or pfos 100 mg l 1 inhibited tce dechlorination in four non dhc orhb containing community including geobacter desulfuromonas desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter but low levels of pfoa or pfos 10 mg l 1 enhanced tce dechlorination pfos showed a stronger inhibitory effect on reductive dechlorination than pfoa with non dhc ohrb in this study high level of pfos killed desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and most fermenters and decreased the biodiversity of bacterial community these results highlight the need for comprehensive site investigation monitoring and management to ensure success bioattenuation of chlorinated solvent in sites that are co contaminated with pfass

14717,hydroxyl radical oh oxidation has been identified as a significant pathway for element cycling and contaminant removal in redox fluctuating environments fe ii has been found to be the main electron contributor for oh production despite the recognition of the mechanisms of oh production from the oxidation of fe ii in soils sediments by o2 the kinetic model about fe ii oxidation oh production and contaminant removal is not yet clear to address this knowledge gap we conducted a series of experiments to explore the variation of different fe ii species oh and trichloroethylene tce a representative contaminant during sediment oxygenation followed by the development of a kinetic model in this model fe ii species in sediments was divided into three categories based on the sequential chemical extraction method ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and mineral structural fe ii results showed that the kinetic model accurately fitted the concentration time trajectories of different fe ii species oh and tce in this study as well as in previous studies model analysis indicated that the relative contribution of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii in oh production was 16 4 33 9 and 66 1 83 6 respectively however ion exchangeable fe ii not only fails to contribute to oh production but also reduces the oh yield relative to h2o2 decomposition poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii can serve as an electron pool to regenerate these reactive fe ii and facilitate oh production regarding tce degradation fe ii species plays a dual role in contributing to oh production while competing with tce for oh consumption with the quenching efficiency being related to their content and reactivity toward oh this kinetic model offers a practical approach to describing and predicting oh production and associated environmental impacts at the oxic anoxic interface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydroxyl radicals sediments oxygenation fe ii species trichloroethylene data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydroxyl radical oh with standard reduction potentials of 2 8 v wardman 1989 is the most powerful oxidant in natural environment for a long time light radiation was deemed essential for oh production and the related research mainly focused on the surface environment such as atmosphere and surface water gligorovski et al 2015 mopper and zhou 1990 however recent studies have demonstrated that oh can also be generated in subsurface environments under dark conditions when oxygen o2 disturbs the redox conditions the resulting oh can degrade contaminants such as trichloroethylene and mineralize organic matter chen et al 2021b schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 for example tong et al 2016 reported that oh accumulation within 24 h reached 2 670 μmol kg during soil sediment oxygenation and the oh produced could result in co2 emissions at levels comparable to soil respiration previous studies have shown that oh in subsurface environment is predominantly produced through abiotic o2 reduction by ferrous iron fe ii and reduced natural organic matter nom du et al 2021 tong et al 2016 due to the higher content of fe ii compared to reduced nom in soils and sediments fe ii has been identified as the primary electron contributor for oh production in most studies chen et al 2021a liao et al 2019 tong et al 2016 consequently the mechanism of oh production from the oxidation of fe ii species by o2 has attracted much attention chen et al 2022 rose and waite 2002 tong et al 2016 molecular o2 has two parallel spin unpaired electrons in its π orbitals allowing it to accept one electron at a time during the reaction halliwell 2006 schoonen et al 2006 taverne et al 2018 therefore the transformation of o2 to oh involves multiple electron transfers wherein o2 is first reduced to h2o2 and then h2o2 is further transformed to oh halliwell 2006 yu and kuzyakov 2021 as fe ii can only donate one electron the single electron transfer mechanism i e haber weiss mechanism eqs 1 4 is suitable for most fe ii species including free fe2 ligands complexed fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii siderite magnetite and silicate associated fe ii ardo et al 2015 xie et al 2020 yu et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 however for pyrite and mackinawite h2o2 is directly generated through the two electron transfer pathway cheng et al 2016 schoonen et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 because their band structure allows two electrons to be transferred from mineral to o2 for soils and sediments the reduction o2 to h2o2 may be through single electron or two electron transfer mechanisms due to the presence of different types of fe ii species chen et al 2021a schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 when h2o2 is formed it will further react with fe ii to produce oh eq 3 rose and waite 2002 however the yield of oh relative to h2o2 decomposition varies by orders of magnitude among different fe ii systems miller et al 2013 zhang and yuan 2017 for example under neutral ph conditions the reaction of free fe2 and h2o2 cannot produce oh katsoyiannis et al 2008 while the oh yield reaches 2 9 31 5 in the fe ii citrate system hu et al 2022 furthermore the reactivity of different fe ii species toward o2 and h2o2 also differ xie et al 2020 as a result oh production exhibits significant variability among different fe ii systems chen et al 2022 cheng et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 1 fe ii o 2 fe iii o 2 2 fe ii o 2 2 h fe iii h 2 o 2 3 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh o h 4 fe ii oh fe iii o h in comparison to the mechanism the kinetics of oh production during the oxygenation of fe ii in soils sediments has not been extensively studied although some studies have reported the kinetic models of oh production from the oxidation of standard fe ii species by o2 and h2o2 miller et al 2013 miller et al 2016 you et al 2023 zhang and yuan 2017 these models cannot fully simulate the actual soil sediment systems due to the higher complexity of soils and sediments this knowledge gap hinders the quantitative understanding of oh production and the associated environmental impacts in subsurface environments a recent study conducted by chen et al 2021a reported a kinetic model of oh production from the oxygenation of fe ii in paddy soils whereas this model is overly simplistic and fails to account for some important reactions previous research has demonstrated that the oh produced in soil sediment systems can effectively oxidize contaminants chen et al 2021b schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 however the degradation efficiency of contaminants is often low and varies significantly across different soil sediment systems xie et al 2020 2021 in addition to the co existing compounds such as hco3 fe ii is also proposed to consider as the potential quencher for oh liu et al 2017 schaefer et al 2018 xie et al 2020 however the role of different fe ii on contaminant degradation has not been quantified hence the objectives of this study were i to develop kinetic models that describe fe ii oxidation oh production and contaminant removal during the oxygenation of soils sediments and ii to quantitatively evaluate the roles of different fe ii species in oh production and contaminant removal to this end we collected three sediments from distinct sedimentary environments and measured the variation of different fe ii cumulative oh and contaminant concentrations during reaction course the oxidation of benzoate to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba is used as a probe reaction to quantify oh production joo et al 2005 zhou and mopper 1990 trichloroethylene tce is a widespread and recalcitrant contaminant in soil and groundwater moran et al 2007 so it was chosen as the typical contaminant based on the experimental data a kinetic model was developed to describe fe ii oxidation oh production and contaminant degradation during sediment oxygenation furthermore the applicability of the kinetic model was tested by simulating previously reported data 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and sediments sources of chemicals used in this study are described in text s1 in the supporting information si sediments were collected from various locations including riparian zones lakeshores and ponds which represented three typical redox fluctuating environments details on sediment collection and its main physical and chemical characteristics are included in text s2 and table s1 2 2 oh production fe ii oxidation and tce degradation during oxygenation of sediments all the experiments were conducted in 121 ml serum bottles and were kept away from light by wrapping them in tinfoil in a typical experiment 17 4 ml of 460 g l riparian sediment stock suspension was mixed with 62 6 ml of an o2 free solution in an anaerobic glovebox 95 n2 and 5 h2 coy usa resulting in a sediment dosage of 100 g l exp i table 1 then 20 mm benzoate was added to above sediment suspension the initial suspension ph was adjusted to 7 by h2so4 and naoh finally the serum bottle was sealed with a thick butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum foil cap and 15 ml of o2 80 was injected into the reactor to initiate experiment the suspension was shaken for 6 h at a constant speed of 150 rpm in a vibration cultivating box the dissolved o2 concentration was constant at approximately 0 25 mm during the reaction course fig s1 to explore the influence of sediment dosage on oh production and fe ii oxidation sediment dosage was varied from 10 to 100 g l exp i table 1 to explore the influence of sediment type on oh production and fe ii oxidation riparian sediment was replaced by lakeshore and wetland sediments exp i table 1 to evaluate the oxidative impact of oh produced 7 6 μm tce was added instead of 20 mm benzoate to sediment suspension and other conditions were identical as the above oh production experiments exp ii table 1 at predetermined time intervals 0 6 h approximately 2 ml suspension was sampled for analysis of p hba fe ii and tce all the experiments were performed at least in duplicate 2 3 production of oh from h2o2 decomposition by different fe ii species in sediments given that sediments contain fe ii of different forms xie et al 2020 it is crucial to isolate specific fe ii species from the sediment bulk to differentiate the rate constants of h2o2 decomposition by fe ii and the associated oh yield to achieve a modified sequential chemical extraction method was utilized to obtain sediments containing specific fe ii species for details see text s3 subsequently h2o2 concentrations of 200 400 600 800 and 1000 μm were added to 80 ml o2 free suspension containing 100 g l pre extracted sediment and 20 mm benzoate exp iii table 1 after 2 h of reaction 2 ml sample was taken for p hba and residual h2o2 analysis to determine the rate constants of h2o2 decomposition by different fe ii species 0 5 mm h2o2 was mixed with 5 g l suspension of either pristine or pre extracted sediment exp iv table 1 at predetermined time intervals 0 6 h approximately 2 ml suspension was sampled for h2o2 and p hba analysis 2 4 analysis the concentration of p hba was determined by an lc 15c hplc as described previously zhang et al 2016 the different fe ii species in sediments were extracted by a sequential chemical extraction method xie et al 2020 dissolved fe ii concentration was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline method at wavelength 510 nm employing a uv vis spectrophotometer tamura et al 1974 total fe concentration was tested after reducing fe iii to fe ii with hydroxylamine hcl h2o2 concentration was assessed by the modified n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method at 551 nm katsoyiannis et al 2008 for the analysis of tce 1 ml suspension was extracted with 2 ml hexane for at least 30 min followed by measuring tce in hexane using a gas chromatograph gc shimadzu 2014c japan equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and a capillary column as described previously liu et al 2017 2 5 kinetics a kinetic model was developed to fit the time series data of oh h2o2 fe ii and tce concentrations under a range of experimental conditions the calculations were performed using kintecus 6 51 software ianni 2018 the reaction networks are depicted in table 2 the initial parameters were set based on the experimental conditions and are given in table s2 counting variables such as xn were added to the reaction stoichiometry to track the cumulative oh and h2o2 produced via a specific pathway zhang et al 2018 a normalized sensitivity coefficient nsc analysis was employed to evaluate the relative importance of each reaction on oh production and tce degradation jones et al 2015 pham and waite 2008 it is noted that this method only considers the direct route influence on the species of interest but not indirect route influence pham and waite 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 fe ii oxidation oh production and pollutant degradation during sediment oxygenation before establishing the kinetic models we first investigated fe ii oxidation oh production and tce degradation during sediment oxygenation a fe ii oxidation during oxygenation ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii were rapidly consumed within 1 h while the oxidation of mineral structural fe ii followed a two stage pattern with quick oxidation in the initial stage and slow oxidation in the last stage figs 1 a c and s3 this observation was in agreement with the previous studies on soil and sediment suspensions chen et al 2021a liao et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in analogy with fe ii containing clay mineral system yuan et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 mineral structural fe ii in sediment was divided into reactive and poorly reactive fe ii based on the two stage oxidation pattern b oh production for 6 h oxygenation the cumulative oh concentration increased rapidly in the first 0 5 h and gradually over the last 5 5 h fig 1d oh accumulations within 6 h reached 81 5 50 9 and 57 5 μm in 100 g l riparian lakeshore and pond sediment systems respectively fig 1d as the riparian sediment dosage increased from 10 to 100 g l the cumulative oh linearly increased from 7 7 to 81 5 μm figs 1e and s4 for oxygenation of filtrate that was separated from sediment suspension oh accumulation within 6 h was 1 μm fig s5 indicating that oh was mainly produced from solid components rather than aqueous phase although solid organic carbon soc reducing sulfur and fe ii in sediments could contribute to oh production du et al 2021 murphy et al 2014 tong et al 2016 fe ii content was much higher than that of soc and reducing sulfur therefore solid fe ii may mainly contribute to oh production text s4 correlation analysis further revealed that oh accumulation was linearly related to the extent of solid fe ii oxidation fig s4 supporting the speculation that oh is mainly produced from the oxidation of solid fe ii by o2 c tce degradation to investigate the environmental impact of oh tce was added into the above sediment suspension after oxygenation of 6 h tce concentrations decreased by 27 6 19 1 and 15 4 in riparian sediment lakeshore sediment and pond sediments respectively fig 1f control experiments rule out other possible abiotic and biotic processes such as microbial aerobic degradation text s5 that may degrade tce and confirmed that tce was primarily degraded by oh oxidation with the increase of sediment dosage from 10 to 100 g l tce degradation efficiency increased from 10 5 to 27 6 within 6 h fig s6 tce degradation correlated linearly with oh accumulation fig s7 which further supports the involvement of oh for tce degradation 3 2 identification of reactive fe ii species on oh production during sediment oxygenation fig 2 a shows that the presence of 2 mm bpy which only chelates ion exchangeable fe ii text s6 had minimal influence on oh production whereas increasing bpy concentration to 7 mm which chelates most of ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii as well as partial reactive mineral fe ii text s6 resulted in an 89 decrease in oh accumulation exp v table 1 based on these results it can be concluded that oh is produced from the oxidation of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii rather than ion exchangeable fe ii this may be explained by the fact that the reaction of ion exchangeable fe ii and o2 h2o2 cannot produce oh at neutral ph conditions katsoyiannis et al 2008 kong et al 2015 for the poorly reactive fe ii species in light of previous findings of electron transfer from interior structural fe ii to surface fe iii during oxygenation of fe ii bearing clay minerals yuan et al 2018 we hypothesized that poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii may promote oh production by reducing surface fe iii to test this hypothesis we pre oxidized 100 g l riparian sediment suspension for 6 h and subsequently stored it under anoxic conditions in the presence of 0 1 hgcl2 which was used to kill microorganisms zhang et al 2020 for 114 h and again exposed it to air as expected ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii concentrations increased while mineral structural fe ii concentration decreased after anoxic storage fig 2b upon re oxygenation the cumulative oh concentration reached 5 8 μm within 6 h fig s8 when 1 m 2 propanol oh quencher was added the accumulation of oh decreased to below the detection limit fig s8 these results support that the electron transfer from poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii to surface fe iii can contribute to oh production 3 3 development of kinetic models for oh production and fe ii oxidation during sediment oxygenation 3 3 1 model framework based on above findings and the mechanism reported in the literature chen et al 2021a 2021b liao et al 2019 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 a kinetic model was developed to describe the redox reactions of fe ii fe iii transformation oh production and tce degradation i fe ii oxidation and ros production previous studies have shown that multiple fe ii species with different reactivity are present in soils sediments chen et al 2021a tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 however the inclusion of all fe ii species in kinetic model will significantly elevate model complexity as well as the uncertainty of the parameters in addition it is challenging to measure the content of each fe ii species in sediments by conventional methods for the sake of simplicity in this model fe ii species were roughly divided into ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and mineral fe ii because sulfide iron minerals e g pyrite and mackinawite were not detected in three sediments table s1 and fig s2 a single electron transfer mechanism may be suitable to describe fe ii oxidation and ros production during sediment oxygenation as the overall oxidation rate of fe ii is a function of the net oxidation of each fe ii species three parallel reaction processes were proposed to describe the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii and the production of o2 h2o2 and oh reactions 1 12 ii fe iii hydrolysis and transformation inorganic aqueous fe iii hydrolysis and the reduction of surface fe iii by poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii were also considered reactions 13 17 text s7 and s8 iii extended reactions of ros in addition to fe ii species the interactions between ros and other co existing compounds including the reduction of o2 by inorganic aqueous fe iii and fe iii oxyhydroxide reactions 18 19 the decomposition of h2o2 through the catalase type and peroxidase type reactions petigara et al 2002 pham et al 2012 reactions 20 22 and the oxidation of cl ha and hco3 by oh reactions 23 25 were considered reactions 26 and 27 were used to describe the oxidation of benzoate and tce by oh respectively the interactions between o2 h2o2 and oh were not included due to their low concentrations in the system text s7 3 3 2 rate constants and oh yields most of reaction rate constants were cited from the literature and the unknown or poorly defined parameters were optimized by visually checking the model curves of the fitted data for details see text s7 in this model the rate constants and oh yield relative to h2o2 decomposition by fe ii were measured as this step was crucial for oh production experimental results showed that the rate constants for h2o2 decomposition by ion exchange ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structure fe ii were 500 40 and 3 9 m 1 s 1 respectively fig s9 furthermore the oh yields for h2o2 decomposition by surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii were estimated to be 2 1 and 4 1 respectively fig s9 since ion exchangeable fe ii does not contribute to oh production fig 2a the oh yield for h2o2 decomposition by ion exchangeable fe ii was set to be 0 these results suggest that the oh yield resulting from h2o2 decomposition by fe ii in sediments should range from 0 to 4 1 which is consistent with previously reported values of 1 8 5 3 text s9 3 3 3 model verification using the kinetic model described above the concentration trajectories of fe ii cumulative oh and tce versus reaction time were simulated under different conditions as demonstrated in figs 1 s3 s6 and s10 the simulated results were in good agreement with the experimental observations in both individual sediment systems and ha hco3 sediment systems this indicates that the assumptions made in this study are plausible and the model accounts for most of important reactions table 2 further we conducted simulations of previously reported oh production and fe ii oxidation kinetics chen et al 2021a xie et al 2020 with adjusting the rate constants of reactions 5 and 9 as well as the oh yields relative to h2o2 decomposition the model can successfully fit the data reported by previous studies as illustrated in figs s11 and s12 which further confirmed the applicability of this model across various soil and sediment systems 3 3 4 sensitivity analysis to assess the relative importance of individual reactions and its associated rate constants on fe ii oxidation oh production and tce degradation nsc matrices were calculated in different sediment systems for the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii o2 o2 and h2o2 are identified as the main oxidants while oh has a negligible contribution fig s13 possibly due to the capture of most oh by 20 mm benzoate for the oxidation of poorly reactive mineral structure fe ii fe iii oxyhydroxides and mineral structure fe iii are considered as its oxidants fig s13 for oh production reactions 5 7 9 and 11 involving the oxidation of fe ii by o2 and h2o2 were determined to play significant roles due to their large nsc values fig 3 a c however reaction 3 generated a negative nsc value which was consistent with the experimental observation that ion exchangeable fe ii cannot react with h2o2 to generate oh fig 2a the oxidation of fe ii by o2 is the initial step for the entire reaction while the decomposition of h2o2 by fe ii serves as the source for oh thus the reactions and the related constants are sensitive for oh production for tce degradation the oxidation of tce by oh reaction 26 and the decomposition of h2o2 by surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structure fe ii reactions 7 and 11 play important roles as these reactions generate large nsc values fig 3d f 3 3 5 comparison with the previously reported kinetic models in comparison with the existing kinetic model of oh production from the oxidation of fe ii in paddy soils by o2 the model has made significant improvements and the details are summarized as follows table s3 i reaction networks for fe ii fe iii transformation we included the fe iii polymer growth reaction 14 and the reduction of surface fe iii by poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii reactions 15 17 this is because previous studies have shown that fe iii hydrolysis included two processes namely homogeneous nucleation reaction 13 and fe iii polymer growth reaction 14 pham et al 2006 rose and waite 2003 if the latter process is not considered the rate of fe iii hydrolysis will be significantly underestimated leading to a high concentration of aqueous fe iii because aqueous fe iii can rapidly consume o2 reaction 18 k 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 and o2 is the precursor for h2o2 and oh excess aqueous fe iii may lead to an underestimation of oh in the previous work chen et al 2021a for ros transformation we added the reactions of h2o2 decomposition through the catalase type and peroxidase type pathways reactions 20 22 as these reactions play important roles in soil sediments petigara et al 2002 pham et al 2012 moreover the oh yields for h2o2 decomposition by different fe ii species were also measured ii fitting parameters although the numbers of total reactions in this study no 27 were higher than the previously reported model no 19 chen et al 2021a the number of fitting rate constants decreased from 9 to 3 this means that the uncertainty of this model may be reduced 3 4 mechanistic insight into fe ii oxidation on oh production and tce degradation as h2o2 is an important intermediate for oh production during fe ii oxygenation huang et al 2021 liao et al 2019 tong et al 2016 the variation of h2o2 concentration during the reactions was modeled fig 4 a showed that instantaneous h2o2 concentration increased first and subsequently decreased within 6 h which is typical of h2o2 as an intermediate in 100 g l riparian sediment suspension h2o2 accumulations within 6 h for the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii by o2 were 0 17 0 86 and 4 65 mm respectively fig 4b however h2o2 consumption by these fe ii species was 1 74 1 39 and 1 64 mm respectively fig 4b these results suggest that the h2o2 produced by ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii cannot offset the h2o2 consumed by these fe ii species whereas the amount of h2o2 produced by reactive mineral structural fe ii was greater than the consumption as ion exchangeable fe ii cannot activate h2o2 to generate oh xie et al 2020 it may not only cannot contribute to oh production but also weaken oh yield this observation may explain the low electron utilization efficiency of fe ii during soil and sediment oxygenation as reported in literature xie et al 2020 2021 and found in this study fig s4 although poorly reactive mineral structure fe ii had a marginal impact on oh production within short term oxygenation such as 6 h it may serve as an electron pool to recharge reactive fe ii and then facilitate oh production after prolonged anoxic storage fig s14 for instance when the pre oxidized sediment was stored for 480 h under anoxic conditions and then exposed it to air the oh accumulation within 6 h reached 18 7 μm fig s14 in both natural and engineered systems pulsed oxygen aeration is a common occurrence diem et al 2013 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 for example groundwater table fluctuation may expose sediments to o2 for a short time followed by prolonged anoxic storage kumar and riyazuddin 2012 therefore poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii may play a critical role in oh production in such pulsed oxidation scenarios for oh production the relative contribution of each pathway varies with reaction time and sediment types fig 5 a b for oxygenation of 100 g l riparian sediment the relative contribution of surface adsorbed fe ii oxidation to oh production decreases rapidly from 74 0 initially to 54 5 at 0 5 h and further to 33 9 at 6 h fig 5a hence surface adsorbed fe ii predominantly contributes to oh production at the initial stage while reactive mineral structure fe ii contributes to oh production at the last stage within 6 h of oxidation the relative contribution of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii oxidation to oh production are estimated to be 33 9 and 66 1 in riparian sediment 26 5 and 73 5 in lakeshore sediment and 16 4 and 83 6 in pond sediment respectively fig 5b because tce is oxidized by oh it is expected that the reactions that contributed to oh production were also beneficial to tce degradation this speculation was supported by the negative nsc values of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii oxidation by o2 and h2o2 reactions 5 7 9 and 11 fig 3d f however reactions 4 8 and 12 resulted in positive nsc values fig 3d f indicating that ion exchangeable surface adsorbed and reactive mineral structural fe ii weakened tce degradation therefore fe ii species played a dual role in tce degradation generating oh to oxidize tce while quenching oh to weaken tce oxidation compared with ha cl and hco3 the quenching effect of fe ii species was more pronounced owing to their high nsc values fig 3d f the quenching effect of fe ii species on tce degradation may explain the low oh utilization efficiency table s4 oh utilization efficiency decreased with increasing fe ii concentration table s4 additionally nsc calculation showed that the order of quenching effect of fe ii species varied with reaction time specifically at the initial stage the quenching effect order was ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii mineral structural fe ii while it was opposite at the last stage fig 3d f the results of fig 5c indicated that the quenching efficiency of ion exchangeable fe ii on tce degradation decreased rapidly from 18 2 at the beginning to 0 5 at 1 h due to the rapid consumption of ion exchangeable fe ii at the initial stage among the three sediment systems reactive mineral structural fe ii exhibited the highest quenching effect on tce degradation fig 5d indicating that reactive mineral structural fe ii is the primary quencher of oh for tce degradation 4 conclusions this study developed a kinetic model capable of describing fe ii oxidation oh production and tce degradation during sediment oxygenation under neutral ph conditions and explored the roles of different fe ii species on oh production and tce degradation the main conclusions derived from this research are as follows employing the categorization of fe ii species in soils sediments into ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and mineral structural fe ii is an effective approach for the development of kinetic models that can describe oh production and contaminant degradation during soil sediment oxygenation oh production is mainly attributed to the oxidation of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii while the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii exerts an inhibitory effect on oh production poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii can act as an electron source to regenerate surface fe ii species thereby contributing to oh production following a period of anoxic storage for tce degradation all fe ii species served as both oh producers and oh scavengers among them reactive mineral structural fe ii exhibited the strongest quenching effect on oh oxidation due to its highest content in sediments due to the quenching effect of fe ii species and co existing compounds the oh utilization efficiency was relatively low this may explain the challenge of removing contaminants through the oh oxidation pathway in soil sediment systems even when oh accumulation exceeded the concentration of contaminants chen et al 2021b schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 2021 in addition considering that o2 replenishment in natural and engineered systems usually involved hydrodynamic processes diem et al 2013 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 further studies are needed to consider both geochemical and hydrodynamic processes

14717,hydroxyl radical oh oxidation has been identified as a significant pathway for element cycling and contaminant removal in redox fluctuating environments fe ii has been found to be the main electron contributor for oh production despite the recognition of the mechanisms of oh production from the oxidation of fe ii in soils sediments by o2 the kinetic model about fe ii oxidation oh production and contaminant removal is not yet clear to address this knowledge gap we conducted a series of experiments to explore the variation of different fe ii species oh and trichloroethylene tce a representative contaminant during sediment oxygenation followed by the development of a kinetic model in this model fe ii species in sediments was divided into three categories based on the sequential chemical extraction method ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and mineral structural fe ii results showed that the kinetic model accurately fitted the concentration time trajectories of different fe ii species oh and tce in this study as well as in previous studies model analysis indicated that the relative contribution of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii in oh production was 16 4 33 9 and 66 1 83 6 respectively however ion exchangeable fe ii not only fails to contribute to oh production but also reduces the oh yield relative to h2o2 decomposition poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii can serve as an electron pool to regenerate these reactive fe ii and facilitate oh production regarding tce degradation fe ii species plays a dual role in contributing to oh production while competing with tce for oh consumption with the quenching efficiency being related to their content and reactivity toward oh this kinetic model offers a practical approach to describing and predicting oh production and associated environmental impacts at the oxic anoxic interface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydroxyl radicals sediments oxygenation fe ii species trichloroethylene data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydroxyl radical oh with standard reduction potentials of 2 8 v wardman 1989 is the most powerful oxidant in natural environment for a long time light radiation was deemed essential for oh production and the related research mainly focused on the surface environment such as atmosphere and surface water gligorovski et al 2015 mopper and zhou 1990 however recent studies have demonstrated that oh can also be generated in subsurface environments under dark conditions when oxygen o2 disturbs the redox conditions the resulting oh can degrade contaminants such as trichloroethylene and mineralize organic matter chen et al 2021b schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 for example tong et al 2016 reported that oh accumulation within 24 h reached 2 670 μmol kg during soil sediment oxygenation and the oh produced could result in co2 emissions at levels comparable to soil respiration previous studies have shown that oh in subsurface environment is predominantly produced through abiotic o2 reduction by ferrous iron fe ii and reduced natural organic matter nom du et al 2021 tong et al 2016 due to the higher content of fe ii compared to reduced nom in soils and sediments fe ii has been identified as the primary electron contributor for oh production in most studies chen et al 2021a liao et al 2019 tong et al 2016 consequently the mechanism of oh production from the oxidation of fe ii species by o2 has attracted much attention chen et al 2022 rose and waite 2002 tong et al 2016 molecular o2 has two parallel spin unpaired electrons in its π orbitals allowing it to accept one electron at a time during the reaction halliwell 2006 schoonen et al 2006 taverne et al 2018 therefore the transformation of o2 to oh involves multiple electron transfers wherein o2 is first reduced to h2o2 and then h2o2 is further transformed to oh halliwell 2006 yu and kuzyakov 2021 as fe ii can only donate one electron the single electron transfer mechanism i e haber weiss mechanism eqs 1 4 is suitable for most fe ii species including free fe2 ligands complexed fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii siderite magnetite and silicate associated fe ii ardo et al 2015 xie et al 2020 yu et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 however for pyrite and mackinawite h2o2 is directly generated through the two electron transfer pathway cheng et al 2016 schoonen et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 because their band structure allows two electrons to be transferred from mineral to o2 for soils and sediments the reduction o2 to h2o2 may be through single electron or two electron transfer mechanisms due to the presence of different types of fe ii species chen et al 2021a schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 when h2o2 is formed it will further react with fe ii to produce oh eq 3 rose and waite 2002 however the yield of oh relative to h2o2 decomposition varies by orders of magnitude among different fe ii systems miller et al 2013 zhang and yuan 2017 for example under neutral ph conditions the reaction of free fe2 and h2o2 cannot produce oh katsoyiannis et al 2008 while the oh yield reaches 2 9 31 5 in the fe ii citrate system hu et al 2022 furthermore the reactivity of different fe ii species toward o2 and h2o2 also differ xie et al 2020 as a result oh production exhibits significant variability among different fe ii systems chen et al 2022 cheng et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 1 fe ii o 2 fe iii o 2 2 fe ii o 2 2 h fe iii h 2 o 2 3 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh o h 4 fe ii oh fe iii o h in comparison to the mechanism the kinetics of oh production during the oxygenation of fe ii in soils sediments has not been extensively studied although some studies have reported the kinetic models of oh production from the oxidation of standard fe ii species by o2 and h2o2 miller et al 2013 miller et al 2016 you et al 2023 zhang and yuan 2017 these models cannot fully simulate the actual soil sediment systems due to the higher complexity of soils and sediments this knowledge gap hinders the quantitative understanding of oh production and the associated environmental impacts in subsurface environments a recent study conducted by chen et al 2021a reported a kinetic model of oh production from the oxygenation of fe ii in paddy soils whereas this model is overly simplistic and fails to account for some important reactions previous research has demonstrated that the oh produced in soil sediment systems can effectively oxidize contaminants chen et al 2021b schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 however the degradation efficiency of contaminants is often low and varies significantly across different soil sediment systems xie et al 2020 2021 in addition to the co existing compounds such as hco3 fe ii is also proposed to consider as the potential quencher for oh liu et al 2017 schaefer et al 2018 xie et al 2020 however the role of different fe ii on contaminant degradation has not been quantified hence the objectives of this study were i to develop kinetic models that describe fe ii oxidation oh production and contaminant removal during the oxygenation of soils sediments and ii to quantitatively evaluate the roles of different fe ii species in oh production and contaminant removal to this end we collected three sediments from distinct sedimentary environments and measured the variation of different fe ii cumulative oh and contaminant concentrations during reaction course the oxidation of benzoate to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba is used as a probe reaction to quantify oh production joo et al 2005 zhou and mopper 1990 trichloroethylene tce is a widespread and recalcitrant contaminant in soil and groundwater moran et al 2007 so it was chosen as the typical contaminant based on the experimental data a kinetic model was developed to describe fe ii oxidation oh production and contaminant degradation during sediment oxygenation furthermore the applicability of the kinetic model was tested by simulating previously reported data 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and sediments sources of chemicals used in this study are described in text s1 in the supporting information si sediments were collected from various locations including riparian zones lakeshores and ponds which represented three typical redox fluctuating environments details on sediment collection and its main physical and chemical characteristics are included in text s2 and table s1 2 2 oh production fe ii oxidation and tce degradation during oxygenation of sediments all the experiments were conducted in 121 ml serum bottles and were kept away from light by wrapping them in tinfoil in a typical experiment 17 4 ml of 460 g l riparian sediment stock suspension was mixed with 62 6 ml of an o2 free solution in an anaerobic glovebox 95 n2 and 5 h2 coy usa resulting in a sediment dosage of 100 g l exp i table 1 then 20 mm benzoate was added to above sediment suspension the initial suspension ph was adjusted to 7 by h2so4 and naoh finally the serum bottle was sealed with a thick butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum foil cap and 15 ml of o2 80 was injected into the reactor to initiate experiment the suspension was shaken for 6 h at a constant speed of 150 rpm in a vibration cultivating box the dissolved o2 concentration was constant at approximately 0 25 mm during the reaction course fig s1 to explore the influence of sediment dosage on oh production and fe ii oxidation sediment dosage was varied from 10 to 100 g l exp i table 1 to explore the influence of sediment type on oh production and fe ii oxidation riparian sediment was replaced by lakeshore and wetland sediments exp i table 1 to evaluate the oxidative impact of oh produced 7 6 μm tce was added instead of 20 mm benzoate to sediment suspension and other conditions were identical as the above oh production experiments exp ii table 1 at predetermined time intervals 0 6 h approximately 2 ml suspension was sampled for analysis of p hba fe ii and tce all the experiments were performed at least in duplicate 2 3 production of oh from h2o2 decomposition by different fe ii species in sediments given that sediments contain fe ii of different forms xie et al 2020 it is crucial to isolate specific fe ii species from the sediment bulk to differentiate the rate constants of h2o2 decomposition by fe ii and the associated oh yield to achieve a modified sequential chemical extraction method was utilized to obtain sediments containing specific fe ii species for details see text s3 subsequently h2o2 concentrations of 200 400 600 800 and 1000 μm were added to 80 ml o2 free suspension containing 100 g l pre extracted sediment and 20 mm benzoate exp iii table 1 after 2 h of reaction 2 ml sample was taken for p hba and residual h2o2 analysis to determine the rate constants of h2o2 decomposition by different fe ii species 0 5 mm h2o2 was mixed with 5 g l suspension of either pristine or pre extracted sediment exp iv table 1 at predetermined time intervals 0 6 h approximately 2 ml suspension was sampled for h2o2 and p hba analysis 2 4 analysis the concentration of p hba was determined by an lc 15c hplc as described previously zhang et al 2016 the different fe ii species in sediments were extracted by a sequential chemical extraction method xie et al 2020 dissolved fe ii concentration was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline method at wavelength 510 nm employing a uv vis spectrophotometer tamura et al 1974 total fe concentration was tested after reducing fe iii to fe ii with hydroxylamine hcl h2o2 concentration was assessed by the modified n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method at 551 nm katsoyiannis et al 2008 for the analysis of tce 1 ml suspension was extracted with 2 ml hexane for at least 30 min followed by measuring tce in hexane using a gas chromatograph gc shimadzu 2014c japan equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and a capillary column as described previously liu et al 2017 2 5 kinetics a kinetic model was developed to fit the time series data of oh h2o2 fe ii and tce concentrations under a range of experimental conditions the calculations were performed using kintecus 6 51 software ianni 2018 the reaction networks are depicted in table 2 the initial parameters were set based on the experimental conditions and are given in table s2 counting variables such as xn were added to the reaction stoichiometry to track the cumulative oh and h2o2 produced via a specific pathway zhang et al 2018 a normalized sensitivity coefficient nsc analysis was employed to evaluate the relative importance of each reaction on oh production and tce degradation jones et al 2015 pham and waite 2008 it is noted that this method only considers the direct route influence on the species of interest but not indirect route influence pham and waite 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 fe ii oxidation oh production and pollutant degradation during sediment oxygenation before establishing the kinetic models we first investigated fe ii oxidation oh production and tce degradation during sediment oxygenation a fe ii oxidation during oxygenation ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii were rapidly consumed within 1 h while the oxidation of mineral structural fe ii followed a two stage pattern with quick oxidation in the initial stage and slow oxidation in the last stage figs 1 a c and s3 this observation was in agreement with the previous studies on soil and sediment suspensions chen et al 2021a liao et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in analogy with fe ii containing clay mineral system yuan et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 mineral structural fe ii in sediment was divided into reactive and poorly reactive fe ii based on the two stage oxidation pattern b oh production for 6 h oxygenation the cumulative oh concentration increased rapidly in the first 0 5 h and gradually over the last 5 5 h fig 1d oh accumulations within 6 h reached 81 5 50 9 and 57 5 μm in 100 g l riparian lakeshore and pond sediment systems respectively fig 1d as the riparian sediment dosage increased from 10 to 100 g l the cumulative oh linearly increased from 7 7 to 81 5 μm figs 1e and s4 for oxygenation of filtrate that was separated from sediment suspension oh accumulation within 6 h was 1 μm fig s5 indicating that oh was mainly produced from solid components rather than aqueous phase although solid organic carbon soc reducing sulfur and fe ii in sediments could contribute to oh production du et al 2021 murphy et al 2014 tong et al 2016 fe ii content was much higher than that of soc and reducing sulfur therefore solid fe ii may mainly contribute to oh production text s4 correlation analysis further revealed that oh accumulation was linearly related to the extent of solid fe ii oxidation fig s4 supporting the speculation that oh is mainly produced from the oxidation of solid fe ii by o2 c tce degradation to investigate the environmental impact of oh tce was added into the above sediment suspension after oxygenation of 6 h tce concentrations decreased by 27 6 19 1 and 15 4 in riparian sediment lakeshore sediment and pond sediments respectively fig 1f control experiments rule out other possible abiotic and biotic processes such as microbial aerobic degradation text s5 that may degrade tce and confirmed that tce was primarily degraded by oh oxidation with the increase of sediment dosage from 10 to 100 g l tce degradation efficiency increased from 10 5 to 27 6 within 6 h fig s6 tce degradation correlated linearly with oh accumulation fig s7 which further supports the involvement of oh for tce degradation 3 2 identification of reactive fe ii species on oh production during sediment oxygenation fig 2 a shows that the presence of 2 mm bpy which only chelates ion exchangeable fe ii text s6 had minimal influence on oh production whereas increasing bpy concentration to 7 mm which chelates most of ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii as well as partial reactive mineral fe ii text s6 resulted in an 89 decrease in oh accumulation exp v table 1 based on these results it can be concluded that oh is produced from the oxidation of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii rather than ion exchangeable fe ii this may be explained by the fact that the reaction of ion exchangeable fe ii and o2 h2o2 cannot produce oh at neutral ph conditions katsoyiannis et al 2008 kong et al 2015 for the poorly reactive fe ii species in light of previous findings of electron transfer from interior structural fe ii to surface fe iii during oxygenation of fe ii bearing clay minerals yuan et al 2018 we hypothesized that poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii may promote oh production by reducing surface fe iii to test this hypothesis we pre oxidized 100 g l riparian sediment suspension for 6 h and subsequently stored it under anoxic conditions in the presence of 0 1 hgcl2 which was used to kill microorganisms zhang et al 2020 for 114 h and again exposed it to air as expected ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii concentrations increased while mineral structural fe ii concentration decreased after anoxic storage fig 2b upon re oxygenation the cumulative oh concentration reached 5 8 μm within 6 h fig s8 when 1 m 2 propanol oh quencher was added the accumulation of oh decreased to below the detection limit fig s8 these results support that the electron transfer from poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii to surface fe iii can contribute to oh production 3 3 development of kinetic models for oh production and fe ii oxidation during sediment oxygenation 3 3 1 model framework based on above findings and the mechanism reported in the literature chen et al 2021a 2021b liao et al 2019 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 a kinetic model was developed to describe the redox reactions of fe ii fe iii transformation oh production and tce degradation i fe ii oxidation and ros production previous studies have shown that multiple fe ii species with different reactivity are present in soils sediments chen et al 2021a tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 however the inclusion of all fe ii species in kinetic model will significantly elevate model complexity as well as the uncertainty of the parameters in addition it is challenging to measure the content of each fe ii species in sediments by conventional methods for the sake of simplicity in this model fe ii species were roughly divided into ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and mineral fe ii because sulfide iron minerals e g pyrite and mackinawite were not detected in three sediments table s1 and fig s2 a single electron transfer mechanism may be suitable to describe fe ii oxidation and ros production during sediment oxygenation as the overall oxidation rate of fe ii is a function of the net oxidation of each fe ii species three parallel reaction processes were proposed to describe the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii and the production of o2 h2o2 and oh reactions 1 12 ii fe iii hydrolysis and transformation inorganic aqueous fe iii hydrolysis and the reduction of surface fe iii by poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii were also considered reactions 13 17 text s7 and s8 iii extended reactions of ros in addition to fe ii species the interactions between ros and other co existing compounds including the reduction of o2 by inorganic aqueous fe iii and fe iii oxyhydroxide reactions 18 19 the decomposition of h2o2 through the catalase type and peroxidase type reactions petigara et al 2002 pham et al 2012 reactions 20 22 and the oxidation of cl ha and hco3 by oh reactions 23 25 were considered reactions 26 and 27 were used to describe the oxidation of benzoate and tce by oh respectively the interactions between o2 h2o2 and oh were not included due to their low concentrations in the system text s7 3 3 2 rate constants and oh yields most of reaction rate constants were cited from the literature and the unknown or poorly defined parameters were optimized by visually checking the model curves of the fitted data for details see text s7 in this model the rate constants and oh yield relative to h2o2 decomposition by fe ii were measured as this step was crucial for oh production experimental results showed that the rate constants for h2o2 decomposition by ion exchange ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structure fe ii were 500 40 and 3 9 m 1 s 1 respectively fig s9 furthermore the oh yields for h2o2 decomposition by surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii were estimated to be 2 1 and 4 1 respectively fig s9 since ion exchangeable fe ii does not contribute to oh production fig 2a the oh yield for h2o2 decomposition by ion exchangeable fe ii was set to be 0 these results suggest that the oh yield resulting from h2o2 decomposition by fe ii in sediments should range from 0 to 4 1 which is consistent with previously reported values of 1 8 5 3 text s9 3 3 3 model verification using the kinetic model described above the concentration trajectories of fe ii cumulative oh and tce versus reaction time were simulated under different conditions as demonstrated in figs 1 s3 s6 and s10 the simulated results were in good agreement with the experimental observations in both individual sediment systems and ha hco3 sediment systems this indicates that the assumptions made in this study are plausible and the model accounts for most of important reactions table 2 further we conducted simulations of previously reported oh production and fe ii oxidation kinetics chen et al 2021a xie et al 2020 with adjusting the rate constants of reactions 5 and 9 as well as the oh yields relative to h2o2 decomposition the model can successfully fit the data reported by previous studies as illustrated in figs s11 and s12 which further confirmed the applicability of this model across various soil and sediment systems 3 3 4 sensitivity analysis to assess the relative importance of individual reactions and its associated rate constants on fe ii oxidation oh production and tce degradation nsc matrices were calculated in different sediment systems for the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii o2 o2 and h2o2 are identified as the main oxidants while oh has a negligible contribution fig s13 possibly due to the capture of most oh by 20 mm benzoate for the oxidation of poorly reactive mineral structure fe ii fe iii oxyhydroxides and mineral structure fe iii are considered as its oxidants fig s13 for oh production reactions 5 7 9 and 11 involving the oxidation of fe ii by o2 and h2o2 were determined to play significant roles due to their large nsc values fig 3 a c however reaction 3 generated a negative nsc value which was consistent with the experimental observation that ion exchangeable fe ii cannot react with h2o2 to generate oh fig 2a the oxidation of fe ii by o2 is the initial step for the entire reaction while the decomposition of h2o2 by fe ii serves as the source for oh thus the reactions and the related constants are sensitive for oh production for tce degradation the oxidation of tce by oh reaction 26 and the decomposition of h2o2 by surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structure fe ii reactions 7 and 11 play important roles as these reactions generate large nsc values fig 3d f 3 3 5 comparison with the previously reported kinetic models in comparison with the existing kinetic model of oh production from the oxidation of fe ii in paddy soils by o2 the model has made significant improvements and the details are summarized as follows table s3 i reaction networks for fe ii fe iii transformation we included the fe iii polymer growth reaction 14 and the reduction of surface fe iii by poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii reactions 15 17 this is because previous studies have shown that fe iii hydrolysis included two processes namely homogeneous nucleation reaction 13 and fe iii polymer growth reaction 14 pham et al 2006 rose and waite 2003 if the latter process is not considered the rate of fe iii hydrolysis will be significantly underestimated leading to a high concentration of aqueous fe iii because aqueous fe iii can rapidly consume o2 reaction 18 k 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 and o2 is the precursor for h2o2 and oh excess aqueous fe iii may lead to an underestimation of oh in the previous work chen et al 2021a for ros transformation we added the reactions of h2o2 decomposition through the catalase type and peroxidase type pathways reactions 20 22 as these reactions play important roles in soil sediments petigara et al 2002 pham et al 2012 moreover the oh yields for h2o2 decomposition by different fe ii species were also measured ii fitting parameters although the numbers of total reactions in this study no 27 were higher than the previously reported model no 19 chen et al 2021a the number of fitting rate constants decreased from 9 to 3 this means that the uncertainty of this model may be reduced 3 4 mechanistic insight into fe ii oxidation on oh production and tce degradation as h2o2 is an important intermediate for oh production during fe ii oxygenation huang et al 2021 liao et al 2019 tong et al 2016 the variation of h2o2 concentration during the reactions was modeled fig 4 a showed that instantaneous h2o2 concentration increased first and subsequently decreased within 6 h which is typical of h2o2 as an intermediate in 100 g l riparian sediment suspension h2o2 accumulations within 6 h for the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii by o2 were 0 17 0 86 and 4 65 mm respectively fig 4b however h2o2 consumption by these fe ii species was 1 74 1 39 and 1 64 mm respectively fig 4b these results suggest that the h2o2 produced by ion exchangeable fe ii and surface adsorbed fe ii cannot offset the h2o2 consumed by these fe ii species whereas the amount of h2o2 produced by reactive mineral structural fe ii was greater than the consumption as ion exchangeable fe ii cannot activate h2o2 to generate oh xie et al 2020 it may not only cannot contribute to oh production but also weaken oh yield this observation may explain the low electron utilization efficiency of fe ii during soil and sediment oxygenation as reported in literature xie et al 2020 2021 and found in this study fig s4 although poorly reactive mineral structure fe ii had a marginal impact on oh production within short term oxygenation such as 6 h it may serve as an electron pool to recharge reactive fe ii and then facilitate oh production after prolonged anoxic storage fig s14 for instance when the pre oxidized sediment was stored for 480 h under anoxic conditions and then exposed it to air the oh accumulation within 6 h reached 18 7 μm fig s14 in both natural and engineered systems pulsed oxygen aeration is a common occurrence diem et al 2013 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 for example groundwater table fluctuation may expose sediments to o2 for a short time followed by prolonged anoxic storage kumar and riyazuddin 2012 therefore poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii may play a critical role in oh production in such pulsed oxidation scenarios for oh production the relative contribution of each pathway varies with reaction time and sediment types fig 5 a b for oxygenation of 100 g l riparian sediment the relative contribution of surface adsorbed fe ii oxidation to oh production decreases rapidly from 74 0 initially to 54 5 at 0 5 h and further to 33 9 at 6 h fig 5a hence surface adsorbed fe ii predominantly contributes to oh production at the initial stage while reactive mineral structure fe ii contributes to oh production at the last stage within 6 h of oxidation the relative contribution of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii oxidation to oh production are estimated to be 33 9 and 66 1 in riparian sediment 26 5 and 73 5 in lakeshore sediment and 16 4 and 83 6 in pond sediment respectively fig 5b because tce is oxidized by oh it is expected that the reactions that contributed to oh production were also beneficial to tce degradation this speculation was supported by the negative nsc values of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii oxidation by o2 and h2o2 reactions 5 7 9 and 11 fig 3d f however reactions 4 8 and 12 resulted in positive nsc values fig 3d f indicating that ion exchangeable surface adsorbed and reactive mineral structural fe ii weakened tce degradation therefore fe ii species played a dual role in tce degradation generating oh to oxidize tce while quenching oh to weaken tce oxidation compared with ha cl and hco3 the quenching effect of fe ii species was more pronounced owing to their high nsc values fig 3d f the quenching effect of fe ii species on tce degradation may explain the low oh utilization efficiency table s4 oh utilization efficiency decreased with increasing fe ii concentration table s4 additionally nsc calculation showed that the order of quenching effect of fe ii species varied with reaction time specifically at the initial stage the quenching effect order was ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii mineral structural fe ii while it was opposite at the last stage fig 3d f the results of fig 5c indicated that the quenching efficiency of ion exchangeable fe ii on tce degradation decreased rapidly from 18 2 at the beginning to 0 5 at 1 h due to the rapid consumption of ion exchangeable fe ii at the initial stage among the three sediment systems reactive mineral structural fe ii exhibited the highest quenching effect on tce degradation fig 5d indicating that reactive mineral structural fe ii is the primary quencher of oh for tce degradation 4 conclusions this study developed a kinetic model capable of describing fe ii oxidation oh production and tce degradation during sediment oxygenation under neutral ph conditions and explored the roles of different fe ii species on oh production and tce degradation the main conclusions derived from this research are as follows employing the categorization of fe ii species in soils sediments into ion exchangeable fe ii surface adsorbed fe ii and mineral structural fe ii is an effective approach for the development of kinetic models that can describe oh production and contaminant degradation during soil sediment oxygenation oh production is mainly attributed to the oxidation of surface adsorbed fe ii and reactive mineral structural fe ii while the oxidation of ion exchangeable fe ii exerts an inhibitory effect on oh production poorly reactive mineral structural fe ii can act as an electron source to regenerate surface fe ii species thereby contributing to oh production following a period of anoxic storage for tce degradation all fe ii species served as both oh producers and oh scavengers among them reactive mineral structural fe ii exhibited the strongest quenching effect on oh oxidation due to its highest content in sediments due to the quenching effect of fe ii species and co existing compounds the oh utilization efficiency was relatively low this may explain the challenge of removing contaminants through the oh oxidation pathway in soil sediment systems even when oh accumulation exceeded the concentration of contaminants chen et al 2021b schaefer et al 2018 tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 2021 in addition considering that o2 replenishment in natural and engineered systems usually involved hydrodynamic processes diem et al 2013 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 further studies are needed to consider both geochemical and hydrodynamic processes

introduction with the intensification of human activities and climate change eutrophication of lakes is increasing and harmful algal blooms occur frequently across the world ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 with the accumulation of biomass in eutrophic lakes cyanobacterial particles usually float to the water surface and form floating blooms bloom patches or scums under appropriate temperature wind speed and light conditions hopkins et al 2021 matthews et al 2012 qin et al 2019 harmful algal blooms may lead to the degradation of water quality decrease biodiversity and affect recreation and even human health for instance toxic cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu china and lake erie usa have led to major drinking water crises burford et al 2020 qin et al 2019 satellite remote sensing can provide continuous monitoring of algal blooms at a large spatial scale by detecting spatial temporal dynamics of the bloom area extent and duration time ho et al 2017 hu 2009 kutser et al 2020 the spatial distribution occurrence extent and duration of cyanobacterial blooms are affected by both physiological and physical processes in lakes feng et al 2018 and can be changed rapidly in a short time chen et al 2019 monitoring the short term variations of cyanobacterial blooms could provide more details of their spatial distribution and is helpful to capture the processes in formation or disappearance of floating blooms accurately predict them especially near the drinking water sources using numerical model or machine learning method and then improve the lake management duan et al 2017 ndong et al 2017 among the satellite sensors geostationary satellites have advantages in providing high frequency observations over one specific region with a 500 m nadir resolution and eight measurements per day the geostationary ocean color imager goci has been used to detect algal blooms choi et al 2014 qi et al 2017 son et al 2015 and identify species of algal blooms in the east china sea feng et al 2022 shen et al 2019 and ariake sea japan feng et al 2021 the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes imager was used to monitor diurnal changes in a trichodesmium erythraeum bloom on the west florida shelf hu and feng 2014 advanced himawari imager ahi onboard himawari 8 h8 observed floating algae at ultrahigh temporal resolutions 10 min and derived a higher 20 frequency of floating algae in lake taihu chen et al 2019 compared with the daily detection of algal blooms using polar orbit satellite such as modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer or viirs visible infrared imager radiometer sensor higher frequency monitoring using geostationary satellites has advantages in tracking the movement of floating green algae patches choi et al 2014 and vertical migration of harmful algal blooms li et al 2022 qi et al 2018 in the previous studies the horizontal shift of cyanobacterial blooms were assessed mainly in situ by tracing the movement of bloom patches deng et al 2016 and measuring the near surface currents to calculate horizontal speed indirectly chen et al 2023 the horizontal velocity of algal patches and wind speed showed a significant linear or exponential relationship at wind speeds lower than the critical value 2 4 m s in shallow lakes deng et al 2016 the horizontal migration velocity of cyanobacterial blooms reaches a maximum when the wind speed reaches a critical value in shallow lakes webster and hutchinson 1994 and then the algal blooms disappear or aggregate on the downwind side at higher wind speeds chen et al 2023 vertical migration rising sinking within a day via buoyancy regulation is an important characteristic of cyanobacteria aparicio medrano et al 2016 and it is modulated mainly by temperature light wind and turbulence through which surface floating blooms may be formed or disappear qi et al 2018 in natural conditions the vertical migration of harmful algae blooms has been observed with airborne remote sensing hunter et al 2008 and satellite remote sensing lou and hu 2014 statistical methods such as lagrangian based models and eulerian approaches have been used to simulate the horizontal distribution and vertical movement of algal blooms in a water body or water column feng et al 2018 ndong et al 2017 in situ sampling is seldom able to illustrate the distribution and movement of cyanobacterial blooms on a large scale and recent studies estimated the overall vertical velocity of cyanobacteria in lake taihu using goci satellite data on a lake scale li et al 2022 qi et al 2018 the vertical movement speed was first estimated from goci data using water depth or curve fitting of algae density in the water column qi et al 2018 and had similar ranges with previous field measurements qin et al 2016 the upward floating speed of cyanobacteria was derived from the daily maximum and minimum daily value of cyanobacterial bloom intensity of the lake li et al 2022 which reflects the vertical migration of cyanobacteria in a lake scale however few studies have focused on the horizontal and vertical migration of cyanobacterial blooms using satellite data considering the spatial heterogeneity of the lake in order to monitor the horizontal and vertical movement of floating algal blooms two eutrophic shallow lakes with frequent cyanobacterial bloom occurrence were taken as examples the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the diurnal dynamics and horizontal movement of floating algal blooms using goci images 2 to estimate the rising and sinking speed of cyanobacteria and 3 to determine the driving forces of horizontal and vertical migration studying the horizontal and vertical movement of cyanobacteria is important for lake management in eliminating floating blooms and monitoring drinking water safety 2 data and methods 2 1 study region lake taihu 2338 km2 and lake chaohu 768 km2 are the third and fifth largest freshwater lakes in china and both are located in the lower yangtze river basin with mean depths of 1 9 and 2 7 m respectively fig 1 with economic development and rapid population growth these two lakes have suffered from severe eutrophication and frequent cyanobacterial blooms in recent decades huang et al 2020 qin et al 2019 the annual mean bloom area of floating blooms showed a nonmonotonic and overall increasing trend from 2002 to 2020 in lake taihu and lake chaohu xue et al 2022a the bloom area of lake taihu reached a maximum value in 2017 which was 3 5 times the mean eba in 2007 xue et al 2022a the cyanobacterial bloom covered 1582 km2 on may 16 2017 in lake taihu and it was the largest area of bloom coverage thus far recorded for the lake qin et al 2019 it showed that lake chaohu had a bloom duration of 344 9 d from 2010 to 2020 yuan et al 2023 harmful cyanobacterial floating blooms or scums often occur in the northern and northwestern parts of lake taihu hu et al 2010 and western part of lake chaohu duan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 where high levels of tp total phosphorus and tn total nitrogen are observed by convention lake taihu was divided into 7 lake segments including zhushan bay zs meiliang bay ml gonghu bay gh western part of lake taihu wt central part of lake taihu ct southern part of lake taihu st and eastern part of lake taihu et et is excluded to decrease the influence of aquatic macrophytes in this region lake chaohu was divided into 3 segments including western wch middle mch and eastern ech part of lake chaohu the drinking water intakes fig 1c d in ech c1 c2 and gh t1 t4 are located in lake segments with low occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms the mean fac of 3 3 pixels around the water intakes were calculated to represent their bloom density 2 2 satellite data processing goci is aboard the communication ocean and meteorological satellite coms launched by the korean ocean satellite center kosc goci covers a regional area of 2500 km 2500 km with center coordinates at 130 e and 36 n it acquires data in 8 spectral bands 6 visible 2 nir with a spatial resolution of approximately 500 m from june 2010 to march 2021 level 1 goci data totally 9185 images were downloaded from nasa gsfc http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov and then processed to rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc data using seadas version 7 5 3 which is a comprehensive software package developed by nasa obpg ocean biology processing group for the processing of satellite data the combination of rrc values in blue green and red were used to mask cloud and sun glint in conditions with rrc 443 0 20 rrc 555 0 22 rrc 660 0 20 the available images that used for fac calculation in further step is 5354 and 5321 for lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively table 1 the alternative floating algae index afai was calculated from the rrc data in one red and two nir bands qi et al 2018 1 afai r r c λ nir 1 r r c λ red r r c λ nir 2 r r c λ red λ nir 1 λ red λ nir 2 λ red where λred λnir1 and λnir2 are 660 745 and 865 nm respectively afai was designed following the concept of floating algae index fai hu 2009 to quantify cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu using modis hu et al 2010 to address the overestimation of floating bloom area using pure pixel assumption a logistic pixel unmixing method was used to derive the fractional floating algae cover fac of lake taihu and lake chaohu xue et al 2022a and the fac was modeled as a logistic regression model using afai as the input parameter 2 fac 100 1 e 5 0 73 6 afai where 100 represents the maximum value of bloom cover in a pixel the cyanobacterial density change dfac at a pixel was calculated as 3 dfac t f a c t 1 f a c t where t is the observing time of the given goci image and t 1 is the observing time of the next hour t ranges from 8 00 to 14 00 at local time utc 8 the integrated equivalent bloom area eba km2 is calculated as follows 4 eba i 1 n s fac i s s where fac i is the fac value of the pixel i ns is the number of valid pixels s is the spatial resolution in kilometers the images with cyanobacterial blooms occurred were chosen for further analysis based on the following rules 1 there are more than 6 available images within a given day and 2 the mean eba of the day is larger than 20 km2 the number of days that meets the above rules is 251 and 130 in lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively table 1 virtual stations with different fac values were set in the following analysis to show the hourly fac variations 2 3 horizontal and vertical movement of cyanobacterial blooms we proposed a method fig 2 to trace the horizontal movement of cyanobacterial bloom patches using their area location and centroid then the fac values at different times were fitted to derive the rising and sinking speeds of algae in each pixel the pixels with fac 30 were extracted first and the segments with lower than 20 consecutive pixels 1 25 km2 were removed one individual segment was regarded as an algal bloom patch the number of algal patches np the eba of each algal patch and the mean area of the algal patches m eq 5 were recorded 5 m i 1 n p eba i n p in conditions with severe floating blooms it is difficult to trace one algal patch as one algal patch may separate into two or more patches or maybe merge with other patches therefore we selected the conditions with only one algal patch in the lake as the target to calculate the daily mean horizontal velocity h m s from the centroid of the patch at different times 6 h i 1 n h 1 x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 t i 1 t i n h 1 where xi and yi are the location of the centroid at ti xi 1 and yi 1 are the locations of the centroid at ti 1 and nh is the number of available images of the day a previous study suggested that the variation in fac was mainly contributed by the vertical movement of phytoplankton in the water column when the wind speed was 3 m s li et al 2022 the vertical rising and sinking speed of each pixel was estimated based on the following assumptions 1 cyanobacterial colonies in the water column rise and sink vertically at the same speed 2 the algae is distributed vertically uniformly in the water column before and after floating bloom formation the diurnal dynamics of fac in each pixel showed three types including monotonously increasing type 1 increasing and then decreasing type 2 and uniformly decreasing type 3 fig 2 type 1 presents the rising of algae in the water column and the rising speed v m h was calculated through the fitted fac t curve in the conditions that significant quadratic polynomial regression can be derived 7 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t mint 1 fac x y t maxt 1 t maxt 1 t mint 1 where z x y is the water depth at a given pixel which is derived from the water level and digital elevation model dem of the lake tmint1 and tmaxt1 are the time that has minimum and maximum of fac x y t in type 1 respectively for type 3 the sinking velocity v m h can be derived following eq 8 as follows 8 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t mint 3 fac x y t max t 3 t mint 3 t maxt 3 where tmint3 and tmaxt3 are the time that has minimum and maximum of fac x y t in type 3 respectively type 2 presents both rising and sinking of algae in the water column the maximum value of fac facmax and its time tmaxt2 were first determined and the rising v m h and sinking speed v m h could then be calculated following eq 9 and eq 10 respectively 9 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t 1 fac x y t maxt 2 t m a x t 2 t 1 10 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t 2 fac x y t maxt 2 t 2 t maxt 2 where t1 and t2 are the start and end time of type 2 2 4 meteorological and hydrological data previous studies illustrated that the influence of tn and tp on floating algal blooms is minimal at the hourly scale huang et al 2015 qin et al 2019 and we assumed that the hourly dynamics of fac mainly results from the variations of meteorological conditions hourly values of irradiance data including global horizontal irradiance ghi diffuse horizontal irradiance dhi and direct normal irradiance dni from 2011 to 2020 in lake taihu and lake chaohu were downloaded from the national solar radiation database nsrdb sengupta et al 2018 according the selected fac images of lake taihu and lake chaohu the corresponding hourly values of ghi dhi dni were extracted and their daily mean values from 8 00 to 15 00 local time utc 8 were calculated the hourly wind speed win and air temperature tem from 2011 to 2020 in lake taihu and lake chaohu were downloaded from the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts era5 dataset era5 is the latest climate reanalysis produced by ecmwf providing hourly data on many atmospheric land surface and sea state parameters together with estimates of uncertainty similarly the hourly win and tem were used to analyze their relationship with fac values the daily mean win and tem from 8 00 to 15 00 the mean wind speed of 24 h prior to the image at this time win 1d and the mean wind speed of 12 h prior to the image at this time win 12 h were used to calculate their contribution in daily fac horizontal and vertical movement random forest regression rfr implemented in the scikit learn sklearn package for python was used to evaluate the influence of wind speed light and temperature on diurnal changes in fac and horizontal and vertical speed the feature importance of driving factors to fac h v and v were calculated through permutation feature importance breiman 2001 which reflects the contribution of each explanatory variable the feature importance is calculated by noticing the increase or decrease in error when we permute the values of a feature the dem data of lake taihu and lake chaohu with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the scientific data center of nanjing institute of geography limnology chinese academy of sciences http lake geodata cn and was resampled to 250 m daily water level data of the nearest hydrological stations from 2011 to 2020 were acquired from the local hydrology bureau in lake taihu and lake chaohu the water depth of each pixel m was derived by subtracting the average water level which was assumed to be the water level of the entire lake of the hydrological stations from the dem 3 results 3 1 diurnal dynamics of fac in lake taihu and lake chaohu diurnal changes in floating algal blooms were illustrated by rgb image fac and dfac in lake chaohu september 04 2018 and lake taihu september 18 2017 and december 18 2017 fig 3 they represent different diurnal types of eba the eba increased to a peak value at approximately 11 00 and then decreased on september 04 2018 in lake chaohu eba had a decreasing tendency on september 18 2017 and an overall increase on december 18 2017 in lake taihu however the eba also the sum of fac of the image integrated the spatial dynamics of fac within a day for example virtual station m1 in the southwest part of lake taihu had the highest fac at approximately 10 00 to 11 00 and the fac values of m3 in gh bay decreased from nearly 100 in the morning to approximately 25 at 13 00 and then increased to a high value on september 18 2017 fig 3b1 b4 algal blooms had obvious spatial variations with high values starting from the southwest part of lake taihu in the morning to the center part of lake taihu in the afternoon on december 18 2017 the mean and standard deviation values of fac in different regions of lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 4 showed that zs ml and gh had obviously lower mean fac values than those of ct wt and st in lake taihu and wch had the highest fac in lake chaohu the highest fac value in wt occurred at 9 00 and 10 00 in the morning and the highest mean fac in ct occurred at approximately 12 00 similarly wch had the highest fac mean value at 10 00 and ech had the highest fac later than that of wch and mch 3 2 horizontal movement of algal blooms the locations number and area of algal bloom patches extracted from all the goci data with blooms showed the hotspots and spatial distribution of cyanobacterial bloom patches in lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 5 it indicated that lake taihu had an overall higher number and area of bloom patches than lake chaohu large bloom patches usually occurred in the western and central parts of lake taihu and the western part of lake chaohu the maximum number and total area of bloom patches occurred at approximately 10 00 and the mean bloom area in the morning was higher than that in the afternoon in lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 5b c g h the number mean and total area of bloom patches in each region had similar trends with the highest values in ct of lake taihu and wch of lake chaohu fig 5d e i j however if the number and total area of bloom patches were divided by the area of each region the zs ml and wt in lake taihu and wch in lake chaohu had higher normalized counts and areas of bloom patches than other regions in addition images with only one algal bloom patch were selected and the horizontal velocity of the bloom patches were calculated to be 1 33 1 19 m s ranging from 0 16 to 3 53 m s n 10 in lake taihu and 1 14 0 99 m s ranging from 0 16 to 2 78 m s n 14 in lake chaohu 3 3 vertical migration of algae in the water column the spatial distribution of the rising v and sinking v velocities of lake taihu and lake chaohu showed that the vertical velocities both rising and sinking in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter fig 6 table 2 the derived mean rising speed is 0 90 0 30 m h in lake taihu and 0 76 0 35 m h in lake chaohu and the mean sinking speed is 0 87 0 33 m h in lake taihu and 0 68 0 38 m h in lake chaohu in summer higher rising and sinking velocity were observed in the central part of lake taihu and the eastern part of lake chaohu the main possible reason is that the ml and zs bays northwestern part of lake taihu and western part of lake chaohu usually had high fac values all day which did not follow the three types of fac significantly in a specific pixel this result indicated that more cases with vertical movement can be observed in waters with a moderate frequency of algal blooms the low rising and sinking velocity may also be related to the growing status of cyanobacteria in spring and winter statistics of the total vertical speed v rising speed and sinking speed of lake chaohu and lake taihu showed that the days with class 1 of eba had the highest mean total vertical speed 0 22 0 33 m h in lake chaohu 0 04 0 44 m h in lake taihu the days with class 2 of eba had the highest mean rising speed 0 83 0 33 m h in lake chaohu 1 00 0 32 m h in lake taihu and the days with class 3 of eba had the highest mean sinking speed 0 76 0 24 m h in lake chaohu 1 01 0 25 m h in lake taihu fig 7 3 4 contribution of meteorological data to migration of algal blooms fig 8 illustrates the relationship between fac and dni dhi ghi tem and win at different time it indicated that dni had a weak positive relationship with fac while dhi ghi and tem had significant positive relationships with fac at 8 00 for lake taihu and lake chaohu this is in accordance with the results that higher eba can be observed in the summer morning however win had a significant negative relationship with fac from 8 00 to 11 00 in lake taihu and lake chaohu which means high fac values usually corresponds to low wind speed random forest regression was used to calculate the contribution of win win 1d win 12 h tem dni dhi and ghi to v v h the maximum fac of the day facmax and the mean value of the day facmean in lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 9 for the facmean and facmax win and win 12 h contributed the most in both lake taihu and lake chaohu the influences of tem on facmean and facmax were smaller in lake taihu 13 6 13 5 than those in lake chaohu 15 4 15 7 win contributed 18 3 and 15 1 to h in lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively for vertical movement temperature and radiation have large contributions to rising and sinking speeds v is more related to dni and dhi in lake taihu and lake chaohu with contribution of 18 1 and 16 6 respectively which could explain the regulation of buoyancy on light variation fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and limitations of estimating horizontal and vertical movement using goci data the horizontal movement of algal bloom patches and vertical speed of algae in each pixel were estimated using goci satellite data in this study one advantage is that the mean horizontal velocity of cyanobacterial blooms within a day was first estimated from goci images with only one bloom patch some macroalgae such as sargassum wang et al 2018 and ulva qi et al 2016 son et al 2015 floating on the water surface are relatively easy to trace using satellite data however cyanobacteria form floating blooms or scums on the water surface under certain conditions and the number of algal bloom patches often changes or the scums even disappear rapidly with strong wind therefore it is difficult to calculate the horizontal velocities of floating scums of cyanobacteria from both field measurements and satellite data field measurements of the horizontal speed of floating bloom patches were conducted in zs bay of lake taihu and the speed was 0 01 0 327 m s with an average value of 0 094 0 061 m s in august 2012 with wind speed ranging from 1 1 to 3 1 m s deng et al 2016 the difference between the satellite and field measurements may lie on the method of the horizontal speed calculation the satellite derived horizontal velocity of the bloom patch in this study represented the mean horizontal movement of the whole day while the field measured speed was the instantaneous floating velocity of bloom patches the rising and sinking velocity in pixel scale was estimated using goci data which not only can be used to monitor the bloom formation but also can be used to evaluate the colony size and the living conditions of the cyanobacteria in a large scale vertical velocity as measured by goci satellite data in this study was lower than that measured in a laboratory setting for colony sizes of 64 100 μm 1 008 0 288 m h and higher for colony sizes of 20 64 μm 0 288 0 108 m h in lake taihu qin et al 2016 similarly a tank experiment showed that the floating velocities of large microcystis colonies ranged 0 15 0 46 m h depending on colony size and were 5 15 times higher than those of smaller colonies 0 03 m h wu et al 2020 the mean upward floating velocity of lake taihu in this study 0 90 0 30 m h 0 36 2 18 m h was higher than the results in the previous study derived from the goci data of the whole lake 0 288 0 792 m h li et al 2022 note that in areas with high mean values of fac such as the northwest part of lake taihu and the west part of lake chaohu the derived vertical migration speed is lower than that in other regions because they had lower variability in fac and did not follow the functions of fac significantly even though they had high fac values one assumption was that the vertical migration was not considered in calculating the horizontal speed and the horizontal shift was not considered in calculating the vertical speed note that cyanobacterial blooms were also observed from the goci images in conditions with mean wind speed 3 m s even though the mean bloom areas in conditions with high wind speed were obvious lower than the conditions with win 3 m s considering the possible combination of horizontal and vertical movement of algae the vertical speed was calculated in conditions with win 3 m s another assumption was that the algal particles and colonies moved vertically at the same speed and were distributed vertically uniformly in the water column before and after floating bloom formation indicating that the method is only suitable in shallow lakes in fact aggregated large colonies have greater buoyancy and higher rates of vertical migration to the surface than smaller colonies ranjbar et al 2021 in addition cyanobacteria may also aggregate at certain depths or even at the water bottom under certain environmental conditions field measurements have demonstrated that the subsurface maximum layer depth of chlorophyll a chla concentration often occurs in deep lakes and seas lou and hu 2014 in which case the above assumption is not valid and beyond the discussion of this study in addition the average hourly wind speed was used to calculate its influence on algal bloom movement note that the spatial variation in the wind field should be taken into consideration however the hourly wind speed had coarse spatial resolution only several pixels could be used in lake taihu and lake chaohu so we used the mean values of wind speed the higher spatial resolution of wind speed may provide more information in explaining the spatial variability of floating algal blooms 4 2 factors that influence the diurnal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms it has been demonstrated that low water turbulence high water temperatures and the buoyancy capacity of cyanobacteria play key roles in floating algal bloom formation aparicio medrano et al 2016 buoyancy regulation within a day is mainly affected by light intensity and colony size hayes et al 2020 li et al 2016 reynolds et al 1987 when the light intensity reaches its maximum value the cyanobacterial bloom density does not yet reach its maximum as there is timelag to compensate for buoyancy ndong et al 2017 in addition large colonies of cyanobacteria with diameter 300 400 μm have great buoyancy and rise much easier to the water surface than cells or small colonies wu et al 2019 smaller colonies are less resistant to turbulence and are more dispersed in the water column xue et al 2022b wind plays an important role in algal bloom formation blukacz et al 2009 paerl and otten 2013 verhagen 1994 and previous studies have demonstrated that the critical wind speeds for bloom scums vary with lakes depending on the lake area water depth duration time of wind wind fetch and so on deng et al 2016 huang et al 2015 for lake taihu several critical wind speeds have been used including 3 6 m s deng et al 2016 and 4 5 m s in zs bay chen et al 2023 based on field measurements an empirical relationship between the critical wind speed and the ratio between the square root of lake area and depth was built at different lakes huang et al 2014 and the results of lake taihu and lake chaohu are 3 41 and 3 67 m s respectively 2 75 m s was used to distinguish vertical uniform and gaussian distribution types of chla profiles in lake chaohu xue et al 2015 when the wind speed exceeds critical wind speed the total horizontal transport rate is reduced due to the strong mixing and reverse flow of the bottom layer in the water column subsequent gentle wind would cause more intensive horizontal accumulation of blooms in the downwind area than what happens under strong wind wang et al 2017 the concept of optimal wind speed was proposed in a recent study chen et al 2023 and it was defined as a certain wind speed maximizes the horizontal transport flux of microcystis through the cross section perpendicular to the wind direction in conditions with optical wind speed 2 1 m s in zs bay of lake taihu the wind made the thin surface water flow rapidly than the lower water column the horizontal transport rate is fast chen et al 2023 it has been demonstrated that the transport of phytoplankton with lake currents contributes only 1 2 to the total vertical movement in ml bay of lake taihu and the transport usually has different directions with the wind wu et al 2010 the euler lagrangian coupled model showed that the wind induced turbulence mixing velocity of colonies contributed 52 9 of bloom formations in lake taihu feng et al 2018 the maximum horizontal transport rate of microcystis 0 0384 m s in the downwind area was observed in zs bay of lake taihu chen et al 2023 which also contributes to the horizontal movement of blooms it is still challenging to distinguish the horizontal and vertical movement of cyanobacteria from satellite data especially in cases with wind speed around the optical wind speed we found a significant relationship between diffuse irradiance and fac in the morning which indicates that floating cyanobacterial blooms may also occur in conditions with thin cloud and suitable temperature however this could not be captured by optical satellites under the influence of clouds sar synthetic aperture radar images acquired from envisat asar advanced synthetic aperture radar or sentinel 1 have been used to monitor cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu wang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 however a recent study qi et al 2022 illustrated that sentinel 1 sar could not detect microalgae such as microcystis trichodesmium and noctiluca whether floating microalgae blooms in these lakes can be detected using sar should be further investigated 4 3 implication for monitoring and forecasting cyanobacterial blooms the occurrence extent and spatial distribution of cyanobacterial blooms are key parameters in the operational monitoring of lake environments the spatial temporal distribution of floating blooms in lake taihu and lake chaohu observed from multi sensors revealed that the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms increased obviously after 2010 xue et al 2022a large costs have been invested in lake restoration including pollution management and algae salvage for instance these activities have cost us 14 billion from 2007 to 2017 in lake taihu qin et al 2019 high frequency satellite data can also support the forecasting of algal blooms in lakes especially in waters near drinking water intakes fig 1 the vertical and horizontal movements of bloom patches near drinking water sources provide key information for the management of water quality and drinking water safety take the 4 water intakes in gh and 2 water intakes in ech as examples the mean fac and eba in gh and ech are lower than other regions fig 5 indicating the good water quality in this region however we found that the number of goci images with fac 50 in the drinking water intakes are 61 30 33 13 for t1 t4 and 33 11 for c1 c2 fig 11 among the 4 intakes in gh t1 is more affected by cyanobacterial blooms than other water intakes for the lake management hourly fac and estimated horizontal and vertical movement of blooms would be key parameters in forecasting the cyanobacterial blooms near the drinking water intakes fortunately goci ii has better performance with 250 m spatial resolution and measurements taken 10 times a day which can succeed the goci in providing better long term observations the combination of goci and goci ii data could provide a consecutive diurnal changes of floating blooms in the further study 5 conclusions the diurnal dynamics and migration of floating cyanobacterial blooms were evaluated and the horizontal shift of bloom patches and vertical migration speed of cyanobacteria were estimated from fac of goci images in lake taihu and lake chaohu china locations number and area of algal bloom patches showed that the western and central parts of lake taihu and the western part of lake chaohu had high mean values of fac and earlier occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom within a day the proposed method calculated the horizontal speed of bloom patches by selecting images with only one bloom patch and derived the rising and sinking speeds of cyanobacteria in the water column when the wind speed was lower than 3 m s the driving factors of variations in fac horizontal and vertical speed showed that dhi ghi and tem had significant positive relationships with fac in the morning win contributed 18 3 and 15 1 to the horizontal movement speed in lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively temperature and radiation have large contributions to rising and sinking speeds of cyanobacteria the rising speed was more related to dni and dhi in both lake taihu and lake chaohu monitoring the horizontal and vertical migration of floating algal blooms using geostationary satellite is helpful for understanding the diurnal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms and

chaohu with contribution of 18 1 and 16 6 the horizontal and vertical movement of algae provide important information for understanding phytoplankton dynamics and the prediction and warning of algal blooms in lake management keywords cyanobacterial blooms horizontal movement vertical velocity goci satellite fractional floating algae cover data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the intensification of human activities and climate change eutrophication of lakes is increasing and harmful algal blooms occur frequently across the world ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 with the accumulation of biomass in eutrophic lakes cyanobacterial particles usually float to the water surface and form floating blooms bloom patches or scums under appropriate temperature wind speed and light conditions hopkins et al 2021 matthews et al 2012 qin et al 2019 harmful algal blooms may lead to the degradation of water quality decrease biodiversity and affect recreation and even human health for instance toxic cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu china and lake erie usa have led to major drinking water crises burford et al 2020 qin et al 2019 satellite remote sensing can provide continuous monitoring of algal blooms at a large spatial scale by detecting spatial temporal dynamics of the bloom area extent and duration time ho et al 2017 hu 2009 kutser et al 2020 the spatial distribution occurrence extent and duration of cyanobacterial blooms are affected by both physiological and physical processes in lakes feng et al 2018 and can be changed rapidly in a short time chen et al 2019 monitoring the short term variations of cyanobacterial blooms could provide more details of their spatial distribution and is helpful to capture the processes in formation or disappearance of floating blooms accurately predict them especially near the drinking water sources using numerical model or machine learning method and then improve the lake management duan et al 2017 ndong et al 2017 among the satellite sensors geostationary satellites have advantages in providing high frequency observations over one specific region with a 500 m nadir resolution and eight measurements per day the geostationary ocean color imager goci has been used to detect algal blooms choi et al 2014 qi et al 2017 son et al 2015 and identify species of algal blooms in the east china sea feng et al 2022 shen et al 2019 and ariake sea japan feng et al 2021 the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes imager was used to monitor diurnal changes in a trichodesmium erythraeum bloom on the west florida shelf hu and feng 2014 advanced himawari imager ahi onboard himawari 8 h8 observed floating algae at ultrahigh temporal resolutions 10 min and derived a higher 20 frequency of floating algae in lake taihu chen et al 2019 compared with the daily detection of algal blooms using polar orbit satellite such as modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer or viirs visible infrared imager radiometer sensor higher frequency monitoring using geostationary satellites has advantages in tracking the movement of floating green algae patches choi et al 2014 and vertical migration of harmful algal blooms li et al 2022 qi et al 2018 in the previous studies the horizontal shift of cyanobacterial blooms were assessed mainly in situ by tracing the movement of bloom patches deng et al 2016 and measuring the near surface currents to calculate horizontal speed indirectly chen et al 2023 the horizontal velocity of algal patches and wind speed showed a significant linear or exponential relationship at wind speeds lower than the critical value 2 4 m s in shallow lakes deng et al 2016 the horizontal migration velocity of cyanobacterial blooms reaches a maximum when the wind speed reaches a critical value in shallow lakes webster and hutchinson 1994 and then the algal blooms disappear or aggregate on the downwind side at higher wind speeds chen et al 2023 vertical migration rising sinking within a day via buoyancy regulation is an important characteristic of cyanobacteria aparicio medrano et al 2016 and it is modulated mainly by temperature light wind and turbulence through which surface floating blooms may be formed or disappear qi et al 2018 in natural conditions the vertical migration of harmful algae blooms has been observed with airborne remote sensing hunter et al 2008 and satellite remote sensing lou and hu 2014 statistical methods such as lagrangian based models and eulerian approaches have been used to simulate the horizontal distribution and vertical movement of algal blooms in a water body or water column feng et al 2018 ndong et al 2017 in situ sampling is seldom able to illustrate the distribution and movement of cyanobacterial blooms on a large scale and recent studies estimated the overall vertical velocity of cyanobacteria in lake taihu using goci satellite data on a lake scale li et al 2022 qi et al 2018 the vertical movement speed was first estimated from goci data using water depth or curve fitting of algae density in the water column qi et al 2018 and had similar ranges with previous field measurements qin et al 2016 the upward floating speed of cyanobacteria was derived from the daily maximum and minimum daily value of cyanobacterial bloom intensity of the lake li et al 2022 which reflects the vertical migration of cyanobacteria in a lake scale however few studies have focused on the horizontal and vertical migration of cyanobacterial blooms using satellite data considering the spatial heterogeneity of the lake in order to monitor the horizontal and vertical movement of floating algal blooms two eutrophic shallow lakes with frequent cyanobacterial bloom occurrence were taken as examples the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the diurnal dynamics and horizontal movement of floating algal blooms using goci images 2 to estimate the rising and sinking speed of cyanobacteria and 3 to determine the driving forces of horizontal and vertical migration studying the horizontal and vertical movement of cyanobacteria is important for lake management in eliminating floating blooms and monitoring drinking water safety 2 data and methods 2 1 study region lake taihu 2338 km2 and lake chaohu 768 km2 are the third and fifth largest freshwater lakes in china and both are located in the lower yangtze river basin with mean depths of 1 9 and 2 7 m respectively fig 1 with economic development and rapid population growth these two lakes have suffered from severe eutrophication and frequent cyanobacterial blooms in recent decades huang et al 2020 qin et al 2019 the annual mean bloom area of floating blooms showed a nonmonotonic and overall increasing trend from 2002 to 2020 in lake taihu and lake chaohu xue et al 2022a the bloom area of lake taihu reached a maximum value in 2017 which was 3 5 times the mean eba in 2007 xue et al 2022a the cyanobacterial bloom covered 1582 km2 on may 16 2017 in lake taihu and it was the largest area of bloom coverage thus far recorded for the lake qin et al 2019 it showed that lake chaohu had a bloom duration of 344 9 d from 2010 to 2020 yuan et al 2023 harmful cyanobacterial floating blooms or scums often occur in the northern and northwestern parts of lake taihu hu et al 2010 and western part of lake chaohu duan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 where high levels of tp total phosphorus and tn total nitrogen are observed by convention lake taihu was divided into 7 lake segments including zhushan bay zs meiliang bay ml gonghu bay gh western part of lake taihu wt central part of lake taihu ct southern part of lake taihu st and eastern part of lake taihu et et is excluded to decrease the influence of aquatic macrophytes in this region lake chaohu was divided into 3 segments including western wch middle mch and eastern ech part of lake chaohu the drinking water intakes fig 1c d in ech c1 c2 and gh t1 t4 are located in lake segments with low occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms the mean fac of 3 3 pixels around the water intakes were calculated to represent their bloom density 2 2 satellite data processing goci is aboard the communication ocean and meteorological satellite coms launched by the korean ocean satellite center kosc goci covers a regional area of 2500 km 2500 km with center coordinates at 130 e and 36 n it acquires data in 8 spectral bands 6 visible 2 nir with a spatial resolution of approximately 500 m from june 2010 to march 2021 level 1 goci data totally 9185 images were downloaded from nasa gsfc http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov and then processed to rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc data using seadas version 7 5 3 which is a comprehensive software package developed by nasa obpg ocean biology processing group for the processing of satellite data the combination of rrc values in blue green and red were used to mask cloud and sun glint in conditions with rrc 443 0 20 rrc 555 0 22 rrc 660 0 20 the available images that used for fac calculation in further step is 5354 and 5321 for lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively table 1 the alternative floating algae index afai was calculated from the rrc data in one red and two nir bands qi et al 2018 1 afai r r c λ nir 1 r r c λ red r r c λ nir 2 r r c λ red λ nir 1 λ red λ nir 2 λ red where λred λnir1 and λnir2 are 660 745 and 865 nm respectively afai was designed following the concept of floating algae index fai hu 2009 to quantify cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu using modis hu et al 2010 to address the overestimation of floating bloom area using pure pixel assumption a logistic pixel unmixing method was used to derive the fractional floating algae cover fac of lake taihu and lake chaohu xue et al 2022a and the fac was modeled as a logistic regression model using afai as the input parameter 2 fac 100 1 e 5 0 73 6 afai where 100 represents the maximum value of bloom cover in a pixel the cyanobacterial density change dfac at a pixel was calculated as 3 dfac t f a c t 1 f a c t where t is the observing time of the given goci image and t 1 is the observing time of the next hour t ranges from 8 00 to 14 00 at local time utc 8 the integrated equivalent bloom area eba km2 is calculated as follows 4 eba i 1 n s fac i s s where fac i is the fac value of the pixel i ns is the number of valid pixels s is the spatial resolution in kilometers the images with cyanobacterial blooms occurred were chosen for further analysis based on the following rules 1 there are more than 6 available images within a given day and 2 the mean eba of the day is larger than 20 km2 the number of days that meets the above rules is 251 and 130 in lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively table 1 virtual stations with different fac values were set in the following analysis to show the hourly fac variations 2 3 horizontal and vertical movement of cyanobacterial blooms we proposed a method fig 2 to trace the horizontal movement of cyanobacterial bloom patches using their area location and centroid then the fac values at different times were fitted to derive the rising and sinking speeds of algae in each pixel the pixels with fac 30 were extracted first and the segments with lower than 20 consecutive pixels 1 25 km2 were removed one individual segment was regarded as an algal bloom patch the number of algal patches np the eba of each algal patch and the mean area of the algal patches m eq 5 were recorded 5 m i 1 n p eba i n p in conditions with severe floating blooms it is difficult to trace one algal patch as one algal patch may separate into two or more patches or maybe merge with other patches therefore we selected the conditions with only one algal patch in the lake as the target to calculate the daily mean horizontal velocity h m s from the centroid of the patch at different times 6 h i 1 n h 1 x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 t i 1 t i n h 1 where xi and yi are the location of the centroid at ti xi 1 and yi 1 are the locations of the centroid at ti 1 and nh is the number of available images of the day a previous study suggested that the variation in fac was mainly contributed by the vertical movement of phytoplankton in the water column when the wind speed was 3 m s li et al 2022 the vertical rising and sinking speed of each pixel was estimated based on the following assumptions 1 cyanobacterial colonies in the water column rise and sink vertically at the same speed 2 the algae is distributed vertically uniformly in the water column before and after floating bloom formation the diurnal dynamics of fac in each pixel showed three types including monotonously increasing type 1 increasing and then decreasing type 2 and uniformly decreasing type 3 fig 2 type 1 presents the rising of algae in the water column and the rising speed v m h was calculated through the fitted fac t curve in the conditions that significant quadratic polynomial regression can be derived 7 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t mint 1 fac x y t maxt 1 t maxt 1 t mint 1 where z x y is the water depth at a given pixel which is derived from the water level and digital elevation model dem of the lake tmint1 and tmaxt1 are the time that has minimum and maximum of fac x y t in type 1 respectively for type 3 the sinking velocity v m h can be derived following eq 8 as follows 8 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t mint 3 fac x y t max t 3 t mint 3 t maxt 3 where tmint3 and tmaxt3 are the time that has minimum and maximum of fac x y t in type 3 respectively type 2 presents both rising and sinking of algae in the water column the maximum value of fac facmax and its time tmaxt2 were first determined and the rising v m h and sinking speed v m h could then be calculated following eq 9 and eq 10 respectively 9 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t 1 fac x y t maxt 2 t m a x t 2 t 1 10 v x y z x y z x y fac x y t 2 fac x y t maxt 2 t 2 t maxt 2 where t1 and t2 are the start and end time of type 2 2 4 meteorological and hydrological data previous studies illustrated that the influence of tn and tp on floating algal blooms is minimal at the hourly scale huang et al 2015 qin et al 2019 and we assumed that the hourly dynamics of fac mainly results from the variations of meteorological conditions hourly values of irradiance data including global horizontal irradiance ghi diffuse horizontal irradiance dhi and direct normal irradiance dni from 2011 to 2020 in lake taihu and lake chaohu were downloaded from the national solar radiation database nsrdb sengupta et al 2018 according the selected fac images of lake taihu and lake chaohu the corresponding hourly values of ghi dhi dni were extracted and their daily mean values from 8 00 to 15 00 local time utc 8 were calculated the hourly wind speed win and air temperature tem from 2011 to 2020 in lake taihu and lake chaohu were downloaded from the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts era5 dataset era5 is the latest climate reanalysis produced by ecmwf providing hourly data on many atmospheric land surface and sea state parameters together with estimates of uncertainty similarly the hourly win and tem were used to analyze their relationship with fac values the daily mean win and tem from 8 00 to 15 00 the mean wind speed of 24 h prior to the image at this time win 1d and the mean wind speed of 12 h prior to the image at this time win 12 h were used to calculate their contribution in daily fac horizontal and vertical movement random forest regression rfr implemented in the scikit learn sklearn package for python was used to evaluate the influence of wind speed light and temperature on diurnal changes in fac and horizontal and vertical speed the feature importance of driving factors to fac h v and v were calculated through permutation feature importance breiman 2001 which reflects the contribution of each explanatory variable the feature importance is calculated by noticing the increase or decrease in error when we permute the values of a feature the dem data of lake taihu and lake chaohu with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the scientific data center of nanjing institute of geography limnology chinese academy of sciences http lake geodata cn and was resampled to 250 m daily water level data of the nearest hydrological stations from 2011 to 2020 were acquired from the local hydrology bureau in lake taihu and lake chaohu the water depth of each pixel m was derived by subtracting the average water level which was assumed to be the water level of the entire lake of the hydrological stations from the dem 3 results 3 1 diurnal dynamics of fac in lake taihu and lake chaohu diurnal changes in floating algal blooms were illustrated by rgb image fac and dfac in lake chaohu september 04 2018 and lake taihu september 18 2017 and december 18 2017 fig 3 they represent different diurnal types of eba the eba increased to a peak value at approximately 11 00 and then decreased on september 04 2018 in lake chaohu eba had a decreasing tendency on september 18 2017 and an overall increase on december 18 2017 in lake taihu however the eba also the sum of fac of the image integrated the spatial dynamics of fac within a day for example virtual station m1 in the southwest part of lake taihu had the highest fac at approximately 10 00 to 11 00 and the fac values of m3 in gh bay decreased from nearly 100 in the morning to approximately 25 at 13 00 and then increased to a high value on september 18 2017 fig 3b1 b4 algal blooms had obvious spatial variations with high values starting from the southwest part of lake taihu in the morning to the center part of lake taihu in the afternoon on december 18 2017 the mean and standard deviation values of fac in different regions of lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 4 showed that zs ml and gh had obviously lower mean fac values than those of ct wt and st in lake taihu and wch had the highest fac in lake chaohu the highest fac value in wt occurred at 9 00 and 10 00 in the morning and the highest mean fac in ct occurred at approximately 12 00 similarly wch had the highest fac mean value at 10 00 and ech had the highest fac later than that of wch and mch 3 2 horizontal movement of algal blooms the locations number and area of algal bloom patches extracted from all the goci data with blooms showed the hotspots and spatial distribution of cyanobacterial bloom patches in lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 5 it indicated that lake taihu had an overall higher number and area of bloom patches than lake chaohu large bloom patches usually occurred in the western and central parts of lake taihu and the western part of lake chaohu the maximum number and total area of bloom patches occurred at approximately 10 00 and the mean bloom area in the morning was higher than that in the afternoon in lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 5b c g h the number mean and total area of bloom patches in each region had similar trends with the highest values in ct of lake taihu and wch of lake chaohu fig 5d e i j however if the number and total area of bloom patches were divided by the area of each region the zs ml and wt in lake taihu and wch in lake chaohu had higher normalized counts and areas of bloom patches than other regions in addition images with only one algal bloom patch were selected and the horizontal velocity of the bloom patches were calculated to be 1 33 1 19 m s ranging from 0 16 to 3 53 m s n 10 in lake taihu and 1 14 0 99 m s ranging from 0 16 to 2 78 m s n 14 in lake chaohu 3 3 vertical migration of algae in the water column the spatial distribution of the rising v and sinking v velocities of lake taihu and lake chaohu showed that the vertical velocities both rising and sinking in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter fig 6 table 2 the derived mean rising speed is 0 90 0 30 m h in lake taihu and 0 76 0 35 m h in lake chaohu and the mean sinking speed is 0 87 0 33 m h in lake taihu and 0 68 0 38 m h in lake chaohu in summer higher rising and sinking velocity were observed in the central part of lake taihu and the eastern part of lake chaohu the main possible reason is that the ml and zs bays northwestern part of lake taihu and western part of lake chaohu usually had high fac values all day which did not follow the three types of fac significantly in a specific pixel this result indicated that more cases with vertical movement can be observed in waters with a moderate frequency of algal blooms the low rising and sinking velocity may also be related to the growing status of cyanobacteria in spring and winter statistics of the total vertical speed v rising speed and sinking speed of lake chaohu and lake taihu showed that the days with class 1 of eba had the highest mean total vertical speed 0 22 0 33 m h in lake chaohu 0 04 0 44 m h in lake taihu the days with class 2 of eba had the highest mean rising speed 0 83 0 33 m h in lake chaohu 1 00 0 32 m h in lake taihu and the days with class 3 of eba had the highest mean sinking speed 0 76 0 24 m h in lake chaohu 1 01 0 25 m h in lake taihu fig 7 3 4 contribution of meteorological data to migration of algal blooms fig 8 illustrates the relationship between fac and dni dhi ghi tem and win at different time it indicated that dni had a weak positive relationship with fac while dhi ghi and tem had significant positive relationships with fac at 8 00 for lake taihu and lake chaohu this is in accordance with the results that higher eba can be observed in the summer morning however win had a significant negative relationship with fac from 8 00 to 11 00 in lake taihu and lake chaohu which means high fac values usually corresponds to low wind speed random forest regression was used to calculate the contribution of win win 1d win 12 h tem dni dhi and ghi to v v h the maximum fac of the day facmax and the mean value of the day facmean in lake taihu and lake chaohu fig 9 for the facmean and facmax win and win 12 h contributed the most in both lake taihu and lake chaohu the influences of tem on facmean and facmax were smaller in lake taihu 13 6 13 5 than those in lake chaohu 15 4 15 7 win contributed 18 3 and 15 1 to h in lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively for vertical movement temperature and radiation have large contributions to rising and sinking speeds v is more related to dni and dhi in lake taihu and lake chaohu with contribution of 18 1 and 16 6 respectively which could explain the regulation of buoyancy on light variation fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and limitations of estimating horizontal and vertical movement using goci data the horizontal movement of algal bloom patches and vertical speed of algae in each pixel were estimated using goci satellite data in this study one advantage is that the mean horizontal velocity of cyanobacterial blooms within a day was first estimated from goci images with only one bloom patch some macroalgae such as sargassum wang et al 2018 and ulva qi et al 2016 son et al 2015 floating on the water surface are relatively easy to trace using satellite data however cyanobacteria form floating blooms or scums on the water surface under certain conditions and the number of algal bloom patches often changes or the scums even disappear rapidly with strong wind therefore it is difficult to calculate the horizontal velocities of floating scums of cyanobacteria from both field measurements and satellite data field measurements of the horizontal speed of floating bloom patches were conducted in zs bay of lake taihu and the speed was 0 01 0 327 m s with an average value of 0 094 0 061 m s in august 2012 with wind speed ranging from 1 1 to 3 1 m s deng et al 2016 the difference between the satellite and field measurements may lie on the method of the horizontal speed calculation the satellite derived horizontal velocity of the bloom patch in this study represented the mean horizontal movement of the whole day while the field measured speed was the instantaneous floating velocity of bloom patches the rising and sinking velocity in pixel scale was estimated using goci data which not only can be used to monitor the bloom formation but also can be used to evaluate the colony size and the living conditions of the cyanobacteria in a large scale vertical velocity as measured by goci satellite data in this study was lower than that measured in a laboratory setting for colony sizes of 64 100 μm 1 008 0 288 m h and higher for colony sizes of 20 64 μm 0 288 0 108 m h in lake taihu qin et al 2016 similarly a tank experiment showed that the floating velocities of large microcystis colonies ranged 0 15 0 46 m h depending on colony size and were 5 15 times higher than those of smaller colonies 0 03 m h wu et al 2020 the mean upward floating velocity of lake taihu in this study 0 90 0 30 m h 0 36 2 18 m h was higher than the results in the previous study derived from the goci data of the whole lake 0 288 0 792 m h li et al 2022 note that in areas with high mean values of fac such as the northwest part of lake taihu and the west part of lake chaohu the derived vertical migration speed is lower than that in other regions because they had lower variability in fac and did not follow the functions of fac significantly even though they had high fac values one assumption was that the vertical migration was not considered in calculating the horizontal speed and the horizontal shift was not considered in calculating the vertical speed note that cyanobacterial blooms were also observed from the goci images in conditions with mean wind speed 3 m s even though the mean bloom areas in conditions with high wind speed were obvious lower than the conditions with win 3 m s considering the possible combination of horizontal and vertical movement of algae the vertical speed was calculated in conditions with win 3 m s another assumption was that the algal particles and colonies moved vertically at the same speed and were distributed vertically uniformly in the water column before and after floating bloom formation indicating that the method is only suitable in shallow lakes in fact aggregated large colonies have greater buoyancy and higher rates of vertical migration to the surface than smaller colonies ranjbar et al 2021 in addition cyanobacteria may also aggregate at certain depths or even at the water bottom under certain environmental conditions field measurements have demonstrated that the subsurface maximum layer depth of chlorophyll a chla concentration often occurs in deep lakes and seas lou and hu 2014 in which case the above assumption is not valid and beyond the discussion of this study in addition the average hourly wind speed was used to calculate its influence on algal bloom movement note that the spatial variation in the wind field should be taken into consideration however the hourly wind speed had coarse spatial resolution only several pixels could be used in lake taihu and lake chaohu so we used the mean values of wind speed the higher spatial resolution of wind speed may provide more information in explaining the spatial variability of floating algal blooms 4 2 factors that influence the diurnal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms it has been demonstrated that low water turbulence high water temperatures and the buoyancy capacity of cyanobacteria play key roles in floating algal bloom formation aparicio medrano et al 2016 buoyancy regulation within a day is mainly affected by light intensity and colony size hayes et al 2020 li et al 2016 reynolds et al 1987 when the light intensity reaches its maximum value the cyanobacterial bloom density does not yet reach its maximum as there is timelag to compensate for buoyancy ndong et al 2017 in addition large colonies of cyanobacteria with diameter 300 400 μm have great buoyancy and rise much easier to the water surface than cells or small colonies wu et al 2019 smaller colonies are less resistant to turbulence and are more dispersed in the water column xue et al 2022b wind plays an important role in algal bloom formation blukacz et al 2009 paerl and otten 2013 verhagen 1994 and previous studies have demonstrated that the critical wind speeds for bloom scums vary with lakes depending on the lake area water depth duration time of wind wind fetch and so on deng et al 2016 huang et al 2015 for lake taihu several critical wind speeds have been used including 3 6 m s deng et al 2016 and 4 5 m s in zs bay chen et al 2023 based on field measurements an empirical relationship between the critical wind speed and the ratio between the square root of lake area and depth was built at different lakes huang et al 2014 and the results of lake taihu and lake chaohu are 3 41 and 3 67 m s respectively 2 75 m s was used to distinguish vertical uniform and gaussian distribution types of chla profiles in lake chaohu xue et al 2015 when the wind speed exceeds critical wind speed the total horizontal transport rate is reduced due to the strong mixing and reverse flow of the bottom layer in the water column subsequent gentle wind would cause more intensive horizontal accumulation of blooms in the downwind area than what happens under strong wind wang et al 2017 the concept of optimal wind speed was proposed in a recent study chen et al 2023 and it was defined as a certain wind speed maximizes the horizontal transport flux of microcystis through the cross section perpendicular to the wind direction in conditions with optical wind speed 2 1 m s in zs bay of lake taihu the wind made the thin surface water flow rapidly than the lower water column the horizontal transport rate is fast chen et al 2023 it has been demonstrated that the transport of phytoplankton with lake currents contributes only 1 2 to the total vertical movement in ml bay of lake taihu and the transport usually has different directions with the wind wu et al 2010 the euler lagrangian coupled model showed that the wind induced turbulence mixing velocity of colonies contributed 52 9 of bloom formations in lake taihu feng et al 2018 the maximum horizontal transport rate of microcystis 0 0384 m s in the downwind area was observed in zs bay of lake taihu chen et al 2023 which also contributes to the horizontal movement of blooms it is still challenging to distinguish the horizontal and vertical movement of cyanobacteria from satellite data especially in cases with wind speed around the optical wind speed we found a significant relationship between diffuse irradiance and fac in the morning which indicates that floating cyanobacterial blooms may also occur in conditions with thin cloud and suitable temperature however this could not be captured by optical satellites under the influence of clouds sar synthetic aperture radar images acquired from envisat asar advanced synthetic aperture radar or sentinel 1 have been used to monitor cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu wang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 however a recent study qi et al 2022 illustrated that sentinel 1 sar could not detect microalgae such as microcystis trichodesmium and noctiluca whether floating microalgae blooms in these lakes can be detected using sar should be further investigated 4 3 implication for monitoring and forecasting cyanobacterial blooms the occurrence extent and spatial distribution of cyanobacterial blooms are key parameters in the operational monitoring of lake environments the spatial temporal distribution of floating blooms in lake taihu and lake chaohu observed from multi sensors revealed that the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms increased obviously after 2010 xue et al 2022a large costs have been invested in lake restoration including pollution management and algae salvage for instance these activities have cost us 14 billion from 2007 to 2017 in lake taihu qin et al 2019 high frequency satellite data can also support the forecasting of algal blooms in lakes especially in waters near drinking water intakes fig 1 the vertical and horizontal movements of bloom patches near drinking water sources provide key information for the management of water quality and drinking water safety take the 4 water intakes in gh and 2 water intakes in ech as examples the mean fac and eba in gh and ech are lower than other regions fig 5 indicating the good water quality in this region however we found that the number of goci images with fac 50 in the drinking water intakes are 61 30 33 13 for t1 t4 and 33 11 for c1 c2 fig 11 among the 4 intakes in gh t1 is more affected by cyanobacterial blooms than other water intakes for the lake management hourly fac and estimated horizontal and vertical movement of blooms would be key parameters in forecasting the cyanobacterial blooms near the drinking water intakes fortunately goci ii has better performance with 250 m spatial resolution and measurements taken 10 times a day which can succeed the goci in providing better long term observations the combination of goci and goci ii data could provide a consecutive diurnal changes of floating blooms in the further study 5 conclusions the diurnal dynamics and migration of floating cyanobacterial blooms were evaluated and the horizontal shift of bloom patches and vertical migration speed of cyanobacteria were estimated from fac of goci images in lake taihu and lake chaohu china locations number and area of algal bloom patches showed that the western and central parts of lake taihu and the western part of lake chaohu had high mean values of fac and earlier occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom within a day the proposed method calculated the horizontal speed of bloom patches by selecting images with only one bloom patch and derived the rising and sinking speeds of cyanobacteria in the water column when the wind speed was lower than 3 m s the driving factors of variations in fac horizontal and vertical speed showed that dhi ghi and tem had significant positive relationships with fac in the morning win contributed 18 3 and 15 1 to the horizontal movement speed in lake taihu and lake chaohu respectively temperature and radiation have large contributions to rising and sinking speeds of cyanobacteria the rising speed was more related to dni and dhi in both lake taihu and lake chaohu monitoring the horizontal and vertical migration of floating algal blooms using geostationary satellite is helpful for understanding the diurnal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms and

14719,drinking water supply in rural areas remains a substantial challenge due to complex natural technical and economic conditions to provide safe and affordable drinking water to all as targeted in the un sustainable development goals 2030 agenda low cost efficient water treatment processes suitable for rural areas need to be developed in this study a bubbleless aeration bac termed abac process is proposed and evaluated involving the incorporation of a hollow fiber membrane hfm assembly within a slow rate bac filter to provide dissolved oxygen do throughout the bac filter and an increased dom removal efficiency the results showed that after a 210 day period of operation the abac increased the doc removal by 54 and decreased the disinfection byproduct formation potential dbpfp by 41 compared to a comparable bac filter without aeration termed nbac the elevated do 4 mg l not only reduced secreted extracellular polymer but also modified the microbial community with a stronger degradation ability the hfm based aeration showed comparable performance to 3 mg l pre ozonation and the doc removal efficiency was four times greater than that of a conventional coagulation process the proposed abac treatment with its various advantages e g high stability avoidance of chemicals ease of operation and maintenance is well suited to be integrated as a prefabricated device for decentralized drinking water systems in rural areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological activated carbon bac bubbleless aeration natural organic matter nom dbp formation rural drinking water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction providing adequate and safe drinking water is a service with immeasurable economic and health benefits unga 2001 investment in drinking water services has brought safely managed drinking water services to two billion people worldwide in the last two decades who 2023 despite this progress two billion people still do not have access to safe and reliable drinking water and poor drinking water systems remain a major challenge particularly in rural areas and small municipalities where drinking water is usually pumped directly from wells or obtained from natural water sources without adequate treatment bei et al 2019 wang et al 2021b due to complex natural technical and economic conditions e g terrain materials cost and labor issues large scale centralized drinking water supply systems used in large urban areas cannot be applied effectively to small scale communities in rural areas song et al 2020 interest in the use of slow biofiltration processes in rural drinking water supply projects has increased in recent years because of their relative simplicity low operating cost and easy maintenance song et al 2020 riverbank filtration for example accounts for 6 5 percent and 16 percent of the total amount of drinking water produced in the netherlands and germany respectively bertelkamp et al 2014 gillefalk et al 2018 slow sand filtration shares similar principles with riverbank filtration using sand or anthracite instead of an aquifer as the filter material bauer et al 2011 such engineered biofiltration is more versatile in practical applications however long residence times and low removal rates are the two major drawbacks of current biofiltration process for example a riverbank filtration process with a 36 hour residence time showed only 33 doc removal efficiency zhao et al 2022 shortening the residence time leads to inadequate biodegradation as demonstrated by a previous study which showed 11 doc removal for a sand filtration with a residence time of 45 min hallé et al 2009 since biodegradation is the primary mechanism for biofiltration increasing biomass and increasing biodegradation efficiency are two factors to enhance the performance of biological filtration granular activated carbon gac with its high porosity can provide large surface area for organics absorption and a substrate for growth of microbial biofilms biofiltration using gac as filter material has been widely applied to remove a variety of contaminants such as biodegradable and recalcitrant dissolved organic matter dom ammonia emerging micro pollutants flavor and odor compounds from water reungoat et al 2011 rattier et al 2012 jantarakasem et al 2020 rui et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 another limitation of slow biofiltration is the insufficient dissolved oxygen do within the fixed bed it has been reported that the progressive consumption of do resulted in anoxic conditions and a poor degradation efficiency in the middle and downstream regions of the bac process zheng et al 2010 chuang and mitch 2017 munz et al 2019 moreover chuang et al found that saturation of do in the influent did not prevent do deficiency in the middle of the bac filter chuang and mitch 2017 a laboratory scale river bank filtration test suggested that a more effective removal under aerobic conditions 9 13 as compared to anoxic conditions 6 10 baumgarten et al 2011 in order to elevate the do concentration some studies have adopted an up flow configuration to improve the oxygen availability lu et al 2013 rui et al 2020 other studies have treated the influent with ozone or pure oxygen prior to the bac process reungoat et al 2011 phungsai et al 2018 chang et al 2022 but aeration is energy intensive and the use of ozone significantly increases the operational cost more importantly aeration of the influent does not successfully address the problem of oxygen deficiency within the bac system chuang and mitch 2017 found that although pre ozonation increased the influent do concentrations close to saturation the do declined to 0 3 0 6 mg l upon bac treatment at 15 min empty bed contact time based on the above discussion a simple low cost approach to providing oxygen throughout the whole bac process is necessary for the sustainable application of the bac process in rural areas in this study bubbleless aeration was used to distributed pressurized air into the bac process by means of a hollow fiber membrane hfm module zhang et al 2022 compared to bubble aeration hfm based aeration has the advantage of uniform mass transfer low supply pressure and a low operational cost aybar et al 2014 hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the performance of bubbleless aeration bac termed abac and non aerated bac termed nbac on dom removal was comprehensively compared in this study in addition the effect of pre ozonation and hfm based aeration on improving bac performance was compared furthermore to further investigate the feasibility of abac for drinking water treatment water samples after abac and conventional coagulation were examined and the dbp formation potentials were evaluated the results of this study have demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of the abac system and advanced the potential application of this biofiltration process for drinking water treatment in rural areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and materials the lab scale bac filter was a circular plexiglass column diameter 50 mm height 450 mm packed with 480 g granular activated carbon coconut shell gac average particle size of 3 5 mm the packing bed had a height of 400 mm and an effective volume of 300 ml corresponding to a bed porosity of 0 38 a bubbleless aerated bac filter modified from our previous study mengjie liu 2023 was used to provide air throughout the bac system as shown in fig 1 a and 1b a polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane hfm diameter 1 1 mm module with 14 strips of hfm was installed in a u shape and each strip of hfm was separated from others by several pore plates incorporated in the column as shown in fig 1a and 1b high pressure air passed through the membrane pores emerging into the water flow in the form of tiny bubbles fig 1c the bac column with hfm modules was termed abac bubbleless aerated bac filter and an identical column without hfm modules was termed nbac non aerated bac filter both nbac and abac systems were designed to operate in parallel with the up flow either in circular re cycle or continuous single pass modes by changing the arrangement of pipe fittings connections and storage tank fig 1d the raw water in this study was sourced from a local natural surface water the jingmi

pretreated jm water treated by 3 mg l or 1 5 mg l ozone to compare the effectiveness of pre ozonation and hfm based aeration on dom removal ozone was generated from oxygen by an ozone generator krc

1 the difference in the effluent doc of the two systems nbac and abac gradually increased fig 2 a the doc removal efficiency of the nbac process deteriorated substantially after the five month operation decreasing from 53 4 to 38 2 in comparison the abac process outperformed the nbac in terms of a sustained stability exhibiting a consistent removal efficiency 55 and having a significantly lower effluent doc value than nbac fig 2b previous studies using sand as filter material for river bank filtration showed a doc removal of only 5 15 baumgarten et al 2011 bertelkamp et al 2014 by using gac as a partial or whole filter material the doc removal increased from 20 to 40 after 12 week operation xu et al 2021a according to the results summarized in fig 2c the dissolved oxygen do at the middle 200 mm below the water surface of abac was significantly higher than that of nbac abac 4 75 0 41 mg l nbac 1 34 0 21 mg l do has been recognized as an important electron acceptor in biological redox reactions and therefore can support the growth of heterotrophic bacteria along with the degradation of organic carbon benner et al 2013 previous studies have suggested that the progressive depletion of do within conventional bac filters led to anoxic conditions and poor degradation efficiency in the middle and downstream regions of the process zheng et al 2010 chuang and mitch 2017 the results of this study suggested hfm based aeration was effective in improving doc removal fig 2d demonstrated the difference between the fluorescent dom in raw water and bac effluents matching the parallel factor parafac analysis results with the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 identified three independent fluorescence components si figure s3 two protein like c1 dainard et al 2015 kida et al 2019 and c3 murphy et al 2006 retelletti brogi et al 2018 and one terrestrial humic like henderson et al 2009 amaral et al 2016 lu et al 2022 c2 abac showed a significant increase in the removal of both c1 and c2 components compared to nbac si figure s3 while the difference of c3 was not significant between the two effluents according to a previous study biopolymers were more preferably removed than humic substances by biofiltration zheng et al 2010 however our results demonstrated a 65 removal of humic like substances this might be ascribed to the addition of 20 mg l of humic acid in the feed water in the pre stabilization period si text s1 that favored the enrichment of ha degrading microorganisms from the perspective of molecular weight mw distribution both nbac and abac showed a high degree of removal of high mw substances mw 1000 da during the first six weeks but the removal of low mw fractions mw 1000 da by nbac was inferior to abac fig 2e and si figure s4 after 56 days the nbac process exhibited a clear regression in the removal of high mw substances in addition the dom removal by nbac was not stable in the long term operation as a new peak in the nbac effluent was observed at day 126 indicating that low mw organics could not be efficiently degraded in contrast the mw distribution pattern of the abac effluent showed little variability during the whole operation period further indicating the high efficiency and strong stability of the abac process 3 2 variation of dom properties along columns in order to investigate the change of dom during the bac processes water samples from different heights of the bac column i e 0 mm 100 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm from bottom to top were collected and subjected to eem uv vis and sec analysis according to the do profile along the bed depth fig 3 a the do in the nbac dropped rapidly to 1 43 0 20 mg l at the height of 100 mm as the flow moved upward from 300 mm to 400 mm the do value gradually increased as a consequence of atmospheric diffusion from the open top of the column in contrast the do concentration in the abac system was relatively uniform with height ensuring an aerobic environment throughout the system fig 3b showed the mw distribution of the dom at different heights and fig 3c quantified the integrated area of the four principal mw peaks it was noticed that p4 mw 300 1000 da increased at a bed height of 100 mm for both bac systems which was attributed to the degradation of high mw substances to low mw substances as the bed height increased the low mw substances gradually mineralized and thus p4 decreased another interesting finding was that at the anaerobic zone of the nbac system i e height 100 300 mm the degradation of high mw mw 1000 da was much less than abac specifically from height 100 mm to height 300 mm p1 p2 and p3 decreased by 38 24 and 26 respectively for nbac while p1 p2 and p3 decreased by 49 49 and 51 respectively for abac these results suggested that maintaining aerobic conditions favored the degradation of high mw substances uv vis and eem spectra also confirmed the benefit of high do on the removal of chromophore and fluorescent organic substances figs 3c 3d and s5 si in addition according to these results the dom content at the height of 300 mm for the abac process a300 sample was lower than the dom content at the height of 400 mm for the nbac process n400 sample indicating that shortening the hrt of the abac system to 6 h could still achieve a better dom removal performance than the nbac with a hrt of 8 h 3 3 characterization of bac particles after the 140 day operation phase 1 bac particles from the nbac and abac filters were taken out and characterized the sem results revealed apparent morphological differences between the carbon particles from the nbac and abac filters figs 4 a s6 and s7 si carbon particles from nbac were completely covered by biofilms with the bacteria being encased in a thick extracellular polymer substance eps in contrast individual bacteria can be easily distinguished on carbon particles from the abac system and most of the activated carbon surface was exposed in water making it conducive to adsorb organic matter for subsequent microbial degradation moreover eps has been reported to hinder extracellular electron transfer in biofilms wang et al 2021a and therefore the large amount of secreted protein and polysaccharide fig 4b decreased the degradation of dom by biological activities in addition to the structure of biofilm the differences in the microbial community composition were also responsible for the differences in dom removal unconstrained principal coordinate analyses pcoas of the bray curtis distance were performed to demonstrate the differences of microbial communities between abac and nbac the bray curtis distance was calculated from the normalized otu tables using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2022 it was suggested that abac and nbac had significant differences in microbial composition fig 4c abac and nbac samples were separated along the first pcoa axis that accounted for 59 65 of the total variance fig 4d suggested that abac and nbac shared 216 otu and their exclusive otus accounted for 56 and 52 of the total otus respectively at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in both bac systems accounting for 65 and 53 of the relative abundance in the nbac and abac filters respectively abac showed a significantly high abundance of nitrospirota and acidobacteriota fig 4e nitrospirota is an aerobic bacterium that reduces ammonia nitrogen and nitrite concentrations lautenschlager et al 2014 implying that enhanced do in abac filters can also favor nitrification processes in bac filters acidobacteriota are highly abundant in soils gonçalves and santana 2021 most members of this phylum are aerobes that prefer sugars as a source of carbon and energy and are capable of degrading complex carbohydrates kuramae and de assis costa 2019 lefse results lda 3 further revealed the differences between the two systems at the class level si figure s8 for instance alphaproteobacteria and gamaproteobacteria are two subcategories in the proteobacteria phylum the former are significantly enriched in abac have been reported to be competitive at low nutrient concentrations and can degrade complex organic compounds such as humic acid newton et al 2011 lu et al 2020 on the contrary nbac had more gamaproteobacteria the members of which have been reported to exhibit a fast growth rate especially in the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus šimek et al 2006 picrust2 analysis provided more information regarding the function of the two microbial communities the metabolic pathways account for more than 75 of the identified pathways at kegg level 1 for both systems for kegg level 2 abac showed a significantly higher proportion in the metabolism of xenobiotics and amino acid than nbac fig 4f which were in good agreement with the characterization described above and explain the higher removal efficiency in the abac system 3 4 comparison of bubbleless aeration and pre ozonation ozonation has been proposed as an effective pretreatment for the bac process in many research studies and applications lin et al 2001 sundaram et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that pre ozonation can improve the biodegradability of organic matter and thus enhance the dom removal efficiency by subsequent bac lin et al 2001 figs 5 a and s9 si showed doc residue by different concentrations of ozone and the dbpfp of treated samples ozone had a poor mineralization effect on natural organic matter with the doc removal of 17 at the highest concentration of 4 mg l si figure s9a an apparent reduction of high mw substances was observed but organic matter with mw 1000 showed little change as the ozone concentration increased from 1 to 4 mg l si figure s9b with respect to the dbpfp when the ozone 2 5 mg l si figure s9c the thmfp increased with ozone concentration which is consistent with previous studies showing a low concentration of ozone increased thm formation liu et al 2022b in consideration of the above results two concentrations were chosen i e 1 5 mg l and 3 mg l for the subsequent comparison of pre ozonation and bubbleless aeration after ozonation the do concentration of the raw water increased but only a high concentration of ozone treatment 3 mg l led to a significant increase of do for both nbac and abac systems fig 5b the doc of the nbac effluent showed 5 and 11 reductions by 1 5 mg l and 3 mg l pre ozonation respectively in comparison the abac without pre ozonation reached 20 reduction of doc and pre ozonation showed an insignificant further increase in doc removal therefore the results indicate that bubbleless aeration by increasing the do within the bac system enhanced its performance more effectively than pre ozonation despite the high reactivity of ozone with unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures von sonntag and von gunten 2012 phungsai et al 2019 the contents of chromophore and fluorescent organic substances in the abac effluent were still lower than the ozone nbac figs 5d 5e and s10 si compared to nbac alone the dbpfp decreased by 36 10 and 44 with bubbleless aeration 1 5 mg l pre ozonation and 3 mg l pre ozonation respectively figs 5f and s11 si however the application of 3 mg l ozone is likely to be expensive for drinking water treatment and the operation and maintenance of ozone generation equipment more sophisticated and demanding than the bubbleless aeration therefore abac is likely to be more suitable for rural drinking water treatment than an ozone bac process 3 5 comparison with coagulation coagulation is one of the most common drinking water treatment processes according to the results of a principal component analysis pca shown in fig 6 a the difference between raw water samples coagulated samples and bac effluents accounted for 63 23 of the total variance the nbac and abac samples are separated along the second principal axis with an explained variance of 20 11 in addition water samples after lab scale coagulation showed similar water qualities to tap water from the municipal water supply in terms of the doc eem components and mw distributions si figures s12 and s13 therefore water sample coagulated with 0 1 mm al3 was used as a comparison to test the performance of bac in drinking water treatment the doc removal efficiency of coagulation nbac and abac processes were 13 0 6 37 0 7 and 57 0 3 respectively fig 6b it is known that hydrolyzing metal based coagulation removes organic matter mainly by charge neutralization and sweep flocculation and organics with higher mw are easier to be removed for instance a previous study using high resolution mass spectra found that the molecular weight distribution of the coagulated water sample substantially skewed towards lower mw compared to raw water indicating that coagulation preferentially removed substances with higher mw liu et al 2022b coagulation showed a poor removal efficiency 20 of fluorescent substances while nbac and abac degraded 55 and 69 fluorescent substances respectively fig 6c organic substance with mw 3000 was preferentially removed by coagulation with a 38 removal efficiency figs 6d and 6e in comparison coagulation showed little removal of components with mw 3000 da where the removal was only 19 compared with 70 for nbac and 87 for abac the control of disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water has attracted great attention in recent decades liu et al 2022a lau et al 2023 here dbp formation potential dbpfp was measured by adding a specific amount of chlorine 3 times the doc value to the treated water samples and incubating them in the dark for 1 day or 3 days du et al 2022 it was found that after 1 day incubation the dbp concentrations in coagulated samples were close to the dbp concentrations in real tap water si figure s14 where the differences might be attributed to the additional treatment of the tap water e g filtration difference in disinfection reagents concentration and time for the 1 day incubation the dbpfp for coagulation nbac and abac were 176 7 6 7 μg l 73 7 7 7 μg l and 43 4 4 8 μg l respectively these represent a decrease of 30 3 71 3 and 83 2 compared to raw water respectively for the 3 day incubation the reductions were 31 3 56 5 and 70 3 for coagulation nbac and abac respectively figs 6f and 6g variations of the dbpfp with incubation time indicate dynamic changes of disinfection byproduct formation specific dbps are defined as the dbps formed per unit of doc and the corresponding results are shown in figs 6f and 6g for the 1 day incubation the sdbps formation for coagulated water was comparable to the raw water but were substantially lower than coagulated water for the bac effluents however for the 3 day incubation the differences in sdbps between coagulated water and the bac effluents were much less among the five eem components r3 fulvic acid like matter and r5 humic acid like matter were the major components i e accounting for the major portion of the dom and hence their intensity was significantly correlated with the sdbps for 1 day of incubation si figure s12 however after 3 days of incubation shaas were significantly correlated with all eem components suggesting that fluorescent organic matter is an important precursor of haas previous studies have also suggested that while aliphatic structures resulted in thm formation haas had more aromatic structures as their precursors liang and singer 2003 hua and reckhow 2007 zhang et al 2012 the relationships between the sdbps and the mw of dom were further examined and demonstrated in figs 6h s15 and s16 si for the 1 day incubation time both sthms and shaas showed significant correlation with low mw components mw 3000 da while for the 3 day incubation the sdbps were significantly correlated with high mw components mw 3000 da these results implied that organic matter reacts with chlorine to produce thms and haas in the order of low to high mw range with more time required for high mw organic matter to be attacked by chlorine to produce the selected dbps i e thms and haas for short incubation times e g flow transport in municipal pipelines the chlorinated intermediates generated from high mw organic fractions might be more harmful toxicologically significant than the regulated dbps jiang et al 2020 han et al 2021 therefore when discussing the removal of dbp precursors by drinking water treatment processes the experimental results may not necessarily reflect the actual situation in practice removing as much of the pool of organic substances as possible is a first principles approach to reducing dbp formation during the water treatment process in addition to this for a small scale decentralized drinking water treatment scheme with a short pipeline transport time the results here suggested bac effluents would have sdbps of less than half of coagulated water sdbps 4 discussion the first target under the un sustainable development goal sdg 6 target 6 1 is by 2030 achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all it was reported that a total of 466 7 billion yuan has been invested in rural water supply projects in china providing safe drinking water to 280 million rural residents and 84 of rural areas have access to tap water in the last decade nonetheless achieving the sdg target 6 1 remains a long way off and rural drinking water supply still faces many challenges due to economic topographical water resources and labor constraints small municipalities are often too far removed from political and industrial interests to afford complex multi stepped treatment systems scheili et al 2015 therefore decentralized and small scale water systems are an important component of rural water supply in the past most rural villages used self sustaining water sources such as wells cellars or small pond sources and used raw water directly without treatment substandard water supply and water quality are practical issues that need to be urgently addressed in the development of rural water supply projects slow sand filtration and riverbank filtration have the advantages of low operating cost and simple operation making them suitable for rural drinking water projects hu et al 2016 however the flow residence time is relatively long typically several to dozens of hours and the purifying efficiency is very low doc removal 30 rudolf von rohr et al 2014 ahmed and marhaba 2017 freitas et al 2022 granular activated carbon gac with its beneficial properties of high specific surface area well developed pore structure and excellent adsorption performance is also conducive to microbial attachment so as to form biofilms to degrade pollutants enhancement of the latter effect has led to the development of the biological activated carbon bac process which was first used for the treatment of municipal or industrial wastewater lin et al 2001 sauter et al 2023 in recent years the ozone bac process has been widely applied to enhance drinking water treatment to improve the water quality and decrease the precursors of disinfection byproducts dbps wan et al 2021 hou et al 2022 some studies have also proposed the combination of ozone bac with membrane filtration for wastewater reuse lau et al 2023 however the deficiency of dissolved oxygen within the bac bed limits the biological degradation in bac processes especially for slow rate bac processes in trying to ameliorate this the use of large scale aeration facilities or pre ozonation treatment is likely to significantly increase the operational and maintenance costs and reduce the sustainability and appropriateness of the treatment technology for rural drinking water projects in this study by incorporating a uniform array of hollow fiber membrane hfm filaments in a bac bed sufficient oxygen via pressurized air was provided throughout the whole bac system thus the doc removal rate was substantially increased from 37 0 7 and 57 0 3 the elevated do value in the abac filter enhanced the biodegradation of dom in two respects firstly the biofilm secreted less eps which has been reported to hinder extracellular electron transfer wang et al 2021 secondly the microbial community was shaped by the high level of do concentration in the abac and exhibited a significantly stronger microbial degradation ability from a practical point of view the bac process outperformed the conventional coagulation process in terms of both dom removal and dbp thms and haas control besides hfm based aeration showed a greater enhancement of the bac process compared to pre ozonation instead of oxygen that is used for ozone production air was used in hfm based aeration moreover the bubbleless aeration has the advantage of uniform mass transfer and low maintenance aybar et al 2014 hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 greatly saving the quantity of air required for aeration and the operation cost in addition to its high treatment efficiency as demonstrated the abac process can be combined with microfiltration or ultrafiltration and integrated into an all in one device to serve water supply areas of varying flow capacities the large size of the gac particles 3 5 mm ensures safe and reliable operation without backwash xu et al 2021b and the process is free of chemical addition and discharge our previous studies have shown that the abac can operate stably for more than 400 days without backwashing while the removal efficiency of nbac gradually deteriorated with the operation time liu et al 2023 such compact prefabricated drinking water treatment equipment is well suited to small scale water systems and avoids the need for frequent management low labor and maintenance costs therefore the proposed abac process is recommended as a superior drinking water treatment for rural areas 5 conclusion bubbleless in bed aeration provides uniform oxygen throughout the whole bac system and thus enhances dom removal compared to a conventional bac system the doc removal efficiency increased by 54 and the dbpfp decreased by 41 the high do 4 mg l in the abac process promoted the biodegradation of exogenous organic matter by decreasing the eps secretion and modifying the microbial community bubbleless aeration is more effective and practical and less costly for improving bac performance than applying pre ozonation especially for rural drinking water projects compared to conventional coagulation abac is a competitive process for small scale or decentralized drinking water

14719,drinking water supply in rural areas remains a substantial challenge due to complex natural technical and economic conditions to provide safe and affordable drinking water to all as targeted in the un sustainable development goals 2030 agenda low cost efficient water treatment processes suitable for rural areas need to be developed in this study a bubbleless aeration bac termed abac process is proposed and evaluated involving the incorporation of a hollow fiber membrane hfm assembly within a slow rate bac filter to provide dissolved oxygen do throughout the bac filter and an increased dom removal efficiency the results showed that after a 210 day period of operation the abac increased the doc removal by 54 and decreased the disinfection byproduct formation potential dbpfp by 41 compared to a comparable bac filter without aeration termed nbac the elevated do 4 mg l not only reduced secreted extracellular polymer but also modified the microbial community with a stronger degradation ability the hfm based aeration showed comparable performance to 3 mg l pre ozonation and the doc removal efficiency was four times greater than that of a conventional coagulation process

rural drinking water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction providing adequate and safe drinking water is a service with immeasurable economic and health benefits unga 2001 investment in drinking water services has brought safely managed drinking water services to two billion people worldwide in the last two decades who 2023 despite this progress two billion people still do not have access to safe and reliable drinking water and poor drinking water systems remain a major challenge particularly in rural areas and small municipalities where drinking water is usually pumped directly from wells or obtained from natural water sources without adequate treatment bei et al 2019 wang et al 2021b due to complex natural technical and economic conditions e g terrain materials cost and labor issues large scale centralized drinking water supply systems used in large urban areas cannot be applied effectively to small scale communities in rural areas song et al 2020 interest in the use of slow biofiltration processes in rural drinking water supply projects has increased in recent years because of their relative simplicity low operating cost and easy maintenance song et al 2020 riverbank filtration for example accounts for 6 5 percent and 16 percent of the total amount of drinking water produced in the netherlands and germany respectively bertelkamp et al 2014 gillefalk et al 2018 slow sand filtration shares similar principles with riverbank filtration using sand or anthracite instead of an aquifer as the filter material bauer et al 2011 such engineered biofiltration is more versatile in practical applications however long residence times and low removal rates are the two major drawbacks of current biofiltration process for example a riverbank filtration process with a 36 hour residence time showed only 33 doc removal efficiency zhao et al 2022 shortening the residence time leads to inadequate biodegradation as demonstrated by a previous study which showed 11 doc removal for a sand filtration with a residence time of 45 min hallé et al 2009 since biodegradation is the primary mechanism for biofiltration increasing biomass and increasing biodegradation efficiency are two factors to enhance the performance of biological filtration granular activated carbon gac with its high porosity can provide large surface area for organics absorption and a substrate for growth of microbial biofilms biofiltration using gac as filter material has been widely applied to remove a variety of contaminants such as biodegradable and recalcitrant dissolved organic matter dom ammonia emerging micro pollutants flavor and odor compounds from water reungoat et al 2011 rattier et al 2012 jantarakasem et al 2020 rui et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 another limitation of slow biofiltration is the insufficient dissolved oxygen do within the fixed bed it has been reported that the progressive consumption of do resulted in anoxic conditions and a poor degradation efficiency in the middle and downstream regions of the bac process zheng et al 2010 chuang and mitch 2017 munz et al 2019 moreover chuang et al found that saturation of do in the influent did not prevent do deficiency in the middle of the bac filter chuang and mitch 2017 a laboratory scale river bank filtration test suggested that a more effective removal under aerobic conditions 9 13 as compared to anoxic conditions 6 10 baumgarten et al 2011 in order to elevate the do concentration some studies have adopted an up flow configuration to improve the oxygen availability lu et al 2013 rui et al 2020 other studies have treated the influent with ozone or pure oxygen prior to the bac process reungoat et al 2011 phungsai et al 2018 chang et al 2022 but aeration is energy intensive and the use of ozone significantly increases the operational cost more importantly aeration of the influent does not successfully address the problem of oxygen deficiency within the bac system chuang and mitch 2017 found that although pre ozonation increased the influent do concentrations close to saturation the do declined to 0 3 0 6 mg l upon bac treatment at 15 min empty bed contact time based on the above discussion a simple low cost approach to providing oxygen throughout the whole bac process is necessary for the sustainable application of the bac process in rural areas in this study bubbleless aeration was used to distributed pressurized air into the bac process by means of a hollow fiber membrane hfm module zhang et al 2022 compared to bubble aeration hfm based aeration has the advantage of uniform mass transfer low supply pressure and a low operational cost aybar et al 2014 hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the performance of bubbleless aeration bac termed abac and non aerated bac termed nbac on dom removal was comprehensively compared in this study in addition the effect of pre ozonation and hfm based aeration on improving bac performance was compared furthermore to further investigate the feasibility of abac for drinking water treatment water samples after abac and conventional coagulation were examined and the dbp formation potentials were evaluated the results of this study have demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of the abac system and advanced the potential application of this biofiltration process for drinking water treatment in rural areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and materials the lab scale bac filter was a circular plexiglass column diameter 50 mm height 450 mm packed with 480 g granular activated carbon coconut shell gac average particle size of 3 5 mm the packing bed had a height of 400 mm and an effective volume of 300 ml corresponding to a bed porosity of 0 38 a bubbleless aerated bac filter modified from our previous study mengjie liu 2023 was used to provide air throughout the bac system as shown in fig 1 a and 1b a polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane hfm diameter 1 1 mm module with 14 strips of hfm was installed in a u shape and each strip of hfm was separated from others by several pore plates incorporated in the column as shown in fig 1a and 1b high pressure air passed through the membrane pores emerging into the water flow in the form of tiny bubbles fig 1c the bac column with hfm modules was termed abac bubbleless aerated bac filter and an identical column without hfm modules was termed nbac non aerated bac filter both nbac and abac systems were designed to operate in parallel with the up flow either in circular re cycle or continuous single pass modes by changing the arrangement of pipe fittings connections and storage tank fig 1d the raw water in this study was sourced from a local natural surface water the jingmi

inoculation and pre stabilization the two bac systems operated continuously at an hrt of 8 h bed approach velocity va 0 02 m h during the first 140 days phase 1 the performance of the two bac filters as well as conventional coagulation for dom removal was comprehensively compared and each bac system had three identical parallel columns in order to determine its repeatability the coagulation test

pretreated jm water treated by 3 mg l or 1 5 mg l ozone to compare the effectiveness of pre ozonation and hfm based aeration on dom removal ozone was generated from oxygen by an ozone generator krc

1 the difference in the effluent doc of the two systems nbac and abac gradually increased fig 2 a the doc removal efficiency of the nbac process deteriorated substantially after the five month operation decreasing from 53 4 to 38 2 in comparison the abac process outperformed the nbac in terms of a sustained stability exhibiting a consistent removal efficiency 55 and having a significantly lower effluent doc value than nbac fig 2b previous studies using sand as filter material for river bank filtration showed a doc removal of only 5 15 baumgarten et al 2011 bertelkamp et al 2014 by using gac as a partial or whole filter material the doc removal increased from 20 to 40 after 12 week operation xu et al 2021a according to the results summarized in fig 2c the dissolved oxygen do at the middle 200 mm below the water surface of abac was significantly higher than that of nbac abac 4 75 0 41 mg l nbac 1 34 0 21 mg l do has been recognized as an important electron acceptor in biological redox reactions and therefore can support the growth of heterotrophic bacteria along with the degradation of organic carbon benner et al 2013 previous studies have suggested that the progressive depletion of do within conventional bac filters led to anoxic conditions and poor degradation efficiency in the middle and downstream regions of the process zheng et al 2010 chuang and mitch 2017 the results of this study suggested hfm based aeration was effective in improving doc removal fig 2d demonstrated the difference between the fluorescent dom in raw water and bac effluents matching the parallel factor parafac analysis results with the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 identified three independent fluorescence components si figure s3 two protein like c1 dainard et al 2015 kida et al 2019 and c3 murphy et al 2006 retelletti brogi et al 2018 and one terrestrial humic like henderson et al 2009 amaral et al 2016 lu et al 2022 c2 abac showed a significant increase in the removal of both c1 and c2 components compared to nbac si figure s3 while the difference of c3 was not significant between the two effluents according to a previous study biopolymers were more preferably removed than humic substances by biofiltration zheng et al 2010 however our results demonstrated a 65 removal of humic like substances this might be ascribed to the addition of 20 mg l of humic acid in the feed water in the pre stabilization period si text s1 that favored the enrichment of ha degrading microorganisms from the perspective of molecular weight mw distribution both nbac and abac showed a high degree of removal of high mw substances mw 1000 da during the first six weeks but the removal of low mw fractions mw 1000 da by nbac was inferior to abac fig 2e and si figure s4 after 56 days the nbac process exhibited a clear regression in the removal of high mw substances in addition the dom removal by nbac was not stable in the long term operation as a new peak in the nbac effluent was observed at day 126 indicating that low mw organics could not be efficiently degraded in contrast the mw distribution pattern of the abac effluent showed little variability during the whole operation period further indicating the high efficiency and strong stability of the abac process 3 2 variation of dom properties along columns in order to investigate the change of dom during the bac processes water samples from different heights of the bac column i e 0 mm 100 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm from bottom to top were collected and subjected to eem uv vis and sec analysis according to the do profile along the bed depth fig 3 a the do in the nbac dropped rapidly to 1 43 0 20 mg l at the height of 100 mm as the flow moved upward from 300 mm to 400 mm the do value gradually increased as a consequence of atmospheric diffusion from the open top of the column in contrast the do concentration in the abac system was relatively uniform with height ensuring an aerobic environment throughout the system fig 3b showed the mw distribution of the dom at different heights and fig 3c quantified the integrated area of the four principal mw peaks it was noticed that p4 mw 300 1000 da increased at a bed height of 100 mm for both bac systems which was attributed to the degradation of high mw substances to low mw substances as the bed height increased the low mw substances gradually mineralized and thus p4 decreased another interesting finding was that at the anaerobic zone of the nbac system i e height 100 300 mm the degradation of high mw mw 1000 da was much less than abac specifically from height 100 mm to height 300 mm p1 p2 and p3 decreased by 38 24 and 26 respectively for nbac while p1 p2 and p3 decreased by 49 49 and 51 respectively for abac these results suggested that maintaining aerobic conditions favored the degradation of high mw substances uv vis and eem spectra also confirmed the benefit of high do on the removal of chromophore and fluorescent organic substances figs 3c 3d and s5 si in addition according to these results the dom content at the height of 300 mm for the abac process a300 sample was lower than the dom content at the height of 400 mm for the nbac process n400 sample indicating that shortening the hrt of the abac system to 6 h could still achieve a better dom removal performance than the nbac with a hrt of 8 h 3 3 characterization of bac particles after the 140 day operation phase 1 bac particles from the nbac and abac filters were taken out and characterized the sem results revealed apparent morphological differences between the carbon particles from the nbac and abac filters figs 4 a s6 and s7 si carbon particles from nbac were completely covered by biofilms with the bacteria being encased in a thick extracellular polymer substance eps in contrast individual bacteria can be easily distinguished on carbon particles from the abac system and most of the activated carbon surface was exposed in water making it conducive to adsorb organic matter for subsequent microbial degradation moreover eps has been reported to hinder extracellular electron transfer in biofilms wang et al 2021a and therefore the large amount of secreted protein and polysaccharide fig 4b decreased the degradation of dom by biological activities in addition to the structure of biofilm the differences in the microbial community composition were also responsible for the differences in dom removal unconstrained principal coordinate analyses pcoas of the bray curtis distance were performed to demonstrate the differences of microbial communities between abac and nbac the bray curtis distance was calculated from the normalized otu tables using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2022 it was suggested that abac and nbac had significant differences in microbial composition fig 4c abac and nbac samples were separated along the first pcoa axis that accounted for 59 65 of the total variance fig 4d suggested that abac and nbac shared 216 otu and their exclusive otus accounted for 56 and 52 of the total otus respectively at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in both bac systems accounting for 65 and 53 of the relative abundance in the nbac and abac filters respectively abac showed a significantly high abundance of nitrospirota and acidobacteriota fig 4e nitrospirota is an aerobic bacterium that reduces ammonia nitrogen and nitrite concentrations lautenschlager et al 2014 implying that enhanced do in abac filters can also favor nitrification processes in bac filters acidobacteriota are highly abundant in soils gonçalves and santana 2021 most members of this phylum are aerobes that prefer sugars as a source of carbon and energy and are capable of degrading complex carbohydrates kuramae and de assis costa 2019 lefse results lda 3 further revealed the differences between the two systems at the class level si figure s8 for instance alphaproteobacteria and gamaproteobacteria are two subcategories in the proteobacteria phylum the former are significantly enriched in abac have been reported to be competitive at low nutrient concentrations and can degrade complex organic compounds such as humic acid newton et al 2011 lu et al 2020 on the contrary nbac had more gamaproteobacteria the members of which have been reported to exhibit a fast growth rate especially in the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus šimek et al 2006 picrust2 analysis provided more information regarding the function of the two microbial communities the metabolic pathways account for more than 75 of the identified pathways at kegg level 1 for both systems for kegg level 2 abac showed a significantly higher proportion in the metabolism of xenobiotics and amino acid than nbac fig 4f which were in good agreement with the characterization described above and explain the higher removal efficiency in the abac system 3 4 comparison of bubbleless aeration and pre ozonation ozonation has been proposed as an effective pretreatment for the bac process in many research studies and applications lin et al 2001 sundaram et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that pre ozonation can improve the biodegradability of organic matter and thus enhance the dom removal efficiency by subsequent bac lin et al 2001 figs 5 a and s9 si showed doc residue by different concentrations of ozone and the dbpfp of treated samples ozone had a poor mineralization effect on natural organic matter with the doc removal of 17 at the highest concentration of 4 mg l si figure s9a an apparent reduction of high mw substances was observed but organic matter with mw 1000 showed little change as the ozone concentration increased from 1 to 4 mg l si figure s9b with respect to the dbpfp when the ozone 2 5 mg l si figure s9c the thmfp increased with ozone concentration which is consistent with previous studies showing a low concentration of ozone increased thm formation liu et al 2022b in consideration of the above results two concentrations were chosen i e 1 5 mg l and 3 mg l for the subsequent comparison of pre ozonation and bubbleless aeration after ozonation the do concentration of the raw water increased but only a high concentration of ozone treatment 3 mg l led to a significant increase of do for both nbac and abac systems fig 5b the doc of the nbac effluent showed 5 and 11 reductions by 1 5 mg l and 3 mg l pre ozonation respectively in comparison the abac without pre ozonation reached 20 reduction of doc and pre ozonation showed an insignificant further increase in doc removal therefore the results indicate that bubbleless aeration by increasing the do within the bac system enhanced its performance more effectively than pre ozonation despite the high reactivity of ozone with unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures von sonntag and von gunten 2012 phungsai et al 2019 the contents of chromophore and fluorescent organic substances in the abac effluent were still lower than the ozone nbac figs 5d 5e and s10 si compared to nbac alone the dbpfp decreased by 36 10 and 44 with bubbleless aeration 1 5 mg l pre ozonation and 3 mg l pre ozonation respectively figs 5f and s11 si however the application of 3 mg l ozone is likely to be expensive for drinking water treatment and the operation and maintenance of ozone generation equipment more sophisticated and demanding than the bubbleless aeration therefore abac is likely to be more suitable for rural drinking water treatment than an ozone bac process 3 5 comparison with coagulation coagulation is one of the most common drinking water treatment processes according to the results of a principal component analysis pca shown in fig 6 a the difference between raw water samples coagulated samples and bac effluents accounted for 63 23 of the total variance the nbac and abac samples are separated along the second principal axis with an explained variance of 20 11 in addition water samples after lab scale coagulation showed similar water qualities to tap water from the municipal water supply in terms of the doc eem components and mw distributions si figures s12 and s13 therefore water sample coagulated with 0 1 mm al3 was used as a comparison to test the performance of bac in drinking water treatment the doc removal efficiency of coagulation nbac and abac processes were 13 0 6 37 0 7 and 57 0 3 respectively fig 6b it is known that hydrolyzing metal based coagulation removes organic matter mainly by charge neutralization and sweep flocculation and organics with higher mw are easier to be removed for instance a previous study using high resolution mass spectra found that the molecular weight distribution of the coagulated water sample substantially skewed towards lower mw compared to raw water indicating that coagulation preferentially removed substances with higher mw liu et al 2022b coagulation showed a poor removal efficiency 20 of fluorescent substances while nbac and abac degraded 55 and 69 fluorescent substances respectively fig 6c organic substance with mw 3000 was preferentially removed by coagulation with a 38 removal efficiency figs 6d and 6e in comparison coagulation showed little removal of components with mw 3000 da where the removal was only 19 compared with 70 for nbac and 87 for abac the control of disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water has attracted great attention in recent decades liu et al 2022a lau et al 2023 here dbp formation potential dbpfp was measured by adding a specific amount of chlorine 3 times the doc value to the treated water samples and incubating them in the dark for 1 day or 3 days du et al 2022 it was found that after 1 day incubation the dbp concentrations in coagulated samples were close to the dbp concentrations in real tap water si figure s14 where the differences might be attributed to the additional treatment of the tap water e g filtration difference in disinfection reagents concentration and time for the 1 day incubation the dbpfp for coagulation nbac and abac were 176 7 6 7 μg l 73 7 7 7 μg l and 43 4 4 8 μg l respectively these represent a decrease of 30 3 71 3 and 83 2 compared to raw water respectively for the 3 day incubation the reductions were 31 3 56 5 and 70 3 for coagulation nbac and abac respectively figs 6f and 6g variations of the dbpfp with incubation time indicate dynamic changes of disinfection byproduct formation specific dbps are defined as the dbps formed per unit of doc and the corresponding results are shown in figs 6f and 6g for the 1 day incubation the sdbps formation for coagulated water was comparable to the raw water but were substantially lower than coagulated water for the bac effluents however for the 3 day incubation the differences in sdbps between coagulated water and the bac effluents were much less among the five eem components r3 fulvic acid like matter and r5 humic acid like matter were the major components i e accounting for the major portion of the dom and hence their intensity was significantly correlated with the sdbps for 1 day of incubation si figure s12 however after 3 days of incubation shaas were significantly correlated with all eem components suggesting that fluorescent organic matter is an important precursor of haas previous studies have also suggested that while aliphatic structures resulted in thm formation haas had more aromatic structures as their precursors liang and singer 2003 hua and reckhow 2007 zhang et al 2012 the relationships between the sdbps and the mw of dom were further examined and demonstrated in figs 6h s15 and s16 si for the 1 day incubation time both sthms and shaas showed significant correlation with low mw components mw 3000 da while for the 3 day incubation the sdbps were significantly correlated with high mw components mw 3000 da these results implied that organic matter reacts with chlorine to produce thms and haas in the order of low to high mw range with more time required for high mw organic matter to be attacked by chlorine to produce the selected dbps i e thms and haas for short incubation times e g flow transport in municipal pipelines the chlorinated intermediates generated from high mw organic fractions might be more harmful toxicologically significant than the regulated dbps jiang et al 2020 han et al 2021 therefore when discussing the removal of dbp precursors by drinking water treatment processes the experimental results may not necessarily reflect the actual situation in practice removing as much of the pool of organic substances as possible is a first principles approach to reducing dbp formation during the water treatment process in addition to this for a small scale decentralized drinking water treatment scheme with a short pipeline transport time the results here suggested bac effluents would have sdbps of less than half of coagulated water sdbps 4 discussion the first target under the un sustainable development goal sdg 6 target 6 1 is by 2030 achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all it was reported that a total of 466 7 billion yuan has been invested in rural water supply projects in china providing safe drinking water to 280 million rural residents and 84 of rural areas have access to tap water in the last decade nonetheless achieving the sdg target 6 1 remains a long way off and rural drinking water supply still faces many challenges due to economic topographical water resources and labor constraints small municipalities are often too far removed from political and industrial interests to afford complex multi stepped treatment systems scheili et al 2015 therefore decentralized and small scale water systems are an important component of rural water supply in the past most rural villages used self sustaining water sources such as wells cellars or small pond sources and used raw water directly without treatment substandard water supply and water quality are practical issues that need to be urgently addressed in the development of rural water supply projects slow sand filtration and riverbank filtration have the advantages of low operating cost and simple operation making them suitable for rural drinking water projects hu et al 2016 however the flow residence time is relatively long typically several to dozens of hours and the purifying efficiency is very low doc removal 30 rudolf von rohr et al 2014 ahmed and marhaba 2017 freitas et al 2022 granular activated carbon gac with its beneficial properties of high specific surface area well developed pore structure and excellent adsorption performance is also conducive to microbial attachment so as to form biofilms to degrade pollutants enhancement of the latter effect has led to the development of the biological activated carbon bac process which was first used for the treatment of municipal or industrial wastewater lin et al 2001 sauter et al 2023 in recent years the ozone bac process has been widely applied to enhance drinking water treatment to improve the water quality and decrease the precursors of disinfection byproducts dbps wan et al 2021 hou et al 2022 some studies have also proposed the combination of ozone bac with membrane filtration for wastewater reuse lau et al 2023 however the deficiency of dissolved oxygen within the bac bed limits the biological degradation in bac processes especially for slow rate bac processes in trying to ameliorate this the use of large scale aeration facilities or pre ozonation treatment is likely to significantly increase the operational and maintenance costs and reduce the sustainability and appropriateness of the treatment technology for rural drinking water projects in this study by incorporating a uniform array of hollow fiber membrane hfm filaments in a bac bed sufficient oxygen via pressurized air was provided throughout the whole bac system thus the doc removal rate was substantially increased from 37 0 7 and 57 0 3 the elevated do value in the abac filter enhanced the biodegradation of dom in two respects firstly the biofilm secreted less eps which has been reported to hinder extracellular electron transfer wang et al 2021 secondly the microbial community was shaped by the high level of do concentration in the abac and exhibited a significantly stronger microbial degradation ability from a practical point of view the bac process outperformed the conventional coagulation process in terms of both dom removal and dbp thms and haas control besides hfm based aeration showed a greater enhancement of the bac process compared to pre ozonation instead of oxygen that is used for ozone production air was used in hfm based aeration moreover the bubbleless aeration has the advantage of uniform mass transfer and low maintenance aybar et al 2014 hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 greatly saving the quantity of air required for aeration and the operation cost in addition to its high treatment efficiency as demonstrated the abac process can be combined with microfiltration or ultrafiltration and integrated into an all in one device to serve water supply areas of varying flow capacities the large size of the gac particles 3 5 mm ensures safe and reliable operation without backwash xu et al 2021b and the process is free of chemical addition and discharge our previous studies have shown that the abac can operate stably for more than 400 days without backwashing while the removal efficiency of nbac gradually deteriorated with the operation time liu et al 2023 such compact prefabricated drinking water treatment equipment is well suited to small scale water systems and avoids the need for frequent management low labor and maintenance costs therefore the proposed abac process is recommended as a superior drinking water treatment for rural areas 5 conclusion bubbleless in bed aeration provides uniform oxygen throughout the whole bac system and thus enhances dom removal compared to a conventional bac system the doc removal efficiency increased by 54 and the dbpfp decreased by 41 the high do 4 mg l in the abac process promoted the biodegradation of exogenous organic matter by decreasing the eps secretion and modifying the microbial community bubbleless aeration is more effective and practical and less costly for improving bac performance than applying pre ozonation especially for rural drinking water projects compared to conventional coagulation abac is a competitive process for small scale or decentralized drinking water
