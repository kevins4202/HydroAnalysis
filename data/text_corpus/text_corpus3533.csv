17665,pre chlorination i e dosing chlorine prior to granular activated carbon gac contactors was recently introduced as a promising method to reduce the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps however our understanding on the effect of natural organic matter nom and gac characteristics on pre chlorination efficiency is still elusive thus we have designed this systematic study to investigate the effects of gac characteristics i e surface area pore size and surface charge on the subsequent reduction of dbp formation using five well characterized adsorbents with three different nom under three initial br concentrations the results revealed that the adsorption of halogenated dbps precursors mostly occurs in the mesoporous region i e 2 nm pore size 50 nm of the adsorbents subsequently pre chlorination before treatment with hd3000 i e gac with the highest mesoporous surface area decreased the formation of dbps by 58 furthermore oxidation of gac increased the surface acidity and negatively impacted the adsorption of halogenated dbp precursors which suggests basic gacs as promising adsorbents when applying pre chlorination in addition experiments with different nom showed that pre chlorination was effective with higher aromatic nom i e high specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 however pre chlorination of nom with low suva254 has decreased the adsorption of some dbp precursors which resulted in increased formations of haloacetic acid haa and total organic halogen tox also experiments with effluent organic matter efom showed that pre chlorination did not increase the adsorption of dbp precursors in low suva254 wastewater effluents besides increasing initial br concentration increased the formation of brominated dbps br dbps and the adsorbed br dbp precursors

2016 recent studies have suggested that adding chlorine prior to gac contactors may reduce subsequent dbp formation jiang et al 2017 have reported on the effect of pre chlorination of a solution

an increased bed volume of water treated before the breakthrough of thm and haa and decreased formation of br dbps and tox then they examined the effects of initial br concentration and chlorine contact time on the effectiveness of pre chlorination and reported that pre chlorination could double the tox removal under tested experimental conditions jiang et al 2018 however a recent study by fischer et al 2019 has showed a decreased formation of thms while haaformation was not affected by the applying pre chloirnation the different observations in the current literature might be attributed to the limited number of studies as well as the variations in the tested gacs nom sources and experimental conditions herein we designed this systematic study to answer three key questions 1 what are the main characteristics of gac that affect the removal of dbps precursors after pre chlorination 2 is pre chlorination effective for different types of organic matters and 3 what is the effect of br concentration on the pre chlorination efficiency we addressed such limitations in the literature and targeted elucidating the adsorption mechanisms of halogenated organic matter by gacs by comparing the adsorption results to those of activated carbon fibers acfs which have well defined pore sizes and surface areas 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents reagent grade chemicals and standards were used in all experiments summary of used chemicals standards and adsorbents can be found in text s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 tested nom and experimental conditions three different nom isolates and two different efom were used in this study in order to see the effect of organic matter aromaticity on its adsorption with and without pre chlorination suwannee river nom sr was purchased from international humic substances society while two other nom isolates were previously extracted from raw and treated water rw and tw respectively of a water treatment plant in south carolina usa the detailed procedures for the extraction of these isolates have been reported elsewhere song et al 2009 two efom samples collected from different wastewater treatment plants in south carolina ww1 and ww2 sr and rw had a high suva254 values of 4 3 and 4 0 l mg m respectively i e an indication of nom in higher aromatic character while tw ww1 and ww2 had a lower suva254 value of 2 6 1 3 and 2 1 l mg m respectively which suggests more hydrophilic nature of this nom karanfil et al 2002 previous studies have reported positive correlations between suva254 and nom molecular size ateia et al 2017 hua et al 2015 suggesting that both sr and rw are likely to have higher molecular size relative to tw summary of characteristics of noms and efom solutions was presented at table 1 the doc concentrations of nom and efom solutions were adjusted to 2 mg l to compare the behavior of organic matter with different suva254 values at the same organic carbon levels during the experiments to prepare working solutions each nom isolate was dissolved in milli q water 18 mω cm millipore and efom solutions were filtered with pre washed 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone membrane filters the ph of nom efom solutions was adjusted to 7 5 with 10 mm phosphate buffer experiments were conducted at three different br concentrations in the absence of br 200 and 800 μg l by spiking br in nom solutions br concentration is between 10 and 3000 μg l in surface waters due to industrial activities sea intrusions and wastewater discharges magazinovic et al 2004 in this study 200 and 800 μg l br concentrations were selected to simulate pre chlorination and adsorption behavior under moderate and high levels of br to increase the formation of br dbps 2 3 activated carbons and their characterization f400 bituminous coal based gac calgon and hd3000 lignite based gac norit were selected for this study due to their wide applications at water treatment plants each carbon sample obtained from manufacturer was crushed and sieved to obtain samples of 200 325 mesh size average particle diameter 45 75 μm for further experiments acf10 and acf20l were based on phenol formaldehyde and were supplied by american kynol company the acf pore structures is more homogenous than gac which helps differentiate the effective pore sizes on the adsorption of nom in order to change the surface charge of the gac 1 g of hd3000 was oxidized in 100 ml of nitric acid 70 gr acs grade for 6 h on a magnetic stirrer then the oxidized carbon hd3000a was rinsed several times with distilled deionized water and ph of eluent was checked until all nitric acid is washed out from carbon pores all five adsorbents were characterized for their bet surface area pore size distribution and ph of point of zero charge phpzc and details of these methods have been reported elsewhere dastgheib et al 2004 table 2 shows the selected characteristics of activated carbons used in the experiments among all adsorbents hd3000 and hd3000a had the lowest bet surface areas i e 613 and 580 m2 g respectively followed by acf10 and f400 with comparable bet surface areas i e 844 and 832 m2 g respectively while acf20l had the largest bet surface area of 1426 m2 g although acf10 and acf20l both consists of micropores acf10 had mostly primary micro pores 1 nm and acf20l had mostly secondary micro pores 1 2 nm f400 is more microporous than hd3000 and hd3000a whose pore structure mostly consist of mesopores acf10 acf20l f400 had neutral to basic surface characteristics as indicated the phpzc values while hd3000 had slightly acidic characteristics after nitric acid activation hd3000 appeared to maintain relatively its pore distribution and total surface area but a significant decrease was observed on its surface acidity low phpzc 2 4 pre chlorination adsorption and chlorination experiments all experiments were conducted in 125 ml bottles in dark and under headspace free conditions at room temperature 21 1 c three steps followed to conduct pre chlorination experiments which are pre chlorination adsorption and final chlorination 2 4 1 pre chlorination in order to both minimize hocl dose and have a residual chlorine after 30 min 2 mg l hocl was selected as a pre chlorine dose doc and hocl was at 1 1 mass ratio after 30 min pre chlorination residual chlorine was measured with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method using a varian uv vis spectrophotometer at 515 nm wavelength then pre chlorinated samples were quenched with ascorbic acid 1 1 m ratio 2 4 2 adsorption after pre chlorination step 50 mg l gacs and acfs were separately added into pre chlorinated and non pre chlorinated bottles all bottles were put on a rotary tumbler for 24 h afterwards each bottle was filtered with pall supor 0 45 μm pore size membrane filters and samples were transferred into clean 125 ml bottles for final chlorination 2 4 3 final chlorination the formation of dbps from gac treated waters was performed under uniform formation conditions ufc that all tested waters will have the same residual hocl after 24h summers et al 1996 based on chlorine demand test of each water samples were chlorinated for 24 h residual 1 mg l free chlorine was quenched with ascorbic acid 1 1 m ratio to gain mechanistic understanding the formation of thm haa han and tox was measured and compared after each step detailed information for the analysis of dbp and tox and bromide substitution factor bsf calculation can be found in text s2 duplicated bottles were used for adsorption and dbp extraction experiments 3 results discussion 3 1 effect of gac characteristics on adsorption of dbps precursors in this study the effectiveness of each adsorbent was evaluated using two indicators first we quantified selected dbps i e thm haa and haloacetonitrile han at different steps of the experiments to examine the effects of different treatment scenarios on the removal of the selected dbp precursors second we measured the changes in chlorinated and brominated tox to better understand the effects of each treatment step on both known and unknown tox the formation of thm haa han and tox using sr nom is presented in fig 1 thm formation at ufc condition was 92 μg l and the thm speciation followed an order of dcbm dbcm tcm tbm fig s1a without pre chlorination no difference was observed between the formed thm of the untreated water and the treated waters with acf10 or acf20l apparently the pore sizes of both acf i e 2 nm were smaller than nom clusters that can range between 0 4 and 4 nm li et al 2003 shimizu et al 2018 on the other hand when pre chlorination was applied prior to adsorption ufc thm formation after adsorption decreased by 27 and 32 respectively for acf10 and acf20l fig 1a this suggests that pre chlorination resulted in enhanced adsorption of thm precursors in primary and secondary micropores of both acfs haa formation at ufc condition was 96 μg l and the speciation order was tcaa bdcaa bcaa dcaa dbcaa dbaa caa tbaa baa fig s1b and similar trends were also observed for haa formation pre chlorination prior to acf adsorption decreased subsequent haa ufc formation by 24 and 30 respectively fig 1b furthermore han formation decreased by 10 and 30 for acf10 and acf20l respectively fig 1c which suggests that han precursors adsorbed better in secondary micropores than only primary micropores moreover without pre chlorination acf20l decreased the tox formation by removing unknown portion of chlorinated tox and brominated tox however with pre chlorination known portion of chlorinated tox and brominated tox further decreased in general acf20l absorbed 6 20 more dbp precursors than the acf10 with pre chlorination fig 1d which was attributed to the secondary micropores 1 2 nm of acf20l which can adsorb bigger size molecules as compared acf10 which mainly consists of primary micropores 1 nm in terms of the behavior of gac f400 was able to remove some dbp precursors and thm haa and tox formation decreases were less than without pre chlorination however with pre chlorination the formation of thm haa and tox decreased by 40 45 fig 1 hd3000 has relatively smaller surface area than the other adsorbents yet it exhibited a considerable removal of dbp precursors up to 39 even without pre chlorination with pre chlorination it showed up to 58 decrease in thm haa han and tox formation fig 1 moreover in terms of the speciation highest decrease was observed for brominated thm haa and han than their chlorinated precursors with pre chlorination fig s1 nitric acid modified hd3000a showed lower reductions up to 36 in thm han and tox formation than hd3000 without pre chlorination this is mainly due to same charge on the carbon surface and nom molecules at the ph of the experiments karanfil et al 1999 sánchez polo et al 2007 on the other hand haa precursor removal was not affected by the surface charge change and remain relatively similar for both hd3000 and hd3000a fig 1b with pre chlorination similar to other adsorbents hd3000a performance is also improved but dbp formation decreased by up to 20 compared to hd3000 3 2 effect of nom characteristics on pre chlorination effectiveness since hd3000 showed a better performance than the other adsorbents in the previous experiments with sr nom it was selected for the following experiments to evaluate the effect of nom characteristics i e high suva254 vs low suva254 in the presence of 200 μg br l fig 2 shows the concentrations of thm haa han and tox after chlorination of the solutions containing sr rw and tw nom and fig s2 shows the speciation of all dbp classes at the same doc level sr nom showed higher thm haa and tox formation than rw and tw nom solutions which was attributed to its highest suva254 value while han formation was comparable for all three nom thm speciation was similar for sr and rw solutions as their suva254 values were similar 4 3 and 4 0 l mg m respectively ateia et al 2019 tw nom solution however formed more brominated species e g tbm which was attributed to more efficient bromination of low suva254 waters hua et al 2015 soyluoglu et al 2020 wang et al 2014 with pre chlorination thm formation decreased by additional 33 for both sr and rw solutions as compared to without pre chlorination while the pre chlorination on the tw did not result in additional reduction in thm similarly pre chlorination did not improve the adsorption of two efom fig s3a with the lower suva254 values tw nom ww1 and ww2 were likely consisting of lower molecular weight and more hydrophilic fractions and pre chlorination did not seem to make additional difference in their adsorption on the other hand haa formation showed different trend than thm formation sr nom showed up to 2 5 times higher haa formation than rw and tw solutions without pre chlorination haa formation decreased by 27 37 and 66 for sr rw and tw nom respectively fig 2b however pre chlorination further decreased haa formation only for sr nom but not for rw and tw nom solutions although there was a small difference in the total haa formation between with and without pre chlorination at rw nom the main difference was in the speciation of haas while without pre chlorination hd3000 reduced more the formation of chlorinated haa species by removing its precursors with pre chlorination this trend changed to more brominated species and less brominated haas formed e g tbaa fig s2b interestingly compared to without pre chlorination there was a 19 increase in the haa formation of tw nom with pre chlorination fig 2b and no additional improvement for ww1 and ww2 fig s3b it was reported that low molecular weight molecules have low adsorption affinity karanfil et al 1999 and this can be the reason on haa formation increase as pre chlorination breaks nom into smaller size then haa precursors become less absorbable while one study suggested that pre chlorination can help decrease haa formation jiang et al 2017 another reported no effect fischer et al 2019 the trends for the decrease in han formation were similar to those of thm formation without pre chlorination han formation decreased 17 for both sr and rw nom and 68 for tw nom fig 2c the formation of hans was higher for ww1 and ww2 than the noms because of the higher nitrogen content and without pre chlorination formation of hans decreased by 30 for ww1 and ww2 fig s3c on the other hand with pre chlorination han formation on sr and rw nom decreased by 30 but did not have an effect at tw nom similar to sr and rw noms pre chlorination improved the adsorption of han precursors and additional 15 decreased observed for both ww1 and ww2 fig s3c even though pre chlorination showed either no effect or little increase on dbps formation for low suva254 nom i e tw nom it is also critical to consider the effects on tox formation as it helps to see overall halogenated dbp precursor removals without pre chlorination the tox formation decrease was 39 and increased to 54 with pre chlorination for sr nom fig 2d similarly with pre chlorination tox formation decrease was 44 and increased to 57 at rw nom these additional 13 15 tox formation decrease mostly happened on unknown portion of chlorinated tox and brominated tox at sr and rw nom solutions fig s2d on the other hand with pre chlorination tox formation removal decreased from 84 to 63 at tw nom moreover while pre chlorination improves 15 tox removal on ww1 it did not show any effect on ww2 fig s3d these trends suggest that pre chlorination affects the adsorption of known and unknown halogenated dbp precursors differently on low and high suva254 organic matter as their characteristics are different 3 3 effect of br concentration on adsorption br concentration is an important factor when considering the formation and the speciation of dbps thus solutions of sr rw and tw nom were treated with four adsorbents under three different br concentrations in the absence of br 200 and 800 μg l fig 3 shows thm haa han and tox formation for rw nom solution with hd3000 treatment speciation of dbps for all nom solutions can be found in fig s4 fig s5 and fig s6 when br concentration was increased to 200 and 800 μg l thm speciation shifted from tcm to tbm on rw fig s4a sr and tw noms fig s5a fig s6a as the formation of thms increased the pre chlorination effect on the removal of thm precursors became more obvious at rw fig 3a and fig s4a and sr noms fig s5a but not at tw nom fig s6a the thm formation difference between without pre chlorination and with pre chlorination under 800 μg l br concentration increased to 19 21 and 1 for rw sr and tw nom solutions fig 3a fig s5a and fig s6a similar to thm speciation haa formation was shifted towards more brominated species i e tbaa as the br concentration increases in the absence of br pre chlorination did not showed effect and as the br concentration increases hd3000 adsorption decreased the formation of haas by 53 fig 3b and fig s4b as the br concentration increases more haa precursors removed at sr nom and the formation difference between without and with pre chlorination increased to 14 fig s5b however br concentration increases did not make a big difference at rw nom on the other hand under all three br concentrations formation of haas increased 10 20 at tw nom fig s6b while dcan was the only species in the absence of br the formation almost became only dban at 800 μg l br concentration for all nom solutions fig s4c fig s5c and fig s6c with pre chlorination han formation of rw nom and sr nom decreased additionally 22 and 27 respectively fig 3c and fig s5c and no additional decrease was observed for tw nom solution fig s6c tox formation removals increased by 5 10 with pre chlorination on rw nom figs 3d and 18 25 on sr nom solution fig s5d interestingly on tw nom solution in the absence of br tox formation was 20 higher with pre chlorination than without pre chlorination however as the br concentration increases both without and with pre chlorination tox formations became similar fig s6d figure s7 presents the comparison of bsf among thm di haa and tri haa at 200 μg l br concentration on sr rw and tw nom in general tw bsf values were higher than sr and rw nom which was attributed to its lower suva254 value as the hydrophobicity increases chlorine competes with bromine to react with aromatic moiety of the organic matter and forms more chlorinated dbps than brominated ones which cause to lower bsfs hua et al 2006 without pre chlorination only carbon adsorption increased the bsf values after treatment which can be attributed to higher br doc ratio since only doc was removed by carbon adsorption on the other hand with pre chlorination after the treatment the bsf values were less than without pre chlorination thm di haa and tri haa bsf values decreased additionally up to 13 21 and 42 respectively fig s7 interestingly tw nom bsf values decreased as well with pre chlorination although the formation of thms and haas were similar between without and with pre chlorination on tw nom this further supports that pre chlorination increases the adsorption of brominated dbps precursors furthermore we checked the bromate formation in all pre chlorinated samples and it was below the minimum reporting level 10 μg l which indicated that bsf reduction was not caused by bromate formation 3 4 correlation between gac surface area and dbp formation to examine the effect of pore size distribution thm haa tox and unknown tox u tox formation were plotted as a function of surface area for three different nom types fig 4 shows the mesoporous surface area vs dbp formation correlations for sr rw and tw nom with pre chlorination thm and haa correlation r2 values were higher than 0 79 and 0 63 respectively and sr nom correlations were the highest among the other two nom solutions fig 4a while all three nom showed good correlations with tox formations r2 0 76 the correlations with u tox were also high r2 0 69 which suggests not only the known portion of tox precursors was removed by mesoporous surface area but also unknown halogenated precursors were removed as well this indicates that with pre chlorination as the mesoporous surface area increases the adsorption of unknown dbp precursors also increases and pre chlorination not only improves regulated dbp precursor adsorption but also it improves unknown dbp precursor adsorption although we did not see an improvement with pre chlorination on tw nom the r2 was higher than 0 72 which suggests that most of the adsorption of dbp precursors occur on the mesoporous region even for lower suva254 nom solution moreover several correlations were also investigated e g with micropore or macropore surface area etc but the analyses did not result in any good correlations data not shown 4 conclusions this study showed that carbon porosity nom characteristics br concentration change the effectiveness of nom and efom adsorption by gac when pre chlorination was applied pre chlorination improved the adsorption of both chlorinated and brominated dbp precursors with tested acfs and gacs adsorption of halogenated dbp precursor did not increase with increasing surface area of adsorbents on the contrary hd3000 which has the lowest surface area adsorbed more halogenated dbp precursors than the all other adsorbents because of its high mesoporosity although all adsorbents removal performance was increased with pre chlorination gac with basic characteristic hd3000 adsorbs more halogenated dbp precursors than gac with an acidic characteristic hd3000a measured dbps and tox decreases showed that pre chlorination is more effective on organic matter with higher aromaticity furthermore pre chlorination decreased the adsorption of certain dbp precursors e g haas with low suva254 nom which suggest that as hydrophobicity increases the effectiveness of pre chlorination also increases formation of br dbps is increased by elevated br concentration and with pre chlorination the adsorbents removed more br dbps precursors than chlorinated ones which decreased bsf values although acf performance is also increased with pre chlorination correlation between dbp formation and surface area showed that the adsorption of halogenated dbp precursors occurs primarily on mesoporous region of the adsorbent results from this study suggest that water treatment plants with high br concentration in their raw water can control dbp formation by applying chlorine before the gac filters to this end choosing microporous to mesoporous gac types can further decrease the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the

three different nom isolates and two different efom were used in this study in order to see the effect of organic matter aromaticity on its adsorption with and without pre chlorination suwannee river

spiking br in nom solutions br concentration is between 10 and 3000 μg l in surface waters due to industrial activities sea intrusions and wastewater discharges magazinovic et al 2004 in this study 200 and 800 μg l br concentrations were selected to simulate pre chlorination and adsorption behavior under moderate and high levels of br to increase the formation of br dbps 2 3 activated carbons and their characterization f400 bituminous coal based gac calgon and hd3000 lignite based gac norit were selected for this study due to their wide applications at water treatment plants each carbon sample obtained from manufacturer was crushed and sieved to obtain samples of 200 325 mesh size average particle diameter 45 75 μm for further experiments acf10 and acf20l were based on phenol formaldehyde and were supplied by american kynol company the acf pore structures is more homogenous than gac which helps differentiate the effective pore sizes on the adsorption of nom in order to change the surface charge of the gac 1 g of hd3000 was oxidized in 100 ml of nitric acid 70 gr acs grade for 6 h on a magnetic stirrer then the oxidized carbon hd3000a was rinsed several times with distilled deionized water and ph of eluent was checked until all nitric acid is washed out from carbon pores all five adsorbents were characterized for their bet surface area pore size distribution and ph of point of zero charge phpzc and details of these methods have been reported elsewhere dastgheib et al 2004 table 2 shows the selected characteristics of activated carbons used in the experiments among all adsorbents hd3000 and hd3000a had the lowest bet surface areas i e 613 and 580 m2 g respectively followed by acf10 and f400 with comparable bet surface areas i e 844 and 832 m2 g respectively while acf20l had the largest bet surface area of 1426 m2 g although acf10 and acf20l both consists of micropores acf10 had mostly primary micro pores 1 nm and acf20l had mostly secondary micro pores 1 2 nm f400 is more microporous than hd3000 and hd3000a whose pore structure mostly consist of mesopores acf10 acf20l f400 had neutral to basic surface characteristics as indicated the phpzc values while hd3000 had slightly acidic characteristics after nitric acid activation hd3000 appeared to maintain relatively its pore distribution and total surface area but a significant decrease was observed on its surface acidity low phpzc 2 4 pre chlorination adsorption and chlorination experiments all experiments were conducted in 125 ml bottles in dark and under headspace free conditions at room temperature 21 1 c three steps followed to conduct pre chlorination experiments which are pre chlorination adsorption and final chlorination 2 4 1 pre chlorination in order to both minimize hocl dose and have a residual chlorine after 30 min 2 mg l hocl was selected as a pre chlorine dose doc and hocl was at 1 1 mass ratio after 30 min pre chlorination residual chlorine was measured with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method using a varian uv vis spectrophotometer at 515 nm wavelength then pre chlorinated samples were quenched with ascorbic acid 1 1 m ratio 2 4 2 adsorption after pre chlorination step 50 mg l gacs and acfs were separately added into pre chlorinated and non pre chlorinated bottles all bottles were put on a rotary tumbler for 24 h afterwards each bottle was filtered with pall supor 0 45 μm pore size membrane filters and samples were transferred into clean 125 ml bottles for final chlorination 2 4 3 final chlorination the formation of dbps from gac treated waters was performed under uniform formation conditions ufc that all tested waters will have the same residual hocl after 24h summers et al 1996 based on chlorine demand test of each water samples were chlorinated for 24 h residual 1 mg l free chlorine was quenched with ascorbic acid 1 1 m ratio to gain mechanistic understanding the formation of thm haa han and tox was measured and compared after each step detailed information for the analysis of dbp and tox and bromide substitution factor bsf calculation can be found in text s2 duplicated bottles were used for adsorption and dbp extraction experiments 3 results discussion 3 1 effect of gac characteristics on adsorption of dbps precursors in this study the effectiveness of each adsorbent was evaluated using two indicators first we quantified selected dbps i e thm haa and haloacetonitrile han at different steps of the experiments to examine the effects of different treatment scenarios on the removal of the selected dbp precursors second we measured the changes in chlorinated and brominated tox to better understand the effects of each treatment step on both known and unknown tox the formation of thm haa han and tox using sr nom is presented in fig 1 thm formation at ufc condition was 92 μg l and the thm speciation followed an order of dcbm dbcm tcm tbm fig s1a without pre chlorination no difference was observed between the formed thm of the untreated water and the treated waters with acf10 or acf20l apparently the pore sizes of both acf i e 2 nm were smaller than nom clusters that can range between 0 4 and 4 nm li et al 2003 shimizu et al 2018 on the other hand when pre chlorination was applied prior to adsorption ufc thm formation after adsorption decreased by 27 and 32 respectively for acf10 and acf20l fig 1a this suggests that pre chlorination resulted in enhanced adsorption of thm precursors in primary and secondary micropores of both acfs haa formation at ufc condition was 96 μg l and the speciation order was tcaa bdcaa bcaa dcaa dbcaa dbaa caa tbaa baa fig s1b and similar trends were also observed for haa formation pre chlorination prior to acf adsorption decreased subsequent haa ufc formation by 24 and 30 respectively fig 1b furthermore han formation decreased by 10 and 30 for acf10 and acf20l respectively fig 1c which suggests that han precursors adsorbed better in secondary micropores than only primary micropores moreover without pre chlorination acf20l decreased the tox formation by removing unknown portion of chlorinated tox and brominated tox however with pre chlorination known portion of chlorinated tox and brominated tox further decreased in general acf20l absorbed 6 20 more dbp precursors than the acf10 with pre chlorination fig 1d which was attributed to the secondary micropores 1 2 nm of acf20l which can adsorb bigger size molecules as compared acf10 which mainly consists of primary micropores 1 nm in terms of the behavior of gac f400 was able to remove some dbp precursors and thm haa and tox formation decreases were less than without pre chlorination however with pre chlorination the formation of thm haa and tox decreased by 40 45 fig 1 hd3000 has relatively smaller surface area than the other adsorbents yet it exhibited a considerable removal of dbp precursors up to 39 even without pre chlorination with pre chlorination it showed up to 58 decrease in thm haa han and tox formation fig 1 moreover in terms of the speciation highest decrease was observed for brominated thm haa and han than their chlorinated precursors with pre chlorination fig s1 nitric acid modified hd3000a showed lower reductions up to 36 in thm han and tox formation than hd3000 without pre chlorination this is mainly due to same charge on the carbon surface and nom molecules at the ph of the experiments karanfil et al 1999 sánchez polo et al 2007 on the other hand haa precursor removal was not affected by the surface charge change and remain relatively similar for both hd3000 and hd3000a fig 1b with pre chlorination similar to other adsorbents hd3000a performance is also improved but dbp formation decreased by up to 20 compared to hd3000 3 2 effect of nom characteristics on pre chlorination effectiveness since hd3000 showed a better performance than the other adsorbents in the previous experiments with sr nom it was selected for the following experiments to evaluate the effect of nom characteristics i e high suva254 vs low suva254 in the presence of 200 μg br l fig 2 shows the concentrations of thm haa han and tox after chlorination of the solutions containing sr rw and tw nom and fig s2 shows the speciation of all dbp classes at the same doc level sr nom showed higher thm haa and tox formation than rw and tw nom solutions which was attributed to its highest suva254 value while han formation was comparable for all three nom thm speciation was similar for sr and rw solutions as their suva254 values were similar 4 3 and 4 0 l mg m respectively ateia et al 2019 tw nom solution however formed more brominated species e g tbm which was attributed to more efficient bromination of low suva254 waters hua et al 2015 soyluoglu et al 2020 wang et al 2014 with pre chlorination thm formation decreased by additional 33 for both sr and rw solutions as compared to without pre chlorination while the pre chlorination on the tw did not result in additional reduction in thm similarly pre chlorination did not improve the adsorption of two efom fig s3a with the lower suva254 values tw nom ww1 and ww2 were likely consisting of lower molecular weight and more hydrophilic fractions and pre chlorination did not seem to make additional difference in their adsorption on the other hand haa formation showed different trend than thm formation sr nom showed up to 2 5 times higher haa formation than rw and tw solutions without pre chlorination haa formation decreased by 27 37 and 66 for sr rw and tw nom respectively fig 2b however pre chlorination further decreased haa formation only for sr nom but not for rw and tw nom solutions although there was a small difference in the total haa formation between with and without pre chlorination at rw nom the main difference was in the speciation of haas while without pre chlorination hd3000 reduced more the formation of chlorinated haa species by removing its precursors with pre chlorination this trend changed to more brominated species and less brominated haas formed e g tbaa fig s2b interestingly compared to without pre chlorination there was a 19 increase in the haa formation of tw nom with pre chlorination fig 2b and no additional improvement for ww1 and ww2 fig s3b it was reported that low molecular weight molecules have low adsorption affinity karanfil et al 1999 and this can be the reason on haa formation increase as pre chlorination breaks nom into smaller size then haa precursors become less absorbable while one study suggested that pre chlorination can help decrease haa formation jiang et al 2017 another reported no effect fischer et al 2019 the trends for the decrease in han formation were similar to those of thm formation without pre chlorination han formation decreased 17 for both sr and rw nom and 68 for tw nom fig 2c the formation of hans was higher for ww1 and ww2 than the noms because of the higher nitrogen content and without pre chlorination formation of hans decreased by 30 for ww1 and ww2 fig s3c on the other hand with pre chlorination han formation on sr and rw nom decreased by 30 but did not have an effect at tw nom similar to sr and rw noms pre chlorination improved the adsorption of han precursors and additional 15 decreased observed for both ww1 and ww2 fig s3c even though pre chlorination showed either no effect or little increase on dbps formation for low suva254 nom i e tw nom it is also critical to consider the effects on tox formation as it helps to see overall halogenated dbp precursor removals without pre chlorination the tox formation decrease was 39 and increased to 54 with pre chlorination for sr nom fig 2d similarly with pre chlorination tox formation decrease was 44 and increased to 57 at rw nom these additional 13 15 tox formation decrease mostly happened on unknown portion of chlorinated tox and brominated tox at sr and rw nom solutions fig s2d on the other hand with pre chlorination tox formation removal decreased from 84 to 63 at tw nom moreover while pre chlorination improves 15 tox removal on ww1 it did not show any effect on ww2 fig s3d these trends suggest that pre chlorination affects the adsorption of known and unknown halogenated dbp precursors differently on low and high suva254 organic matter as their characteristics are different 3 3 effect of br concentration on adsorption br concentration is an important factor when considering the formation and the speciation of dbps thus solutions of sr rw and tw nom were treated with four adsorbents under three different br concentrations in the absence of br 200 and 800 μg l fig 3 shows thm haa han and tox formation for rw nom solution with hd3000 treatment speciation of dbps for all nom solutions can be found in fig s4 fig s5 and fig s6 when br concentration was increased to 200 and 800 μg l thm speciation shifted from tcm to tbm on rw fig s4a sr and tw noms fig s5a fig s6a as the formation of thms increased the pre chlorination effect on the removal of thm precursors became more obvious at rw fig 3a and fig s4a and sr noms fig s5a but not at tw nom fig s6a the thm formation difference between without pre chlorination and with pre chlorination under 800 μg l br concentration increased to 19 21 and 1 for rw sr and tw nom solutions fig 3a fig s5a and fig s6a similar to thm speciation haa formation was shifted towards more brominated species i e tbaa as the br concentration increases in the absence of br pre chlorination did not showed effect and as the br concentration increases hd3000 adsorption decreased the formation of haas by 53 fig 3b and fig s4b as the br concentration increases more haa precursors removed at sr nom and the formation difference between without and with pre chlorination increased to 14 fig s5b however br concentration increases did not make a big difference at rw nom on the other hand under all three br concentrations formation of haas increased 10 20 at tw nom fig s6b while dcan was the only species in the absence of br the formation almost became only dban at 800 μg l br concentration for all nom solutions fig s4c fig s5c and fig s6c with pre chlorination han formation of rw nom and sr nom decreased additionally 22 and 27 respectively fig 3c and fig s5c and no additional decrease was observed for tw nom solution fig s6c tox formation removals increased by 5 10 with pre chlorination on rw nom figs 3d and 18 25 on sr nom solution fig s5d interestingly on tw nom solution in the absence of br tox formation was 20 higher with pre chlorination than without pre chlorination however as the br concentration increases both without and with pre chlorination tox formations became similar fig s6d figure s7 presents the comparison of bsf among thm di haa and tri haa at 200 μg l br concentration on sr rw and tw nom in general tw bsf values were higher than sr and rw nom which was attributed to its lower suva254 value as the hydrophobicity increases chlorine competes with bromine to react with aromatic moiety of the organic matter and forms more chlorinated dbps than brominated ones which cause to lower bsfs hua et al 2006 without pre chlorination only carbon adsorption increased the bsf values after treatment which can be attributed to higher br doc ratio since only doc was removed by carbon adsorption on the other hand with pre chlorination after the treatment the bsf values were less than without pre chlorination thm di haa and tri haa bsf values decreased additionally up to 13 21 and 42 respectively fig s7 interestingly tw nom bsf values decreased as well with pre chlorination although the formation of thms and haas were similar between without and with pre chlorination on tw nom this further supports that pre chlorination increases the adsorption of brominated dbps precursors furthermore we checked the bromate formation in all pre chlorinated samples and it was below the minimum reporting level 10 μg l which indicated that bsf reduction was not caused by bromate formation 3 4 correlation between gac surface area and dbp formation to examine the effect of pore size distribution thm haa tox and unknown tox u tox formation were plotted as a function of surface area for three different nom types fig 4 shows the mesoporous surface area vs dbp formation correlations for sr rw and tw nom with pre chlorination thm and haa correlation r2 values were higher than 0 79 and 0 63 respectively and sr nom correlations were the highest among the other two nom solutions fig 4a while all three nom showed good correlations with tox formations r2 0 76 the correlations with u tox were also high r2 0 69 which suggests not only the known portion of tox precursors was removed by mesoporous surface area but also unknown halogenated precursors were removed as well this indicates that with pre chlorination as the mesoporous surface area increases the adsorption of unknown dbp precursors also increases and pre chlorination not only improves regulated dbp precursor adsorption but also it improves unknown dbp precursor adsorption although we did not see an improvement with pre chlorination on tw nom the r2 was higher than 0 72 which suggests that most of the adsorption of dbp precursors occur on the mesoporous region even for lower suva254 nom solution moreover several correlations were also investigated e g with micropore or macropore surface area etc but the analyses did not result in any good correlations data not shown 4 conclusions this study showed that carbon porosity nom characteristics br concentration change the effectiveness of nom and efom adsorption by gac when pre chlorination was applied pre chlorination improved the adsorption of both chlorinated and brominated dbp precursors with tested acfs and gacs adsorption of halogenated dbp precursor did not increase with increasing surface area of adsorbents on the contrary hd3000 which has the lowest surface area adsorbed more halogenated dbp precursors than the all other adsorbents because of its high mesoporosity although all adsorbents removal performance was increased with pre chlorination gac with basic characteristic hd3000 adsorbs more halogenated dbp precursors than gac with an acidic characteristic hd3000a measured dbps and tox decreases showed that pre chlorination is more effective on organic matter with higher aromaticity furthermore pre chlorination decreased the adsorption of certain dbp precursors e g haas with low suva254 nom which suggest that as hydrophobicity increases the effectiveness of pre chlorination also increases formation of br dbps is increased by elevated br concentration and with pre chlorination the adsorbents removed more br dbps precursors than chlorinated ones which decreased bsf values although acf performance is also increased with pre chlorination correlation between dbp formation and surface area showed that the adsorption of halogenated dbp precursors occurs primarily on mesoporous region of the adsorbent results from this study suggest that water treatment plants with high br concentration in their raw water can control dbp formation by applying chlorine before the gac filters to this end choosing microporous to mesoporous gac types can further decrease the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the

17666,there is growing pressure for wastewater treatment plants to mitigate the discharge of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and extracellular resistance genes eargs which requires technological innovation here hierarchical bi2o2co3 microspheres were wrapped with nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide nrgo for enhanced inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli ndm 1 and degradation of the plasmid encoded arg bla ndm 1 in secondary effluent the nrgo shell enhanced reactive oxygen species ros generation oh and h2o2 by about three fold which was ascribed to broadened light absorption region red shifted up to 459 nm and decreased electron transfer time from 55 3 to 19 8 ns wrapping enhanced e coli adsorption near photocatalytic sites to minimize ros scavenging by background constituents which contributed to the nrgo wrapped microspheres significantly outperforming commercial tio2 photocatalyst ros scavenger tests indicated that wrapping also changed the primary inactivation pathway with photogenerated electron holes and surface attached hydroxyl radicals becoming the predominant oxidizing species with wrapped microspheres versus free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 for bare microspheres formation of resistance plasmid composited microsphere complexes primary due to the π π stacking and hydrogen bonding between the shell and nucleotides also minimized ros scavenging and kept free plasmid concentrations below 102 copies ml as proof of concept this work offers promising insight into the utilization of nrgo wrapped microspheres for mitigating antibiotic resistance propagation in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords trap and zap nitrogen doped graphene surface reactive species antibiotic resistance 1 introduction the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb poses a growing threat to public health davies and davies 2010 o neill 2016 underscoring the need to consider the occurrence and fate of arb in water infrastructure some wastewater treatment plants wwtps may serve as breeding grounds and point sources for arb and extracellular antibiotic resistance genes eargs that contribute to the environmental resistome ju et al 2016 luo et al 2014 furthermore conventional secondary effluent disinfection approaches e g chlorination and ultraviolet uv radiation exhibit relatively low efficiency to mitigate the discharge of arb and eargs he et al 2019 lorenz and wackernagel 1994 luo et al 2011 and residual disinfectants may enhance arg horizontal transfer contributing to resistance propagation dotson et al 2010 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 thus there is a critical need for technological innovation to develop robust and sustainable approaches to mitigate antibiotic resistance dissemination through efficient arb inactivation and associated eargs degradation photocatalysis has received significant attention as a potential eco friendly disinfection process for eliminating waterborne microbial contaminants including arb giannakis et al 2018 pelaez et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a the process involves production of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide o2 as well as electron

2015 three dimensional 3d hierarchical microspheres composed of 2d photoactive nanosheets exhibit high specific surface area to facilitate light harvesting and photocatalytic performance liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 while their relatively large size enables cost effective separation and recovery zhang et al 2018 we previously showed that nanosheet assembled bi2o2co3 microspheres can be easily composited with electron shuttling reduced graphene oxide rgo to promote electron transfer and increase ros production zhang et al 2014 however while enhanced ros generation may improve

and natural organic matter eargs released in bulk water away from photocatalytic sites may escape treatment dunlop et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2019 accordingly previous work showed that rgo enhanced photocatalytic disinfection of arb did not efficiently degrade the associated eargs in wastewater karaolia et al 2018 thus it is important to enhance bacterial and earg adsorption near photocatalytic sites for more efficient ros utilization i e trap and zap strategy zhang et al 2018 we postulate that nitrogen doping of the rgo shell can improve bacterial adhesion to microspheres due to a less negative zeta potential than undoped rgo hasan et al 2012 smith et al 2019 which decreases electrostatic repulsion and thus increase the probability of catalyst bacteria collision xue et al 2018 zhao et al 2014b subsequently bacteria can be adsorbed by the catalyst due to hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic amino acids on bacterial surfaces and the photocatalyst surface e g graphitic basal planes bacterial adsorption near photocatalytic sites is not only conducive to more efficient disinfection but also may enhance the immediate capture and degradation of eargs that are released due to bacterial cell lysis furthermore nitrogen doping may accelerate electron transfer and enhance ros generation by decreasing defects within the nrgo plane and improving the interfacial contact between nrgo and the photocatalyst mou et al 2014 xu et al 2016 here we report the synthesis of novel nrgo wrapped bi2o2co3 microspheres ngwm and demonstrate their efficacy for simultaneous photocatalytic arb

wrapped by graphene oxide go sheet through the electrostatic interactions and dehydration condensation reaction subsequently the corresponding amount of n2h4 was added into the go wrapped bi2o2co3 microspheres with vigorous stirring for 30 min the mixed suspension was then transferred into a teflon stainless steel autoclave and autoclaved at 80 c for 3 h to achieve go reduction and n doping simultaneously specifically microspheres should be wrapped by go before n doping to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the amine functionalized bi2o2co3 microspheres and go shell after the

bacterial cells and water disinfection ros generation efficiency i e oh h2o2 was analyzed to evaluate the photoactivity of different photocatalysts briefly pcba was chosen as a probe to detect the steady state concentrations of oh cho et al 2004 h2o2 production was determined by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd photometric method bader et al 1988 ros scavenger experiments were conducted

ohads giandomenico et al 1997 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 we recognize that there may be potential differences in the affinity of different ros scavengers to catalyst surfaces before and after coating which may confound interpretation of which ros played significant roles thus ros scavengers were added in excess to ensure that their potential depletion due to sorption did not limit their ability to scavenge photogenerated ros 2 5 bacterial response to ros and cellular damage assessment systematic experiments were conducted to investigate the bacterial responses to and damages caused

rose like core of bi2o2co3 nanosheets which was completely wrapped by a thin layer of nrgo fig 1 a c xps spectra confirm the chemical bonds that constitute bi2o2co3 and nrgo composite materials fig 1d

s2a the c 1s spectrum of ngwm fig 1d also shows the presence of c c c n and c o from nrgo at 284 8 285 8 and 286 7 ev respectively zhang et al 2014 specifically the c c peak from c 1s spectrum of bi2o2co3 fig s2b at 284 8 ev refers to the adventitious carbon added for binding energy correction nitrogen doping was verified by the peaks at 398 1 399 6 and 401 6 ev fig 1e which correspond to pyridine n pyrrole n and graphite n from nrgo respectively xu et al 2016 as expected the oxygen containing functional groups from nrgo i e oh co oh and c o detected at 533 18 532 18 and 531 22 ev respectively and the bi o bond from bi2o2co3 529 58 ev were identified from the o 1s spectrum of ngwm fig 1f surface wrapping did not affect the crystallites of the hierarchical core as bi2o2co3 microspheres gwm and ngwm all showed identical diffraction peaks of tetragonal phase bi2o2co3 fig s2c dong et al 2011 3 2 wrapping the photocatalyst with nrgo enhanced ros generation and facilitated bacterial adsorption improving disinfection nitrogen doping i e ngwm significantly facilitated ros generation fig 2 a through accelerated electron transfer and enhanced visible light absorption intensity figs s2d and s3 the average photon emission lifetime from electron hole pair recombination of ngwm τ 15 4 ns was much shorter than that of bi2o2co3 microspheres τ 69 0 ns and gwm τ 30 7 ns table 1 fig s3 which is likely due to the ultrafast electron transfer process from bi2o2co3 to nrgo additionally nitrogen doping decreased the defects on the graphene sheets as measured by raman spectroscopy the intensity ratio of the d and g bands id ig represents the relative concentration of sp3 hybridized defects compared to the sp2 hybridized carbon network liang et al 2011 specifically id ig value of ngwm decreased by 6 5 compared to gwm fig s4 which corroborates that nitrogen doping decreased the abundance of defects on nrgo additionally n atoms could also serve as active sites for electron transfer or redox reactions xu et al 2016 decreasing defects within the nrgo plane and improving the interfacial contact between nrgo and the photocatalyst resulted in a higher electron transfer efficiency η 77 78 for ngwm compared to gwm η 55 51 mou et al 2014 due to nrgo wrapping ngwm exhibited an red shifted absorption edge up to 459 nm attributed to the formation of bi c bond with an enhanced broadband absorption ranging from 460 to 800 nm due to the presence of graphene figs s2a and d zhang et al 2010a 2014 consistently increased ros generation i e oh and h2o2 was observed with ngwm under uva vis irradiation relative to gwm and bare microspheres fig 2a fig s5 to investigate the effect of nrgo on bacterial adhesion equilibrium adhesion isotherms for e coli ndm 1 were determined with various photocatalysts ngwm showed a significant improvement in adsorption capacity for bacteria in secondary effluent 3 08 0 27 108 cfu mg catalyst compared to bi2o2co3 microspheres 0 78 0 09 108 cfu mg catalyst and gwm 2 07 0 18 108 cfu mg catalyst fig 2b table s3 apparently nitrogen doping increased the zeta potential of ngwm due to protonation of the lone pair electron on doped nitrogen table s4 decreasing electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged bacteria smith et al 2019 the flexibility koenig et al 2011 and corrugation meyer et al 2007 of rgo and nrgo surfaces would also enhance bacterial membrane adhesion compared with bare bi2o2co3 microspheres hu and zhou 2013 additionally nrgo and rgo wrapping improved bacterial affinity for the microspheres through enhanced hydrophobic interaction between bacterial surface proteins and the photocatalyst surface e g hydrophobic amino acids in pilin proteins interacting with graphitic basal planes vesper 1987 xue et al 2018 despite some background organics could also be adsorbed to the catalysts through hydrophobic interactions the decreased electrostatic repulsion as well as the flexibility and corrugation properties of nrgo surface facilitated bacterial adsorption to nrgo relative to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres fig s6 due to the synergetic effect of enhanced ros generation and increased bacterial adsorption ngwm exhibited the highest disinfection rate constant k 0 302 0 025 cfu ml 1min 1 in pbs and k 0 193 0 017 cfu ml 1min 1 in secondary effluent fig s7 table s5 also approximately 6 log inactivation of ndm 1 was achieved within 90 min in pbs and 120 min in secondary effluents under uva visible irradiation 8 68 10 6 e l s the photocatalytic disinfection rate constant of ngwm in secondary effluents was 3 2 3 1 and 1 6 times faster than that of tio2 bi2o2co3 and gwm respectively control experiments confirmed that the bactericidal effect of photocatalysts alone in the dark and xenon lamp irradiation alone without photocatalysts were negligible fig s8 3 3 bacterial adsorption to ngwm enhanced the contribution of surface bound photogenerated species in photocatalytic disinfection the inactivation of e coli ndm 1 in the presence of various scavengers was investigated to gain further insight into the photocatalytic mechanism ros scavengers were added in excess to ensure that their potential depletion due to sorption did not limit their ability to scavenge photogenerated ros fig s9 wrapping the catalyst with nrgo increased bacterial affinity fig 2c and resulted in e coli inactivation primarily through a surface bound reactive species e g h and ohads this was evidenced by dramatic inhibition of photoactivity by 75 5 in the ngwm photocatalytic system fig 3 a fig s10 in the presence of ki h and ohads scavenger in contrast the photoactivity for bare bi2o2co3 microspheres was significantly inhibited by isopropanol oh scavenger 55 6 inhibition sodium pyruvate h2o2 scavenger 61 8 inhibition and superoxide dismutase o2 scavenger 50 8 inhibition fig 3b fig s10 this inhibition of dissolved ros was much larger than that observed for ngwm fig 3a demonstrating that free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 are more important for e coli inactivation with bare bi2o2co3 microspheres photogenerated h and ohads can directly inactivate adsorbed bacteria by interrupting the electron transport respiratory chain via electron shuttling between bacteria and h or generate ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 to attack bacteria teng et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 in contrast due to insufficient bacterial affinity the bare bi2o2co3 microsphere surface does not favor direct contact with arb and the inactivation process is primarily mediated by the free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 that diffuse away from photocatalyst surface sites the combination of more direct contact i e increased bacterial adsorption and surface reactive species shows improved arb disinfection for ngwm compared to gwm and bare bi2o2co3 microspheres 3 4 nrgo wrapping enhanced the disruption of bacterial defense systems as expected more cell membrane damage was caused by ngwm compared to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres during treatment fig 4 a and b as the reactions progressed pi stained cells became more dominant fig s11 and k increasingly leaked out of the cytoplasm fig 4a indicating more severe cell membrane damage by the increased level of extracellular ros furthermore bacterial atp levels dramatically decreased with photocatalytic treatment fig 4b suggesting that atpase associated with the cell membrane was also damaged by the extracellular ros it has been reported that h2o2 can penetrate through the cell membrane and react with fe2 in the cytoplasm to generate intracellular oh intracellular fenton reaction gogniat and dukan 2007 the accelerated destruction of the cell membrane apparently allowed more extracellular ros e g h2o2 to enter the cytoplasm which further promoted the collapse of bacterial antioxidative enzymes fig 4c 4d ngwm resulted in more iros accumulated in the first 30 min relative to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres the iros concentration exhibited a bell shaped pattern as a function of reaction time in all the reactions fig 4d the decrease in iros after the peak concentration might be due to iros dispersion into the bulk solution as bacteria lysed overall enhanced extracellular and intracellular ros generation through nrgo wrapping accelerated the destruction of bacterial defense systems and promoted severe oxidative damage to other functional biomolecules figs s12 and s13 3 5 ngwm plasmid binding enhanced photocatalytic degradation of the plasmid encoded bla ndm 1 gene as with arb inactivation ngwm demonstrated enhanced arg both eargs and iargs degradation relative to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres under uva visible light irradiation 340 λ 700 nm 8 68 10 6 e l s ngwm reduced the level of i bla ndm 1 genes by approximately 5 0 log within 120 min and the remaining eargs was less than the detection limit 2 log copies ml 1 fig 5 control experiments confirmed the lack of arg degradation with uva visible light irradiation alone fig s8 ngwm began degrading i bla ndm 1 genes significantly earlier than gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres this was likely due to the accelerated destruction of bacterial defense systems e g cell membrane and antioxidative enzymes mediated by ngwm which was not as rapid in the other catalyst systems subsequently the abundance of both e bla ndm 1 and i bla ndm 1 genes decreased as treatment time increased fig 5 note that enhanced arb adsorption was achieved by ngwm fig 2b which might shorten the diffusion distance of eargs from the decayed arb to the microsphere s surface and photocatalytic sites e g h this would facilitate immediate capture and degradation of the released eargs and thus possibly mitigate ros dilution and scavenging by background constituents accordingly photocatalytic treatment with ngwm outperformed other treatments less than 2 log eargs copies ml 1 were detected within 120 min with ngwm versus 7 5 log with tio2 7 4 log with bi2o2co3 microspheres and 4 5 log with gwm fig 5b remarkably the increase in eargs abundance due to release from dead cells was efficiently mitigated by ngwm compared to other photocatalysts fig 5 corroborating that plasmid dna released from impaired cells could be effectively adsorbed with increasing arb adsorption and plasmid dna binding capacity for more efficient oxidation fig 2b fig s14 background constituents in the effluent including naturally occurring ros scavengers hindered photocatalytic degradation of eargs by both tio2 and ngwm relative to treatment in pbs solution fig s15 nevertheless ngwm enhanced bacterial and plasmid dna adsorption near photocatalytic sites and was thus less susceptible to such inhibitory effects than tio2 plasmids were introduced to verify the interaction between arg and the ngwm surface during adsorption and photocatalysis green fluorescent microspheres fig s16 were observed after mixing ngwm with sybr stained plasmids but not before mixing which indicated that plasmids were adsorbed onto the ngwm surface the raman spectrum confirmed the adsorption of plasmids onto the ngwm surface the d and g bands of the raman spectra were associated with the disordered sp2 and sp2 carbon network of nrgo respectively gómez navarro et al 2007 when nrgo adsorbed plasmid dna the nrgo delocalized π electron and the nucleobase aromatic ring likely disturbed the nrgo π conjugation through π π stacking interactions resulting in sp2 carbon network disorder defects and id ig enhancement thereafter yu et al 2017 due to the adsorption of plasmids by ngwm the ratio of d to g band intensity id ig increased by 12 7 fig 6 a moreover the id ig ratio of ngwm rebounded to 0 942 after photocatalytic treatment indicating that the photogenerated reactive species efficiently degraded the absorbed plasmids ngwm dna binding was further confirmed by the new stretching vibration of c nnucleobase at 1340 cm 1 fig 6b after plasmid dna absorption in return the hydroxyl groups ho c 1260 cm 1 nrgo and carboxylic groups ho c o 1039 cm 1 nrgo vibration bands were weakened fig 6b mainly due to the hydrogen bond interaction with the amidogen carbonyl of dna nucleobase hon rgo nh2nucleobase and honrgo onucleobase yu et al 2017 the absorption peaks at 968 1078 and 1211 cm 1 belong to the vibration of the phosphomonoesters dianion po3 2 phosphodiester po2 and sugar phosphate bond c o p respectively movasaghi et al 2008 tsuboi 1957 yu et al 2018 zhao 2008 these new absorption peaks were observed from ngwm sampled after plasmid absorption but not from ngwm before treatment fig 6b implying that the dna containing sugar phosphate backbone was adsorbed on ngwm specifically these new vibration peaks were weakened after photocatalytic treatment further demonstrating that the adsorbed plasmids could be degraded by photogenerated reactive species photocatalyst stability and reusability ensuring photocatalyst stability is critical to practical water treatment and disinfection applications hence we examined the possible photoactivity loss of ngwm over consecutive reuse cycles the photoactivity was relatively stable and no significant decrease in inactivation efficiency was observed after 10 cycles fig s17a in contrast the photoactivity of bi2o2co3 microspheres decreased by 45 7 only after 6 cycles fig s17b notably mass loss and photocorrosion were marginal throughout the test with about 95 1 0 7 of ngwm recovered after the 10th recycle fig s18 this indicates that nrgo wrapping could efficiently inhibit photocorrosion i e bi ion leaching attributed to the effective hybridization of the core photocatalyst with the intimate sheet specifically nrgo could serve as electron acceptors tran et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 which likely inhibited further oxidation of nrgo fig s19 and therefore the photoactivity was relatively stable even after ten cycles 4 conclusions wrapping of hierarchical bi2o2co3 microspheres with nrgo enhanced bacterial adsorption and photocatalytic arb inactivation in the secondary effluent which contains abundant ros scavengers photogenerated electron holes h and surface attached hydroxyl radicals ohads were the predominant oxidizing species responsible for arb inactivation with wrapped microspheres versus free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 for bare microspheres due to the short distance between the adsorbed bacteria and photocatalysis reaction sites eargs that were released from lysed bacteria were efficiently captured and degraded by the microspheres thus minimizing ros scavenging and dilution the nrgo shell increased the photocatalyst s affinity toward the antibiotic resistant plasmid through π π stacking and hydrogen bond interfacial interactions improving degradation of eargs the nrgo shell also served as a protective layer for bi2o2co3 microspheres preventing photocorrosion under irradiation thereby increasing the photocatalyst s lifetime overall this work demonstrates the potential of nrgo wrapping to enhance photocatalytic treatment of secondary effluent and mitigate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through discharges of secondary effluent from sewage treatment plants declaration of competing

17666,there is growing pressure for wastewater treatment plants to mitigate the discharge of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and extracellular resistance genes eargs which requires technological innovation here hierarchical bi2o2co3 microspheres were wrapped with nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide nrgo for enhanced inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli ndm 1 and degradation of the plasmid encoded arg bla ndm 1 in secondary effluent the nrgo shell enhanced reactive oxygen species ros generation oh and h2o2 by about three fold which was ascribed to broadened light absorption region red shifted up to 459 nm and decreased electron transfer time from 55 3 to 19 8 ns wrapping enhanced e coli adsorption near photocatalytic sites to minimize ros scavenging by background constituents which contributed to the nrgo wrapped microspheres significantly outperforming commercial tio2 photocatalyst ros scavenger tests indicated that wrapping also changed the primary inactivation pathway with photogenerated electron holes and surface attached hydroxyl radicals becoming the predominant oxidizing species with wrapped microspheres versus free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 for bare microspheres formation of resistance plasmid composited microsphere complexes primary due to the π π stacking and hydrogen bonding between the shell and nucleotides also minimized ros scavenging and kept free plasmid concentrations below 102 copies ml as proof of concept this work offers promising insight into the utilization of nrgo wrapped microspheres for mitigating antibiotic resistance propagation in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords trap and zap nitrogen doped graphene surface reactive species antibiotic resistance 1 introduction the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb poses a growing threat to public health davies and davies 2010 o neill 2016 underscoring the need to consider the occurrence and fate of arb in water infrastructure some wastewater treatment plants wwtps may serve as breeding grounds and point sources for arb and extracellular antibiotic resistance genes eargs that contribute to the environmental resistome ju et al 2016 luo et al 2014 furthermore conventional secondary effluent disinfection approaches e g chlorination and ultraviolet uv radiation exhibit relatively low efficiency to mitigate the discharge of arb and eargs he et al 2019 lorenz and wackernagel 1994 luo et al 2011 and residual disinfectants may enhance arg horizontal transfer contributing to resistance propagation dotson et al 2010 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 thus there is a critical need for technological innovation to develop robust and sustainable approaches to mitigate antibiotic resistance dissemination through efficient arb inactivation and associated eargs degradation photocatalysis has received significant attention as a potential eco friendly disinfection process for eliminating waterborne microbial contaminants including arb giannakis et al 2018 pelaez et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a the process involves production of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide o2 as well as electron holes h upon uv irradiation table s1 these oxidizing species can efficiently inactivate bacteria by attacking essential biomolecules e g lipids proteins and dna cho et al 2004 ren et al 2018 xia et al 2015 three dimensional 3d hierarchical microspheres composed of 2d photoactive nanosheets exhibit high specific surface area to facilitate light harvesting and photocatalytic performance liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 while their relatively large size enables cost effective separation and recovery zhang et al 2018 we previously showed that nanosheet assembled bi2o2co3 microspheres can be easily composited with electron shuttling reduced graphene oxide rgo to promote electron transfer and increase ros production zhang et al 2014 however while enhanced ros generation may improve disinfection moreira et al 2018 a higher rate of cells lysis increases the release of eargs due to ros dilution and scavenging by background constituents e g carbonates soluble microbial products smps and natural organic matter eargs released in bulk water away from photocatalytic sites may escape treatment dunlop et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2019 accordingly previous work showed that rgo enhanced photocatalytic disinfection of arb did not efficiently degrade the associated eargs in wastewater karaolia et al 2018 thus it is important to enhance bacterial and earg adsorption near photocatalytic sites for more efficient ros utilization i e trap and zap strategy zhang et al 2018 we postulate that nitrogen doping of the rgo shell can improve bacterial adhesion to microspheres due to a less negative zeta potential than undoped rgo hasan et al 2012 smith et al 2019 which decreases electrostatic repulsion and thus increase the probability of catalyst bacteria collision xue et al 2018 zhao et al 2014b subsequently bacteria can be adsorbed by the catalyst due to hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic amino acids on bacterial surfaces and the photocatalyst surface e g graphitic basal planes bacterial adsorption near photocatalytic sites is not only conducive to more efficient disinfection but also may enhance the immediate capture and degradation of eargs that are released due to bacterial cell lysis furthermore nitrogen doping may accelerate electron transfer and enhance ros generation by decreasing defects within the nrgo plane and improving the interfacial contact between nrgo and the photocatalyst mou et al 2014 xu et al 2016 here we report the synthesis of novel nrgo wrapped bi2o2co3 microspheres ngwm and demonstrate their efficacy for simultaneous photocatalytic arb inactivation and eargs degradation in a secondary effluent polishing context enhanced bacterial adsorption and inactivation as well as earg degradation were confirmed by direct comparisons versus treatment with bare bi2o2co3 microspheres or undoped rgo wrapped bi2o2co3 microspheres gwm the photocatalytic mechanism was investigated through ros scavenging tests and oxidative stress to the arb was assessed by quantifying cell membrane integrity and antioxidant enzymatic activity we discerned the interfacial mechanisms for enhanced eargs adsorption and degradation relative to uncoated catalyst benchmarking experiments were also performed using a commercial tio2 photocatalyst to demonstrate the applicability of ngwm for municipal wastewater treatment effluent disinfection and associated mitigation of antibiotic resistance propagation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and bacterial strains bismuth citrate 99 urea 97 ethanol 99 5 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane

characterization hierarchical bi2o2co3 microspheres were synthesized by a hydrothermal method as previously described zhang et al 2014 the microspheres were amine functionalized by aptms and then wrapped by graphene oxide go sheet through the electrostatic interactions and dehydration condensation reaction subsequently the corresponding amount of n2h4 was added into the go wrapped bi2o2co3 microspheres with vigorous stirring for 30 min the mixed suspension was then transferred into a teflon stainless steel autoclave and autoclaved at 80 c for 3 h to achieve go reduction and n doping simultaneously specifically microspheres should be wrapped by go before n doping to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the amine functionalized bi2o2co3 microspheres and go shell after the hydrothermal reaction the final mixture was washed with di water and dried at 60 c for 24 h under vacuum to obtain ngwm microspheres the morphology of the catalysts was characterized by a scanning

bacterial cells and water disinfection ros generation efficiency i e oh h2o2 was analyzed to evaluate the photoactivity of different photocatalysts briefly pcba was chosen as a probe to detect the steady state concentrations of oh cho et al 2004 h2o2 production was determined by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd photometric method bader et al 1988 ros scavenger experiments were conducted to distinguish the contributions of different ros generated by ngwm the scavengers used in this study were sp for h2o2 ipa for oh sod for o2 and potassium iodide ki for surface bound species i e h and ohads giandomenico et al 1997 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 we recognize that there may be potential differences in the affinity of different ros scavengers to catalyst surfaces before and after coating which may confound interpretation of which ros played significant roles thus ros scavengers were added in excess to ensure that their potential depletion due to sorption did not limit their ability to scavenge photogenerated ros 2 5 bacterial response to ros and cellular damage assessment systematic experiments were conducted to investigate the bacterial responses to and damages caused by ros briefly the cell membrane integrity was examined by the k leakage assay protein leakage assay and atp synthesis ability wang et al 2012 xia et al 2016 the activities of cat and sod were

respectively and the bi o bond from bi2o2co3 529 58 ev were identified from the o 1s spectrum of ngwm fig 1f surface wrapping did not affect the crystallites of the hierarchical core as bi2o2co3 microspheres gwm and ngwm all showed identical diffraction peaks of tetragonal phase bi2o2co3 fig s2c dong et al 2011 3 2 wrapping the photocatalyst with nrgo enhanced ros generation and facilitated bacterial adsorption improving disinfection nitrogen doping i e ngwm significantly facilitated ros generation fig 2 a through accelerated electron transfer and enhanced visible light absorption intensity figs s2d and s3 the average photon emission lifetime from electron hole pair recombination of ngwm τ 15 4 ns was much shorter than that of bi2o2co3 microspheres τ 69 0 ns and gwm τ 30 7 ns table 1 fig s3 which is likely due to the ultrafast electron transfer process from bi2o2co3 to nrgo additionally nitrogen doping decreased the defects on the graphene sheets as measured by raman spectroscopy the intensity ratio of the d and g bands id ig represents the relative concentration of sp3 hybridized defects compared to the sp2 hybridized carbon network liang et al 2011 specifically id ig value of ngwm decreased by 6 5 compared to gwm fig s4 which corroborates that nitrogen doping decreased the abundance of defects on nrgo additionally n atoms could also serve as active sites for electron transfer or redox reactions xu et al 2016 decreasing defects within the nrgo plane and improving the interfacial contact between nrgo and the photocatalyst resulted in a higher electron transfer efficiency η 77 78 for ngwm compared to gwm η 55 51 mou et al 2014 due to nrgo wrapping ngwm exhibited an red shifted absorption edge up to 459 nm attributed to the formation of bi c bond with an enhanced broadband absorption ranging from 460 to 800 nm due to the presence of graphene figs s2a and d zhang et al 2010a 2014 consistently increased ros generation i e oh and h2o2 was observed with ngwm under uva vis irradiation relative to gwm and bare microspheres fig 2a fig s5 to investigate the effect of nrgo on bacterial adhesion equilibrium adhesion isotherms for e coli ndm 1 were determined with various photocatalysts ngwm showed a significant improvement in adsorption capacity for bacteria in secondary effluent 3 08 0 27 108 cfu mg catalyst compared to bi2o2co3 microspheres 0 78 0 09 108 cfu mg catalyst and gwm 2 07 0 18 108 cfu mg catalyst fig 2b table s3 apparently nitrogen doping increased the zeta potential of ngwm due to protonation of the lone pair electron on doped nitrogen table s4 decreasing electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged bacteria smith et al 2019 the flexibility koenig et al 2011 and corrugation meyer et al 2007 of rgo and nrgo surfaces would also enhance bacterial membrane adhesion compared with bare bi2o2co3 microspheres hu and zhou 2013 additionally nrgo and rgo wrapping improved bacterial affinity for the microspheres through enhanced hydrophobic interaction between bacterial surface proteins and the photocatalyst surface e g hydrophobic amino acids in pilin proteins interacting with graphitic basal planes vesper 1987 xue et al 2018 despite some background organics could also be adsorbed to the catalysts through hydrophobic interactions the decreased electrostatic repulsion as well as the flexibility and corrugation properties of nrgo surface facilitated bacterial adsorption to nrgo relative to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres fig s6 due to the synergetic effect of enhanced ros generation and increased bacterial adsorption ngwm exhibited the highest disinfection rate constant k 0 302 0 025 cfu ml 1min 1 in pbs and k 0 193 0 017 cfu ml 1min 1 in secondary effluent fig s7 table s5 also approximately 6 log inactivation of ndm 1 was achieved within 90 min in pbs and 120 min in secondary effluents under uva visible irradiation 8 68 10 6 e l s the photocatalytic disinfection rate constant of ngwm in secondary effluents was 3 2 3 1 and 1 6 times faster than that of tio2 bi2o2co3 and gwm respectively control experiments confirmed that the bactericidal effect of photocatalysts alone in the dark and xenon lamp irradiation alone without photocatalysts were negligible fig s8 3 3 bacterial adsorption to ngwm enhanced the contribution of surface bound photogenerated species in photocatalytic disinfection the inactivation of e coli ndm 1 in the presence of various scavengers was investigated to gain further insight into the photocatalytic mechanism ros scavengers were added in excess to ensure that their potential depletion due to sorption did not limit their ability to scavenge photogenerated ros fig s9 wrapping the catalyst with nrgo increased bacterial affinity fig 2c and resulted in e coli inactivation primarily through a surface bound reactive species e g h and ohads this was evidenced by dramatic inhibition of photoactivity by 75 5 in the ngwm photocatalytic system fig 3 a fig s10 in the presence of ki h and ohads scavenger in contrast the photoactivity for bare bi2o2co3 microspheres was significantly inhibited by isopropanol oh scavenger 55 6 inhibition sodium pyruvate h2o2 scavenger 61 8 inhibition and superoxide dismutase o2 scavenger 50 8 inhibition fig 3b fig s10 this inhibition of dissolved ros was much larger than that observed for ngwm fig 3a demonstrating that free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 are more important for e coli inactivation with bare bi2o2co3 microspheres photogenerated h and ohads can directly inactivate adsorbed bacteria by interrupting the electron transport respiratory chain via electron shuttling between bacteria and h or generate ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 to attack bacteria teng et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 in contrast due to insufficient bacterial affinity the bare bi2o2co3 microsphere surface does not favor direct contact with arb and the inactivation process is primarily mediated by the free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 that diffuse away from photocatalyst surface sites the combination of more direct contact i e increased bacterial adsorption and surface reactive species shows improved arb disinfection for ngwm compared to gwm and bare bi2o2co3 microspheres 3 4 nrgo wrapping enhanced the disruption of bacterial defense systems as expected more cell membrane damage was caused by ngwm compared to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres during treatment fig 4 a and b as the reactions progressed pi stained cells became more dominant fig s11 and k increasingly leaked out of the cytoplasm fig 4a indicating more severe cell membrane damage by the increased level of extracellular ros furthermore bacterial atp levels dramatically decreased with photocatalytic treatment fig 4b suggesting that atpase associated with the cell membrane was also damaged by the extracellular ros it has been reported that h2o2 can penetrate through the cell membrane and react with fe2 in the cytoplasm to generate intracellular oh intracellular fenton reaction gogniat and dukan 2007 the accelerated destruction of the cell membrane apparently allowed more extracellular ros e g h2o2 to enter the cytoplasm which further promoted the collapse of bacterial antioxidative enzymes fig 4c 4d ngwm resulted in more iros accumulated in the first 30 min relative to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres the iros concentration exhibited a bell shaped pattern as a function of reaction time in all the reactions fig 4d the decrease in iros after the peak concentration might be due to iros dispersion into the bulk solution as bacteria lysed overall enhanced extracellular and intracellular ros generation through nrgo wrapping accelerated the destruction of bacterial defense systems and promoted severe oxidative damage to other functional biomolecules figs s12 and s13 3 5 ngwm plasmid binding enhanced photocatalytic degradation of the plasmid encoded bla ndm 1 gene as with arb inactivation ngwm demonstrated enhanced arg both eargs and iargs degradation relative to gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres under uva visible light irradiation 340 λ 700 nm 8 68 10 6 e l s ngwm reduced the level of i bla ndm 1 genes by approximately 5 0 log within 120 min and the remaining eargs was less than the detection limit 2 log copies ml 1 fig 5 control experiments confirmed the lack of arg degradation with uva visible light irradiation alone fig s8 ngwm began degrading i bla ndm 1 genes significantly earlier than gwm and bi2o2co3 microspheres this was likely due to the accelerated destruction of bacterial defense systems e g cell membrane and antioxidative enzymes mediated by ngwm which was not as rapid in the other catalyst systems subsequently the abundance of both e bla ndm 1 and i bla ndm 1 genes decreased as treatment time increased fig 5 note that enhanced arb adsorption was achieved by ngwm fig 2b which might shorten the diffusion distance of eargs from the decayed arb to the microsphere s surface and photocatalytic sites e g h this would facilitate immediate capture and degradation of the released eargs and thus possibly mitigate ros dilution and scavenging by background constituents accordingly photocatalytic treatment with ngwm outperformed other treatments less than 2 log eargs copies ml 1 were detected within 120 min with ngwm versus 7 5 log with tio2 7 4 log with bi2o2co3 microspheres and 4 5 log with gwm fig 5b remarkably the increase in eargs abundance due to release from dead cells was efficiently mitigated by ngwm compared to other photocatalysts fig 5 corroborating that plasmid dna released from impaired cells could be effectively adsorbed with increasing arb adsorption and plasmid dna binding capacity for more efficient oxidation fig 2b fig s14 background constituents in the effluent including naturally occurring ros scavengers hindered photocatalytic degradation of eargs by both tio2 and ngwm relative to treatment in pbs solution fig s15 nevertheless ngwm enhanced bacterial and plasmid dna adsorption near photocatalytic sites and was thus less susceptible to such inhibitory effects than tio2 plasmids were introduced to verify the interaction between arg and the ngwm surface during adsorption and photocatalysis green fluorescent microspheres fig s16 were observed after mixing ngwm with sybr stained plasmids but not before mixing which indicated that plasmids were adsorbed onto the ngwm surface the raman spectrum confirmed the adsorption of plasmids onto the ngwm surface the d and g bands of the raman spectra were associated with the disordered sp2 and sp2 carbon network of nrgo respectively gómez navarro et al 2007 when nrgo adsorbed plasmid dna the nrgo delocalized π electron and the nucleobase aromatic ring likely disturbed the nrgo π conjugation through π π stacking interactions resulting in sp2 carbon network disorder defects and id ig enhancement thereafter yu et al 2017 due to the adsorption of plasmids by ngwm the ratio of d to g band intensity id ig increased by 12 7 fig 6 a moreover the id ig ratio of ngwm rebounded to 0 942 after photocatalytic treatment indicating that the photogenerated reactive species efficiently degraded the absorbed plasmids ngwm dna binding was further confirmed by the new stretching vibration of c nnucleobase at 1340 cm 1 fig 6b after plasmid dna absorption in return the hydroxyl groups ho c 1260 cm 1 nrgo and carboxylic groups ho c o 1039 cm 1 nrgo vibration bands were weakened fig 6b mainly due to the hydrogen bond interaction with the amidogen carbonyl of dna nucleobase hon rgo nh2nucleobase and honrgo onucleobase yu et al 2017 the absorption peaks at 968 1078 and 1211 cm 1 belong to the vibration of the phosphomonoesters dianion po3 2 phosphodiester po2 and sugar phosphate bond c o p respectively movasaghi et al 2008 tsuboi 1957 yu et al 2018 zhao 2008 these new absorption peaks were observed from ngwm sampled after plasmid absorption but not from ngwm before treatment fig 6b implying that the dna containing sugar phosphate backbone was adsorbed on ngwm specifically these new vibration peaks were weakened after photocatalytic treatment further demonstrating that the adsorbed plasmids could be degraded by photogenerated reactive species photocatalyst stability and reusability ensuring photocatalyst stability is critical to practical water treatment and disinfection applications hence we examined the possible photoactivity loss of ngwm over consecutive reuse cycles the photoactivity was relatively stable and no significant decrease in inactivation efficiency was observed after 10 cycles fig s17a in contrast the photoactivity of bi2o2co3 microspheres decreased by 45 7 only after 6 cycles fig s17b notably mass loss and photocorrosion were marginal throughout the test with about 95 1 0 7 of ngwm recovered after the 10th recycle fig s18 this indicates that nrgo wrapping could efficiently inhibit photocorrosion i e bi ion leaching attributed to the effective hybridization of the core photocatalyst with the intimate sheet specifically nrgo could serve as electron acceptors tran et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 which likely inhibited further oxidation of nrgo fig s19 and therefore the photoactivity was relatively stable even after ten cycles 4 conclusions wrapping of hierarchical bi2o2co3 microspheres with nrgo enhanced bacterial adsorption and photocatalytic arb inactivation in the secondary effluent which contains abundant ros scavengers photogenerated electron holes h and surface attached hydroxyl radicals ohads were the predominant oxidizing species responsible for arb inactivation with wrapped microspheres versus free ros e g oh h2o2 and o2 for bare microspheres due to the short distance between the adsorbed bacteria and photocatalysis reaction sites eargs that were released from lysed bacteria were efficiently captured and degraded by the microspheres thus minimizing ros scavenging and dilution the nrgo shell increased the photocatalyst s affinity toward the antibiotic resistant plasmid through π π stacking and hydrogen bond interfacial interactions improving degradation of eargs the nrgo shell also served as a protective layer for bi2o2co3 microspheres preventing photocorrosion under irradiation thereby increasing the photocatalyst s lifetime overall this work demonstrates the potential of nrgo wrapping to enhance photocatalytic treatment of secondary effluent and mitigate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through discharges of secondary effluent from sewage treatment plants declaration of competing

17667,climate change and increasing eutrophication are expected to increase the release of autochthonous organic matter om to sediments where most contaminants are transformed or mineralized in freshwater lakes this study sought to evaluate how cyanobacteria and macrophyte derived om com and mom affected the microbial attenuation of 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in the sediment from eutrophic lake taihu in china in two months of water sediment microcosm experiments the input of com and mom both promoted ee2 degradation more strongly than humic acids and the degradation efficiency was significantly and positively correlated with the cometabolism of increasing organic carbon in sediments p 0 001 the enhanced degradation was explained by responses of indigenous bacterial community to om amendment as a priming effect the immediate breakdown of biodegradable components such as proteinaceous substances in com and mom remarkably augmented the metabolic activity of bacteria in terms of the stimulated activity of extracellular enzymes including fluorescein diacetate and dehydrogenase as well as the elevated production of proteins and polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances in the meantime the bacterial community composition was reshaped toward a more eutrophic state leading to the clear upregulation of metabolic function genes of organic carbon and xenobiotics correlation based network analysis further determined the strong facilitative coordination between the community members and the compositional variability of om in the cometabolism these results suggest that cyanobacterial blooms dominated zones are potential hotspot areas for steroid estrogen attenuation a finding of significance for the control and management of complex pollution in freshwater lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords autochthonous organic matter bacterial community cyanobacterial bloom degradation estrogens sediment 1 introduction the widespread steroid estrogens have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their thousands time higher estrogenic potency than other major pharmaceuticals and personal care products lai et al 2002 exposure to estrogens at extremely low levels can have the potential to alter secondary sex characteristics disrupt endocrine function and activate hormone responses of aquatic species and their offspring van den belt et al 2004 unfortunately estrogens are frequently released into a variety of environmental matrixes including groundwaters surface waters and sediments through the wastewater discharge animal waste disposal and runoff of field applied hormone bearing materials zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 specifically sediments are expected to be a substantial sink for estrogens after their deposition in the associated water column peck et al 2004 the degradation by high densities of diverse microorganisms is a prominent mechanism for the nonconservative i e destructive attenuation of estrogenic activity in sediments yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 commonly the ambient concentrations of emerging contaminants are not sufficient to maintain the growth of heterotrophic bacteria or to induce the expression of relevant degrading enzymes egli 2010 instead natural organic matter om a heterogeneous mixture of complex organic matter such as amino acids proteins carbohydrates and humic acids ha is the most important carbon and energy source for heterotrophic bacteria traving et al 2017 our previous research showed that the growth and degradation capacity of an isolated ee2 degrading strain increased with the bioavailability of dissolved om in the water phase bai et al 2019 however most contaminant degrading strains are co localized with multi species communities in the natural environment and the degradation occurs through the coordinated functioning of a multi members metabolic network yan et al 2019 also the interspecies syntrophic interactions such as sharing intermediates are regulated by carbon source through the selection and activation of microbial guilds therefore the environment specific metabolic network in contaminant degradation is determined by om in two ways i shaping the microbial community by selecting the microbes which have the potential to metabolize substrates and ii stimulating the expression of metabolic pathways involved in interspecies syntrophic cooperations in the case the two processes are both closely associated with the concentration and structure of om in the past decades climate change and increasing eutrophication have increased the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and the overgrowth of macrophytes in freshwater lakes paul 2008 the input of autochthonous om aom which is produced in the growth and decay of cyanobacteria and macrophytes significantly changes the om concentration and composition in sediments zhang et al 2017 unlike the sediment om that is mainly composed of terrestrial and recalcitrant substances aom includes a considerable fraction of biochemically well defined compounds and exhibits high biodegradability in productive ecosystems bai et al 2017 song et al 2020 microbial processing of aom was found to change the microbial community composition and metabolic function for example phytoplankton derived om could increase the production of extracellular polymeric substance eps and enhance the survival metabolic efficiency and adaptation of biofilm decho and gutierrez 2017 the microbial communities metabolizing aquatic plants and algal derived om also exhibited a better ability to remove certain xenobiotics compounds in surface waters fono et al 2006 lim et al 2008 the response of contaminant degradation to om supply varies substantially due to their different bioavailabilities however previous studies involving the effect of om on estrogen degradation mostly used single easily or refractory end members e g glucose peptone and humic acid du et al 2017 racz et al 2012 while these compounds all present at various concentrations in aom causing the difficulty in translating the existing results to the lake sediment system it also remains a question how the increasing aom input affected estrogen attenuation through regulating the metabolic network of bacterial community such as metabolic activities interspecies interactions and functional genes to unequivocally assess how increasing aom input affected the microbial degradation of estrogens in sediments the water sediment microcosm studies were carried out over 2 months employing the natural sediments collected from lake taihu a typical eutrophic freshwater lake in china the most biologically active estrogen ee2 was selected as the target contaminant van den belt et al 2004 the fresh cyanobacteria and macrophyte derived om com and mom sampled from lake taihu were used as the autochthonous like om the impact of om quantity and quality on ee2 degradation was firstly determined then the responses of bacterial metabolic activity were investigated in terms of extracellular enzyme activity and eps production furthermore the evolution of indigenous bacterial community was systematically described with high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing in terms of population composition structures and metabolic genes results of this study will provide a deeper insight into the fate and toxicity of estrogens in surface waters under increasing eutrophication and further climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation sediment samples were collected from the meiliang bay of lake taihu in july 2018 with the sunny weather conditions and 30 c air temperature fig s1 a total of three replicate samples were collected from the surface sediment 0 15 cm using a peterson grab sampler and then mixed into a single sample bag once transported to the lab on ice the sediment samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve and thoroughly homogenized microcystis aeruginosa and potamogeton malaianus the most abundant algal and submerged species in lake taihu ma et al 2008 were collected from the cyanobacteria dominated region of meiliang bay and the macrophyte dominated region of xukou bay in lake taihu respectively fig s2 then the com and mom were leached from the biomass as described in supporting information si the ha solution was prepared using the standard ha sigma aldrich chemical co usa the obtained com mom and ha were lyophilized and the total organic carbon toc concentrations were determined in triplicate

2 2 water sediment microcosm experiments the water sediment microcosms were conducted in a series of 250 ml incubation bottles covered with aluminum foil to avoid the pass of light fig s3 10 g of sediment 50 ml synthetic lake water and 2 μg g 1 of ee2 dry weight basis as eutrophic lakes may receive wastewater discharge including estrogens at levels up to several μg l 1 zhou et al 2012 the spiked concentration of ee2 was relatively higher than the environmental relevant concentrations zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 but comparable to those in studies involving estrogen degradation in sediments sarmah and northcott 2008 yang et al 2016 ying and kookana 2003 a total of eight treatments were created with various om amendments 1 com at 1 mg c g 1 dry weight basis c g 2 com at 3 mg c g 1 3c g 3 mom at 1 mg c g 1 m g 4 mom at 3 mg c g 1 3m g 5 ha at 1 mg c g 1 h g 6 ha at 3 mg c g 1 3h g 7 no om n g and 8 sterilized treatment s g the amendment of om at 1 mg c g 1 and 3 mg c g 1 accounted for approximately 15 and 40 respectively of the background toc concentration 7 4 0 2 mg c g 1 in the sediment these dosages were selected according to previous findings that the average contribution of autochthonous sources to the toc in sediments from lake taihu was around 34 zhang et al 2017 for each treatment six replicate bottles were performed and a total of 48 bottles were finally set up the detailed procedure to set up water sediment microcosms were further described in si the bottles were then incubated at 25 c in dark and sampled on day 0 30 and 60 at each sampling two bottles were sacrificed from each treatment and duplicates were collected from each bottle consequently four replicates were obtained for each treatment for the toc and ee2 quantification the overlying water and sediments were mixed and lyophilized for the analysis of enzyme activity eps and microbial communities only the sediments were collected 2 3 analysis of eps and extracellular enzymes the structure of eps existing in sediments is depicted by a two layer model colloidal eps c eps and bound eps b eps the extraction of c eps and b eps was carried out using a published dowex resin method yang et al 2018 briefly the sediment was firstly suspended in a 0 05 w w nacl solution for the c eps extraction and then the sediment was re suspended in nacl solution containing activated dowex 50wx8 hydrogen form 200 400 mesh sigma aldrich mo usa to extract the b eps the protein and polysaccharides concentrations in eps were determined using the modified lowry method and anthrone sulfuric acid method respectively the activities of extracellular enzymes including urease ua dehydrogenase dha fluorescein diacetate fda neutral protease npa and alkaline phosphatase apa were analyzed using corresponding kits according to manufacturer s directions solarbio science technology company beijing china the expanded description of extraction and analysis is shown in si 2 4 microbial community analysis the sediment in each bottle was homogenized and lyophilized before dna extraction the duplicate dna were extracted from each bottle according to the manufacturer s direction of powersoil dna kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca resulting in a total of four dna replicates for each treatment the four replicates were then pooled together li et al 2019 and amplified using 515f and 907r universal bacterial primers each dna sample was amplified in triplicate pooled for purification and processed by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china for high throughput dna sequencing with the illumina hiseq2500 system illumina san diego u s a high quality sequences with 97 identity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic unit otu the obtained otus were converted into a suitable input file for further alpha diversity and beta diversity calculation in quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime the bacterial metagenome functional content

copy numbers were also determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr amplification quantstudio3 systems thermo fisher usa a more detailed description of microbial community analysis is provided in si 2 5 analytical methodology and statistical analysis the toc content in solid samples was measured as co2 on acid treated samples with a solid toc analyzer o i analytical co usa to obtain the composition information of com mom and ha the lyophilized om was re dissolved in milli q water at 15 mg c l 1 in triplicate then the absorption and fluorescent spectra of om solutions were collected in a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan and a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan respectively the excitation emission matrix spectra eems were corrected for water raman scatter peaks inner filter effects and rayleigh scattering effects in matlab r2012a embedded with dreems toolbox ver 0 2 0 murphy et al 2013 afterward the specific parameters including specific uv absorbance suva254 spectral slope ratio s r and biological index bix were calculated according to published methods hansen et al 2016 parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was employed to identify fluorescent components using dreems toolbox murphy et al 2013 the ee2 in lyophilized samples were extracted via ultrasonic extraction and quantified using an agilent 7890a gas chromatography coupled with a 5975c mass spectrometer gc ms after derivation detailed information about the analytical methodology is given in si for om characterization average values and standard deviations were calculated from the analysis of triplicates using one sample t test in statistical package for social science spss software version 22 0 ibm usa for the analysis of ee2 toc enzyme activity and eps production the average values and standard deviations were calculated from the analysis of four replications for each treatment for all statistical analyses a p value of 0 05 was considered statistically significant a parametric one way analysis of variance anova coupled with a post hoc comparison was used to test for significant differences in ee2 degradation toc removal enzyme activity and eps production a parametric two way anova was used to determine the influences of om quantity and quality on ee2 degradation toc removal enzyme activity and eps production the normality independence and equality of variance of data were verified with spss spearman correlations between om fluorescent components and bacterial community activity and compositions were also performed in spss moreover correlation based networks were constructed based on otus in combination with fluorescent components using the vegan and psych packages in r software the otus with occurrence in more than 75 of the samples were selected all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between the relative abundance of selected otus and the intensity of each fluorescent component were calculated only the correlations with r 0 6 and p value 0 01 were incorporated into networks network visualization and module detection were performed in the interactive platform gephi webatlas paris france 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of autochthonous like om the main characteristics of the two autochthonous like om and ha were shown in table 1 the absorbance of com and mom was remarkably lower than that of ha indicating their low humification degrees fig s4 the values of suva254 also suggested that a large fraction of the cyanobacteria and macrophyte leachate included aliphatic compounds that do not absorb at 254 nm hansen et al 2016 with steeper slope ratios reflective of greater amounts of low molecular weight compounds hansen et al 2016 the values of s r implied that the average molecular weight of com and mom was larger than that of ha this was because the molecular weights of biomacromolecules such as proteins released from biomass were higher than those of humic substances xu et al 2020 as an indicator corresponding to the recently produced om of autochthonous origin hansen et al 2016 the values of bix demonstrated that com and mom were derived from microbial sources extracellular release and leachate from cyanobacteria and macrophyte through eem parafac analysis a total of five fluorescent components were identified and matched with other published models in the openfluor database similarity score 0 95 murphy et al 2014 component 1 c1 and component 2 c2 were assigned into the proteinaceous tryptophan and tyrosine like matter respectively component 3 c3 was assigned into the microbial humic like matter produced from algae or macrophytes component 4 c4 was assigned into the humic like matter and component 5 c5 was assigned into a combination of the traditionally defined humic like peak a and c respectively fig s5 and fig s6 this was in keeping with the former findings that the leachates from phytoplankton and macrophytes contained fluorescent components similar to peak a and peak c zhang et al 2013 which were usually considered as originating from allochthonous on the basis of fluorescence intensity the proteinaceous substances accounted for 49 and 70 of com and mom fluorescent components respectively whereas 97 of the fluorescent compounds in ha were attributed to humic like substances the complex composition and structure of autochthonous like om highlighted the necessity of employing natural om instead of end members when investigating the role of om in contaminant degradation 3 2 degradation of ee2 in water sediment systems as displayed in fig 1 a the concentration of ee2 remarkably declined and the final removal efficiency reached to 44 99 at the end of incubation the limited loss of ee2 less than 8 in abiotic control proved that abiotic process such as chemical hydrolysis chemical reduction and irreversible sorption sarmah and northcott 2008 played a minor role in the degradation fig s7 also the absence of organic carbon and microbes in the overlying water restricted the biotic removal in the water phase suggesting that the ee2 was primarily removed via microbial degradation in the sediment the degradation efficiencies of ee2 in om amended sediments except h g were significantly higher than the control p 0 05 moreover the promotive effect of om showed a significant concentration dependent character for the same quality p 0 001 however the ee2 degradation rate in c g and m g was comparable to that in 3h g suggesting the important role of om quality in determining estrogen degradation the addition of com and mom at equal concentration exhibited a similar enhancement on ee2 degradation at the end of incubation even though the degradation efficiency in 3c g was significantly higher than that in 3m g on day 30 p 0 001 in comparison the existence of ha had a much weaker promotion on ee2 degradation over the incubation the significant interaction between om quantity and quality on ee2 degradation was also presented using two way anova analysis p 0 001 on day 30 and 60 with the degradation of ee2 the organic carbon content in the water sediment system also decreased fig 1b similarly the degradation rate was dependent on om quantity and quality p 0 001 after 2 months of incubation the addition of 3 mg c g 1 of com and mom increased the average toc removal from 1 26 mg c g 1 to 4 03 mg c g 1 and 4 08 mg c g 1 respectively the similar toc removal in c g m g and 3h g indicated that the biodegradable fractions in com and mom were approximately three times higher than those in ha it was further found that the toc removal in water sediment systems was positively correlated with ee2 degradation efficiency p 0 001 fig 1c this synchronous decrease in toc and ee2 concentration provided strong evidence that ee2 was prominently cometabolically degraded by bacteria together with the utilization of organic carbon the degradation of ee2 has been reported in simulated aquatic environments under aerobic conditions even though it shows a level of resistance to microbial degradation the ee2 degradation rate in this study was similar to that in marine sediments ying and kookana 2003 but lower than those in estuarine and river sediments sarmah and northcott 2008 yang et al 2016 the various degradation rates were mostly due to the differences in the experimental matrixes such as concentration sediment properties microbial biomass and water chemistry the estrogen degradation rates in sediments were reported positively correlated with the background concentrations of nutrients organic carbon zhang et al 2019 and microbial biomass li et al 2005 nevertheless a similar study found that the sediment chemical properties and indigenous microbial community in lake taihu were inherently detrimental to 17β estradiol degradation zhang et al 2019 moreover the experiment design including the higher concentration of ee2 the absence of carbon source in overlying water and the lower ratio of sediment to water also contributed to the slow degradation capacity in this study it should be noted that the obtained results may differ from the ee2 degradation rates in real situations in which the average environmental concentrations of ee2 were relatively low considering the significant accelerative effect of com within a short time the trace amount of estrogens would be more sensitive to the com input estrogens can be sorbed onto om possibly decreasing their bioavailability to bacteria lee et al 2011 nonetheless the higher ee2 degradation rates in microcosms with 3 mg c g 1 of om than those with 1 mg c g 1 of om demonstrated that the sorption of om played a secondary role in ee2 degradation so the enhanced ee2 degradation was largely attributed to the responses of microbial communities although some critical catabolites in bacterial metabolism e g glucose could inhibit the ring cleavage of estrogens li et al 2008 the contents of these compounds in autochthonous like om at environmental concentrations were not enough to reach the threshold values thus the biomass grown on increasing concentrations of organic carbon exhibited stronger growth and activity than those in oligotrophic conditions moreover the stronger degradation of ee2 and organic carbon in com and mom amended microcosms than in ha amended microcosms confirmed that the biodegradable organic carbon rather than the bulk organic carbon was the determining factor as the labile organic carbon could enhance the mineralization of recalcitrant substances that failed to sustain active microbial populations and thereby the production of enzymes trevathan tackett et al 2018 it was speculated that the ready mineralization of labile substrates in com and mom stimulated the metabolic activity of potential degraders and enhanced the ee2 degradation under oligotrophic condition the relevant mechanisms were further elucidated in section 3 3 and 3 4 the enhancement of 3 mg c g 1 of com on ee2 degradation was stronger than that of 3 mg c g 1 of mom despite the stronger organic carbon removal in 3m g than that in 3c g after 1 month of incubation the reason for this inconsistency may be due to that the com contained a higher content of microbial humic like c3 which could act as structural analogues to activate more enzymes that can readily transform estrogens without increasing the population of degraders tan et al 2015 meanwhile the biodegradable fractions in autochthonous like om were also transformed into the microbial derived substances in the incubation thus the subtle complementation of the cometabolism of biodegradable organic carbon and the stimulated degradation activity by microbial humic like matters resulted in the similar ee2 degradation in com and mom amended sediments at the end of incubation 3 3 responses of bacterial activity to om input 3 3 1 eps production as shown in fig 2 a the concentrations of total extracellular proteins in the control were significantly lower than those in om amended sediment over the incubation p 0 05 on day 30 the input of com and mom at 1 mg c g 1 both showed a weaker promotion on the production of extracellular proteins than those at 3 mg c g 1 whereas the concentrations were significantly lower in 3h g than in h g p 0 05 at the end of incubation no significant difference was observed among the 1 mg c g 1 of om amended sediments but the final concentration followed the order of 3m g 3c g 3h g furthermore the protein concentrations in c eps and b eps both increased with the autochthonous like om whereas ha only enhanced the secretion of proteins in b eps which was more evident in 3h g as for the polysaccharides secretion the input of com and mom at 1 mg c g 1 did not significantly increase the polysaccharides concentration in c eps but significantly promoted their production in b eps p 0 05 fig 2b in comparison the polysaccharides secretions in c eps and b eps were both enhanced with the input of three om at 3 mg c g 1 except the c eps in 3h g on day 30 the total concentration of polysaccharides followed the order of 3c g 3m g 3h g on day 30 whereas the order changed to 3m g 3h g 3c g on day 60 a similar pattern was observed in the distribution of polysaccharides in c eps but the final polysaccharides secretion in b eps followed the order of 3m g 3h g 3c g these results suggesting that the production of c eps was mainly promoted by com and mom at higher concentrations whereas the three om exhibited a more similar effect on the secretion of b eps also although the promotion of autochthonous like om on eps production was stronger than that of ha in the first month the ha showed a significant enhancement on the secretion of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides at the end of incubation the production of eps is directly related to the fundamental adaptations that microbial aggregates utilize to enhance activity and survival when exposed to toxicant stress flemming et al 2016 nevertheless the available carbon source could also increase the bacterial number and promoted eps secretion in sediments leading to a positive correlation between total eps concentrations and biodegradable concentrations in om fig s8 the spearman s correlations also showed that the tryptophan and tyrosine like fractions were significantly and positively related to the protein concentrations in eps on day 30 and polysaccharides concentrations were positively related to the tyrosine like fractions fig s9 however the ha may also increase the eps concentration through binding due to its large surface areas and strong bindings sites with aliphatic aromatic and carboxylic groups in eps yang et al 2018 this explained the observations that the final eps concentrations in ha amended sediments were comparable to those in sediments amended with autochthonous like om even though the toc decrease was relatively lower additionally the low extracellular enzyme activity in ha amended sediments see section 3 3 2 also contributed to the gradual accumulation of eps with incubation which was consistent with the higher concentration of eps in 3h g on day 60 than on day 30 it was proposed that the increased eps secretion was favorable to the self organization of bacterial cells into biofilm coordinating cell cell chemical communication and facilitating the trapping of contaminants decho and gutierrez 2017 thus the input of autochthonous like om may encapsulate more ee2 in spatial proximity to bacterial cells and promote its hydrolysis by extracellular enzymes localized in the eps matrix moreover the abundant proteins and polysaccharides in eps also increased the erosion threshold of the sediment and help the stability of biofilm which is an effective external digestion system for the microbial community 3 3 2 exctracelular enzyme activity five extracellular enzyme activities were investigated to compare the metabolic activity of bacterial communities in the water sediment systems after 30 days of incubation the input of om at 1 mg c g 1 increased ua activity from 227 64 to 255 92 327 65 u g significantly lower than those in the 3 mg c g 1 of om amended sediments p 0 05 figure 3a while the activity of ua followed the order of 3c g 3m g 3h g on day 30 they were close to each other at the end of incubation also no significant difference was observed among the final npa activity in om amended sediments even though the promotion of com and mom at 3 mg c g 1 was significantly stronger than ha on day 30 figure 3b the 3 mg c g 1 of autochthonous like om significantly increased fda activity p 0 05 but the final fda activity was similar in c g m g and h g figure 3c for the dha the com at 1 mg c g 1 increased dha activity more strongly than the mom whereas the dha in 3m g was the most active at the end of incubation figure 3d moreover the presence of ha at 3 mg c g 1 showed no significant effect on dha activity spearman s correlations showed that the ua fda and dha activities were significantly and positively related to the proteinaceous tyrosine like matter in om on day 30 fig s9 therefore the input of autochthonous like om mostly presented a positive but temporary effect on the activity of extracellular enzymes and the stimulation was related to the quantity and quality of om the activity of extracellular enzymes could be regarded as an indicator of the microbial community detoxification of exogenous compounds the higher ua activity in com and mom amended sediments suggested that the abundant nitrogen bearing compounds e g proteins peptides and amino acids in autochthonous like om were the available nitrogen source of bacteria and enhance the cycling of nitrogen in sediments as most of the sediment microorganisms can produce proteases to hydrolyze peptide bonds which link amino acids together in the polypeptide chain vranova et al 2013 the existence of protein like components in com and mom also increased the npa activity nonetheless the added nutrients were gradually mineralized with the organic matter degradation thereby the npa activities decreased the high activity of fda also suggested the strong microbial metabolic activity in om amended sediment adam and duncan 2001 as a key enzyme in carbon processing and its activity dha transports electrons and hydrogen through a chain of intermediate electron carriers to a final electron acceptor oxygen simčič 2005 so the increased activity of dha could be attributed to the respiratory potential and redox status involved in the intense decomposition of com and mom in general the enhancement of ua npa fda and dha activities demonstrated that the presence of aom created an active microbial community in the microcosms which may include an enhanced metabolism of ee2 3 4 responses of bacterial community structure to om input 3 4 1 bacterial community composition a total of 307 680 sequences were generated and assigned to 1588 otus at 97 identity table s1 the calculated coverage 98 95 99 18 indicated that the library was sufficiently large to yield stable phylotype richness estimates according to qpcr analysis the existence of com and mom were more favorable to bacterial growth on day 30 whereas a long term exposure to ha also increased the growth of biomass fig s10 the chao1 values suggested that the bacterial diversity was higher in com amended sediments than in other microcosms on day 30 and the diversity further increased at the end of incubation the result of pcoa analysis indicated a temporal variability in the evolution of bacterial community composition during the 2 months of incubation fig s11 the bacterial community in 3c g was distinguished from others on day 30 whereas the bacterial communities in 3c g and 3m g were closed to each other and differed from those in c g and m g in the end this result highlighted the sensitivity of bacterial community composition to the concentration of autochthonous like om furthermore the bacterial community in 3h g was similar to those amended with 1 mg c g 1 of ha implying that the roles of recalcitrant substances in shaping bacterial community were also dependent on its quality the distributions of major phyla identified in the sediment including proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae and bacteroidetes varied substantially with the om amendment over the incubation fig s12 to clarify the responses of specific bacterial groups to om quantity and quality the spearman s correlations between the intensity of each fluorescent om component and the bacterial relative abundances at class and genus levels were determined fig 4 a and b deltaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria along with nitrospira were clustered together and positively related to the concentration of proteinaceous components c1 and c2 over the incubation similarly the proteinaceous tyrosine like matter exhibited a positive effect on the distribution of alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidia in contrast the classes latescibacteria and verruomirobiae were negatively related to the concentration of protein like substances on day 60 furthermore as some microbes were outcompeted with the depletion of labile carbon the correlations possessed a temporal variability for example the significant positive relationship between bacteroidia and humic like c3 and c5 diminished with the evolution at the end of incubation this trend was also pronounced for gemmatimonadetes which was positively related to the microbial humic like component c3 only on day 60 at genus levels the clustered genera sulfurifustis and bsv26 and nitrospira were positively related to the input of protein like components a similar pattern was also observed in the genus pseudomonas belonging to gammaproteobacteria cooccurrence networks were further constructed based on spearman s correlations between otus and fluorescent om components fig 4c and d and fig s13 positive correlations accounted for more than half of the total correlations in both networks table s2 the topological properties of the networks suggested that the networks were clustered modular and formed a small world topology herein only the co occurrence network on day 60 was further interpreted to obtain the facilitative interaction between microbial taxa and fluorescent components the number of connections of the five fluorescent components followed the order of c1 c4 c2 c3 c5 the two proteinaceous c1 and c2 were divided into the same module module 1 in which the connections were more diverse than other modules the humic like c4 and c5 were clustered into module 2 while the microbial humic like c3 was assigned into module 4 module division provides information for the detection of specific functions of different groups of nodes the keystone species positively associated with c1 and c2 were the otus belonging to alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes whereas acidobacteria was negatively associated with the proteinaceous components fig s14 the c3 c4 and c5 were mainly negatively correlated with the otus belonging to deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and nitrospirae but positively correlated with some taxa belonging to acidobacteria and actinobacteria moreover the dense correlations between the otus indicated that the microorganisms had strong interspecific interactions in decomposing the biodegradable om components considering the higher biodegradability of proteinaceous components than of humic components the selectively enriched and actively growing microbial community should mainly contain a high proportion of active labile and semilabile om degraders the growth of copiotrophic taxa e g proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were previously found to exhibit rapid growth rates under long term om augmentation and associated with carbon rich regimes mccarren et al 2010 traving et al 2017 moreover pseudomonas was also reported to be the dominant genus in microcosms amended with labile carbon ghosh and leff 2013 it is therefore not surprising that the relative abundance of pseudomonas was positively related to the concentration of protein like components the growth of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in om amended sediments may have an intrinsic potential to degrade estrogens zhang et al 2019 even though the contribution of key phylotypes in bacterial community to ee2 degradation was not yet clearly evident numerous genera belonging to pseudomonas were reported to have an advantage in consuming estrogens as the organic carbon source zhang et al 2016 what is more the stronger associations between proteinaceous substances and community members suggested that microorganisms tended to more co occurrences and aggregations in the utilization of autochthonous like om than those in ha degradation the facilitative interactions among microbes whose inche space may be relatively complementary could orchestrate microbial communities to develop spontaneous adaptation and metabolic plasticity for contaminant degradation yan et al 2019 therefore the enhanced ee2 degradation was not only resulted from the varieties in community richness or species abundance but also related to the stimulated metabolic pathways involved in interspecies syntrophic cooperations in the aom amended sediments 3 4 2 bacterial community functions the relative abundance of kegg orthologs predicted by picrust showed that om input led to a clear shift in functional gene components over the incubation fig s15 seven components in kegg pathways were associated with the predicted functional genes including approximately 51 associated with metabolism 16 with genetic information processing and 14 with environmental information processing the further investigation of changes in metabolic function genes was conducted because of their greatest proportion in 3 mg c g 1 of om amended microcosms fig 5 among them carbohydrate metabolism was the most abundant followed by amino acid metabolism lipid and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism these groups showed a significant increase after the input of autochthonous like om p 0 05 the greater pathways of metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids suggested that the rate of carbon turnover and the utilization capacity of carbon sources were higher in the com and mom amended groups the tryptophan and tyrosine like organic matter could be important primary metabolites driving microbial metabolism and biosynthesis whereas a high percentage of humic components were used to cause lower functional genes that are linked to carbohydrate and xenobiotics metabolism li et al 2020 moreover the high molecular weight substances in com and mom may also induce a significant upregulation in the functional genes involved in lipid metabolism mccarren et al 2010 accordingly the upregulation of metabolism largely relied on the stimulation of labile om components the increase in microbial individuals associated with xenobiotics degradation accounted for the upregulation of ee2 degradation the drug metabolism by cytochrome p450 classified at level 3 plays an important role in catalyzing the oxidation reaction of numerous chemicals including lipids steroidal hormones and xenobiotic substances such as drugs and other toxic chemicals ortiz de montellano 2015 also the simultaneous increase in amino acid carbohydrate and xenobiotic metabolism genes confirmed the appearance of cometabolism in ee2 degradation although the metagenomic results reflect the metabolic potentials rather than the real capability expressed by microbes and estrogens have not been documented in the kegg database for degradation pathway the significant increase of xenobiotic biodegradation potentials demonstrated that the input of autochthonous like om increased ee2 degradation in sediments not only through increasing the bacterial community activity but also through reshaping the bacterial functional genes nonetheless this does not mean that water quality will improve if more aom is released the depletion of excessive om can create an anaerobic environment that is generally unfavorable to estrogen degradation in deeper sediments future researches will be performed to investigate the dual roles of om input in mediating the degradation of estrogens at average environmental levels i e i by providing the carbon source to microbes and thus increases estrogen degradation and ii by creating the anaerobic environment and then inhibits estrogen degradation 4 conclusions climate change and increasing eutrophication are projected to increase the biological production of autochthonous om in freshwater lakes this study has given insight into the priming effect of autochthonous om input on bacterial community and subsequent ee2 degradation ability in the water sediment system of one eutrophic lake bacterial metabolic activities including extracellular enzyme activity and eps secretion was stimulated with the cometabolism of increased biodegradable organic carbon in com and mom amended sediments the biodegradable components in om were also the key factors reshaping the bacterial community to a more eutrophic state enhancing the facilitative interactions among microbes and leading to an upregulation in metabolic functional genes of organic carbon and xenobiotics the changes in bacterial community activity composition and function significantly promoted the degradation of ee2 suggesting that cyanobacterial blooms dominated zones may be potential hotspot areas for estrogen attenuation in eutrophic freshwater lakes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17667,climate change and increasing eutrophication are expected to increase the release of autochthonous organic matter om to sediments where most contaminants are transformed or mineralized in freshwater lakes this study sought to evaluate how cyanobacteria and macrophyte derived om com and mom affected the microbial attenuation of 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in the sediment from eutrophic lake taihu in china in two months of water sediment microcosm experiments the input of com and mom both promoted ee2 degradation more strongly than humic acids and the degradation efficiency was significantly and positively correlated with the cometabolism of increasing organic carbon in sediments p 0 001 the enhanced degradation was explained by responses of indigenous bacterial community to om amendment as a priming effect the immediate breakdown of biodegradable components such as proteinaceous substances in com and mom remarkably augmented the metabolic activity of bacteria in terms of the stimulated activity of extracellular enzymes including fluorescein diacetate and dehydrogenase as well as the elevated production of proteins and polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances in the meantime the bacterial community composition was reshaped toward a more eutrophic state leading to the clear upregulation of metabolic function genes of organic carbon and xenobiotics correlation based network analysis further determined the strong facilitative coordination between the community members and the compositional variability of om in the cometabolism these results suggest that cyanobacterial blooms dominated zones are potential hotspot areas for steroid estrogen attenuation a finding of significance for the control and management of complex pollution in freshwater lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords autochthonous organic matter bacterial community cyanobacterial bloom degradation estrogens sediment 1 introduction the widespread steroid estrogens have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their thousands time higher estrogenic potency than other major pharmaceuticals and personal care products lai et al 2002 exposure to estrogens at extremely low levels can have the potential to alter secondary sex characteristics disrupt endocrine function and activate hormone responses of aquatic species and their offspring van den belt et al 2004 unfortunately estrogens are frequently released into a variety of environmental matrixes including groundwaters surface waters and sediments through the wastewater discharge animal waste disposal and runoff of field applied hormone bearing materials zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 specifically sediments are expected to be a substantial sink for estrogens after their deposition in the associated water column peck et al 2004 the degradation by high densities of diverse microorganisms is a prominent mechanism for the nonconservative i e destructive attenuation of estrogenic activity in sediments yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 commonly the ambient concentrations of emerging contaminants are not sufficient to maintain the growth of heterotrophic bacteria or to induce the expression of relevant degrading enzymes egli 2010 instead natural organic matter om a heterogeneous mixture of complex organic matter such as amino acids proteins carbohydrates and humic acids ha is the most important carbon and energy source for heterotrophic bacteria traving et al 2017 our previous research showed that the growth and degradation capacity of an isolated ee2 degrading strain increased with the bioavailability of dissolved om in the water phase bai et al 2019 however most contaminant degrading strains are co localized with multi species communities in the natural environment and the degradation occurs through the coordinated functioning of a multi members metabolic network yan et al 2019 also the interspecies syntrophic interactions such as sharing intermediates are regulated by carbon source through the selection and activation of microbial guilds therefore the environment specific metabolic network in contaminant degradation is determined by om in two ways i shaping the microbial community by selecting the microbes which have the potential to metabolize substrates and ii stimulating the expression of metabolic pathways involved in interspecies syntrophic cooperations in the case the two processes are both closely associated with the concentration and structure of om in the past decades climate change and increasing eutrophication have increased the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and the overgrowth of macrophytes in freshwater lakes paul 2008 the input of autochthonous om aom which is produced in the growth and decay of cyanobacteria and macrophytes significantly changes the om concentration and composition in sediments zhang et al 2017 unlike the sediment om that is mainly composed of terrestrial and recalcitrant substances aom includes a considerable fraction of biochemically well defined compounds and exhibits high biodegradability in productive ecosystems bai et al 2017 song et al 2020 microbial processing of aom was found to change the microbial community composition and metabolic function for example phytoplankton derived om could increase the production of extracellular polymeric substance eps and enhance the survival metabolic efficiency and adaptation of biofilm decho and gutierrez 2017 the microbial communities metabolizing aquatic plants and algal derived om also exhibited a better ability to remove certain xenobiotics compounds in surface waters fono et al 2006 lim et al 2008 the response of contaminant degradation to om supply varies substantially due to their different bioavailabilities however previous studies involving the effect of om on estrogen degradation mostly used single easily or refractory end members e g glucose peptone and humic acid du et al 2017 racz et al 2012 while these compounds all present at various concentrations in aom causing the difficulty in translating the existing results to the lake sediment system it also remains a question how the increasing aom input affected estrogen attenuation through regulating the metabolic network of bacterial community such as metabolic activities interspecies interactions and functional genes to unequivocally assess how increasing aom input affected the microbial degradation of estrogens in sediments the water sediment microcosm studies were carried out over 2 months employing the natural sediments collected from lake taihu a typical eutrophic freshwater lake in china the most biologically active estrogen ee2 was selected as the target contaminant van den belt et al 2004 the fresh cyanobacteria and macrophyte derived om com and mom sampled from lake taihu were used as the autochthonous like om the impact of om quantity and quality on ee2 degradation was firstly determined then the responses of bacterial metabolic activity were investigated in terms of extracellular enzyme activity and eps production furthermore the evolution of indigenous bacterial community was systematically described with high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing in terms of population composition structures and metabolic genes results of this study will provide a deeper insight into the fate and toxicity of estrogens in surface waters under increasing eutrophication and further climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation sediment samples were collected from the meiliang bay of lake taihu in july 2018 with the sunny weather conditions and 30 c air temperature fig s1 a total of three replicate samples were collected from the surface sediment 0 15 cm using a peterson grab sampler and then mixed into a single sample bag once transported to the lab on ice the sediment samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve and thoroughly homogenized microcystis aeruginosa and potamogeton malaianus the most abundant algal and submerged species in lake taihu ma et al 2008 were collected from the cyanobacteria dominated region of meiliang bay and the macrophyte dominated region of xukou bay in lake taihu respectively fig s2 then the com and mom were leached from the biomass as described in supporting information si the ha

2 2 water sediment microcosm experiments the water sediment microcosms were conducted in a series of 250 ml incubation bottles covered with aluminum foil to avoid the pass of light fig s3 10 g of sediment 50 ml synthetic lake water and 2 μg g 1 of ee2 dry weight basis as eutrophic lakes may receive wastewater discharge including estrogens at levels up to several μg l 1 zhou et al 2012 the spiked concentration of ee2 was relatively higher than the environmental relevant concentrations zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 but comparable to those in studies involving estrogen degradation in sediments sarmah and northcott 2008 yang et al 2016 ying and kookana 2003 a total of eight treatments were created with various om amendments 1 com at 1 mg c g 1 dry weight basis c g 2 com at 3 mg c g

accounted for approximately 15 and 40 respectively of the background toc concentration 7 4 0 2 mg c g 1 in the sediment these dosages were selected according to previous findings that the average contribution of autochthonous sources to the toc in sediments from lake taihu was around 34 zhang et al 2017 for each treatment six replicate bottles were performed and a total of 48 bottles were finally set up the detailed procedure to set up water sediment microcosms were further described in si the bottles were then incubated at 25 c in dark and sampled on day 0 30 and 60 at each sampling two bottles were sacrificed from each treatment and duplicates were collected from each bottle consequently four replicates were obtained for each treatment for the toc and ee2 quantification the overlying water and sediments were mixed and lyophilized for the analysis of enzyme activity eps and microbial communities only the sediments were collected 2 3 analysis of eps and extracellular enzymes the structure of eps existing in sediments is depicted by a two layer model colloidal eps c eps and bound eps b eps the extraction of c eps and b eps was carried out using a published dowex resin method yang et al 2018 briefly the sediment was firstly suspended in a 0 05 w w nacl solution for the c eps extraction and then the sediment was re suspended in nacl solution containing activated dowex 50wx8 hydrogen form 200 400 mesh sigma aldrich mo usa to extract the b eps the protein and polysaccharides concentrations in eps were determined using the modified lowry method and

obtain the composition information of com mom and ha the lyophilized om was re dissolved in milli q water at 15 mg c l 1 in triplicate then the absorption and fluorescent spectra of om solutions were collected in a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan and a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan respectively the excitation emission matrix spectra eems were corrected for water raman scatter peaks inner filter effects and rayleigh scattering effects in matlab r2012a embedded with dreems toolbox ver 0 2 0 murphy et al 2013 afterward the specific parameters including specific uv absorbance suva254 spectral slope ratio s r and biological index bix were calculated according to published methods hansen et al 2016 parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was employed to identify fluorescent components using dreems toolbox murphy et al 2013 the ee2 in lyophilized samples were extracted via ultrasonic extraction and quantified using an agilent 7890a gas chromatography coupled with a 5975c mass spectrometer gc ms after derivation detailed information about the analytical methodology is given in si for om characterization average values and standard deviations were calculated from the analysis of triplicates using one sample t test in statistical package for social science spss software version 22 0 ibm usa for the analysis of ee2 toc enzyme activity and eps production the average values and standard deviations were calculated from the analysis of four replications for each treatment for all statistical analyses a p value of 0 05 was considered statistically significant a parametric one way analysis of variance anova coupled with a post hoc comparison was used to test for significant differences in ee2 degradation toc removal enzyme activity and eps production a parametric two way anova was used to determine the influences of om quantity and quality on ee2 degradation toc removal enzyme activity and eps production the normality independence and equality of variance of data were verified with spss spearman correlations between om fluorescent components and bacterial community activity and compositions were also performed in spss moreover correlation based networks were constructed based on otus in combination with fluorescent components using the vegan and psych packages in r software the otus with occurrence in more than 75 of the samples were selected all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between the relative abundance of selected otus and the intensity of each fluorescent component were calculated only the correlations with r 0 6 and p value 0 01 were incorporated into networks network visualization and module detection were performed in the interactive platform gephi webatlas paris france 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of autochthonous like om the main characteristics of the two autochthonous like om and ha were shown in table 1 the absorbance of com and mom was remarkably lower than that of ha indicating their low humification degrees fig s4 the values of suva254 also suggested that a large fraction of the cyanobacteria and macrophyte leachate included aliphatic compounds that do not absorb at 254 nm hansen et al 2016 with steeper slope ratios reflective of greater amounts of low molecular weight compounds hansen et al 2016 the values of s r implied that the average molecular weight of com and mom was larger than that of ha this was because the molecular weights of biomacromolecules such as proteins released from biomass were higher than those of humic substances xu et al 2020 as an indicator corresponding to the recently produced om of autochthonous origin hansen et al 2016 the values of bix demonstrated that com and mom were derived from microbial sources extracellular release and leachate from cyanobacteria and macrophyte through eem parafac analysis a total of five fluorescent components were identified and matched with other published models in the openfluor database similarity score 0 95 murphy et al 2014 component 1 c1 and component 2 c2 were assigned into the proteinaceous tryptophan and tyrosine like matter respectively component 3 c3 was assigned into the microbial humic like matter produced from algae or macrophytes component 4 c4 was assigned into the humic like matter and component 5 c5 was assigned into a combination of the traditionally defined humic like peak a and c respectively fig s5 and fig s6 this was in keeping with the former findings that the leachates from phytoplankton and macrophytes contained fluorescent components similar to peak a and peak c zhang et al 2013 which were usually considered as originating from allochthonous on the basis of fluorescence intensity the proteinaceous substances accounted for 49 and 70 of com and mom fluorescent components respectively whereas 97 of the fluorescent compounds in ha were attributed to humic like substances the complex composition and structure of autochthonous like om highlighted the necessity of employing natural om instead of end members when investigating the role of om in contaminant degradation 3 2 degradation of ee2 in water sediment systems as displayed in fig 1 a the concentration of ee2 remarkably declined and the final removal efficiency reached to 44 99 at the end of incubation the limited loss of ee2 less than 8 in abiotic control proved that abiotic process such as chemical hydrolysis chemical reduction and irreversible sorption sarmah and northcott 2008 played a minor role in the degradation fig s7 also the absence of organic carbon and microbes in the overlying water restricted the biotic removal in the water phase suggesting that the ee2 was primarily removed via microbial degradation in the sediment the degradation efficiencies of ee2 in om amended sediments except h g were significantly higher than the control p 0 05 moreover the promotive effect of om showed a significant concentration dependent character for the same quality p 0 001 however the ee2 degradation rate in c g and m g was comparable to that in 3h g suggesting the important role of om quality in determining estrogen degradation the addition of com and mom at equal concentration exhibited a similar enhancement on ee2 degradation at the end of incubation even though the degradation efficiency in 3c g was significantly higher than that in 3m g on day 30 p 0 001 in comparison the existence of ha had a much weaker promotion on ee2 degradation over the incubation the significant interaction between om quantity and quality on ee2 degradation was also presented using two way anova analysis p 0 001 on day 30 and 60 with the degradation of ee2 the organic carbon content in the water sediment system also decreased fig 1b similarly the degradation rate was dependent on om quantity and quality p 0 001 after 2 months of incubation the addition of 3 mg c g 1 of com and mom increased the average toc removal from 1 26 mg c g 1 to 4 03 mg c g 1 and 4 08 mg c g 1 respectively the similar toc removal in c g m g and 3h g indicated that the biodegradable fractions in com and mom were approximately three times higher than those in ha it was further found that the toc removal in water sediment systems was positively correlated with ee2 degradation efficiency p 0 001 fig 1c this synchronous decrease in toc and ee2 concentration provided strong evidence that ee2 was prominently cometabolically degraded by bacteria together with the utilization of organic carbon the degradation of ee2 has been reported in simulated aquatic environments under aerobic conditions even though it shows a level of resistance to microbial degradation the ee2 degradation rate in this study was similar to that in marine sediments ying and kookana 2003 but lower than those in estuarine and river sediments sarmah and northcott 2008 yang et al 2016 the various degradation rates were mostly due to the differences in the experimental matrixes such as concentration sediment properties microbial biomass and water chemistry the estrogen degradation rates in sediments were reported positively correlated with the background concentrations of nutrients organic carbon zhang et al 2019 and microbial biomass li et al 2005 nevertheless a similar study found that the sediment chemical properties and indigenous microbial community in lake taihu were inherently detrimental to 17β estradiol degradation zhang et al 2019 moreover the experiment design including the higher concentration of ee2 the absence of carbon source in overlying water and the lower ratio of sediment to water also contributed to the slow degradation capacity in this study it should be noted that the obtained results may differ from the ee2 degradation rates in real situations in which the average environmental concentrations of ee2 were relatively low considering the significant accelerative effect of com within a short time the trace amount of estrogens would be more sensitive to the com input estrogens can be sorbed onto om possibly decreasing their bioavailability to bacteria lee et al 2011 nonetheless the higher ee2 degradation rates in microcosms with 3 mg c g 1 of om than those with 1 mg c g 1 of om demonstrated that the sorption of om played a secondary role in ee2 degradation so the enhanced ee2 degradation was largely attributed to the responses of microbial communities although some critical catabolites in bacterial metabolism e g glucose could inhibit the ring cleavage of estrogens li et al 2008 the contents of these compounds in autochthonous like om at environmental concentrations were not enough to reach the threshold values thus the biomass grown on increasing concentrations of organic carbon exhibited stronger growth and activity than those in oligotrophic conditions moreover the stronger degradation of ee2 and organic carbon in com and mom amended microcosms than in ha amended microcosms confirmed that the biodegradable organic carbon rather than the bulk organic carbon was the determining factor as the labile organic carbon could enhance the mineralization of recalcitrant substances that failed to sustain active microbial populations and thereby the production of enzymes trevathan tackett et al 2018 it was speculated that the ready mineralization of labile substrates in com and mom stimulated the metabolic activity of potential degraders and enhanced the ee2 degradation under oligotrophic condition the relevant mechanisms were further elucidated in section 3 3 and 3 4 the enhancement of 3 mg c g 1 of com on ee2 degradation was stronger than that of 3 mg c g 1 of mom despite the stronger organic carbon removal in 3m g than that in 3c g after 1 month of incubation the reason for this inconsistency may be due to that the com contained a higher content of microbial humic like c3 which could act as structural analogues to activate more enzymes that can readily transform estrogens without increasing the population of degraders tan et al 2015 meanwhile the biodegradable fractions in autochthonous like om were also transformed into the microbial derived substances in the incubation thus the subtle complementation of the cometabolism of biodegradable organic carbon and the stimulated degradation activity by microbial humic like matters resulted in the similar ee2 degradation in com and mom amended sediments at the end of incubation 3 3 responses of bacterial activity to om input 3 3 1 eps production as shown in fig 2 a the concentrations of total extracellular proteins in the control were significantly lower than those in om amended sediment over the incubation p 0 05 on day 30 the input of com and mom at 1 mg c g 1 both showed a weaker promotion on the production of extracellular proteins than those at 3 mg c g 1 whereas the concentrations were significantly lower in 3h g than in h g p 0 05 at the end of incubation no significant difference was observed among the 1 mg c g 1 of om amended sediments but the final concentration followed the order of 3m g 3c g 3h g furthermore the protein concentrations in c eps and b eps both increased with the autochthonous like om whereas ha only enhanced the secretion of proteins in b eps which was more evident in 3h g as for the polysaccharides secretion the input of com and mom at 1 mg c g 1 did not significantly increase the polysaccharides concentration in c eps but significantly promoted their production in b eps p 0 05 fig 2b in comparison the polysaccharides secretions in c eps and b eps were both enhanced with the input of three om at 3 mg c g 1 except the c eps in 3h g on day 30 the total concentration of polysaccharides followed the order of 3c g 3m g 3h g on day 30 whereas the order changed to 3m g 3h g 3c g on day 60 a similar pattern was observed in the distribution of polysaccharides in c eps but the final polysaccharides secretion in b eps followed the order of 3m g 3h g 3c g these results suggesting that the production of c eps was mainly promoted by com and mom at higher concentrations whereas the three om exhibited a more similar effect on the secretion of b eps also although the promotion of autochthonous like om on eps production was stronger than that of ha in the first month the ha showed a significant enhancement on the secretion of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides at the end of incubation the production of eps is directly related to the fundamental adaptations that microbial aggregates utilize to enhance activity and survival when exposed to toxicant stress flemming et al 2016 nevertheless the available carbon source could also increase the bacterial number and promoted eps secretion in sediments leading to a positive correlation between total eps concentrations and biodegradable concentrations in om fig s8 the spearman s correlations also showed that the tryptophan and tyrosine like fractions were significantly and positively related to the protein concentrations in eps on day 30 and polysaccharides concentrations were positively related to the tyrosine like fractions fig s9 however the ha may also increase the eps concentration through binding due to its large surface areas and strong bindings sites with aliphatic aromatic and carboxylic groups in eps yang et al 2018 this explained the observations that the final eps concentrations in ha amended sediments were comparable to those in sediments amended with autochthonous like om even though the toc decrease was relatively lower additionally the low extracellular enzyme activity in ha amended sediments see section 3 3 2 also contributed to the gradual accumulation of eps with incubation which was consistent with the higher concentration of eps in 3h g on day 60 than on day 30 it was proposed that the increased eps secretion was favorable to the self organization of bacterial cells into biofilm coordinating cell cell chemical communication and facilitating the trapping of contaminants decho and gutierrez 2017 thus the input of autochthonous like om may encapsulate more ee2 in spatial proximity to bacterial cells and promote its hydrolysis by extracellular enzymes localized in the eps matrix moreover the abundant proteins and polysaccharides in eps also increased the erosion threshold of the sediment and help the stability of biofilm which is an effective external digestion system for the microbial community 3 3 2 exctracelular enzyme activity five extracellular enzyme activities were investigated to compare the metabolic activity of bacterial communities in the water sediment systems after 30 days of incubation the input of om at 1 mg c g 1 increased ua activity from 227 64 to 255 92 327 65 u g significantly lower than those in the 3 mg c g 1 of om amended sediments p 0 05 figure 3a while the activity of ua followed the order of 3c g 3m g 3h g on day 30 they were close to each other at the end of incubation also no significant difference was observed among the final npa activity in om amended sediments even though the promotion of com and mom at 3 mg c g 1 was significantly stronger than ha on day 30 figure 3b the 3 mg c g 1 of autochthonous like om significantly increased fda activity p 0 05 but the final fda activity was similar in c g m g and h g figure 3c for the dha the com at 1 mg c g 1 increased dha activity more strongly than the mom whereas the dha in 3m g was the most active at the end of incubation figure 3d moreover the presence of ha at 3 mg c g 1 showed no significant effect on dha activity spearman s correlations showed that the ua fda and dha activities were significantly and positively related to the proteinaceous tyrosine like matter in om on day 30 fig s9 therefore the input of autochthonous like om mostly presented a positive but temporary effect on the activity of extracellular enzymes and the stimulation was related to the quantity and quality of om the activity of extracellular enzymes could be regarded as an indicator of the microbial community detoxification of exogenous compounds the higher ua activity in com and mom amended sediments suggested that the abundant nitrogen bearing compounds e g proteins peptides and amino acids in autochthonous like om were the available nitrogen source of bacteria and enhance the cycling of nitrogen in sediments as most of the sediment microorganisms can produce proteases to hydrolyze peptide bonds which link amino acids together in the polypeptide chain vranova et al 2013 the existence of protein like components in com and mom also increased the npa activity nonetheless the added nutrients were gradually mineralized with the organic matter degradation thereby the npa activities decreased the high activity of fda also suggested the strong microbial metabolic activity in om amended sediment adam and duncan 2001 as a key enzyme in carbon processing and its activity dha transports electrons and hydrogen through a chain of intermediate electron carriers to a final electron acceptor oxygen simčič 2005 so the increased activity of dha could be attributed to the respiratory potential and redox status involved in the intense decomposition of com and mom in general the enhancement of ua npa fda and dha activities demonstrated that the presence of aom created an active microbial community in the microcosms which may include an enhanced metabolism of ee2 3 4 responses of bacterial community structure to om input 3 4 1 bacterial community composition a total of 307 680 sequences were generated and assigned to 1588 otus at 97 identity table s1 the calculated coverage 98 95 99 18 indicated that the library was sufficiently large to yield stable phylotype richness estimates according to qpcr analysis the existence of com and mom were more favorable to bacterial growth on day 30 whereas a long term exposure to ha also increased the growth of biomass fig s10 the chao1 values suggested that the bacterial diversity was higher in com amended sediments than in other microcosms on day 30 and the diversity further increased at the end of incubation the result of pcoa analysis indicated a temporal variability in the evolution of bacterial community composition during the 2 months of incubation fig s11 the bacterial community in 3c g was distinguished from others on day 30 whereas the bacterial communities in 3c g and 3m g were closed to each other and differed from those in c g and m g in the end this result highlighted the sensitivity of bacterial community composition to the concentration of autochthonous like om furthermore the bacterial community in 3h g was similar to those amended with 1 mg c g 1 of ha implying that the roles of recalcitrant substances in shaping bacterial community were also dependent on its quality the distributions of major phyla identified in the sediment including proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae and bacteroidetes varied substantially with the om amendment over the incubation fig s12 to clarify the responses of specific bacterial groups to om quantity and quality the spearman s correlations between the intensity of each fluorescent om component and the bacterial relative abundances at class and genus levels were determined fig 4 a and b deltaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria along with nitrospira were clustered together and positively related to the concentration of proteinaceous components c1 and c2 over the incubation similarly the proteinaceous tyrosine like matter exhibited a positive effect on the distribution of alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidia in contrast the classes latescibacteria and verruomirobiae were negatively related to the concentration of protein like substances on day 60 furthermore as some microbes were outcompeted with the depletion of labile carbon the correlations possessed a temporal variability for example the significant positive relationship between bacteroidia and humic like c3 and c5 diminished with the evolution at the end of incubation this trend was also pronounced for gemmatimonadetes which was positively related to the microbial humic like component c3 only on day 60 at genus levels the clustered genera sulfurifustis and bsv26 and nitrospira were positively related to the input of protein like components a similar pattern was also observed in the genus pseudomonas belonging to gammaproteobacteria cooccurrence networks were further constructed based on spearman s correlations between otus and fluorescent om components fig 4c and d and fig s13 positive correlations accounted for more than half of the total correlations in both networks table s2 the topological properties of the networks suggested that the networks were clustered modular and formed a small world topology herein only the co occurrence network on day 60 was further interpreted to obtain the facilitative interaction between microbial taxa and fluorescent components the number of connections of the five fluorescent components followed the order of c1 c4 c2 c3 c5 the two proteinaceous c1 and c2 were divided into the same module module 1 in which the connections were more diverse than other modules the humic like c4 and c5 were clustered into module 2 while the microbial humic like c3 was assigned into module 4 module division provides information for the detection of specific functions of different groups of nodes the keystone species positively associated with c1 and c2 were the otus belonging to alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes whereas acidobacteria was negatively associated with the proteinaceous components fig s14 the c3 c4 and c5 were mainly negatively correlated with the otus belonging to deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and nitrospirae but positively correlated with some taxa belonging to acidobacteria and actinobacteria moreover the dense correlations between the otus indicated that the microorganisms had strong interspecific interactions in decomposing the biodegradable om components considering the higher biodegradability of proteinaceous components than of humic components the selectively enriched and actively growing microbial community should mainly contain a high proportion of active labile and semilabile om degraders the growth of copiotrophic taxa e g proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were previously found to exhibit rapid growth rates under long term om augmentation and associated with carbon rich regimes mccarren et al 2010 traving et al 2017 moreover pseudomonas was also reported to be the dominant genus in microcosms amended with labile carbon ghosh and leff 2013 it is therefore not surprising that the relative abundance of pseudomonas was positively related to the concentration of protein like components the growth of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in om amended sediments may have an intrinsic potential to degrade estrogens zhang et al 2019 even though the contribution of key phylotypes in bacterial community to ee2 degradation was not yet clearly evident numerous genera belonging to pseudomonas were reported to have an advantage in consuming estrogens as the organic carbon source zhang et al 2016 what is more the stronger associations between proteinaceous substances and community members suggested that microorganisms tended to more co occurrences and aggregations in the utilization of autochthonous like om than those in ha degradation the facilitative interactions among microbes whose inche space may be relatively complementary could orchestrate microbial communities to develop spontaneous adaptation and metabolic plasticity for contaminant degradation yan et al 2019 therefore the enhanced ee2 degradation was not only resulted from the varieties in community richness or species abundance but also related to the stimulated metabolic pathways involved in interspecies syntrophic cooperations in the aom amended sediments 3 4 2 bacterial community functions the relative abundance of kegg orthologs predicted by picrust showed that om input led to a clear shift in functional gene components over the incubation fig s15 seven components in kegg pathways were associated with the predicted functional genes including approximately 51 associated with metabolism 16 with genetic information processing and 14 with environmental information processing the further investigation of changes in metabolic function genes was conducted because of their greatest proportion in 3 mg c g 1 of om amended microcosms fig 5 among them carbohydrate metabolism was the most abundant followed by amino acid metabolism lipid and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism these groups showed a significant increase after the input of autochthonous like om p 0 05 the greater pathways of metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids suggested that the rate of carbon turnover and the utilization capacity of carbon sources were higher in the com and mom amended groups the tryptophan and tyrosine like organic matter could be important primary metabolites driving microbial metabolism and biosynthesis whereas a high percentage of humic components were used to cause lower functional genes that are linked to carbohydrate and xenobiotics metabolism li et al 2020 moreover the high molecular weight substances in com and mom may also induce a significant upregulation in the functional genes involved in lipid metabolism mccarren et al 2010 accordingly the upregulation of metabolism largely relied on the stimulation of labile om components the increase in microbial individuals associated with xenobiotics degradation accounted for the upregulation of ee2 degradation the drug metabolism by cytochrome p450 classified at level 3 plays an important role in catalyzing the oxidation reaction of numerous chemicals including lipids steroidal hormones and xenobiotic substances such as drugs and other toxic chemicals ortiz de montellano 2015 also the simultaneous increase in amino acid carbohydrate and xenobiotic metabolism genes confirmed the appearance of cometabolism in ee2 degradation although the metagenomic results reflect the metabolic potentials rather than the real capability expressed by microbes and estrogens have not been documented in the kegg database for degradation pathway the significant increase of xenobiotic biodegradation potentials demonstrated that the input of autochthonous like om increased ee2 degradation in sediments not only through increasing the bacterial community activity but also through reshaping the bacterial functional genes nonetheless this does not mean that water quality will improve if more aom is released the depletion of excessive om can create an anaerobic environment that is generally unfavorable to estrogen degradation in deeper sediments future researches will be performed to investigate the dual roles of om input in mediating the degradation of estrogens at average environmental levels i e i by providing the carbon source to microbes and thus increases estrogen degradation and ii by creating the anaerobic environment and then inhibits estrogen degradation 4 conclusions climate change and increasing eutrophication are projected to increase the biological production of autochthonous om in freshwater lakes this study has given insight into the priming effect of autochthonous om input on bacterial community and subsequent ee2 degradation ability in the water sediment system of one eutrophic lake bacterial metabolic activities including extracellular enzyme activity and eps secretion was stimulated with the cometabolism of increased biodegradable organic carbon in com and mom amended sediments the biodegradable components in om were also the key factors reshaping the bacterial community to a more eutrophic state enhancing the facilitative interactions among microbes and leading to an upregulation in metabolic functional genes of organic carbon and xenobiotics the changes in bacterial community activity composition and function significantly promoted the degradation of ee2 suggesting that cyanobacterial blooms dominated zones may be potential hotspot areas for estrogen attenuation in eutrophic freshwater lakes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

contributed equally to this work and should be considered co first authors lake surface water temperature lswt is an important factor in lake ecological environments it has been observed that lswt have followed an upward trend in the last half century which has had serious impacts on regional biodiversity and climate it is important to understand the main reason for this phenomenon in order to have a basis for controlling and improving the regional ecological environment in this study the contribution rates of near surface air temperature nsat surface pressure sp surface solar radiation ssr total cloud cover tcc wind speed ws and secchi depth sd to lswt of 11 naturally formed lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau are quantified the characteristics of and relationships between the various factors and lswt in lakes of different types and attributes are revealed the results show that 1 from 2001 to 2018 most lakes were warming the change rate of lswt day was higher than that of lswt night the mean comprehensive warming rate mcwr of lswt day was 0 42 c decade and the mean comprehensive change rate mccr was 0 31 c decade the mcwr of lswt night was 0 19 c decade and the mccr was 0 01 c decade nsat and ssr were most strongly correlated with lswt day night there were no large seasonal differences in the correlation between nsat and lswt day while seasonal differences in the correlations between nsat with lswt night and ssr with lswt day night were observed 2 nsat and ssr were the most important factors affecting lswt day night changes with contribution rates of 30 24 and 44 34 respectively lswt day was more affected by sp and ssr in small shallow and low storage lakes for larger lakes lswt day was more affected by ws while lswt night was greatly affected by tcc urban and semi urban lakes were more affected by ssr and nsat for natural lakes the decreasing sd affected the increases in lswt which indirectly reflects the impact of human activities lswt day night responded differently to different morphological characteristics of the lakes and different intensities of human activity graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake surface water temperature plateau lake yunnan guizhou plateau driving factor contribution rate 1 introduction lakes are important ecological resources the ecological environment of lake is not only associated with the quality of the regional ecological environment but also the sustainable development of cities dokulil 2014 zhang et al 2015 joseph et al 2012 it can also reflect the status of the regional environment dokulil 2014 water temperature is a basic physical property and an important environmental condition it affects the metabolism of organisms living in the lake as well as the decomposition of organic materials and determines the primary productivity of lakes sharma et al 2007 lake surface water temperature lswt can directly reflect the material and energy exchange processes of the water land atmosphere system and can also serve as an indicator of climate change and human activities yang et al 2019 he et al 2019 weber et al 2018 o reilly 2015 zhang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 changes in the lswt would have a dynamic and complex fatal impact on the physical biological and chemical processes occurring in the lake ecological environment adrian et al 2009 o reilly et al 2015 in the past 30 years the lswts of most lakes around the world have risen rapidly at an average rate of 0 34 c decade which could lead to ecological problems such as the prolongation of the cyanobacteria suitable growth period and the aggravation of eutrophication environmental problems such as the prolongation of the lake thermal stratification period the increase of thermocline depth and strength and hypoxia at the bottom of lakes with increased o reilly 2015 the rise in lswt caused by climate change is a large scale and long term effect which has been confirmed by many studies conducted around the world o reilly et al 2003 o reilly et al 2015 however some serious ecological environmental problems associated with lakes have been driven by short term environmental conditions missaghi et al 2017 found that the minnetoka lswt increased up to 4 c during the ice free seasons resulting in a significant reduction in the size of the freshwater fish habitat o reilly et al 2003 showed that the tanganyika lswt had been increasing at a rate of 0 1 c decade since 1913 with climate warming and regional wind speed reduction this warming had also affected the stability of the lake as a result of which the primary productivity may have decreased by about 20 implying a roughly 30 decrease in fish yields at the same time lake warming would lead to an increase in the frequency of cyanobacteria bloom outbreaks by 20 o reilly et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 constructed a dataset of climate drivers near surface air temperature surface solar radiation cloud cover and lake morphology parameters longitude latitude altitude lake area etc that affected lswt changes in 291 lakes worldwide sharma et al 2015 based on this dataset o reilly et al 2015 demonstrated that the regional near surface air temperature and geomorphology had a greater impact on lswt than other factors schmid and koster 2016 showed that increases in near surface air temperature and surface solar radiation were the main reasons for the increase in lswt in spring and summer with contribution rates of 60 and 40 respectively in addition to near surface air temperature and surface solar radiation several other factors have also been shown to affect the lswt schmid and koster 2016 increased wind speed tended to decrease the lswt due to increased evaporation tanentzap et al 2008 valerio et al 2015 woolway et al 2018 secchi depth can be used to calculate the light attenuation and stronger light attenuation was found to cause the lswt to rise in spring and summer but the shallower thermocline caused the lswt to fall faster in autumn heiskanen et al 2015 hocking and straskraba 1999 rinke et al 2010 in particular lswt values in daytime or nighttime showed different warming characteristics and need to be considered separately especially in small and shallow lakes wan et al 2017 woolway et al 2016 to sum up the observation that lswts are gradually rising has become a consensus in the academic community climate warming was the main factor leading to increasing lswts but the impact of differences in spatial heterogeneity on lswt is also worthy of in depth study therefore based on previous research yang et al 2016 2017 2018a 2018b 2019 2020 luo et al 2018 2019 yu et al 2019 2020 the 11 naturally formed lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau were selected for study the lswt change characteristics from january 2001 to december 2018 were analyzed the contribution rates of six factors near surface air temperature surface solar radiation etc were quantified and the characteristics and the relationships of those six factors to different lake attributes and lake types are discussed this work provides methodological reference and theoretical support for the analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of regional lswt increases 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yunnan guizhou plateau is one of the most typical karst landforms in the world the 11 naturally formed plateau lakes support abundant natural resources diverse ethnic cultures and unique ecological environments in the yunnan guizhou plateau the differences in lake depth eutrophication water quality and land use types in the watershed can provide abundant research samples these lakes reserve nearly 5 of the freshwater resources of china they all have a surface area of more than 25 km2 including nine lakes in yunnan province dianchi erhai fuxian chenghai lugu yilong qilu xingyun and yangzonghai lake 1 in guizhou province caohai lake and 1 in sichuan province qionghai lake the names and major characteristics of these lakes are shown in table a1 and table a2 respectively and their geographical locations are shown in fig 1 among these lakes fuxian and lugu lakes are the second and third deepest freshwater lakes in china while dianchi and erhai lakes are the first and second largest freshwater lakes in yunnan province respectively chenghai lake is the second largest freshwater lake in western yunnan province and qionghai lake is the second largest freshwater lake in sichuan province dianchi erhai and fuxian lakes each has a surface area of more than 200 km2 while the other lakes have an area of less than 80 km2 each from 2005 to 2018 the eutrophication status of dianchi lake was hyper eutropher fuxian and lugu lakes were oligotropher 3 lakes yilong qilu and xingyun lake were middle eutropher and the other 5 lakes were mesotropher the annual mean of lswt day of 4 lakes chenghai lugu yilong and qionghai lakes was higher than 20 c while that of lswt night of 2 lakes lugu and caohai lakes was lower than 10 c table a2 2

solar radiation bias 48 28 w m2 total cloud cover bias 9 32 and wind speed bias 1 91 m s were obtained from the era interim dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and wind speed values were calculated from the u and v wind speed components 10 m u v wind component as shown in eq 1 specifically ws i is the wind speed on the ith day while u and v are the 10 m u v wind components respectively 1 w s i u i 2 v i 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend analysis method theil sen slope ts slope estimation is a nonparametric estimation method that was used here to estimate the change rate cr of time series data this estimation method can handle censored regression models and is insensitive to outliers for skew and heteroscedastic data it is more accurate than non robust simple linear regression even for normally distributed data and non robust least squares this method has obvious advantages especially for data with chaotic properties the expression for the theil sen slope is given in eq 2 where median is the median function x i and x j are series data t i and t j are the time points corresponding to the series data n is the series length and i and j are the series number 1 i j n when ts slope 0 this indicates an upward trend otherwise it indicates a downward trend the higher the value of ts slope the stronger the trend 2 t s s l o p e m e d i a n x j x i t j t i in order to express the change rates of parameters in different scales this paper uses a comprehensive change rate ccr which avoids the limitations of a single dimension the comprehensive change rate was calculated as the average of the annual change rate ts year the seasonal spring summer autumn and winter change rate ts season and the monthly january to december change rate ts month as shown in eq 3 where mean represents the mean function and the mean comprehensive change rate mccr is the average ccr of 11 lakes for the mean comprehensive warming rate mcwr only the warming rates are considered and the cooling rates are excluded 3 t s c o m p r e h e n s i v e m e a n t s y e a r t s s e a s o n t s m o n t h 2 3 2 contribution analysis method the δ r 2 values of multivariate regressions were used to calculate the contribution rates a detailed description of this analysis method is presented in appendix b 2 4 multivariate regression analysis δ r 2 can be used to describe the explanatory power of a newly added independent variable to the dependent variable as shown in eq 4 here r b e f o r e 2 is the r 2 of the original regression model and r a f t e r 2 is the r 2 of the regression model after adding the new independent variable 4 δ r 2 r a f t e r 2 r b e f o r e 2 2 3 3 correlation analysis method pearson s correlation coefficient is one of the metrics used to describe the relationships among the variables this comparison method uses the covariance matrix of the data to evaluate the strength of the relationship between two vectors normally the pearson s correlation coefficient between two variables α i and α j can be calculated as shown in eq 5 where cov α i α j is the covariance var α i is the variance of α i and var α j is the variance of α j pearson s correlation coefficient was also used in cross correlation analysis podobnik et al 2008 5 r α i α j c o v α i α j v a r α i v a r α j 3 results 3 1 characteristics of lake surface water

for six factors for each lake and the monthly mean lswt day night are shown in fig 3 for the 11 lakes the correlation between nsat and lswt was the highest rnsat day 0 83 rnsat night 0 81 followed by that between ssr and tcc rssr day 0 46 rtcc day 0 54 rssr night 0 66 rtcc night 0 38 sd was the lowest rsd day 0 017 rsd night 0 026 while sp and ws were negatively correlated rsp day 0 46 rws day 0 19 rsp night 0 32 rws night 0 19 according to the analysis for each lake the factors with pearson s correlation coefficients higher than 0 6 were considered as high correlation factors as shown in table a5 for lswt day the most highly correlated factors of yilong and caohai lakes were found to be sp ssr and nsat for xingyun and yangzonghai lakes sp and nsat for qilu lake nsat for lugu lake ssr and for the other five lakes dianchi fuxian erhai chenghai and qionghai lakes the high correlation factors were found to be nsat and tcc for lswt night the high correlation factors of yilong lake were sp ssr and nsat those of fuxian and chenghai lakes were nsat those of erhai lake were nsat and tcc and those of the other 7 lakes dianchi xingyun qilu yangzonghai lugu qionghai and caohai lakes were ssr and nsat of the correlations between different factors and lswt day as shown in fig a3 a f those of sp and tcc were lower but relatively higher in summer those of ssr and nsat were higher especially in winter but lower in summer and autumn those of sds in all four seasons were close slightly higher in winter and relatively lower in spring and summer that of ws was lower in summer but higher in other seasons in terms of the correlations between different factors and lswt night as shown in fig a3 g l the four seasons resulted in clear changes except for sd and ws the correlation with sd in spring was lower but higher in autumn and winter the correlation with ws was higher in spring but the correlation values in other seasons were close in autumn sp showed an opposite correlation compared to the other seasons that is higher in autumn and lower in other seasons the correlation coefficients of ssr were closer in autumn and winter as were those in spring and summer the correlation with nsat was higher in winter lower in summer and close in spring and autumn the correlation coefficients of tcc were close in summer and winter but higher in autumn cross correlation analysis results are shown in table a6 and all factors were found to be statistically significant α 0 05 except sd in general tcc exhibited a first order lag ssr and sp for lswt day exhibited first order lead ssr exhibited 5th order lag for lswt night and wd exhibited 2nd order lag for lswt day and 8th order lag for lswt night the different factors almost maintained the same time lag at different scales it is necessary to mention that sp exhibited a different time lag in each lake type in terms of lswt day the natural lakes yang et al 2019 were different from the other types urban and semi urban lakes yang et al 2019 exhibited 5th order lag while natural lakes exhibited 1st order lead for lswt night semi urban and natural lakes were close with 5th 4th order lag respectively while urban lakes showed 2nd order lead the trend in the cross correlation coefficients was almost same as that in the pearson s coefficients but the values were higher 3 2 2 contribution rate analysis the overall contribution rates of each factor to lswt day night are shown in fig 4 the multiple linear regression equations are shown in table a7 eq a1 a2 in these equations lswt day and lswt night represent lswt day and lswt night respectively two equations can express the contributions of six variables to lswt day night which were 61 94 and 64 40 respectively the remaining 38 06 and 35 60 contributions are attributed to other factors for lswt day nsat ssr and tcc contributed 42 79 for lswt night nsat and ssr contributed 44 34 for lswt day and lswt night nsat contributed the most conrday 18 50 conrnight 30 41 followed by ssr conrday 11 74 conrnight 13 93 while ws contributed the least conrday 6 11 conrnight 0 00 the mean contribution rates of the six factors to lswt day night were found to be 81 02 and 75 96 respectively and that of nsat was the highest conrday 34 85 conrnight 32 77 ssr and tcc exhibited the second highest rates conrssr day 13 62 conrssr night 21 88 conrtcc day 16 05 conrtcc night 8 84 that of sd was the lowest conrday 0 19 conrnight 0 17 for lswt day nsat tcc ssr and sp were the main impact factors conrday 76 16 for lswt night nsat and ssr were the main impact factors conrday 54 65 for all 11 lakes the contribution rates of each factor to lswt day night were different as shown in table a8 the variables with contribution rates higher than 10 were regarded as the main impact factors 4 discussion from 2001 to 2018 the lswt day night values of most lakes showed a warming trend the mean comprehensive change rate of lswt day was 0 31 c decade which is approaching global lake warming rates o reilly 2015 the mean comprehensive change rate of lswt night was 0 01 c decade the mean comprehensive change rate of nsat was 0 25 c decade and the mean comprehensive change rates of nsat and lswt day were relatively close the rising trend of lswt day in the 11 naturally formed lakes was consistent with that observed in most lakes in the world o reilly et al 2015 the governance plan for urbanization expansion put forward by the government had a certain impact on lswt changes in the watershed the average altitude of the yunnan guizhou plateau is about 1881 m and the solar radiation in the east is lower than that in the west the distribution of solar radiation is relatively uniform in each month of the year the population distribution is relatively concentrated in the low altitude areas of central and southeast yunnan with serious urbanization and expansion the number of impervious surfaces increased resulting in increased runoff temperature the influence of human activities had caused changes in the regional land surface temperature humidity air convection and other factors related to urban surface area resulting in urban heat island and rain island effects lawrence 1971 jáuregui and romales 1996 adamowski and prokoph 2013 which in turn affected the lswt furthermore in the past thirty years the total area of lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau showed a trend of rising first and then falling which was mainly attributed to the four year lingering drought and man made damage to the lake environment from 2009 to 2012 xiao et al 2018 the main reason for the decrease in lake area was urban expansion and lake shrinkage would also cause the lswt rise the spatial heterogeneity of the lswt changes was related to lake morphology parameters woolway and merchant 2017 2018 and human activities yang et al 2019 4 1 lake surface water temperature variation characteristics of different lake types in previous studies yang et al 2019 the 11 lakes considered here were divided into three types urban lakes dianchi and qilu lakes semi urban lakes erhai yilong qionghai yangzonghai and caohai lakes and natural lakes fuxian xingyun lugu and chenghai lakes on this basis lswt day night change trends in different lake types were analyzed as shown in fig 5 for lswt day all the three lake types exhibited rising values the comprehensive warming rate of urban lakes was higher than that of the others and the warming rates of semi urban and natural lakes were almost the same crul 0 58 c decade crsul 0 25 c decade crnl 0 26 c decade for lswt night urban and semi urban lakes showed a cooling trend while natural lakes showed a warming trend crul 0 19 c decade crsul 0 0039 c decade crnl 0 12 c decade and the cooling rates of qilu and yilong lakes were higher crqll 0 4 c decade cryll 0 94 c decade apart from these lakes qilu and yilong lakes urban and semi urban lakes showed warming trends crul 0 03 c decade crsul 0 23 c decade considering the correlations between each factor and lswt day the seasonal differences in sp and nsat were small while the values for urban and semi urban lakes were higher than those of natural lakes the sd of natural lakes was higher than that of the other lakes and the ws of semi urban lakes was higher especially in the winter ssr and tcc changed greatly with the season the ssr was higher in spring and winter for natural lakes while summer and autumn showed higher values for urban and semi urban lakes for tcc semi urban lakes were higher in spring natural lakes were higher in summer urban and semi urban lakes were higher in winter and tcc showed little variation in autumn sp and nsat were closely related to the urban heat island effect adamowski and prokoph 2013 and were greatly affected by human activities so natural lakes showed lower values than the other lakes the sd of the natural lakes was higher and the fluctuation range was larger than that of the other lakes so the correlation coefficients of sd for urban and semi urban lakes were lower most of the semi urban lakes were located in the southern part of the yunnan guizhou plateau which is the low altitude region ws was affected by terrain and climate and values were smaller fan and thomas 2013 with dense cities ws and lswt were more affected by human activities so the correlation was higher than for the other areas tcc was closely related to the rain island effect lawrence 1971 jáuregui and romales 1996 in winter urban heat emissions were higher than in other areas so the natural lakes exhibited lower values in lswt night there were little seasonal differences for sp and sd sp was higher in natural lakes sd was higher in urban and semi urban lakes and ssr was higher in natural and urban lakes nsat was higher in the natural lakes ws in summer was higher in natural and urban lakes and changed little in the other lakes while ws was relatively higher in the natural lakes tcc changed more in spring and summer urban and semi urban lakes exhibited higher tcc autumn was gentle and in winter tcc was higher for natural lakes the intensity of human activity is greatly reduced at night but still remains much higher in the urban areas than in other areas cao et al 2009 especially in summer and autumn therefore urban and semi urban lakes were more affected by human activities nsat was more sensitive to human activities than lswt ye et al 2013 the correlation between lswt night and nsat urban and semi urban lakes was lower than for natural lakes and the influence of human activities at night cannot be ruled out nsat in non urban areas at night was affected by fewer other factors so the correlation coefficient for natural lakes was higher in terms of the contribution of each factor to the lswt of different lake types the regression equations are shown in table a7 eq a3 a8 and the contribution rates are shown in table a9 the overall contribution of the six factors for the three lake types was higher than 60 while the urban lakes exhibited the highest values conrall day 83 60 conrall night 78 49 for urban and semi urban lakes the main factors affecting lswt day were found to be ssr nsat and tcc of which nsat was the most important impact factor conrul 43 49 conrsul 38 12 ssr and nsat were found to be the main factors affecting lswt night with contributions reaching 65 95 and 56 52 respectively for natural lakes the impact of the six factors on lswt day was small the main contributing factors were sp ssr tcc and sd the contribution rate of the main factors was 52 18 sp nsat and sd were determined to be the main factors affecting lswt day with a contribution rate of 64 56 schmid and koster 2016 showed evidence that ssr and nsat were the main influencing factors of lswt and that the contribution rate of ssr was 60 while that of nsat was 40 these results are slightly different from ours the above results show that the driving factors and their contributions are not the same for different types of lakes which might be related to the intensity of human activity and the distribution of differences in lake morphology 4 2 lake surface water temperature variation characteristics with different morphological becker and daw 2005 and woolway and merchant 2017 2018 showed that the morphological characteristics of lakes had a significant impact on lswt and the main influencing factors included lake area depth and storage in this paper the 11 lakes were divided into three types by k means clustering with these factors as shown in table a10 the areas of fuxian dianchi and erhai lakes are all greater than 200 km2 while the areas of the other lakes were within 25 80 km2 the storage and depth of fuxian lake are the highest of the 11 lakes dianchi and erhai lakes are close to the urban area in lswt day dianchi erhai and fuxian lakes were mainly affected by nsat tcc and ws while nsat and tcc had particularly high contribution rates conrnsat2 28 57 conrnsat3 37 20 conrtcc2 23 30 conrtcc3 26 91 while other lakes were mainly affected by sp ssr nsat and tcc of which nsat had the highest contribution rate conrnsat1 35 06 in lswt night dianchi erhai and fuxian lake were mainly affected by ssr and nsat under the impact of tcc nsat had a high contribution rate conrnsat2 27 05 conrnsat3 38 13 while other lakes were mainly affected by ssr and nsat with a contribution rate of 56 02 even if the attributes of the lakes were different nsat was still the most important factor affecting lswt and ssr was the second main factor in the small shallow and low storage lakes lswt day was more affected by sp and ssr for large lakes fuxian dianchi and erhai lakes ws had a greater impact on lswt day night in summary considering the dual impact of human activities and climate change urban and semi urban lakes more strongly influenced by human activities were more affected by ssr and nsat and the contributions of the six factors were higher in these two lake types indicating that the urban heat island effect caused by the expansion of impervious surface area and the increase in surface runoff temperature in the areas with more human activities resulted in higher lswt warming rates for lswt day tcc was also a factor with great influence more cloud enhanced atmospheric counter radiation and atmospheric insulation enabled nsat to stay in a higher state for natural lakes sp and sd were both important factors for lswt sd can directly reflect the water quality of a lake and indirectly reflect the changes in lake water quality caused by human activities the impact of nsat on lswt day was smaller which indicates that lakes were more sensitive to natural factors in the case of less point source pollution and a lake less affected by human activities moreover the higher contribution rate of sd also reflected the fact that lakes were more affected by humans 5 conclusion based on the dataset of lswt day night sp ssr nsat tcc ws and sd this paper analyzed the lswt day night values of the 11 major naturally formed lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau from january 1 2001 to december 31 2018 explored the main driving factors affecting the change of lswt day night and quantified the impact degree of each factor the characteristics of and relationships between the factors affecting lswt in lakes of different types and attributes were revealed which will provide new insight for further research into lake environments 1 in the past 18 years the lswt day night values of all 11 lakes showed a warming trend and lswt day was higher than lswt night in terms of lswt day nine lakes exhibited rising temperatures with a mean comprehensive warming rate of 0 42 c decade while yangzonghai and lugu lakes showed downward trends in lswt night 8 lakes showed upward trends with a mean comprehensive warming rate of 0 19 c decade while xingyun qilu and yilong lakes showed decreasing trends 2 the results of correlation analysis showed that nsat and lswt day night had the strongest correlation for all the 11 lakes rnsat day 0 83 rnsat night 0 81 while the correlations between tcc and lswt day and ssr and lswt night were the second largest rtcc day 0 54 rssr night 0 66 correlation analysis for each lake showed that nsat and lswt day were the most strongly correlated while ssr and sp were the second most strongly correlated pair on the seasonal scale the correlations between nsat and lswt day were constant over each of the four seasons while the correlations between nsat and lswt night ssr and lswt day night varied greatly 3 contribution rate analysis showed that nsat and ssr were the most important factors affecting lswt day night and their contribution rates reached 30 24 and 44 34 respectively the lswt day values of smaller shallower and lower storage lakes were more affected by sp and ssr for larger lakes the lswt day values were more affected by ws the lswt night values were more affected by tcc the influence of ssr and nsat in urban and semi urban lakes was more serious which indicates that the urban heat island effect caused by the expansion of impervious surfaces and increases in runoff surface temperature in areas with higher degrees of human activity are responsible for higher lswt warming rates for natural lakes the decrease in sd was important to the increase in lswt which indirectly suggests that the impact of human activities on the water quality of lakes has caused the lswt to warm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

contributed equally to this work and should be considered co first authors lake surface water temperature lswt is an important factor in lake ecological environments it has been observed that lswt have followed an upward trend in the last half century which has had serious impacts on regional biodiversity and climate it is important to understand the main reason for this phenomenon in order to have a basis for controlling and improving the regional ecological environment in this study the contribution rates of near surface air temperature nsat surface pressure sp surface solar radiation ssr total cloud cover tcc wind speed ws and secchi depth sd to lswt of 11 naturally formed lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau are quantified the characteristics of and relationships between the various factors and lswt in lakes of different types and attributes are revealed the results show that 1 from 2001 to 2018 most lakes were warming the change rate of lswt day was higher than that of lswt night the mean comprehensive warming rate mcwr of lswt day was 0 42 c decade and the mean comprehensive change rate mccr was 0 31 c decade the mcwr of lswt night was 0 19 c decade and the mccr was 0 01 c decade nsat and ssr were most strongly correlated with lswt day night there were no large seasonal differences in the correlation between nsat and lswt day while seasonal differences in the correlations between nsat with lswt night and ssr with lswt day night were observed 2 nsat and ssr were the most important factors affecting lswt day night changes with contribution rates of 30 24 and 44 34 respectively lswt day was more affected by sp and ssr in small shallow and low storage lakes for larger lakes lswt day was more affected by ws while lswt night was greatly affected by tcc urban and semi urban lakes were more affected by ssr and nsat for natural lakes the decreasing sd affected the increases in lswt which indirectly reflects the impact of human activities lswt day night responded differently to different morphological characteristics of the lakes and different intensities of human activity graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake surface water temperature plateau

a dynamic and complex fatal impact on the physical biological and chemical processes occurring in the lake ecological environment adrian et al 2009 o reilly et al 2015 in the past 30 years the lswts of most lakes around the world have risen rapidly at an average rate of 0 34 c decade which could lead to ecological problems such as the prolongation of the cyanobacteria suitable growth period and the aggravation of eutrophication environmental problems such as the prolongation of the lake thermal stratification period the increase of thermocline depth and strength and hypoxia at the bottom of lakes with increased o reilly 2015 the rise in lswt caused by climate change is a large scale and long term effect which has been confirmed by many studies conducted around the world o reilly et al 2003 o reilly et al 2015 however some serious ecological environmental problems associated with lakes have been driven by short term environmental conditions missaghi et al 2017 found that the minnetoka lswt increased up to 4 c during the ice free seasons resulting in a significant reduction in the size of the freshwater fish habitat o reilly et al 2003 showed that the tanganyika lswt had been increasing at a rate of 0 1 c decade since 1913 with climate warming and regional wind speed reduction this warming had also affected the stability of the lake as a result of which the primary productivity may have decreased by about 20 implying a roughly 30 decrease in fish yields at the same time lake warming would lead to an increase in the frequency of cyanobacteria bloom outbreaks by 20 o reilly et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 constructed a dataset of climate drivers near surface air temperature surface solar radiation cloud cover and lake morphology parameters longitude latitude altitude lake area etc that affected lswt changes in 291 lakes worldwide sharma et al 2015 based on this dataset o reilly et al 2015 demonstrated that the regional near surface air temperature and geomorphology had a greater impact on lswt than other factors schmid and koster 2016 showed that increases in near surface air temperature and surface solar radiation were the main reasons for the increase in lswt in spring and summer with contribution rates of 60 and 40 respectively in addition to near surface air temperature and surface solar radiation several other factors have also been shown to affect the lswt schmid and koster 2016 increased wind speed tended to decrease the lswt due to increased evaporation tanentzap et al 2008 valerio et al 2015 woolway et al 2018 secchi depth can be used to calculate the light attenuation and stronger light attenuation was found to cause the lswt to rise in spring and summer but the shallower thermocline caused the lswt to fall faster in autumn heiskanen et al 2015 hocking and straskraba 1999 rinke et al 2010 in particular lswt values in daytime or nighttime showed different warming characteristics and need to be considered separately especially in small and shallow lakes wan et al 2017 woolway et al 2016 to sum up the observation that lswts are gradually rising has become a consensus in the academic community climate warming was the main factor leading to increasing lswts but the impact of differences in spatial heterogeneity on lswt is also worthy of in depth study therefore based on previous research yang et al 2016 2017 2018a 2018b 2019 2020 luo et al 2018 2019 yu et al 2019 2020 the 11 naturally formed lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau were selected for study the lswt change characteristics from january 2001 to december 2018 were analyzed the contribution rates of six factors near surface air temperature surface solar radiation etc were quantified and the characteristics and the relationships of those six factors to different lake attributes and lake types are discussed this work provides methodological reference and theoretical support for the analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of regional lswt increases 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yunnan guizhou plateau is one of the most typical karst landforms in the world the 11 naturally formed plateau lakes support abundant natural resources diverse ethnic cultures and unique ecological environments in the yunnan guizhou plateau the differences in lake depth eutrophication water quality and land use types in the watershed can provide abundant research samples these lakes reserve nearly 5 of the freshwater resources of china they all have a surface area of more than 25 km2 including nine lakes in yunnan province dianchi erhai fuxian chenghai lugu yilong qilu xingyun and yangzonghai lake 1 in guizhou province caohai lake and 1 in sichuan province qionghai lake the names and major characteristics of these lakes are shown in

the second largest freshwater lake in sichuan province dianchi erhai and fuxian lakes each has a surface area of more than 200 km2 while the other lakes have an area of less than 80 km2 each from 2005 to 2018 the eutrophication status of dianchi lake was hyper eutropher fuxian and lugu lakes were oligotropher 3 lakes yilong qilu and xingyun lake were middle eutropher and the other 5 lakes were mesotropher the annual mean of lswt day of 4 lakes chenghai lugu yilong and qionghai lakes was higher than 20 c while that of lswt night of 2 lakes lugu and caohai lakes was lower than 10 c table a2 2

wind components respectively 1 w s i u i 2 v i 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend analysis method theil sen slope ts slope estimation is a nonparametric estimation method that was used here to estimate the change rate cr of time series data this estimation method can handle censored regression models and is insensitive to outliers for skew and heteroscedastic data it is more accurate than non robust simple linear regression even for normally distributed data and non robust least squares this method has obvious advantages especially for data with chaotic properties the expression for the theil sen slope is given in eq 2 where median is the median function x i and x j are series data t i and t j are the time points corresponding to the series data n is the series length and i and j are the series number 1 i j n when ts slope 0 this indicates an upward trend otherwise it indicates a downward trend the higher the value of ts slope the stronger the trend 2 t s s l o p e m e d i a n x j x i t j t i in order to express the change rates of parameters in different scales this paper uses a comprehensive change rate ccr which avoids the limitations of a single dimension the comprehensive change rate was calculated as the average of the annual change rate ts year the seasonal spring summer autumn and winter change rate ts season and the monthly january to december change rate ts month as shown in eq 3 where mean represents the mean function and the mean comprehensive change rate mccr is the average ccr of 11 lakes for the mean comprehensive warming rate mcwr only the warming rates

regressions were used to calculate the contribution rates a detailed description of this analysis method is presented in appendix b 2 4 multivariate regression analysis δ r 2 can be used to describe the explanatory power of a newly added independent variable to the dependent variable as shown in eq 4 here r b e f o r e 2 is the r 2 of the original regression model and r a f t e r 2 is the r 2 of the regression model after adding the new independent variable 4 δ r 2 r a f t e r 2 r b e f o r e 2 2 3 3 correlation analysis method pearson s correlation coefficient is one of the metrics used to describe the relationships among the variables this comparison method uses the covariance matrix of the data to evaluate the strength of the relationship between two vectors normally the pearson s correlation coefficient between two variables α i and α j can be calculated as shown in eq 5 where cov α i α j is the covariance var α i is the variance of α i and var α j is the variance of α j pearson s correlation coefficient was also used in cross correlation analysis podobnik et al 2008 5 r α i α j c o v α i α j v a r α i v a r α j 3 results 3 1 characteristics of lake surface water

table a5 for lswt day the most highly correlated factors of yilong and caohai lakes were found to be sp ssr and nsat for xingyun and yangzonghai lakes sp and nsat for qilu lake nsat for lugu lake ssr and for the other five lakes dianchi fuxian erhai chenghai and qionghai lakes the high correlation factors were found to be nsat and tcc for lswt night the high correlation factors of yilong lake were sp ssr and nsat those of fuxian and chenghai lakes were nsat those of erhai lake were nsat and tcc and those of the other 7 lakes dianchi xingyun qilu yangzonghai lugu qionghai and caohai lakes were ssr and nsat of the correlations between different factors and lswt day as shown in fig a3 a f those of sp and tcc were lower but relatively higher in summer those of ssr and nsat were higher especially in winter but lower in summer and autumn those of sds in all four seasons were close slightly higher in winter and relatively lower in spring and summer that of ws was lower in summer but higher in other seasons in terms of the correlations between different factors and lswt night as shown in fig a3 g l the four seasons resulted in clear changes except for sd and ws the correlation with sd in spring was lower but higher in autumn and winter the correlation with ws was higher in spring but the correlation values in other seasons were close in autumn sp showed an opposite correlation compared to the other seasons that is higher in autumn and lower in other seasons the correlation coefficients of ssr were closer in autumn and winter as were those in spring and summer the correlation with nsat was higher in winter lower in summer and close in spring and autumn the correlation coefficients of tcc were close in summer and winter but higher in autumn cross correlation analysis results are shown in table a6 and all factors were found to be statistically significant α 0 05 except sd in general tcc exhibited a first order lag ssr and sp for lswt day exhibited first order lead ssr exhibited 5th order lag for lswt night and wd exhibited 2nd order lag for lswt day and 8th order lag for lswt night the different factors almost maintained the same time lag at different scales it is necessary to mention that sp exhibited a different time lag in each lake type in terms of lswt day the natural lakes yang et al 2019 were different from the other types urban and semi urban lakes yang et al 2019 exhibited 5th order lag while natural lakes exhibited 1st order lead for lswt night semi urban and natural lakes were close with 5th 4th order lag respectively while urban lakes showed 2nd order lead the trend in the cross correlation coefficients was almost same as that in the pearson s coefficients but the values were higher 3 2 2 contribution rate analysis the overall contribution rates of each factor to lswt day night are shown in fig 4 the multiple linear regression equations are shown in table a7 eq a1 a2 in these equations lswt day and lswt night represent lswt day and lswt night respectively two equations can express the contributions of six variables to lswt day night which were 61 94 and 64 40 respectively the remaining 38 06 and 35 60 contributions are attributed to other factors for lswt day nsat ssr and tcc contributed 42 79 for lswt night nsat and ssr contributed 44 34 for lswt day and lswt night nsat contributed the most conrday 18 50 conrnight 30 41 followed by ssr conrday 11 74 conrnight 13 93 while ws contributed the least conrday 6 11 conrnight 0 00 the mean contribution rates of the six factors to lswt day night were found to be 81 02 and 75 96 respectively and that of nsat was the highest conrday 34 85 conrnight 32 77 ssr and tcc exhibited the second highest rates conrssr day 13 62 conrssr night 21 88 conrtcc day 16 05 conrtcc night 8 84 that of sd was the lowest conrday 0 19 conrnight 0 17 for lswt day nsat tcc ssr and sp were the main impact factors conrday 76 16 for lswt night nsat and ssr were the main impact factors conrday 54 65 for all 11 lakes the contribution rates of each factor to lswt day night were different as shown in table a8 the variables with contribution rates higher than 10 were regarded as the main impact factors 4 discussion from 2001 to 2018 the lswt day night values of most lakes showed a warming trend the mean comprehensive change rate of lswt day was 0 31 c decade which is approaching global lake warming rates o reilly 2015 the mean comprehensive change rate of lswt night was 0 01 c decade the mean comprehensive change rate of nsat was 0 25 c decade and the mean comprehensive change rates of nsat and lswt day were relatively close the rising trend of lswt day in the 11 naturally formed lakes was consistent with that observed in most lakes in the world o reilly et al 2015 the governance plan for urbanization expansion put forward by the government had a certain impact on lswt changes in the watershed the average altitude of the yunnan guizhou plateau is about 1881 m and the solar radiation in the east is lower than that in the west the distribution of solar radiation is relatively uniform in each month of the year the population distribution is relatively concentrated in the low altitude areas of central and southeast yunnan with serious urbanization and expansion the number of impervious surfaces increased resulting in increased runoff temperature the influence of human activities had caused changes in the regional land surface temperature humidity air convection and other factors related to urban surface area resulting in urban heat island and rain island effects lawrence 1971 jáuregui and romales 1996 adamowski and prokoph 2013 which in turn affected the lswt furthermore in the past thirty years the total area of lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau showed a trend of rising first and then falling which was mainly attributed to the four year lingering drought and man made damage to the lake environment from 2009 to 2012 xiao et al 2018 the main reason for the decrease in lake area was urban expansion and lake shrinkage would also cause the lswt rise the spatial heterogeneity of the lswt changes was related to lake morphology parameters woolway and merchant 2017 2018 and human activities yang et al 2019 4 1 lake surface water temperature variation characteristics of different lake types in previous studies yang et al 2019 the 11 lakes considered here were divided into three types urban lakes dianchi and qilu lakes semi urban lakes erhai yilong qionghai yangzonghai and caohai lakes and natural lakes fuxian xingyun lugu and chenghai lakes on this basis lswt day night change trends in different lake types were analyzed as shown in fig 5 for lswt day all the three lake types exhibited rising values the comprehensive warming rate of urban lakes was higher than that of the others and the warming rates of semi urban and natural lakes were almost the same crul 0 58 c decade crsul 0 25 c decade crnl 0 26 c decade for lswt night urban and semi urban lakes showed a cooling trend while natural lakes showed a warming trend crul 0 19 c decade crsul 0 0039 c decade crnl 0 12 c decade and the cooling rates of qilu and yilong lakes were higher crqll 0 4 c decade cryll 0 94 c decade apart from these lakes qilu and yilong lakes urban and semi urban lakes showed warming trends crul 0 03 c decade crsul 0 23 c decade considering the correlations between each factor and lswt day the seasonal differences in sp and nsat were small while the values for urban and semi urban lakes were higher than those of natural lakes the sd of natural lakes was higher than that of the other lakes and the ws of semi urban lakes was higher especially in the winter ssr and tcc changed greatly with the season the ssr was higher in spring and winter for natural lakes while summer and autumn showed higher values for urban and semi urban lakes for tcc semi urban lakes were higher in spring natural lakes were higher in summer urban and semi urban lakes were higher in winter and tcc showed little variation in autumn sp and nsat were closely related to the urban heat island effect adamowski and prokoph 2013 and were greatly affected by human activities so natural lakes showed lower values than the other lakes the sd of the natural lakes was higher and the fluctuation range was larger than that of the other lakes so the correlation coefficients of sd for urban and semi urban lakes were lower most of the semi urban lakes were located in the southern part of the yunnan guizhou plateau which is the low altitude region ws was affected by terrain and climate and values were smaller fan and thomas 2013 with dense cities ws and lswt were more affected by human activities so the correlation was higher than for the other areas tcc was closely related to the rain island effect lawrence 1971 jáuregui and romales 1996 in winter urban heat emissions were higher than in other areas so the natural lakes exhibited lower values in lswt night there were little seasonal differences for sp and sd sp was higher in natural lakes sd was higher in urban and semi urban lakes and ssr was higher in natural and urban lakes nsat was higher in the natural lakes ws in summer was higher in natural and urban lakes and changed little in the other lakes while ws was relatively higher in the natural lakes tcc changed more in spring and summer urban and semi urban lakes exhibited higher tcc autumn was gentle and in winter tcc was higher for natural lakes the intensity of human activity is greatly reduced at night but still remains much higher in the urban areas than in other areas cao et al 2009 especially in summer and autumn therefore urban and semi urban lakes were more affected by human activities nsat was more sensitive to human activities than lswt ye et al 2013 the correlation between lswt night and nsat urban and semi urban lakes was lower than for natural lakes and the influence of human activities at night cannot be ruled out nsat in non urban areas at night was affected by fewer other factors so the correlation coefficient for natural lakes was higher in terms of the contribution of each factor to the lswt of different lake types the regression equations are shown in table a7 eq a3 a8 and the contribution rates are shown in table a9 the overall contribution of the six factors for the three lake types was higher than 60 while the urban lakes exhibited the highest values conrall day 83 60 conrall night 78 49 for urban and semi urban lakes the main factors affecting lswt day were found to be ssr nsat and tcc of which nsat was the most important impact factor conrul 43 49 conrsul 38 12 ssr and nsat were found to be the main factors affecting lswt night with contributions reaching 65 95 and 56 52 respectively for natural lakes the impact of the six factors on lswt day was small the main contributing factors were sp ssr tcc and sd the contribution rate of the main factors was 52 18 sp nsat and sd were determined to be the main factors affecting lswt day with a contribution rate of 64 56 schmid and koster 2016 showed evidence that ssr and nsat were the main influencing factors of lswt and that the contribution rate of ssr was 60 while that of nsat was 40 these results are slightly different from ours the above results show that the driving factors and their contributions are not the same for different types of lakes which might be related to the intensity of human activity and the distribution of differences in lake morphology 4 2 lake surface water temperature variation characteristics with different morphological becker and daw 2005 and woolway and merchant 2017 2018 showed that the morphological characteristics of lakes had a significant impact on lswt and the main influencing factors included lake area depth and storage in this paper the 11 lakes were divided into three types by k means clustering with these factors as shown in table a10 the areas of fuxian dianchi and erhai lakes are all greater than 200 km2 while the areas of the other lakes were within 25 80 km2 the storage and depth of fuxian lake are the highest of the 11 lakes dianchi and erhai lakes are close to the urban area in lswt day dianchi erhai and fuxian lakes were mainly affected by nsat tcc and ws while nsat and tcc had particularly high contribution rates conrnsat2 28 57 conrnsat3 37 20 conrtcc2 23 30 conrtcc3 26 91 while other lakes were mainly affected by sp ssr nsat and tcc of which nsat had the highest contribution rate conrnsat1 35 06 in lswt night dianchi erhai and fuxian lake were mainly affected by ssr and nsat under the impact of tcc nsat had a high contribution rate conrnsat2 27 05 conrnsat3 38 13 while other lakes were mainly affected by ssr and nsat with a contribution rate of 56 02 even if the attributes of the lakes were different nsat was still the most important factor affecting lswt and ssr was the second main factor in the small shallow and low storage lakes lswt day was more affected by sp and ssr for large lakes fuxian dianchi and erhai lakes ws had a greater impact on lswt day night in summary considering the dual impact of human activities and climate change urban and semi urban lakes more strongly influenced by human activities were more affected by ssr and nsat and the contributions of the six factors were higher in these two lake types indicating that the urban heat island effect caused by the expansion of impervious surface area and the increase in surface runoff temperature in the areas with more human activities resulted in higher lswt warming rates for lswt day tcc was also a factor with great influence more cloud enhanced atmospheric counter radiation and atmospheric insulation enabled nsat to stay in a higher state for natural lakes sp and sd were both important factors for lswt sd can directly reflect the water quality of a lake and indirectly reflect the changes in lake water quality caused by human activities the impact of nsat on lswt day was smaller which indicates that lakes were more sensitive to natural factors in the case of less point source pollution and a lake less affected by human activities moreover the higher contribution rate of sd also reflected the fact that lakes were more affected by humans 5 conclusion based on the dataset of lswt day night sp ssr nsat tcc ws and sd this paper analyzed the lswt day night values of the 11 major naturally formed lakes in the yunnan guizhou plateau from january 1 2001 to december 31 2018 explored the main driving factors affecting the change of lswt day night and quantified the impact degree of each factor the characteristics of and relationships between the factors affecting lswt in lakes of different types and attributes were revealed which will provide new insight for further research into lake environments 1 in the past 18 years the lswt day night values of all 11 lakes showed a warming trend and lswt day was higher than lswt night in terms of lswt day nine lakes exhibited rising temperatures with a mean comprehensive warming rate of 0 42 c decade while yangzonghai and lugu lakes showed downward trends in lswt night 8 lakes showed upward trends with a mean comprehensive warming rate of 0 19 c decade while xingyun qilu and yilong lakes showed decreasing trends 2 the results of correlation analysis showed that nsat and lswt day night had the strongest correlation for all the 11 lakes rnsat day 0 83 rnsat night 0 81 while the correlations between tcc and lswt day and ssr and lswt night were the second largest rtcc day 0 54 rssr night 0 66 correlation analysis for each lake showed that nsat and lswt day were the most strongly correlated while ssr and sp were the second most strongly correlated pair on the seasonal scale the correlations between nsat and lswt day were constant over each of the four seasons while the correlations between nsat and lswt night ssr and lswt day night varied greatly 3 contribution rate analysis showed that nsat and ssr were the most important factors affecting lswt day night and their contribution rates reached 30 24 and 44 34 respectively the lswt day values of smaller shallower and lower storage lakes were more affected by sp and ssr for larger lakes the lswt day values were more affected by ws the lswt night values were more affected by tcc the influence of ssr and nsat in urban and semi urban lakes was more serious which indicates that the urban heat island effect caused by the expansion of impervious surfaces and increases in runoff surface temperature in areas with higher degrees of human activity are responsible for higher lswt warming rates for natural lakes the decrease in sd was important to the increase in lswt which indirectly suggests that the impact of human activities on the water quality of lakes has caused the lswt to warm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17669,microalgae show great potential for wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery however microalgae cultivation and harvesting are affected by the low biomass concentrations which are inherent to the photoautotrophic growth process mixotrophic growth can be a solution as it increases microalgae biomass concentration independently from the incident light intensity in this work a combined respirometric titrimetric unit was used to assess the microalgae kinetics during such mixotrophic growth conditions for chlorella vulgaris based on the experimental results a microalgae model was extended in order to gain more insight in the delicate balance between photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth the results suggest that during heterotrophic growth with light in absence of external inorganic carbon sources i e photoheterotrophic growth all co2 produced by the heterotrophic pathway is internally recycled for photoautotrophic growth moreover it was shown that photoautotrophic growth is the preferential growth mechanism under mixotrophic cultivation conditions i e light inorganic carbon organic carbon but that high oxygen concentrations activate the heterotrophic growth pathway to avoid photorespiration the extended microalgae model supports these findings with good model performance for all conducted experiments graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae mixotrophy gas exchange respirometry titrimetry modelling 1 introduction in recent years the trend towards a circular economy has become more pronounced in that perspective conventional wastewater treatment plants are now also considered as resource recovery plants that recover the energy from available carbon c sources i e lipids cellulose and polyhydroxyalkanoates stored inside the biomass puyol et al 2017 however with regard to nitrogen sources recovery is challenging a possible solution for this is the use of microalgae for wastewater treatment since microalgae are capable of storing both nitrogen and phosphorus inside their cells the harvested cells can then for example be used to extract pigments or lipids for biofuel production and the remaining biomass can be applied as a bio fertilizer arashiro et al 2020 cheirsilp and torpee 2012 the bottleneck for the use of microalgae however is the energy consuming harvesting step parmentier et al 2020 this is due to the high stability of the microalgae suspension in combination with a low biomass concentration the latter is inherent to the photoautotrophic growth process since the light penetration inside the microalgae suspension is inversely proportional to the biomass concentration liang et al 2009 a possible solution is selecting microalgae species which are capable of growing mixotrophically i e growing autotrophically and heterotrophically at the same time pang et al 2019 this process allows the microalgae to grow on organic carbon oc substrates when the incident light becomes limiting resulting in a higher biomass concentration with regard to this process martinez and orus 1991 reported that under non aerated conditions the mixotrophic growth rate μm is 20 higher than the sum of the autotrophic growth rate μa and the heterotrophic growth rate μh however this difference decreased with 10 when the cultures were aerated with air furthermore when aerating with air containing 2 co2 the difference became negligible martinez and orus 1991 it can be hypothesized that these differences might be due to the limiting co2 and o2 concentrations occurring under non aerated conditions to test this hypothesis the inorganic carbon ic and dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured in suspensions of the green microalgae species micractinium inermum under photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions smith et al 2015 the results indicated that the ic and do concentration were limiting under photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions respectively moreover during mixotrophic growth increased levels of ic and do were measured together with a 37 increase of μm in comparison with the sum of μa and μh it was therefore concluded that internal co2 and o2 exchange led to higher biomass growth during mixotrophic test conditions and that this growth advantage ceases without limiting ic and do concentrations i e when aerating the cultures with air containing 2 co2 indeed endogenous co2 produced during heterotrophic metabolism could be recycled preferably between the intracellular compartments rather than through the metabolically more energy expensive external incorporation grama et al 2016 however it was not experimentally assessed to which extent microalgae would recycle these endogenous sources and under which conditions this occurs it is clear from the experiments of smith et al 2015 that a part of the produced co2 and o2 will be excreted since increased values of ic and do were measured during mixotrophic growth when further increasing the co2 fraction in the air to 5 it was observed for chlorella protothecoides that the metabolization of the organic substrate was blocked under mixotrophic conditions thus cancelling the benefits of mixotrophic growth sforza et al 2012 this indicates that c protothecoides prefers growing photoautotrophically rather than mixotrophically under elevated ic concentrations on a biochemical level decreased rubisco activity and citrate synthase activity have been observed in chlorella zofingiensis during mixotrophic growth indicating a down regulation of the calvin and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle respectively zhang et al 2017 moreover gene expressions in chlorella sorokiniana under photoautotrophic and mixotrophic conditions showed an upregulation of the phospoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzyme during mixotrophic growth conditions cecchin et al 2018 this enzyme enables the potential recovery of c atoms lost by the oxidation of oc sources furthermore a downregulation of rubisco activase was observed but also an upregulation of the rubisco accumulation factor raf this indicates that during photoautotrophic growth rubisco activase had to be increased in order to catalyze the carbamylation of rubisco due to low co2 concentrations in contrast during mixotrophic growth the raf upregulation contributes to the assembly of the rubisco complex to improve c fixation cecchin et al 2018 these findings support the hypothesis of internal co2 recycling overall it can be concluded that there is a delicate balance driving the mixotrophic growth of microalgae enabling a fine regulation of the cell metabolism however more research is needed in order to gain insight into the driving factors of this balance in this research the mixotrophic microalgae growth was assessed with a combined respirometric titrimetric unit using chlorella vulgaris as an indicator species the goal was to 1 quantify the amount of co2 that was internally recycled during mixotrophic growth and 2 to assess the influence of elevated dissolved ic concentrations on the mixotrophic growth finally a previously developed microalgae model manhaeghe et al 2019 describing the photoautotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris was extended with the photo heterotrophic growth pathway in order to assess and validate the experimental data 2 material and methods 2 1 combined respirometric titrimetric unit the experimental data collection was done using the same respirometric titrimetric set up as in manhaeghe et al 2019 this set up consist of a 1 5 l heat jacketed reactor for temperature control operating volume of 1 3 l a stirrer at 250 rpm ika eurostar 20 digital to obtain a homogenous microalgae suspension and eight fluorescent lamps grolux t8 14w sylvania surrounding the reactor providing light 73 μmol m 2 s 1 a do probe inpro 6860 i 12 120 na mettler toledo and a ph probe inpro 4260 120 pt1000 mettler toledo allowed for online measurement the ph inside the reactor was controlled at 7 by using an on off algorithm in labview national instruments acid 0 25 mol l 1 hcl or base 0 25 mol l 1 naoh were dosed when the ph deviated from the desired interval of 6 90 7 10 each time acid or base was added the time during which the valve was open was recorded and the dosed volume of acid and base per unit of time was derived as such it was possible to calculate the added amount mmol of acid and base i e the titrimetric data using the recorded do concentration and the mass transfer coefficient k l a 16 3 1 026 t 20 d 1 t temperature in c kla values at 10 c 20 c 30 c were determined experimentally in manhaeghe et al 2019 using the dynamic gassing out method fig s12 it was possible to calculate the oxygen production rate opr g o2 m 3 d 1 of the microalgae using equation 1 1 o p r d s o 2 d t k l a s o 2 s a t s o 2 with t the time d so2 the measured do concentration g o2 m 3 so2 sat the saturated oxygen concentration g o2 m 3 calculated according to the asce so2 sat 14 65 0 41 t 7 99 10 3 t2 7 78 10 5 t³ t temperature in c asce 1996 kla so2 sat so2 stands for the oxygen transfer rate otr as the reactor vessel was open and to allow for accurate results the o2 exchange between the reactor medium and the surrounding atmosphere was quantified manhaeghe et al 2019 in addition exchange of co2 is assessed by the titrimetric data since this process alters the c equilibrium in the water phase from the opr profile and the titrimetric profile two kinetic parameters were derived after removing noise using a local regression function loess in r firstly the specific oxygen production rate po2 g o2 g dw 1 d 1 was calculated as the net oxygen production i e the surface under the opr graph subtracted with the oxygen consumption due to endogenous respiration divided by the initial biomass concentration and the time until the added c source was depleted the total o2 consumption due to endogenous respiration er was determined by multiplying the measured po2 in the er experiments section 2 3 with the measured initial biomass concentration and the time until depletion of the c source secondly the net specific proton addition rate ph mg h g dw 1 d 1 was calculated in an analogous way this time the net amount of protons added i e the total amount of protons added subtracted with the proton consumption due to er was divided by the initial biomass concentration and the time until the c source was depleted po2 and ph were defined as positive during o2 production and acid addition respectively the kinetic parameters became negative during o2 consumption and base addition the added amount of acid and base was sufficiently low to avoid medium dilution or salinity increase hence no effect on kinetic parameters is expected 2 2 algae cultivation conditions and harvesting an inoculum of the green microalgae strain chlorella vulgaris was obtained from the department of biology from ku leuven belgium it was grown batch wise in a 2 l bioreactor manhaeghe et al 2019 to prevent contamination with bacteria the freshly prepared adjusted bg 11 growth medium decostere et al 2013 was autoclaved before adding microalgae from the previous batch cultivation the medium was aerated to provide co2 for photoautotrophic growth no additional inorganic nor organic carbon sources were added during the microalgae cultivation in order to keep an axenic culture culture axenicity was checked by microscopic observations light was provided by six fluorescent lamps grolux t8 14w sylvania yielding a total light intensity in the middle of the reactor of 55 μmol m 2 s 1 li 250a light meter li cor biosciences microalgae harvesting was done at the end of the exponential growth phase in order to prevent variations in the results the optical density of the microalgae suspension was measured at 750 nm in order to determine the volume of microalgae solution needed for the respirometric titrimetric experiment the microalgae were then centrifuged and washed according to the protocol described in manhaeghe et al 2019 after washing the microalgae were added to the heat jacketed reactor of the respirometric titrimetric unit 2 3 experimental protocol the initial conditions of every experiment were kept as much as possible constant i e a biomass concentration of 100 g dw m 3 total suspended solids tss 8 66 g no3 n m 3 66 7 g nh4 n m 3 and 8 44 g po4 3 p m 3 these nutrient concentrations were chosen to avoid microalgae growth limitations and were based on the elemental microalgae composition next to assess the mixotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris the experiments summarized in table 1 were performed all experiments were conducted in duplicate it must be noted that based on previous experiments manhaeghe et al 2019 photorespiration is to be expected at a concentration of 190 g hco3 m 3 and light intensity of 73 μmol m 2 s 1 however this concentration was chosen based on the results of sforza et al 2012 who measured an inhibition of the heterotrophic growth of chlorella protothecoides under elevated co2 concentrations for the heterotrophic experiment d glucose concentrations of 75 g m 3 and 100 g m 3 were chosen based on preliminary experiments results not shown which indicated that the o2 concentration did not decrease below 2 g o2 m 3 at such carbon dosages this was important since it was desirable to avoid o2 limitation during the heterotrophic growth experiments gernaey et al 2002 the er experiment was performed to determine oxygen consumption and base addition due to maintenance processes section 2 1 nutrient concentrations i e no3 n nh4 n po4 p and scod were determined spectrophotometrically using hach test kits before and after each experiment lck339 lck303 phosphover powder pillows and lck1414 respectively using a dr6000 spectrophotometer hach in addition the biomass concentration was determined before and after the experiment according to standard gravimetric methods described by apha apha 1999 using glass fiber filters macherey nagel gf 3 2 4 model framework the starting point for the modelling framework was the previously developed model of manhaeghe et al 2019 describing the photoautotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris the model uses monod kinetics for nutrient uptake from the bulk solution this approach was chosen since there was no need to describe the internal n quota i e the droop model because the nitrogen concentration was not limiting during the experiments droop 1973 in addition a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr was assumed as such avoiding mathematical equations describing spatial distributions the kinetic expressions are multiplicative meaning that all variables can simultaneously contribute to the biomass growth rate kumar et al 2016 within this concept the interdependent effect of light i μmol m 2 s 1 and temperature t c was modelled by a function f i t which ranges between 0 and 1 as such the equation for the photoautotrophic growth rate can be written as 2 μ a μ m a x a f c n p f i t with μa the dynamic specific photoautotrophic growth rate d 1 μmax a the fixed maximum photoautotrophic growth rate d 1 f c n p a function combining multiple monod terms for the growth on nutrients i e no3 nh4 po4 3 co2 hco3 including the preferential uptake of nh4 over no3 and the preferential uptake of co2 over hco3 table s1 decostere et al 2016 2013 the biomass growth rate g dw m 3 d 1 is then calculated by multiplying μa with the biomass concentration xalg g dw m 3 next to the photoautotrophic growth the microalgae model also describes the c equilibrium in the water phase and the gas exchange of co2 and o2 between the microalgae suspension and the surrounding atmosphere table 4 this was necessary since both physico chemical processes have an important effect on the do and ic concentration not including these equations would lead to incomplete mass balances for both oxygen and carbon given the open reactor setup used in this research the gujer matrix of the photoautotrophic model can also be found in table 4 white rows and columns the stoichiometry was adopted from manhaeghe et al 2019 2 5 sensitivity analysis and parameter identifiability in order to avoid ad hoc selection of parameters for model calibration a systematic approach was followed brun et al 2002 based on performing a global sensitivity analysis by means of a monte carlo simulation saltelli et al 2005 in the r environment using the fme package soetaert and petzoldt 2010 during this simulation the parameters were varied over a predefined range within this parameter matrix random parameter sets were chosen using the latin hybercube sampling method audenaert et al 2013 and the model output was calculated at one specific point in time a total of 175 simulations per parameter were conducted audenaert et al 2013 decostere et al 2016 afterwards two linear regressions were performed on the output data i e a number of different parameter sets x and the respirometric y1 or titrimetric data y2 this yielded regression coefficients for each parameter the linear dependency between these regression coefficients and the model output data y1 or y2 can be evaluated by means of the t statistic which is calculated from the standard errors of the regression coefficients audenaert et al 2013 t statistics higher than the critical t statistic of 1 96 5 confidence interval indicate a significant impact of the parameter on the model variable based on this global sensitivity analysis a subset of sensitive parameters can be selected however it is still uncertain if these parameters are uniquely identifiable for this a local sensitivity analysis perturbation factor 1 10 6 and collinearity analysis were performed in r using the fme package soetaert and petzoldt 2010 parameter subsets with a collinearity index below a threshold value of 10 15 were deemed identifiable and were used for model calibration brun et al 2002 2 6 parameter estimation and goodness of fit model calibration was done by minimizing the sum of squared errors sse between the modelled and measured values of both the respirometric and titrimetric profiles for this the selected parameter subset section 2 5 was varied according to the marquardt levenberg algorithm marquardt 1963 in the r environment using the fme package finally the goodness of fit was calculated by using theils inequality coefficient tic where a tic value below 0 3 indicates a good model fit audenaert et al 2010 3 t i c i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i 2 i 1 n y ˆ i 2 with n the number of experiments yi the measured value and y i ˆ the predicted value by the model it needs to be stated that the parameter identifiability and subsequent calibration is an iterative process since parameter identifiability is based on local measures i e computed at a single point in the parameter space 3 results and discussion 3 1 respirometry titrimetry for measuring microalgae kinetics under photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions fig 1 a and b show the respirometric and titrimetric profile respectively measured under dark conditions with the addition of 75 g d glucose m ³ i e experiment oc75 it can be seen that the o2 concentration immediately dropped upon glucose addition moreover a ph decrease of the medium occurred which led to the addition of base to keep the ph within the desired interval 6 90 7 10 komor and tanner 1974 reported a ph increase of the medium upon addition of hexoses which was assigned to the hexose h symport system however under low hexose concentrations a ph decrease was indeed commonly observed perez garcia et al 2011 once the c source was fully consumed i e time when the oxygen uptake rate reached a plateau the base addition stopped and the o2 concentration increased up to 8 1 g o2 m 3 which is below the saturated o2 concentration of 9 g o2 m 3 the remaining o2 consumption defined as negative in section 2 1 can be addressed to the er of the microalgae which was found to be 0 103 0 007 g o2 g dw 1 d 1 these observations are in line with respirometric titrimetric assays with activated sludge and dextrose gernaey et al 2002 as observed previously manhaeghe et al 2019 photoautotrophic experiments resulted in an o2 production and acid addition the latter was explained by a shift in the c equilibrium in the water phase resulting from co2 fixation after depletion of the c source i e time when the opr reached a plateau o2 concentrations of 9 6 g o2 m 3 were measured this remaining photosynthetic activity was explained by co2 diffusion from the atmosphere into the microalgae suspension similar profiles were observed for the mixotrophic experiments fig 3a d the photoheterotrophic experiment oc75 l is depicted in fig 1c d it can be seen that the o2 production is rather constant throughout the experiment however the base addition reduces to the endogenous respiration level after approximately 0 6 d indicating c depletion the outcomes of all 7 experimental conditions are shown in table 2 due to i the high influence of the er on the o2 consumption during heterotrophic growth i e approximately 25 of respiration is due to er table 2 and ii the differences in duration before c depletion i e longer duration equals more er table 2 po2 and ph were calculated as net values i e excluding the background activity resulting from the er section 2 1 the total amounts of o2 and h were given both with and without the er in the next sections these parameters will be used to analyze the mixotrophic microalgal growth no nitrogen or phosphorus depletion occurred for all fourteen experiments table s5 3 2 photoheterotrophic growth mechanism o2 co2 circulation when comparing heterotrophic growth oc75 with photoheterotrophic growth oc75 l without ic addition it can be concluded that there is a shift from a net oxygen consumption rate po2 to a net oxygen production rate table 2 since the growth medium was prepared with distilled water and no ic sources were added it can be concluded that chlorella vulgaris is indeed capable of using the produced co2 during heterotrophic growth for photosynthesis moreover a two sample t test ms excel indicated a significant difference between the ph values of oc75 and oc75 l p 0 01 and also the biomass growth increased from 0 47 g dw g dwini 1 during the heterotrophic growth experiment to 0 82 g dw g dwini 1 during photoheterotrophic growth these results indicate that there indeed is a circulation of o2 and co2 between the cells of the green microalgae species chlorella vulgaris this is in agreement with cecchin et al 2018 who reported an increased co2 content during mixotrophic growth in chlorella sorokiniana based on gene expressions it remains to be proven whether this circulation occurs within a single microalgal cell this was assumed by grama et al 2016 since this would lead to better efficiencies for each metabolic pathway next mass balances were used in order to determine the amount of circulation of o2 and co2 fig 2 during the oc75 experiments table 1 75 mg d glucose l 1 was added reactor volume 1 3 l which resulted in a net o2 consumption of 15 23 0 09 mg o2 and a net proton production of 0 597 0 004 mg h it is assumed that the addition of oc will lead to the same amount of o2 and h consumed and or produced during the oc75 and oc75 l test however due to the difference in time before c depletion 0 397 d for oc75 0 600 d for oc75 l more oxygen and protons will be consumed and produced respectively due to er as such when taking into account the time duration 0 600 d and initial biomass concentration 0 125 g of the oc75 l test 7 73 mg o2 0 103 0 6 0 125 1000 is expected to be consumed for maintenance processes before c depletion this results in an overall o2 consumption of 23 3 mg o2 15 23 7 73 an analogous calculation can be performed for the titrimetric data which results in a total proton production of 0 648 0 004 mg h 0 597 0 051 the protons produced during the heterotrophic growth result from the uptake of nh4 and from changes in the c equilibrium in the water phase decostere et al 2013 grobbelaar 2004 according to the stoichiometric equation for the oxidation of d glucose to co2 depicted in fig 2 an o2 consumption of 23 mg o2 results in a net production of 32 4 mg co2 it has to be stressed that the amount of co2 could not be calculated based on the added amount of d glucose since a part of the d glucose will be used for biomass growth and not for energy production despite these activities resulting from the heterotrophic growth and er the oc75 l experiment yielded a total o2 production of 8 4 mg o2 and a total proton production of 0 5 0 1 mg table 2 when making the mass balance over the whole system this results in an overall production of 31 7 mg o2 23 8 and in a consumption of 0 12 0 1 mg h 0 64 0 52 fig 2 the lower amount of protons produced during photoheterotrophic growth results from the internal recycling of co2 which is not stripped to the atmosphere anymore as such less base had to be added due to changes in the c equilibrium in the water phase when using the stoichiometric equation for photoautotrophic growth depicted in fig 2 decostere et al 2016 31 7 mg o2 and 0 12 0 1 mg h correspond to a required co2 concentration of 33 7 mg co2 and 31 1 0 1 mg co2 respectively these amounts are the same as the produced amount of co2 during heterotrophic growth i e 32 4 mg co2 in addition it was observed that the measured profiles of the oc75 l experiment showed a constant o2 production and base addition fig 1c d this can be interpreted as a concurrent operational mechanism with an internal recycling of co2 and o2 in conclusion it seems that there is a 100 circulation of the produced amount of co2 within the microalgae cells during photoheterotrophic growth 3 3 mixotrophic growth mechanism fig 3 a and b compare the results of the mixotrophic experiments ic75 oc75 with the photoautotrophic experiments ic75 it can be noticed that the respirometric profiles overlap indeed there is no statistical difference between ic75 and ic75 oc75 in both the oxygen production rate p 0 52 and total oxygen production p 0 53 table 2 two sample t test ms excel however only the first part of the titrimetric profiles overlaps the second part of the mixotrophic experiment shows base addition which was not observed during the photoautotrophic experiment as discussed in section 3 1 base addition is an indication of heterotrophic growth when comparing the observed base addition rate during mixotrophic growth 4 2 mg h g dw 1 d 1 with the one observed during heterotrophic growth i e oc75 a significant α 0 05 difference was found p 0 04 however the base addition rate was statistically the same as in the oc75 l profile p 0 25 in addition the increase in biomass during mixotrophic growth 125 mg was a factor 1 34 larger than the sum of the biomass growth under photoautotrophic 26 0 mg and heterotrophic 67 0 mg conditions this shows a synergistic effect of the mixotrophic growth mechanism which is in accordance with other studies martinez and orus 1991 smith et al 2015 these results indicate that there is a preferential uptake of ic over oc for the microalgae species chlorella vulgaris indeed it seems that once all the ic is depleted the microalgae start consuming the oc source with an internal recycling of o2 co2 as described in section 3 2 this preference was also observed by sforza et al 2012 it is interesting to note that the microalgae in their work were cultivated in the presence of an oc source as such it seems that the lack oc acclimation during microalgae cultivation in this work did not affect the microalgae behavior next in order to analyze the effect of elevated ic levels on the mixotrophic growth mechanism sforza et al 2012 the ic oc ratio was increased from ic75 oc75 to ic190 oc100 fig 3c and d show a difference in the first part of both profiles this can be interpreted as a concurrent operation of the photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth pathway which was not observed during the ic75 oc75 experiment however the respirometric profiles only start deviating from each other when the o2 concentrations are around 15 20 g m 3 according to wágner et al 2016 no photoinhibition is to be expected at oxygen concentrations lower than 24 5 mg l 1 this might indicate that o2 concentrations of 15 20 g m 3 induce the heterotrophic growth pathway in order to avoid photorespiration after depletion of the ic source the o2 concentrations converge again until they completely overlap however the titrimetric profiles do not converge indeed the mixotrophic profile shows base addition 4 5 0 3 mg h g dw 1 d 1 which is statistically two sample t test ms excel the same p 0 80 as the ph measured during the ic75 oc75 experiment again indicating a synergistic effect based on these results three hypotheses were formulated firstly all co2 produced during photoheterotrophic growth is circulated within the microalgae cells which leads to an increased microalgae concentration and a net o2 production secondly the photoautotrophic growth mechanism is preferred over the heterotrophic growth mechanism thirdly high levels of oxygen due to elevated ic concentrations can activate the heterotrophic growth mechanism in order to avoid photorespiration in order to test these three hypotheses a previously developed microalgae model was extended 3 4 model development 3 4 1 heterotrophic microalgae model 3 4 1 1 kinetics in order to describe the heterotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris the photoautotrophic model described in section 2 4 was extended with heterotrophic activity table 4 using the cell based modelling approach of ross and geider 2009 in the latter model total cellular carbon is divided into a functional pool including proteins nucleic acids cell membrane and an energy reserve pool which contains the oc storage products i e carbohydrates and neutral lipids as a consequence a new variable for oc storage was introduced xsto g c m 3 storage of oc will occur during photoautotrophic growth section 3 4 2 but also due to the uptake of external oc and this until the maximum capacity qc max is reached once stored xsto can be used for biomass growth and er however when xsto drops below a threshold value qc min only er will occur when the reserves are fully depleted er will continue using carbon from the functional pool i e the microalgae biomass hence the model was extended with 1 oc uptake indicated as soc from the medium 2 heterotrophic growth on xsto and 3 endogenous respiration on xsto and when depleted microalgae biomass xalg oc uptake from the medium was mathematically expressed as adesanya et al 2014 4 ρ 1 f sto k 3 s o c s o c k oc x alg with 5 f s t o 1 q c q c m i n q c m a x q c q c m a x q c m i n q c m i n q c q c m a x 0 q c q c m a x where k3 is the c uptake rate 27 32 d 1 soc the oc concentration in the medium g c m 3 koc the affinity constant for oc 3 15 g c m 3 xalg the biomass concentration g dw m 3 qc max the maximum storage capacity of chlorella vulgaris 0 4571 g c g dw 1 qc min the threshold value for growth on oc storage 0 4143 g c g dw 1 and qc the stored amount of carbon in the microalgae g c g dw 1 with qc xsto xalg the values for the parameters in equations 4 and 5 in particular the storage capacity and the c uptake rate were adopted from adesanya et al 2014 the initial value of xsto was assigned 0 432 0 006 g c g dw 1 based on the er experiments fig s3 from these equations it can be seen that the oc uptake from the medium is expressed by monod kinetics and a linear dependency fsto on the stored amount of carbon this linear dependency states that there will be a maximum c uptake when qc qc min however between qc min and qc max the oc uptake rate will slow down in a linear way until the maximum cell quota for carbon is reached after which no additional c uptake will take place fsto 0 moreover when qc qc min the cells will stop producing biomass i e grow heterotrophically and will only use this carbon for maintenance i e er this will continue until the c storage is fully depleted ross and geider 2009 as such the growth on xsto can be modelled with similar equations as during photoautotrophic growth section 2 4 6 ρ 2 3 1 f s t o μ m a x h f c n p x a l g when simulating the experiments in this study the monod terms for no3 nh4 and po4 3 tend to 1 only the monod function for carbon gradually decreases to zero due to c depletion finally the er on xsto and xalg was modelled using equations 7 and 8 respectively reichert et al 2001 7 ρ 4 r x s t o x s t o k s t o x a l g 8 ρ 5 r k s t o k s t o x s t o x a l g with r the respiration rate 0 1 d 1 and ksto 0 2 g m 3 the affinity constant for respiration on stored oc 3 4 1 2 stoichiometry with regard to the stoichiometry of heterotrophic growth only the main nutrients c h n o and p were taken into account moreover growth on both nh4 and no3 were implemented with a preferential uptake of nh4 over no3 decostere et al 2016 the nutrient concentrations of n and p will not influence the specific heterotrophic growth rate μh section 3 4 1 1 although they do have an effect on the amount of protons that will be produced eq 9 or consumed eq 10 during heterotrophic growth 9 a c h 2 o b o 2 c n h 4 d h p o 4 2 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p e c o 2 f h 2 o g h 10 a c h 2 o

on glucose yh g c g c 1 which determines the amount of ch2o that will be used for biomass production this results in the stoichiometric coefficients depicted in tables 4 and 5 the value of yh was calculated according to the oc75 experiments this test yielded an average biomass growth of 67 0 mg dw and an average o2 consumption of 21 mg i e including respiration table 2 resulting in a yield coefficient for oxygen on biomass of 0 3134 g o2 g dw 1 using the stoichiometric coefficients in table 4 and the solver function in ms excel the yh value was varied until the experimentally determined yield coefficient for oxygen on biomass was obtained fig s1 this resulted in an yh value of 0 753 g c g c 1 this number seems high but is in agreement with decker and tanner 1972 and perez garcia et al 2011 who stated that 80 85 of the glucose is assimilated and converted to oligo and polysaccharides in addition with regard to the production and or consumption of protons it is important to note that the uptake of ammonium and phosphate will influence the alkalinity of the growth medium in previous work regarding photoautotrophic growth decostere et al 2013 this was considered as negligible due to the high influence of the c equilibrium on the alkalinity of the medium however the experimental results clearly showed that chlorella vulgaris does not need external ic to grow heterotrophically in addition as described in section 3 1 no proton consumption was modelled for oc uptake from the medium endogenous respiration has an effect on o2 co2 h and biomass concentrations reichert et al 2001 however given the short duration of the experiments in this work only er on the stored c sources was expected as such the stoichiometry could be determined using the standard oxidation equation of oc 11 c h 2 o o 2 c o 2 h 2 o based on the measured o2 consumption rate of 0 103 0 007 g o2 g dw 1 d 1 table 2 during the er experiments and according to the stoichiometric relations in equation 11 the following yield coefficients were obtained for an endogenous respiration rate of 0 1 d 1 1 03 g o2 g dw 1 1 41 g co2 g dw 1 and 0 385 g c g dw 1 moreover also a proton production rate of 0 68 0 05 mg h g dw 1 d 1 was measured hence a yield coefficient of 6 8 mg h g dw 1 was added all stoichiometric coefficients are close to the values reported by reichert et al 2001 3 4 1 3 model analysis and calibration before model calibration a set of monte carlo simulations was performed in order to determine the sensitive parameters table 3 of the heterotrophic growth model table 4 the conditions of the oc100 experiment were used because the light intensity during this test was 0 μmol m 2 s 1 the photoautotrophic growth equations did not influence the model results avoiding possible interactions during model calibration the do concentration and added amount of base at t 0 2 d were selected as model output since there still was a strong activity at this point in time 0 598 d before c depletion table 2 the results of the linear regression with 1225 simulations indicated a strong sensitivity for yh t statistic do 94 7 t statistic h 96 4 and μmax h t statistic do 60 93 t statistic h 89 5 and a significant effect of the parameter k3 t statistic do 4 62 t statistic h 6 88 next collinearity analyses were performed with these three parameters the initial values were 0 753 g c g c 1 for yh section 3 4 1 2 1 2 d 1 for μmax h martinez and orus 1991 and 27 32 d 1 for k3 adesanya et al 2014 the results revealed that all parameter subsets had collinearity indexes below 10 meaning that all subsets are identifiable brun et al 2002 it must be stressed that it is remarkable that yh and μmax h are not correlated collinearity index 1 4 when analyzing the local sensitivity function for oxygen fig s2 it could indeed be observed that there is a different effect during the second part of the growth phase i e after c depletion model simulations revealed that increasing both yh and μmax h with 5 led to higher co2 and lower o2 concentrations in the water phase as a consequence upon c depletion more co2 will be stripped to the atmosphere and more o2 will enter the medium as such model calibration was performed with the parameter subset yh μmax h k3 the obtained values for oc75 were yh 0 720 0 001 g c g c 1 μmax h 1 26 0 02 d 1 and k3 27 3 d 1 the yh value of 0 720 g c g c 1 indicates that 80 of the oc added is taken up by the microalgal biomass which is in agreement with decker and tanner 1972 and perez garcia et al 2011 in addition a μmax h value of 1 26 d 1 lies within the range found in scientific literature martinez and orus 1991 smith et al 2015 after performing the collinearity analysis again with these values the same parameter subsets were identifiable the final tic values for all four heterotrophic profiles were lower than 0 3 indicating good model prediction audenaert et al 2010 3 4 2 photoautotrophic model adjustments during photoautotrophic growth microalgae will produce an excess of carbon which is stored inside their cell i e xsto adesanya et al 2014 ross and geider 2009 as such the photoautotrophic model of manhaeghe et al 2019 was extended with this process based on figueroa torres et al 2017 the yield coefficient for this process is set to 0 0165 g c g dw 1 however it has to be taken into account that this is the net production of additional carbon meaning that the amount of carbon consumed during er i e 0 385 g c g dw 1 is also produced during photosynthetic growth this results in a yield coefficient of 0 4016 g c g dw 1 y13 table 5 secondly in order not to overcomplicate the model the original detailed respiration function was replaced by the endogenous respiration equation discussed in section 3 4 1 simulating this model for the photoautotrophic growth experiments revealed an overestimation in both the o2 production and acid addition since the initial biomass concentration was doubled in comparison with manhaeghe et al 2019 100 g dw m 3 in this work it was hypothesized that this overestimation is caused by the phenomenon of self shading this would lead to a lower amount of photons reaching every single algal cell lowering the photoautotrophic growth rate μmax a when simulating the photoautotrophic experiments with the original model of manhaeghe et al 2019 the same overestimation was observed this confirmed the hypothesis of self shading due to increased biomass concentration since it was not the goal of this research to model the light penetration in the reactor the photoautotrophic growth rate μmax a was calibrated using the respirometric and tritrimetric data of all four photoautotrophic experiments this yielded a μmax a of 3 54 d 1 when running the model with these adjustments tic values below 0 3 were obtained for both ic75 and ic190 indicating good model fit audenaert et al 2010 it must be noticed that the modelled o2 concentration of the ic190 experiment is higher than the one measured this can be explained by the lack of photorespiration in the model structure however since this process is rather complex to model and the model fit is reasonable it was decided not to perform additional experiments to include photorespiration into the model structure 3 4 3 mixotrophic microalgae model 3 4 3 1 kinetics and stoichiometry in a next step the heterotrophic model section 3 4 1 and photoautotrophic model section 3 4 2 were combined in section 3 3 it was hypothesized that 1 all co2 produced during photoheterotrophic growth was circulated within the microalgae cells 2 there is a preferential uptake of ic over oc and 3 high levels of oxygen can activate the heterotrophic growth mechanism in order to avoid photorespiration the internal circulation of co2 is inherent to the model structure since co2 is taken up preferentially above hco3 produced co2 will immediately be consumed the preferential uptake of ic was modelled by extending equation 6 12 ρ 2 3 1 f s t o μ m a x h f c n p k i μ a k i μ a μ a 3 x a l g this extension was done in accordance to the hill equation haefner 2005 to create an s shaped curve as function of μa meaning that if the autotrophic growth rate is too high no heterotrophic growth will occur ki μa was given an empirical value of 0 2 d 3 in order to still adequately describe the μa profile of the ic75 test this expression was used rather than an inhibition by ic since microalgae should still be capable of growing heterotrophically in the dark when ic is available in the growth medium the same stoichiometry is used as for equation 6 tables 4 and 5 with regard to the activation of μmax h in order to avoid photorespiration the model was extended with the following process 13 ρ 6 7 1 f s t o μ m a x h f c n p 1 1 e s 1 o 2 s 2 μ a 3 μ a 3 k i μ a x a l g this was done in order to enable heterotrophic growth at higher o2 concentrations a sigmoidal curve i e logistic curve was added where s1 stands for the width of the s shape and s2 stands for the midpoint of the s curve according to wágner et al 2016 photoinhibition occurs at o2 concentrations higher than 24 5 mg l 1 as such until model calibration s2 was assigned an initial value of 24 5 g o2 m 3 s1 was given an empirical value of 4 this function also returns a value between 0 and 1 the same stoichiometry was used as for equation 6 tables 4 and 5 3 4 3 2 model analysis and calibration before calibrating the mixotrophic model a set of monte carlo simulations was performed the model output at t 0 15 d was taken rather than at t 0 2 section 3 4 1 3 since the time before c depletion is shorter during mixotrophic tests 0 304 d vs 0 598 d the sensitivity of the parameters ki μa range 0 02 d 3 0 5 d 3 s1 range 1 5 6 5 and s2 range 19 g m 3 26 5 g m 3 was assessed using the model with initial variable values of the ic190 oc100 experiments the linear regression of the 525 simulations revealed that only the parameters s1 t statistic do 2 7 t statistic hp 2 5 and s2 t statistic do 46 7 t statistic hp 27 3 were sensitive however the collinearity analysis indicated that the parameter subset s1 s2 is not identifiable collinearity index 20 as such it was decided to only calibrate the more sensitive parameter s2 and keep the assigned value of 4 for s1 the calibration yielded a value of 24 50 0 02 g o2 m 3 when simulating the mixotrophic model it can be seen from fig 4 that there is a good agreement between the predicted and measured values however there still is a discrepancy between the o2 production at the ic190 oc100 level this can be explained by the lack of photorespiration included in the model structure which was also observed when modelling the photoautotrophic growth at ic190 due to the complexity of this process it was decided not to include this process in the model structure overall the mixotrophic microalgae model was able to predict all the measured respirometric titrimetric profiles with tic values below the threshold value of 0 3 table s6 however with regard to the oc75 l experiment it seems that the model has a small shortcoming at the end of the experiment fig s19 this is probably due to the lack of a photorespiration term indeed co2 concentrations smaller than 0 02 mg l 1 were predicted by the model while o2 concentrations were stable around 9 5 mg l 1 with regard to the co2 diffusion between the atmosphere and the microalgae suspension it is interesting to note that during photoautotrophic experiments 76 6 of the biomass growth happened before c depletion the remaining part was due to co2 diffusion from the atmosphere however before c depletion stripping of co2 occurred due to er and a shift in the c equilibrium in the water phase indicating that all o2 production upon c depletion can be addressed to the added ic source during heterotrophic tests without light no additional growth occurred after c depletion and only a small amount of decay i e 0 01 the latter can be explained by the respiration on stored organic compounds during the oc75 l experiment 86 3 of the biomass growth occurred before c depletion when omitting the co2 diffusion from the model the biomass growth upon c depletion decreased with 2 7 0 5 this shows only a small effect of the co2 diffusion on the photoheterotrophic experiment next the added value of the preferential factors presented in equations 12 and 13 was assessed by means of the sse with regard to the ic75 oc75 profile the sse improved with 12 and 165 for the respirometric and titrimetric profiles respectively when including the preferential factors in the model structure the same was observed for the ic190 oc100 profile where the sse improved with 16 and 49 for the respirometric and titrimetric profiles respectively furthermore in terms of biomass growth a recovery i e biomass growth model biomass growth measured of 76 80 was found for the model without preferential factors whereas recoveries of 98 108 were found for the model including preferential terms as such it can be concluded that the model yields better results when the preferential factors are included this supports the hypotheses formulated based on the experimental data as such this work shows that modelling multiple effects such as light intensity nutrient concentrations e g ic and oc concentrations and temperature can help to further increase the knowledge needed to optimize the operation of microalgae systems overall it seems that introducing all aspects of photorespiration might help to fully explain the synergistic effect observed during mixotrophic growth it must be stated however that the results in this work were obtained by using microalgae cultures with low densities i e initial tss of 100 g m 3 during short time batch experiments further model development taking into account self shading at higher microalgae concentrations is recommended for assessing long term experiments in continuous reactors 4 conclusions a combined respirometric titrimetric unit was used to assess the photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth of the green microalgae species chlorella vulgaris mass balances revealed that under photoheterotrophic conditions all the produced co2 derived from assimilating the organic carbon source was internally recycled for photoautotrophic growth furthermore from the experimental data it was hypothesized that photoautotrophic growth is the preferential growth mechanism of chlorella vulgaris and that high oxygen concentrations due to elevated ic concentrations can activate concurrent heterotrophic growth in order to avoid photorespiration these findings were used to extend an existing mathematical model describing the photoautotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris with 1 the heterotrophic growth pathway and 2 with factors taking into account the formulated hypotheses the results showed good model performance for all measurements with tic values below 0 3 as such supporting the formulated hypotheses these new insights can now be used to further investigate the optimization of mixotrophic microalgae growth lowering the cost of

17669,microalgae show great potential for wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery however microalgae cultivation and harvesting are affected by the low biomass concentrations which are inherent to the photoautotrophic growth process mixotrophic growth can be a solution as it increases microalgae biomass concentration independently from the incident light intensity in this work a combined respirometric titrimetric unit was used to assess the microalgae kinetics during such mixotrophic growth conditions for chlorella vulgaris based on the experimental results a microalgae model was extended in order to gain more insight in the delicate balance between photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth the results suggest that during heterotrophic growth with light in absence of external inorganic carbon sources i e photoheterotrophic growth all co2 produced by the heterotrophic pathway is internally recycled for photoautotrophic growth moreover it was shown that photoautotrophic growth is the preferential growth mechanism under mixotrophic cultivation conditions i e light inorganic carbon organic carbon but that high oxygen concentrations activate the heterotrophic growth pathway to avoid photorespiration the extended microalgae model supports these findings with good model performance for all conducted experiments graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae mixotrophy gas exchange respirometry titrimetry modelling 1 introduction in recent years the trend towards a circular economy has become more pronounced in that perspective conventional wastewater treatment plants are now also considered as resource recovery plants that recover the energy from available carbon c sources i e lipids cellulose and polyhydroxyalkanoates stored inside the biomass puyol et al 2017 however with regard to nitrogen sources recovery is challenging a possible solution for this is the use of microalgae for wastewater treatment since microalgae are capable of storing both nitrogen and phosphorus inside their cells the harvested cells can then for example be used to extract pigments or lipids for biofuel production and the remaining biomass can be applied as a bio fertilizer arashiro et al 2020 cheirsilp and torpee 2012 the bottleneck for the use of microalgae however is the energy consuming harvesting step parmentier et al 2020 this is due to the high stability of the microalgae suspension in combination with a low biomass concentration the latter is inherent to the photoautotrophic growth process since the light penetration inside the microalgae suspension is inversely proportional to the biomass concentration liang et al 2009 a possible solution is selecting microalgae species which are capable of growing mixotrophically i e growing autotrophically and heterotrophically at the same time pang et al 2019 this process allows the microalgae to grow on organic carbon oc substrates when the incident light becomes limiting resulting in a higher biomass concentration with regard to this process martinez and orus 1991 reported that under non aerated conditions the mixotrophic growth rate μm is 20 higher than the sum of the autotrophic growth rate μa and the heterotrophic growth rate μh however this difference decreased with 10 when the cultures were aerated with air furthermore when aerating with air containing 2 co2 the difference became negligible martinez and orus 1991 it can be hypothesized that these differences might be due to the limiting co2 and o2 concentrations occurring under non aerated conditions to test this hypothesis the inorganic carbon ic and dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured in suspensions of the green microalgae species micractinium inermum under photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions smith et al 2015 the results indicated that the ic and do concentration were limiting under photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions respectively moreover during mixotrophic growth increased levels of ic and do were measured together with a 37 increase of μm in comparison with the sum of μa and μh it was therefore concluded that internal co2 and o2 exchange led to higher biomass growth during mixotrophic test conditions and that this growth advantage ceases without limiting ic and do concentrations i e when aerating the cultures with air containing 2 co2 indeed endogenous co2 produced during heterotrophic metabolism could be recycled preferably between the intracellular compartments rather than through the metabolically more energy expensive external incorporation grama et al 2016 however it was not experimentally assessed to which extent microalgae would recycle these endogenous sources and under which conditions this occurs it is clear from the experiments of smith et al 2015 that a part of the produced co2 and o2 will be excreted since increased values of ic and do were measured during mixotrophic growth when further increasing the co2 fraction in the air to 5 it was observed for chlorella protothecoides that the metabolization of the organic substrate was blocked under mixotrophic conditions thus cancelling the benefits of mixotrophic growth sforza et al 2012 this indicates that c protothecoides prefers growing photoautotrophically rather than mixotrophically under elevated ic concentrations on a biochemical level decreased rubisco activity and citrate synthase activity have been observed in chlorella zofingiensis during mixotrophic growth indicating a down regulation of the calvin and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle respectively zhang et al 2017 moreover gene expressions in chlorella sorokiniana under photoautotrophic and mixotrophic conditions showed an upregulation of the phospoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzyme during mixotrophic growth conditions cecchin et al 2018 this enzyme enables the potential recovery of c atoms lost by the oxidation of oc sources furthermore a downregulation of rubisco activase was observed but also an upregulation of the rubisco accumulation factor raf this indicates that during photoautotrophic growth rubisco activase had to be increased in order to catalyze the carbamylation of rubisco due to low co2 concentrations in contrast during mixotrophic growth the raf upregulation contributes to the assembly of the rubisco complex to improve c fixation cecchin et al 2018 these findings support the hypothesis of internal co2 recycling overall it can be concluded that there is a delicate balance driving the mixotrophic growth of microalgae enabling a fine regulation of the cell metabolism however more research is needed in order to gain insight into the driving factors of this balance in this research the mixotrophic microalgae growth was assessed with a combined respirometric titrimetric unit using chlorella vulgaris as an indicator species the goal was to 1 quantify the amount of co2 that was internally recycled during mixotrophic growth and 2 to assess the influence of elevated dissolved ic concentrations on the mixotrophic growth finally a previously developed microalgae model manhaeghe et al 2019 describing the photoautotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris was extended with the photo heterotrophic growth pathway in order to assess and validate the experimental data 2 material and methods 2 1 combined respirometric titrimetric unit the experimental data collection was done using the same respirometric titrimetric set up as in manhaeghe et al 2019 this set up consist of a 1 5 l heat jacketed reactor for temperature control operating volume of 1 3 l a stirrer at 250 rpm ika eurostar 20 digital to obtain a homogenous microalgae suspension and eight fluorescent lamps grolux t8 14w sylvania surrounding the reactor providing light 73 μmol m 2 s 1 a do probe inpro 6860 i 12 120 na mettler toledo and a ph probe inpro 4260 120 pt1000 mettler toledo allowed for online measurement the ph inside the reactor was controlled at 7 by using an on off algorithm in labview national instruments acid 0 25 mol l 1 hcl or base 0 25 mol l 1 naoh were dosed when the ph deviated from the desired interval of 6 90 7 10 each time acid or base was added the time during which the valve was open was recorded and the dosed volume of acid and base per unit of time was derived as such it was possible to calculate the added amount mmol of acid and base i e the titrimetric data using the recorded do concentration and the mass transfer coefficient k l a 16 3 1 026 t 20 d 1 t temperature in c kla values at 10 c 20 c 30 c were determined experimentally in manhaeghe et al 2019 using the dynamic gassing out method fig s12 it was possible to calculate the oxygen production rate opr g o2 m 3 d 1 of the microalgae using equation 1 1 o p r d s o 2 d t k l a s o 2 s a t s o 2 with t the time d so2 the measured do concentration g o2 m 3 so2 sat the saturated oxygen concentration g o2 m 3 calculated according to the asce so2 sat 14 65 0 41 t 7 99 10 3 t2 7 78 10 5 t³ t temperature in c asce 1996 kla so2 sat so2 stands for the oxygen transfer rate otr as the reactor vessel was open and to allow for accurate results the o2 exchange between the reactor medium and the surrounding atmosphere was quantified manhaeghe et al 2019 in addition exchange of co2 is assessed by the titrimetric data since this process alters the c equilibrium in the water phase from the opr profile and the titrimetric profile two kinetic parameters were derived after removing noise using a local regression function loess in r firstly the specific oxygen production rate po2 g o2 g dw 1 d 1 was calculated as the net oxygen production i e the surface under the opr graph subtracted with the oxygen consumption due to endogenous respiration divided by the initial biomass concentration and the time until the added c source was depleted the total o2 consumption due to endogenous respiration er was determined by multiplying the measured po2 in the er experiments section 2 3 with the measured initial biomass concentration and the time until depletion of the c source secondly the net specific proton addition rate ph mg h g dw 1 d 1 was calculated in an analogous way this time the net amount of protons added i e the total amount of protons added subtracted with the proton consumption due to er was divided by the initial biomass concentration and the time until the c source was depleted po2 and ph were defined as positive during o2 production and acid addition respectively the kinetic parameters became negative during o2 consumption and base addition the added amount of acid and base was sufficiently low to avoid medium dilution or salinity increase hence no effect on kinetic parameters is expected 2 2 algae cultivation conditions and harvesting an inoculum of the green microalgae strain chlorella vulgaris was obtained from the department of biology from ku leuven belgium it was grown batch wise in a 2 l bioreactor manhaeghe et al 2019 to prevent contamination with bacteria the freshly prepared adjusted bg 11 growth medium decostere et al 2013 was autoclaved before adding microalgae from the previous batch cultivation the medium was aerated to provide co2 for photoautotrophic growth no additional inorganic nor organic carbon sources were added during the microalgae cultivation in order to keep an axenic culture culture axenicity was checked by microscopic observations light was provided by six fluorescent lamps grolux t8 14w sylvania yielding a total light intensity in the middle of the reactor of 55 μmol m 2 s 1 li 250a light meter li cor biosciences microalgae harvesting was done at the end of the exponential growth phase in order to prevent variations in the results the optical density of the microalgae suspension was measured at 750 nm in order to determine the volume of microalgae solution needed for the respirometric titrimetric experiment the microalgae were then centrifuged and washed according to the protocol described in manhaeghe et al 2019 after washing the microalgae were added to the heat jacketed reactor of the respirometric titrimetric unit 2 3 experimental protocol the initial conditions of every experiment were kept as much as possible constant i e a biomass concentration of 100 g dw m 3 total suspended solids tss 8 66 g no3 n m 3 66 7 g nh4 n m 3 and 8 44 g po4 3 p m 3 these nutrient concentrations were chosen to avoid microalgae growth limitations and were based on the elemental microalgae composition next to assess the mixotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris the experiments summarized in table 1 were performed all experiments were conducted in duplicate it must be noted that based on previous experiments manhaeghe et al 2019 photorespiration is to be expected at a concentration of 190 g hco3 m 3 and light intensity of 73 μmol m 2 s 1 however this concentration was chosen based on the results of sforza et al 2012 who measured an inhibition of the heterotrophic growth of chlorella protothecoides under elevated co2 concentrations for the heterotrophic experiment d glucose concentrations of 75 g m 3 and 100 g m 3 were chosen based on preliminary experiments results not shown which indicated that the o2 concentration did not decrease below 2 g o2 m 3 at such carbon dosages this was important since it was desirable to avoid o2 limitation during the heterotrophic growth experiments gernaey et al 2002 the er experiment was performed to determine oxygen consumption and base addition due to maintenance processes section 2 1 nutrient concentrations i e no3 n nh4 n po4 p and scod were determined spectrophotometrically using hach test kits before and after each experiment lck339 lck303 phosphover powder pillows and lck1414 respectively using a dr6000 spectrophotometer hach in addition the biomass concentration was determined before and after the experiment according to standard gravimetric methods described by apha apha 1999 using glass fiber filters macherey nagel gf 3 2 4 model framework the starting point for the modelling framework was the previously developed model of manhaeghe et al 2019 describing the photoautotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris the model uses monod kinetics for nutrient uptake from the bulk solution this approach was chosen since there was no need to describe the internal n quota i e the droop model because the nitrogen concentration was not limiting during the experiments droop 1973 in addition a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr was assumed as such avoiding mathematical equations describing spatial distributions the kinetic expressions are multiplicative meaning that all variables can simultaneously contribute to the biomass growth rate kumar et al 2016 within this concept the interdependent effect of light i μmol m 2 s 1 and temperature t c was modelled by a function f i t which ranges between 0 and 1 as such the equation for the photoautotrophic growth rate can be written as 2 μ a μ m a x a f c n p f i t with μa the dynamic specific photoautotrophic growth rate d 1 μmax a the fixed maximum photoautotrophic growth rate d 1 f c n p a function combining multiple monod terms for the growth on nutrients i e no3 nh4 po4 3 co2 hco3 including the preferential uptake of nh4 over no3 and the preferential uptake of co2 over hco3 table s1 decostere et al 2016 2013 the biomass growth rate g dw m 3 d 1 is then calculated by multiplying μa with the biomass concentration xalg g dw m 3 next to the photoautotrophic growth the microalgae model also describes the c equilibrium in the water phase and the gas exchange of co2 and o2 between the microalgae suspension and the surrounding atmosphere table 4 this was necessary since both physico chemical processes have an important effect on the do and ic concentration not including these equations would lead to incomplete mass balances for both oxygen and carbon given the open reactor setup used in this research the gujer matrix of the photoautotrophic model can also be found in table 4 white rows and columns the stoichiometry was adopted from manhaeghe et al 2019 2 5 sensitivity analysis and parameter identifiability in order to avoid ad hoc selection of parameters for model calibration a systematic approach was followed brun et al 2002 based on performing a global sensitivity analysis by means of a monte carlo simulation saltelli et al 2005 in the r environment using the fme package soetaert and petzoldt 2010 during this simulation the parameters were varied over a predefined range within this parameter matrix random parameter sets were chosen using the latin hybercube sampling method audenaert et al 2013 and the model output was calculated at one specific point in time a total of 175 simulations per parameter were conducted audenaert et al 2013 decostere et al 2016 afterwards two linear regressions were performed on the output data i e a number of different parameter sets x and the respirometric y1 or titrimetric data y2 this yielded regression coefficients for each parameter the linear dependency between these regression coefficients and the model output data y1 or y2 can be evaluated by means of the t statistic which is calculated from the standard errors of the regression coefficients audenaert et al 2013 t statistics higher than the critical t statistic of 1 96 5 confidence interval indicate a significant impact of the parameter on the model variable based on this global sensitivity analysis a subset of sensitive parameters can be selected however it is still uncertain if these parameters are uniquely identifiable for this a local sensitivity analysis perturbation factor 1 10 6 and collinearity analysis were performed in r using the fme package soetaert and petzoldt 2010 parameter subsets with a collinearity index below a threshold value of 10 15 were deemed identifiable and were used for model calibration brun et al 2002 2 6 parameter estimation and goodness of fit model calibration was done by minimizing the sum of squared errors sse between the modelled and measured values of both the respirometric and titrimetric profiles for this the selected parameter subset section 2 5 was varied according to the marquardt levenberg algorithm marquardt 1963 in the r environment using the fme package finally the goodness of fit was calculated by using theils inequality coefficient tic where a tic value below 0 3 indicates a good model fit audenaert et al 2010 3 t i c i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1

calibration is an iterative process since parameter identifiability is based on local measures i e computed at a single point in the parameter space 3 results and discussion 3 1 respirometry titrimetry for measuring microalgae kinetics under photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions fig 1 a and b show the respirometric and titrimetric profile respectively measured under dark conditions with the addition of 75 g d glucose m ³ i e experiment oc75 it can be seen that the o2 concentration immediately dropped upon glucose addition moreover a ph decrease of the medium occurred which led to the addition of base to keep the ph within the desired interval 6 90 7 10 komor and tanner 1974 reported a ph increase of the medium upon addition of hexoses which was assigned to the hexose h symport system however under low hexose concentrations a ph decrease was indeed commonly observed perez garcia et al 2011 once the c source was fully consumed i e time when the oxygen uptake rate reached a plateau the base addition stopped and the o2 concentration increased up to 8 1 g o2 m 3 which is below the saturated o2 concentration of 9 g o2 m 3 the remaining o2 consumption defined as negative in section 2 1 can be addressed to the er of the microalgae which was found to be 0 103 0 007 g o2 g dw 1 d 1 these observations are in line with respirometric titrimetric assays with activated sludge and dextrose gernaey et al 2002 as observed previously manhaeghe et al 2019 photoautotrophic experiments resulted in an o2 production and acid addition the latter was explained by a shift in the c equilibrium in the water phase resulting from co2 fixation after depletion of the c source i e time when the opr reached a plateau o2 concentrations of 9 6 g o2 m 3 were measured this remaining photosynthetic activity was explained by co2 diffusion from the atmosphere into the microalgae suspension similar profiles were observed for the mixotrophic experiments fig 3a d the photoheterotrophic experiment oc75 l is depicted in fig 1c d it can be seen that the o2 production is rather constant throughout the experiment however the base addition reduces to the endogenous respiration level after approximately 0 6 d indicating c depletion the outcomes of all 7 experimental conditions are shown in table 2 due to i the high influence of the er on the o2 consumption during heterotrophic growth i e approximately 25 of respiration is due to er table 2 and ii the differences in duration before c depletion i e longer duration equals more er table 2 po2 and ph were calculated as net values i e excluding the background activity resulting from the er section 2 1 the total amounts of o2 and h were given both with and without the er in the next sections these parameters will be used to analyze the mixotrophic microalgal growth no nitrogen or phosphorus depletion occurred for all fourteen experiments table s5 3 2 photoheterotrophic growth mechanism o2 co2 circulation when comparing heterotrophic growth oc75 with photoheterotrophic growth oc75 l without ic addition it can be concluded that there is a shift from a net oxygen consumption rate po2 to a net oxygen production rate table 2 since the growth medium was prepared with distilled water and no ic sources were added it can be concluded that chlorella vulgaris is indeed capable of using the produced co2 during heterotrophic growth for photosynthesis moreover a two sample t test ms excel indicated a significant difference between the ph values of oc75 and oc75 l p 0 01 and also the biomass growth increased from 0 47 g dw g dwini 1 during the heterotrophic growth experiment to 0 82 g dw g dwini 1 during photoheterotrophic growth these results indicate that there indeed is a circulation of o2 and co2 between the cells of the green microalgae species chlorella vulgaris this is in agreement with cecchin et al 2018 who reported an increased co2 content during mixotrophic growth in chlorella sorokiniana based on gene expressions it remains to be proven whether this circulation occurs within a single microalgal cell this was assumed by grama et al 2016 since this would lead to better efficiencies for each metabolic pathway next mass balances were used in order to determine the amount of circulation of o2 and co2 fig 2 during the oc75 experiments table 1 75 mg d glucose l 1 was added reactor volume 1 3 l which resulted in a net o2 consumption of 15 23 0 09 mg o2 and a net proton production of 0 597 0 004 mg h it is assumed that the addition of oc will lead to the same amount of o2 and h consumed and or produced during the oc75 and oc75 l test however due to the difference in time before c depletion 0 397 d for oc75 0 600 d for oc75 l more oxygen and protons will be consumed and produced respectively due to er as such when taking into account the time duration 0 600 d and initial biomass concentration 0 125 g of the oc75 l test 7 73 mg o2 0 103 0 6 0 125 1000 is expected to be consumed for maintenance processes before c depletion this results in an overall o2 consumption of 23 3 mg o2 15 23 7 73 an analogous calculation can be performed for the titrimetric data which results in a total proton production of 0 648 0 004 mg h 0 597 0 051 the protons produced during the heterotrophic growth result from the uptake of nh4 and from changes in the c equilibrium in the water phase decostere et al 2013 grobbelaar 2004 according to the stoichiometric equation for the oxidation of d glucose to co2 depicted in fig 2 an o2 consumption of 23 mg o2 results in a net production of 32 4 mg co2 it has to be stressed that the amount of co2 could not be calculated based on the added amount of d glucose since a part of the d glucose will be used for biomass growth and not for energy production despite these activities resulting from the heterotrophic growth and er the oc75 l experiment yielded a total o2 production of 8 4 mg o2 and a total proton production of 0 5 0 1 mg table 2 when making the mass balance over the whole system this results in an overall production of 31 7 mg o2 23 8 and in a consumption of 0 12 0 1 mg h 0 64 0 52 fig 2 the lower amount of protons produced during photoheterotrophic growth results from the internal recycling of co2 which is not stripped to the atmosphere anymore as such less base had to be added due to changes in the c equilibrium in the water phase when using the stoichiometric equation for photoautotrophic growth depicted in fig 2 decostere et al 2016 31 7 mg o2 and 0 12 0 1 mg h correspond to a required co2 concentration of 33 7 mg co2 and 31 1 0 1 mg co2 respectively these amounts are the same as the produced amount of co2 during heterotrophic growth i e 32 4 mg co2 in addition it was observed that the measured profiles of the oc75 l experiment showed a constant o2 production and base addition fig 1c d this can be interpreted as a concurrent operational mechanism with an internal recycling of co2 and o2 in conclusion it seems that there is a 100 circulation of the produced amount of co2 within the microalgae cells during photoheterotrophic growth 3 3 mixotrophic growth mechanism fig 3 a and b compare the results of the mixotrophic experiments ic75 oc75 with the photoautotrophic experiments ic75 it can be noticed that the respirometric profiles overlap indeed there is no statistical difference between ic75 and ic75 oc75 in both the oxygen production rate p 0 52 and total oxygen production p 0 53 table 2 two sample t test ms excel however only the first part of the titrimetric profiles overlaps the second part of the mixotrophic experiment shows base addition which was not observed during the photoautotrophic experiment as discussed in section 3 1 base addition is an indication of heterotrophic growth when comparing the observed base addition rate during mixotrophic growth 4 2 mg h g dw 1 d 1 with the one observed during heterotrophic growth i e oc75 a significant α 0 05 difference was found p 0 04 however the base addition rate was statistically the same as in the oc75 l profile p 0 25 in addition the increase in biomass during mixotrophic growth 125 mg was a factor 1 34 larger than the sum of the biomass growth under photoautotrophic 26 0 mg and heterotrophic 67 0 mg conditions this shows a synergistic effect of the mixotrophic growth mechanism which is in accordance with other studies martinez and orus 1991 smith et al 2015 these results indicate that there is a preferential uptake of ic over oc for the microalgae species chlorella vulgaris indeed it seems that once all the ic is depleted the microalgae start consuming the oc source with an internal recycling of o2 co2 as described in section 3 2 this preference was also observed by sforza et al 2012 it is interesting to note that the microalgae in their work were cultivated in the presence of an oc source as such it seems that the lack oc acclimation during microalgae cultivation in this work did not affect the microalgae behavior next in order to analyze the effect of elevated ic levels on the mixotrophic growth mechanism sforza et al 2012 the ic oc ratio was increased from ic75 oc75 to ic190 oc100 fig 3c and d show a difference in the first part of both profiles this can be interpreted as a concurrent operation of the photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth pathway which was not observed during the ic75 oc75 experiment however the respirometric profiles only start deviating from each other when the o2 concentrations are around 15 20 g m 3 according to wágner et al 2016 no photoinhibition is to be expected at oxygen concentrations lower than 24 5 mg l 1 this might indicate that o2 concentrations of 15 20 g m 3 induce the heterotrophic growth pathway in order to avoid photorespiration after depletion of the ic source the o2 concentrations converge again until they completely overlap however the titrimetric profiles do not converge indeed the mixotrophic profile shows base addition 4 5 0 3 mg h g dw 1 d 1 which is statistically two sample t test ms excel the same p 0 80 as the ph measured during the ic75 oc75 experiment again indicating a synergistic effect based on these results three hypotheses were formulated firstly all co2 produced during photoheterotrophic growth is circulated within the microalgae cells which leads to an increased microalgae concentration and a net o2 production secondly the photoautotrophic growth mechanism is preferred over the heterotrophic growth mechanism thirdly high levels of oxygen due to elevated ic concentrations can activate the heterotrophic growth mechanism in order to avoid photorespiration in order to test these three hypotheses a previously developed microalgae model was extended 3 4 model development 3 4 1 heterotrophic microalgae model 3 4 1 1 kinetics in order to describe the heterotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris the photoautotrophic model described in section 2 4 was extended with heterotrophic activity table 4 using the cell based modelling approach of ross and geider 2009 in the latter model total cellular carbon is divided into a functional pool including proteins nucleic acids cell membrane and an energy reserve pool which contains the oc storage products i e carbohydrates and neutral lipids as a consequence a new variable for oc storage was introduced xsto g c m 3 storage of oc will occur during photoautotrophic growth section 3 4 2 but also due to the uptake of external oc and this until the maximum capacity qc max is reached once stored xsto can be used for biomass growth and er however when xsto drops below a threshold value qc min only er will occur when the reserves are fully depleted er will continue using carbon from the functional pool i e the microalgae biomass hence the model was extended with 1 oc uptake indicated as soc from the medium 2 heterotrophic growth on xsto and 3 endogenous respiration on xsto and when depleted microalgae biomass xalg oc uptake from the medium was mathematically expressed as adesanya et al 2014 4 ρ 1 f sto k 3 s o c s o c k oc x alg with 5 f s t o 1 q c q c m i n q c m a x q c q c m a x q c m i n q c m i n q c q c m a x 0 q c q c m a x where k3 is the c uptake rate 27 32 d 1 soc the oc concentration in the medium g c m 3 koc the affinity constant for oc 3 15 g c m 3 xalg the biomass concentration g dw m 3 qc max the maximum storage capacity of chlorella vulgaris 0 4571 g c g dw 1 qc min the threshold value for growth on oc storage 0 4143 g c g dw 1 and qc the stored amount of carbon in the microalgae g c g dw 1 with qc xsto xalg the values for the parameters in equations 4 and 5 in particular the storage capacity and the c uptake rate were adopted from adesanya et al 2014 the initial value of xsto was assigned 0 432 0 006 g c g dw 1 based on the er experiments fig s3 from these equations it can be seen that the oc uptake from the medium is expressed by monod kinetics and a linear dependency fsto on the stored amount of carbon this linear dependency states that there will be a maximum c uptake when qc qc min however between qc min and qc max the oc uptake rate will slow down in a linear way until the maximum cell quota for carbon is reached after which no additional c uptake will take place fsto 0 moreover when qc qc min the cells will stop producing biomass i e grow heterotrophically and will only use this carbon for maintenance i e er this will continue until the c storage is fully depleted ross and geider 2009 as such the growth on xsto can be modelled with similar equations as during photoautotrophic growth section 2 4 6 ρ 2 3 1 f s t o μ m a x h f c n p x a l g when simulating the experiments in this study the monod terms for no3 nh4 and po4 3 tend to 1 only the monod function for carbon gradually decreases to zero due to c depletion finally the er on xsto and xalg was modelled using equations 7 and 8 respectively reichert et al 2001 7 ρ 4 r x s t o x s t o k s t o x a l g 8 ρ 5 r k s t o k s t o x s t o x a l g with r the respiration rate 0 1 d 1 and ksto 0 2 g m 3 the affinity constant for respiration on stored oc 3 4 1 2 stoichiometry with regard to the stoichiometry of heterotrophic growth only the main nutrients c h n o and p were taken into account moreover growth on both nh4 and no3 were implemented with a preferential uptake of nh4 over no3 decostere et al 2016 the nutrient concentrations of n and p will not influence the specific heterotrophic growth rate μh section 3 4 1 1 although they do have an effect on the amount of protons that will be produced eq 9 or consumed eq 10 during heterotrophic growth 9 a c h 2 o b o 2 c n h 4 d h p o 4 2 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p e c o 2 f h 2 o g h 10 a c h 2 o b o 2 c n o 3 d h p o 4 2 e h c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p f c o 2 g h 2 o however in order to determine the correct stoichiometry information is missing this can be solved by assuming a yield coefficient on glucose yh g c g c 1 which determines the amount of ch2o that will be used for biomass production this results in the stoichiometric coefficients depicted in tables 4 and 5 the value of yh was calculated according to the oc75 experiments this test yielded an average biomass growth of 67 0 mg dw and an average o2 consumption of 21 mg i e including respiration table 2 resulting in a yield coefficient for oxygen on biomass of 0 3134 g o2 g dw 1 using the stoichiometric coefficients in table 4 and the solver function in ms excel the yh value was varied until the experimentally determined yield coefficient for oxygen on biomass was obtained fig s1 this resulted in an yh value of 0 753 g c g c 1 this number seems high but is in agreement with decker and tanner 1972 and perez garcia et al 2011 who stated that 80 85 of the glucose is assimilated and converted to oligo and polysaccharides in addition with regard to the production and or consumption of protons it is important to note that the uptake of ammonium and phosphate will influence the alkalinity of the growth medium in previous work regarding photoautotrophic growth decostere et al 2013 this was considered as negligible due to the high influence of the c equilibrium on the alkalinity of the medium however the experimental results clearly showed that chlorella vulgaris does not need external ic to grow heterotrophically in addition as described in section 3 1 no proton consumption was modelled for oc uptake from the medium endogenous respiration has an effect on o2 co2 h and biomass concentrations reichert et al 2001 however given the short duration of the experiments in this work only er on the stored c sources was expected as such the stoichiometry could be determined using the standard oxidation equation of oc 11 c h 2 o o 2 c o 2 h 2 o based on the measured o2 consumption rate of 0 103 0 007 g o2 g dw 1 d 1 table 2 during the er experiments and according to the stoichiometric relations in equation 11 the following yield coefficients were obtained for an endogenous respiration rate of 0 1 d 1 1 03 g o2 g dw 1 1 41 g co2 g dw 1 and 0 385 g c g dw 1 moreover also a proton production rate of 0 68 0 05 mg h g dw 1 d 1 was measured hence a yield coefficient of 6 8 mg h g dw 1 was added all stoichiometric coefficients are close to the values reported by reichert et al 2001 3 4 1 3 model analysis and calibration before model calibration a set of monte carlo simulations was performed in order to determine the sensitive parameters table 3 of the heterotrophic growth model table 4 the conditions of the oc100 experiment were used because the light intensity during this test was 0 μmol m 2 s 1 the photoautotrophic growth equations did not influence the model results avoiding possible interactions during model calibration the do concentration and added amount of base at t 0 2 d were selected as model output since there still was a strong activity at this point in time 0 598 d before c depletion table 2 the results of the linear regression with 1225 simulations indicated a strong sensitivity for yh t statistic do 94 7 t statistic h 96 4 and μmax h t statistic do 60 93 t statistic h 89 5 and a significant effect of the parameter k3 t statistic do 4 62 t statistic h 6 88 next collinearity analyses were performed with these three parameters the initial values were 0 753 g c g c 1 for yh section 3 4 1 2 1 2 d 1 for μmax h martinez and orus 1991 and 27 32 d 1 for k3 adesanya et al 2014 the results revealed that all parameter subsets had collinearity indexes below 10 meaning that all subsets are identifiable brun et al 2002 it must be stressed that it is remarkable that yh and μmax h are not correlated collinearity index 1 4 when analyzing the local sensitivity function for oxygen fig s2 it could indeed be observed that there is a different effect during the second part of the growth phase i e after c depletion model simulations revealed that increasing both yh and μmax h with 5 led to higher co2 and lower o2 concentrations in the water phase as a consequence upon c depletion more co2 will be stripped to the atmosphere and more o2 will enter the medium as such model calibration was performed with the parameter subset yh μmax h k3 the obtained values for oc75 were yh 0 720 0 001 g c g c 1 μmax h 1 26 0 02 d 1 and k3 27 3 d 1 the yh value of 0 720 g c g c 1 indicates that 80 of the oc added is taken up by the microalgal biomass which is in agreement with decker and tanner 1972 and perez garcia et al 2011 in addition a μmax h value of 1 26 d 1 lies within the range found in scientific literature martinez and orus 1991 smith et al 2015 after performing the collinearity analysis again with these values the same parameter subsets were identifiable the final tic values for all four heterotrophic profiles were lower than 0 3 indicating good model prediction audenaert et al 2010 3 4 2 photoautotrophic model adjustments during photoautotrophic growth microalgae will produce an excess of carbon which is stored inside their cell i e xsto adesanya et al 2014 ross and geider 2009 as such the photoautotrophic model of manhaeghe et al 2019 was extended with this process based on figueroa torres et al 2017 the yield coefficient for this process is set to 0 0165 g c g dw 1 however it has to be taken into account that this is the net production of additional carbon meaning that the amount of carbon consumed during er i e 0 385 g c g dw 1 is also produced during photosynthetic growth this results in a yield coefficient of 0 4016 g c g dw 1 y13 table 5 secondly in order not to overcomplicate the model the original detailed respiration function was replaced by the endogenous respiration equation discussed in section 3 4 1 simulating this model for the photoautotrophic growth experiments revealed an overestimation in both the o2 production and acid addition since the initial biomass concentration was doubled in comparison with manhaeghe et al 2019 100 g dw m 3 in this work it was hypothesized that this overestimation is caused by the phenomenon of self shading this would lead to a lower amount of photons reaching every single algal cell lowering the photoautotrophic growth rate μmax a when simulating the photoautotrophic experiments with the original model of manhaeghe et al 2019 the same overestimation was observed this confirmed the hypothesis of self shading due to increased biomass concentration since it was not the goal of this research to model the light penetration in the reactor the photoautotrophic growth rate μmax a was calibrated using the respirometric and tritrimetric data of all four photoautotrophic experiments this yielded a μmax a of 3 54 d 1 when running the model with these adjustments tic values below 0 3 were obtained for both ic75 and ic190 indicating good model fit audenaert et al 2010 it must be noticed that the modelled o2 concentration of the ic190 experiment is higher than the one measured this can be explained by the lack of photorespiration in the model structure however since this process is rather complex to model and the model fit is reasonable it was decided not to perform additional experiments to include photorespiration into the model structure 3 4 3 mixotrophic microalgae model 3 4 3 1 kinetics and stoichiometry in a next step the heterotrophic model section 3 4 1 and photoautotrophic model section 3 4 2 were combined in section 3 3 it was hypothesized that 1 all co2 produced during photoheterotrophic growth was circulated within the microalgae cells 2 there is a preferential uptake of ic over oc and 3 high levels of oxygen can activate the heterotrophic growth mechanism in order to avoid photorespiration the internal circulation of co2 is inherent to the model structure since co2 is taken up preferentially above hco3 produced co2 will immediately be consumed the preferential uptake of ic was modelled by extending equation 6 12 ρ 2 3 1 f s t o μ m a x h f c n p k i μ a k i μ a μ a 3 x a l g this extension was done in accordance to the hill equation haefner 2005 to create an s shaped curve as function of μa meaning that if the autotrophic growth rate is too high no heterotrophic growth will occur ki μa was given an empirical value of 0 2 d 3 in order to still adequately describe the μa profile of the ic75 test this expression was used rather than an inhibition by ic since microalgae should still be capable of growing heterotrophically in the dark when ic is available in the growth medium the same stoichiometry is used as for equation 6 tables 4 and 5 with regard to the activation of μmax h in order to avoid photorespiration the model was extended with the following process 13 ρ 6 7 1 f s t o μ m a x h f c n p 1 1 e s 1 o 2 s 2 μ a 3 μ a 3 k i μ a x a l g this was done in order to enable heterotrophic growth at higher o2 concentrations a sigmoidal curve i e logistic curve was added where s1 stands for the width of the s shape and s2 stands for the midpoint of the s curve according to wágner et al 2016 photoinhibition occurs at o2 concentrations higher than 24 5 mg l 1 as such until model calibration s2 was assigned an initial value of 24 5 g o2 m 3 s1 was given an empirical value of 4 this function also returns a value between 0 and 1 the same stoichiometry was used as for equation 6 tables 4 and 5 3 4 3 2 model analysis and calibration before calibrating the mixotrophic model a set of monte carlo simulations was performed the model output at t 0 15 d was taken rather than at t 0 2 section 3 4 1 3 since the time before c depletion is shorter during mixotrophic tests 0 304 d vs 0 598 d the sensitivity of the parameters ki μa range 0 02 d 3 0 5 d 3 s1 range 1 5 6 5 and s2 range 19 g m 3 26 5 g m 3 was assessed using the model with initial variable values of the ic190 oc100 experiments the linear regression of the 525 simulations revealed that only the parameters s1 t statistic do 2 7 t statistic hp 2 5 and s2 t statistic do 46 7 t statistic hp 27 3 were sensitive however the collinearity analysis indicated that the parameter subset s1 s2 is not identifiable collinearity index 20 as such it was decided to only calibrate the more sensitive parameter s2 and keep the assigned value of 4 for s1 the calibration yielded a value of 24 50 0 02 g o2 m 3 when simulating the mixotrophic model it can be seen from fig 4 that there is a good agreement between the predicted and measured values however there still is a discrepancy between the o2 production at the ic190 oc100 level this can be explained by the lack of photorespiration included in the model structure which was also observed when modelling the photoautotrophic growth at ic190 due to the complexity of this process it was decided not to include this process in the model structure overall the mixotrophic microalgae model was able to predict all the measured respirometric titrimetric profiles with tic values below the threshold value of 0 3 table s6 however with regard to the oc75 l experiment it seems that the model has a small shortcoming at the end of the experiment fig s19 this is probably due to the lack of a photorespiration term indeed co2 concentrations smaller than 0 02 mg l 1 were predicted by the model while o2 concentrations were stable around 9 5 mg l 1 with regard to the co2 diffusion between the atmosphere and the microalgae suspension it is interesting to note that during photoautotrophic experiments 76 6 of the biomass growth happened before c depletion the remaining part was due to co2 diffusion from the atmosphere however before c depletion stripping of co2 occurred due to er and a shift in the c equilibrium in the water phase indicating that all o2 production upon c depletion can be addressed to the added ic source during heterotrophic tests without light no additional growth occurred after c depletion and only a small amount of decay i e 0 01 the latter can be explained by the respiration on stored organic compounds during the oc75 l experiment 86 3 of the biomass growth occurred before c depletion when omitting the co2 diffusion from the model the biomass growth upon c depletion decreased with 2 7 0 5 this shows only a small effect of the co2 diffusion on the photoheterotrophic experiment next the added value of the preferential factors presented in equations 12 and 13 was assessed by means of the sse with regard to the ic75 oc75 profile the sse improved with 12 and 165 for the respirometric and titrimetric profiles respectively when including the preferential factors in the model structure the same was observed for the ic190 oc100 profile where the sse improved with 16 and 49 for the respirometric and titrimetric profiles respectively furthermore in terms of biomass growth a recovery i e biomass growth model biomass growth measured of 76 80 was found for the model without preferential factors whereas recoveries of 98 108 were found for the model including preferential terms as such it can be concluded that the model yields better results when the preferential factors are included this supports the hypotheses formulated based on the experimental data as such this work shows that modelling multiple effects such as light intensity nutrient concentrations e g ic and oc concentrations and temperature can help to further increase the knowledge needed to optimize the operation of microalgae systems overall it seems that introducing all aspects of photorespiration might help to fully explain the synergistic effect observed during mixotrophic growth it must be stated however that the results in this work were obtained by using microalgae cultures with low densities i e initial tss of 100 g m 3 during short time batch experiments further model development taking into account self shading at higher microalgae concentrations is recommended for assessing long term experiments in continuous reactors 4 conclusions a combined respirometric titrimetric unit was used to assess the photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth of the green microalgae species chlorella vulgaris mass balances revealed that under photoheterotrophic conditions all the produced co2 derived from assimilating the organic carbon source was internally recycled for photoautotrophic growth furthermore from the experimental data it was hypothesized that photoautotrophic growth is the preferential growth mechanism of chlorella vulgaris and that high oxygen concentrations due to elevated ic concentrations can activate concurrent heterotrophic growth in order to avoid photorespiration these findings were used to extend an existing mathematical model describing the photoautotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris with 1 the heterotrophic growth pathway and 2 with factors taking into account the formulated hypotheses the results showed good model performance for all measurements with tic values below 0 3 as such supporting the formulated hypotheses these new insights can now be used to further investigate the optimization of mixotrophic microalgae growth lowering the cost of microalgae harvesting and making this technique economically more viable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
