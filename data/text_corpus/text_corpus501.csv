2505,fluoride enrichment in groundwater of coastal plains poses a potential health hazard to hundreds of millions of people in the present study 515 groundwater samples were collected from shallow and deep aquifers to investigate spatial distribution quantify the dominant mechanisms and factors of f enrichment in groundwater and assess potential health hazards of groundwater f results showed that high f groundwater was widely distributed in deep aquifers with chemical types of hco3 na and cl na and sporadically distributed in shallow aquifers based on the groundwater chemistry characterization and regression analysis it was found that mineral dissolution and precipitation cation exchange desorption evaporation and competitive adsorption jointly controlled groundwater f enrichment in the study area which contributes 61 15 11 and 7 and 5 respectively the influence of seawater intrusion on groundwater f enrichment was ignored the results of health risk assessments indicated that more than 85 of deep groundwater samples posed potential health hazards to infants children and adult females and males while approximately 55 of shallow groundwater samples posed potential health hazards to infants followed by 27 to children 22 to adult females and 18 to adult males this study provides a scientific basis for the effective management of high f groundwater in coastal plains keywords fluoride coastal plain hydrogeochemical processes relative contribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fluoride is an essential trace element of the human body appropriate amounts of fluoride can strengthen skeletal tissues and teeth however lack of fluoride in the human diet may limit tissue growth and impair fertility and an excess intake of f can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis ayoob and gupta 2006 sahu et al 2017 yadav et al 2019 the world health organization recommends a safe limit of 1 5 mg l for f in drinking water while the safe limit for f in drinking water is 1 0 mg l in china gb5749 2022 this study considered the chinese safe limit as the criterion for identifying high f groundwater around 200 million people are suffering chronic endemic fluorosis around the world in 28 countries including in the united states mcmahon et al 2020 harkness and jurgens 2022 brazil de souza et al 2013 south africa onipe et al 2021 podgorski and berg 2022 india meenakshi et al 2004 vikas et al 2013 malawi addison et al 2020 mexico armienta and segovia 2008 pakistan rafique et al 2009 ukraine fordyce et al 2007 and china chen et al 2012 2020a currell et al 2011 hu et al 2022 li et al 2021 liu et al 2016 pi et al 2015 qiao et al 2022 in china more than 41 million and 2 6 million people in 29 provinces suffer from dental and skeletal fluorosis respectively yang et al 2003 jia et al 2018 there are three main sources of natural enrichment of f in groundwater fractured fissured bedrock of fluorine containing minerals active volcanic belts of fluorine containing volcanic rocks and fluorine containing sediments in arid semi arid regions fuge 2019 wang et al 2021b regenspurg et al 2022 several studies were also conducted in the shallow aquifers of hard rocks in africa fantong et al 2010 yidana et al 2010 high fluoride groundwater was discovered in hohhot inner mongolia china and the geological source was found to be fluorine containing volcanic rocks dong et al 2015 in addition high fluoride groundwater has been found in sedimentary aquifers in arid semi arid regions of southeastern south america northern china and eastern africa chowdhury et al 2019 the leaching of fluoride containing minerals is the most important process forming high f groundwater so the lithology and hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer are the basis of f enrichment in groundwater edmunds and smedley 2013 hydrogeochemical processes controlling f behavior in groundwater systems generally include dissolution and precipitation adsorption and desorption cation exchange and evaporation in arid and semi arid regions wang et al 2021b high concentrations of hco3 and na in groundwater can promote f release but excess ca2 may precipitate f from groundwater as caf2 rango et al 2009 the adsorption and desorption of f depend on groundwater ph at low ph f can easily form complexes with al and fe in sediments while under alkaline conditions oh and hco3 can compete for adsorption sites on aquifer sediments with adsorbed f guo et al 2012 intense evaporation in arid and semi arid regions can directly lead to an increase in f concentration in shallow groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 furthermore evaporation indirectly accelerates the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals and f enrichment by promoting the precipitation of low soluble minerals e g calcite and dolomite and further lowers the ca2 content of groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in addition to inland plains and basins high f groundwater was also widely distributed in coastal areas in southern india southern california the northern coast of the mediterranean sea the east coast of south america southern africa and northern china chowdhury et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021 subba rao 2017 the high f groundwater in the coastal bedrock aquifer in southern india and in laizhou bay china was thought to be related to seawater intrusion which brought in large amounts of hco3 and na the competitive adsorption of hco3 promoted f enrichment and the increase in na contributed to the presence of aqueous fluoride mainly in the form of naf chen et al 2020b singaraja et al 2013 the southern part of the liaohe plain in china was also subject to seawater intrusion and the sediments contained large amounts of fluorinated minerals but no excess was detected in the groundwater within the area of seawater intrusion zuo et al 2019 high f groundwater in the coastal area might be related to the release of pore water from compacted clay layers due to ground subsidence li et al 2020 han et al 2021 and after the south to north water diversion project land subsidence has slowed down especially in the central area of land subsidence thereby restricting the release of fluoride rich pore water sun et al 2022 mcmahon et al 2020 found that water rock interaction and evaporation were the main pathways of groundwater f enrichment in the coastal plain of southern california rahman et al 2020 found that the fluoride exceedance rate was greater in the dry season than in the wet season but they did not elucidate the enrichment mechanism and the causes of seasonal differences about groundwater f therefore in coastal plains controlling factors of f enrichment in groundwater are controversial and the health hazards for humans from groundwater f are unclear the north china plain is the most extensive high f groundwater area that exists in china among which the coastal plain is the most affected area with groundwater f ion concentration as high as 9 2 mg l jia et al 2018 the scarcity of fresh groundwater in the coastal area and the excess f in groundwater make it more difficult to ensure the safety of drinking water han et al 2020 han and currell 2022 therefore the present study aims to investigate the spatial distribution of high f groundwater elucidate the factors driving f enrichment in shallow and deep groundwater and assess the health hazards of excessive f in drinking water 2 study area as one of the largest groundwater systems worldwide thickness of neogene and paleogene sediments of the north china plain ncp are 1 2 2 5 km and 5 7 km respectively ncp is located in a continental semiarid climate zone with a mean annual temperature ranging from 12 to 13 mean annual precipitation of 583 mm and mean annual evaporation of 1100 2000 mm where the rivers belong to the two basin systems of haihe river and luanhe river the terrain of ncp is flat and the altitude gradually declines from 100 m above mean sea level a m s l of the piedmont to 2 3 m a m s l on the coast from the western piedmont to the east coast the cenozoic strata range from fluvial deposits to alluvial and lacustrine deposits to alluvial deposits with interbedded marine deposits in the coastal plain according to the sedimentary and geographic characteristics the hydrogeological zones of ncp are divided into three parts piedmont alluvial proluvial clinoplain central alluvial lacustrine plain and coastal plain zhang et al 1997 chen et al 2005 cao et al 2013 the study area is the coastal plain of bohai rim and also is the coastal area of the north china plain this area is a regional groundwater discharge zone fig 1 which is underlain by thick 400 600 m alluvial deposits intercalated by marine sediments the quaternary aquifers the main source of groundwater supply are generally separated into four groups aquifer ⅰ holocene aquifer aquifer ⅱ upper pleistocene aquifer aquifer iii middle pleistocene aquifer and aquifer iv lower pleistocene aquifer respectively chen et al 2014 liu et al 2016 aquifer ⅰ consists of estuarine and deltaic facies aquifer ⅱ is predominantly composed of fluvial sediments interbedded with marine sediments aquifer iii is characterized by shallow lacustrine to diluvium aquifer iv is composed mostly of terrigenous deposits originated from river channel and floodplain cai et al 2014 the shallow groundwater mentioned in this study refers to the groundwater in aquifers ⅰ and ⅱ while the deep groundwater refers to the groundwater in aquifers iii and iv 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analysis this study collected 515 groundwater samples including 254 shallow ones and 261 deep ones from july to august of 2017 from agricultural irrigation and domestic wells the coastal plain of the bohai rim groundwater samples were obtained through pumping for 20 min to minimize the disturbance of stagnant water through an in line flow cell under minimal atmospheric contact the groundwater temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured by a multiparameter portable meter hi 9828 hanna groundwater alkalinity was determined by a model 16 900 digital titrator hach in the field with 0 22 μm membrane filters all samples were filtered with ultrapure 6 m hno3 groundwater samples for major cations were acidified to ph 2 0 samples for anion analysis were filtered and stored without being acidified all samples were stored at 4 during shipment and preservation through refrigeration in the laboratory before analysis in the key laboratory of groundwater science and engineering ministry of natural resources concentrations of major cations were determined by icp aes and the analytical precision was 3 0 by ion chromatography dx 120 dionex unacidified aliquots were used to determine major anions with the analytical precision less than 5 0 an ion selective electrode method was applied to determine dissolved fluoride with the analytical precision less than 5 0 about 97 of samples ion charge imbalance are less than 5 3 2 data processing the saturation index si of selected minerals fluorite calcite and dolomite as well as groundwater f and ca2 activities across the study area were computed by the phreeqc version 3 7 1 software to illustrate the influence of mineral dissolution and precipitation on f enrichment the si value can indicate the equilibrium state of minerals si 0 undersaturation si 0 equilibrium si 0 oversaturation piper diagram scatter diagrams and correlation analysis were introduced to illustrate the groundwater s general chemical characteristics and reveal the controlling mechanisms and factors of f enrichment in groundwater before conducting data processing the datasets were checked to determine whether they conform to a normal distribution relative importance can be given to the contribution made by each predictor to r square both alone and in combination with other predictors a new method called relative weights shows significant promise closely approximating the mean increase in r square that is obtained by adding a predictor variable across all possible sub models johnson and lebreton 2004 lebreton and tonidandel 2008 in this study the relweights function of r language was performed to evaluate the relative contributions of multiple controlling mechanisms and factors on f enrichment of groundwater 3 3 health risk assessment the health risk assessment hra model was developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2004 fluoride poses a non carcinogenic risk to humans with oral ingestion being the primary exposure pathway so this study selected oral ingestion data to make assessment on the potential health risk of groundwater f based on a non carcinogen risk assessment model nawale et al 2021 zango et al 2019 cdi c i r e f e d 365 e d b w hq cdi rfd where cdi refers to the daily intake doses of f through oral ingestion c refers to the analyzed concentration of groundwater f ir refers to the daily water consumption 0 65 1 5 2 66 and 3 62 l day for infants children adult females and males respectively zhang et al 2021a ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china 2013 ef and ed refer to the exposure frequency 365 days year and exposure duration 0 5 years for infants 6 years for children 24 years for adult females and males bw denotes the body average weight 6 94 25 9 64 and 73 kg for infants children adult females and males respectively xiao et al 2022 rfd indicates the reference dose of f in a specific exposure pathway 0 06 mg kg d the potential health risks to human health are unacceptable if the calculated hq value is greater than 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 general hydrochemistry and spatial distribution of groundwater f obvious differences in chemical characteristics were observed between shallow and deep groundwater samples across the study area fig 2 shallow groundwater ph ranged from 6 55 to 9 10 with a median of 7 33 the range of tds is 316 0 mg l to 145997 mg l implying a large variety in salinity about 96 5 of groundwater samples exceeded the safe limit for chinese drinking purposes of 1000 mg l gb5749 2022 in terms of tds shallow groundwater alkalinity ranged from 30 5 to 26670 mg l with a median of 1336 2 mg l na was the dominant cation and followed by mg ca2 k with medians of 1188 9 203 4 201 2 and 16 4 mg l respectively the dominant anion in shallow groundwater was cl followed by hco3 and so4 2 with medians of 1860 8 614 7 and 576 9 mg l respectively actually percentages of the sample exceeding the safe limit about na cl and so4 2 were 95 3 95 7 and 80 7 respectively deep groundwater was slightly alkaline with a ph median value of 8 31 groundwater tds ranged from 246 to 18002 mg l and 50 8 of samples exceeded the safe limit the major cation and anion of deep groundwater were na and hco3 with medians of 359 0 and 341 0 mg l respectively compared with shallow groundwater lower percentages of the sample exceeding the limit were observed in deep groundwater with 70 1 for na 48 0 for cl and 16 9 for so4 2 respectively the chemical types of shallow groundwater were dominated by cl na and mixed cl ca mg while the deep groundwater chemical types witnessed a big variation varying from fresh hco3 na type to mixed hco3 na ca to cl na fig 3 the median of shallow groundwater f concentrations was 0 50 mg l ranging from 0 10 to 4 50 mg l while the median of deep groundwater f concentrations was 2 60 mg l ranging from 0 10 to 7 08 mg l about 16 1 of shallow groundwater samples and 84 6 of deep ones were beyond the chinese drinking water limit the shallow high f groundwaters were sporadically distributed in the study area with a chemical type of cl na while the deep high f groundwaters were widely distributed along the coastal plain with chemical types of hco3 na and cl na figs 1 and 3 the result of generally higher f in deep groundwater compared to shallow groundwater is consistent with the finding of han and currell 2022 4 2 hydrogeochemical processes controlling f release 4 2 1 dissolution and precipitation as presented in fig 4 a the si fluorite was less than 0 and had an exponential relationship with f concentration which demonstrated that the dissolution of fluorite might be the main source of dissolved f the si fluorite of deep groundwater was slightly higher than that of shallow groundwater a negative correlation was observed between ca2 and f in deep groundwater r 0 19 p 0 01 which suggests that excess ca2 could potentially restrain the dissolution of fluorite furthermore the si calcite and si dolomite were more than 0 implying that the calcite and dolomite were in states of oversaturation the precipitation of both would consume dissolved ca2 fig 4c d which decreased the dissolved ca2 concentrations and promoted the dissolution of fluorite the dissolution of fluorite was a process of dynamic equilibrium and dissolved f concentrations were regulated by fluorite solubility in groundwater pkfluorite 10 6 when fluorite dissolved congruently the activities of f and ca2 usually fell on line 1 however in this study the activities of both ions in high f groundwater samples fell on the right side of line 1 and also below the line of pkfluorite suggesting that apart from fluorite dissolution there were other sources of ca2 such as calcite and dolomite dissolution fig 4b the activities of f and ca2 were expected to follow line 2 when calcite and fluorite coexisted in sediments and dissolved with a 200 1 ratio guo et al 2012 groundwater samples were located between line 1 and line 2 suggesting that the f concentration was controlled by dissolved ca2 derived from minerals such as fluorite and calcite avtar et al 2013 si calcite greater than 0 for most samples implied that the calcite was under oversaturation fig 4c which contributed to the decrease of dissolved ca2 concentration and further facilitated fluorite dissolution the activities of f and ca2 in shallow high f groundwaters mostly fell between lines 2 and 3 fig 4b indicating that the calcite precipitation contributed to dissovled f concentration in addition the activities of f and ca2 in deep high f groundwaters were mostly plotted between line 1 and line 3 fig 4b implying that in addition to mineral precipitation cation exchange also had a significant influence on f release 4 2 2 cation exchange cation exchange can increase na concentration and decrease ca2 concentration in groundwater which accelerates the dissolution of fluorite and other fluorine containing minerals and further regulates the f enrichment of groundwater in the aquifer liu et al 2015 wang et al 2021b two indicators cai 1 cl na k cl and cai 2 cl na k so4 2 hco3 no3 co3 2 generally reflected the possibility of cation exchange in groundwater as presented in fig 5 a the cai 1 and cai 2 of shallow groundwater were positive while the indices of most deep groundwater samples were negative suggesting that the cation exchange exhibited an important influence on regulating the groundwater chemical composition with this regulation the ca2 and mg2 in groundwater were depleted and further the dissolution of f containing minerals would be promoted the negative relationship between ca2 and f in deep groundwater supported the above assumption r 0 19 p 0 01 in addition concentrations of groundwater f had a positive relationship with na ca2 mg2 molar ratios in groundwater shallow groundwater r 0 38 p 0 01 deep groundwater r 0 48 p 0 01 fig 5b indicating the positive influence of cation exchange on groundwater f concentrations this observation is in accordance with the findings of field and laboratory studies currell et al 2011 su et al 2013 li et al 2019 suggesting that na rich and ca depleted groundwater favor f enrichment 4 2 3 desorption and competitive adsorption desorption of f in groundwater with high ph is an important mechanism of f release in the study area around 70 of high f groundwater samples ph values are greater than 8 0 fig 6 a generally higher than the point of zero charge of most natural minerals 7 to 8 and thus the exchangeable f would be released from negatively charged surfaces of sediments mcnab et al 2009 jeong et al 2013 in shallow groundwater 34 of the high f samples ph values are greater than 8 0 while in deep groundwater the value was as high as 76 indicating that ph was a key factor affecting f enrichment in deep groundwater moreover under high ph conditions the competitive adsorption between oh and f could promote f release from the solid surfaces due to their similar ionic radii sreedevi et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 in addition hco3 concentrations in deep groundwater with high amounts of dissolved f were generally high in our study area and the groundwater chemical type was mainly hco3 na type numerous studies have shown that high f is usually accompanied by high hco3 in groundwater pi et al 2015 wang et al 2021b mcmahon et al 2020 the significantly positive correlation between dissolved f and hco3 concentrations in deep groundwater r 0 51 p 0 01 suggested that the presence of hco3 favored f release fig 6b on the one hand high hco3 facilitated competitive adsorption between negatively charged hco3 and f which resulted in the release of the previously captured f on sediments into groundwater on the other hand the elevated hco3 tended to form low soluble minerals e g calcite and dolomite with ca2 thus reducing the concentration of dissolved ca2 and promoting the dissolution of fluorite rafique et al 2009 puccia et al 2018 wang et al 2021b however in shallow groundwater there was no good correlation between hco3 and f indicating that hco3 had little effect on the release of f 4 3 factors affecting f concentration of groundwater 4 3 1 evaporation as a common hydrological process in nature evaporation increases all ions concentrations in water by concentrating the gibbs diagram showed that the chemical composition of shallow groundwater was regulated by evaporation fig 7 a and b the buried depth of shallow groundwater in the variation of 2 10 m provided favorable conditions for evaporation chen et al 2005 cao et al 2013 li et al 2020 furthermore scatter diagram of f cl molar ratio versus f was performed to evaluate the relationship between groundwater f enrichment and evaporation fig 7c results showed that the ratios of f cl molar ratio in shallow high f groundwater were below the reference value 0 02 of undisturbed precipitation currell et al 2011 confirming the positive influence of evaporation on the enrichment of f some deep groundwater samples had similar chemical characteristics to shallow groundwater affected by evaporation which was mainly due to the downward recharge of shallow groundwater caused by the extraction of deep groundwater in ncp with the increasing f concentrations the ratios of f cl molar ratio of most deep groundwater samples showed an increasing trend indicating a geogenic enrichment which was confirmed by the hco3 na type of deep groundwater furthermore evaporation increased groundwater ph because of loss of co2 and to a certain degree elevated f concentration 4 3 2 seawater intrusion groundwater affected by seawater intrusion is always characterized by high ph tds and na ca2 molar ratio and some studies have concluded that high f groundwater is favorable in conditions with enriched na and hco3 and depleted ca2 ozsvath 2009 fuge 2019 thus seawater intrusion has recently been regarded as an important dynamic affecting groundwater f concentrations chen et al 2020a liu et al 2022 the aquifers in the study area might be affected by seawater intrusion due to their proximity to the bohai sea the key to studying the influence of seawater intrusion on groundwater f enrichment was to determine whether seawater intrusion occurred within the aquifers the major anion in seawater was cl while the major anions in freshwater in the coastal aquifers were hco3 and so4 2 the cl hco3 mass ratios in seawater and groundwater differed by several orders of magnitude and varying levels of seawater intrusion could be the cause of obvious changes in the ratios of groundwater some researchers classified the degree of seawater intrusion into three levels in the relationship diagram between cl hco3 mass ratios and cl concentrations park et al 2012 wang et al 2021a the results showed that 21 of the shallow groundwaters and 53 of the deep groundwaters were brackish while 75 of the shallow groundwaters and 2 of the deep groundwaters were saline fig 7d further cation exchange caused by seawater intrusion together with high ph resulted in the consumption of dissolved ca2 and facilitated f release which was supported by the findings in seawater intrusion area of gaomi city chen et al 2020a 2020b 4 4 relative contributions of controlling mechanisms and factors on f enrichment of groundwater dissolution and precipitation cation exchange as well as desorption and competitive adsorption were the main mechanisms resulting in the spatial variations in groundwater f concentrations which were also regulated by the evaporation and seawater intrusion however the relative contributions of these mechanisms and factors were unclear in this study si fluorite si calcite and si dolomite were proposed to refer to mineral dissolution and precipitation edmunds and smedley 2013 wang et al 2021b na ca2 mg2 molar ratio was proposed to refer to cation exchange li et al 2018 ph and hco3 were proposed to refer to desorption and competitive adsorption pi et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 in addition mass ratios of cl cl hco3 and cl hco3 were proposed to refer to the influences of evaporation and seawater intrusion respectively fuge 2019 mcmahon et al 2020 wang et a 2021a the relweights function was introduced to determine the relative contributions of the above processes results showed that the total contribution of si fluorite si calcite and si dolomite to dissolved f contents was 61 table 1 suggesting that the dissolution of fluorine containing minerals accompanied by the dissolution of calcite and dolomite was the most crucial control mechanism for the formation of high f groundwater this is consistent with the findings of hu et al 2022 and zhang et al 2021b cation exchange contributed 15 and had a more positive impact on f release in deep groundwater than that in shallow groundwater fig 5b the contribution of groundwater ph to f release was 11 although the contribution of hco3 to f release was only 5 in all groundwaters a significant positive correlation between hco3 and f in deep groundwater r 0 51 p 0 01 was observed indicating that the competitive adsorption of hco3 was a key hydrogeochemical process causing f release the contributions of evaporation and seawater intrusion to f enrichment in groundwater were 7 and 1 respectively therefore the dissolution of fluorine containing minerals accompanied by the precipitation of carbonate minerals was the dominant mechanism of groundwater f enrichment followed by cation exchange desorption evaporation and competitive adsorption the influence of seawater intrusion on groundwater f enrichment was ignored 4 5 health hazards of high f groundwater the hq index was used to assess the potential hazards of groundwater f to human health adimalla and qian 2019 results showed that the hq values exhibited obvious changes for infants children adult females and adult males fig 8 the hq values in the shallow groundwater for infants children adult females and adult males ranged between 0 23 and 10 1 median 1 12 0 14 6 25 median 0 69 0 11 4 86 median 0 54 and 0 13 5 61 median 0 62 respectively around 55 of groundwater samples exceeded the safety limit of 1 xiao et al 2022 and led to a health threat to infants followed by 27 to children 22 to adult males and 18 to adult females the hq values in the deep groundwater ranged between 0 23 and 15 90 median 5 84 for infants 0 14 9 83 median 3 79 for children 0 11 7 65 median 2 81 for adult females and 0 13 8 83 median 3 24 for adult males approximately 96 91 89 and 91 of samples threat infants children adult females and adult males health respectively the potential health threat of f in deep groundwater was higher than that in shallow groundwater for the four groups spatially the health hazards of f in shallow groundwater were sporadically distributed in the study area the high health hazards to infants were mainly distributed in the south near the yellow river while the high health hazards of f for children and adult females males were very limited fig 9 in contrast to shallow groundwater deep groundwater posed a more serious f hazard to human health the distribution of high health hazards to infants were primarily in the hai river and ziya river while the high health hazards to other populations were mainly concentrated in the hai river due to the high health hazards faced by the population from deep groundwater f near the hai river it is not proper to take deep groundwater as a priority resource for domestic usages in addition appropriate treatment targeting high f groundwater is required in high health hazard areas 5 conclusion this study was conducted to elucidate the spatial distribution dominant controlling mechanisms and factors and potential health hazards of groundwater f concentrations in the coastal plain of bohai rim the deep groundwater witnessed an extensive excess of fluoride with an excess rate of 84 6 and a median of 2 60 mg l high f groundwater samples were characterized by chemical types of hco3 na and cl na although the excess rate of f in shallow groundwater was 16 1 obviously lower than that of deep groundwater the excess of other components needed be concerned such as 95 7 for cl and 95 3 for na fluorite dissolution was the dominant source of groundwater f regulated by the precipitation of calcite and dolomite the dissolution and precipitation of fluorite calcite and dolomite contributed 61 to f enrichment in groundwater of the coastal plain differences in dissolution and precipitation of these three minerals in the aquifer were the primary cause of the differences in f concentrations between shallow and deep groundwater furthermore cation exchange desorption and evaporation facilitated f enrichment which contributes 15 11 and 7 respectively the weak alkaline environment of deep groundwater with high na ca2 mg2 molar ratios was conducive to the occurrence of cation exchange and desorption while the shallower groundwater table was conducive to the evaporation of shallow groundwater in particular the competitive adsorption hco3 prevailed in deep groundwater the results of hq indicated that around 55 of shallow groundwater samples brought potential health hazards to infants followed by 27 to children 22 to adult females and 18 to adult males and on a more serious note more than 85 of deep groundwater samples brought potential health hazards to the four groups

2505,fluoride enrichment in groundwater of coastal plains poses a potential health hazard to hundreds of millions of people in the present study 515 groundwater samples were collected from shallow and deep aquifers to investigate spatial distribution quantify the dominant mechanisms and factors of f enrichment in groundwater and assess potential health hazards of groundwater f results showed that high f groundwater was widely distributed in deep aquifers with chemical types of hco3 na and cl na and sporadically distributed in shallow aquifers based on the groundwater chemistry characterization and regression analysis it was found that mineral dissolution and precipitation cation exchange desorption evaporation and competitive adsorption jointly controlled groundwater f enrichment in the study area which contributes 61 15 11 and 7 and 5 respectively the influence of seawater intrusion on groundwater f enrichment was ignored the results of health risk assessments indicated that more than 85 of deep groundwater samples posed potential health hazards to infants children and adult females and males while approximately 55 of shallow groundwater samples posed potential health hazards to infants followed by 27 to children 22 to adult females and 18 to adult males this study provides a scientific basis for the effective management of high f groundwater in coastal plains keywords

appropriate amounts of fluoride can strengthen skeletal tissues and teeth however lack of fluoride in the human diet may limit tissue growth and impair fertility and an excess intake of f can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis ayoob and gupta 2006 sahu et al 2017 yadav et al 2019 the world health organization recommends a safe limit of 1 5 mg l for f in drinking water while the safe limit for f in drinking water is 1 0 mg l in china gb5749 2022 this study considered the chinese safe limit as the criterion for identifying high f groundwater around 200 million people are suffering chronic endemic fluorosis around the world in 28 countries including in the united states mcmahon et al 2020 harkness and jurgens 2022 brazil de souza et al 2013 south africa onipe et al 2021 podgorski and

fluorosis respectively yang et al 2003 jia et al 2018 there are three main sources of natural enrichment of f in groundwater fractured fissured bedrock of fluorine containing minerals active volcanic belts of fluorine containing volcanic rocks and fluorine containing sediments in arid semi arid regions fuge 2019 wang et al 2021b regenspurg et al 2022 several studies were also conducted in the shallow aquifers of hard rocks in africa fantong et al 2010 yidana et al 2010 high fluoride groundwater was discovered in hohhot inner mongolia china and the geological source was found to be fluorine containing volcanic rocks dong et al 2015 in addition high fluoride groundwater has been found in sedimentary aquifers in arid semi arid regions of southeastern south america northern china and eastern africa chowdhury et al 2019 the leaching of fluoride containing minerals is the most important process forming high f groundwater so the lithology and hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer are the basis of f enrichment in groundwater edmunds and smedley 2013 hydrogeochemical processes controlling f behavior in groundwater systems generally include dissolution and precipitation adsorption and desorption cation exchange and evaporation in arid and semi arid regions wang et al 2021b high concentrations of hco3 and na in groundwater can promote f release but excess ca2 may precipitate f from groundwater as caf2 rango et al 2009 the adsorption and desorption of f depend on groundwater ph at low ph f can easily form complexes with al and fe in sediments while under alkaline conditions oh and hco3 can compete for adsorption sites on aquifer sediments with adsorbed f guo et al 2012 intense evaporation in arid and semi arid regions can directly lead to an increase in f concentration in shallow groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 furthermore evaporation indirectly accelerates the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals and f enrichment by promoting the precipitation of low soluble minerals e g calcite and dolomite and further lowers the ca2 content of groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in addition to inland plains and basins high f groundwater was also widely distributed in coastal areas in southern india southern california the northern coast of the mediterranean sea the east coast of south america southern africa and northern china chowdhury et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021 subba rao 2017 the high f groundwater in the coastal bedrock aquifer in southern india and in laizhou bay china was thought to be related to seawater intrusion which brought in large amounts of hco3 and na the competitive adsorption of hco3 promoted f enrichment and the increase in na contributed to the presence of aqueous fluoride mainly in the form of naf chen et al 2020b singaraja et al 2013 the southern part of the liaohe plain in china was also subject to seawater intrusion and the sediments contained large amounts of fluorinated minerals but no excess was detected in the groundwater within the area of seawater intrusion zuo et al 2019 high f groundwater in the coastal area might be related to the release of pore water from compacted clay layers due to ground subsidence li et al 2020 han et al 2021 and after the south to north water diversion project land subsidence has slowed down especially in the central area of land subsidence thereby restricting the release of fluoride rich pore water sun et al 2022 mcmahon et al 2020 found that water rock interaction and evaporation were the main pathways of groundwater f enrichment in the coastal plain of southern california rahman et al 2020 found that the fluoride exceedance rate was greater in the dry season than in the wet season but they did not elucidate the enrichment mechanism and the causes of seasonal differences about groundwater f therefore in coastal plains controlling factors of f enrichment in groundwater are controversial and the health hazards for humans from groundwater f are unclear the north china plain is the most extensive high f groundwater area that exists in china among which the coastal plain is the most affected area with groundwater f ion concentration as high as 9 2 mg l jia et al 2018 the scarcity of fresh groundwater in the coastal area and the excess f in groundwater make it more difficult to ensure the safety of drinking water han et al 2020 han and currell 2022 therefore the present study aims to investigate the spatial distribution of high f groundwater elucidate the factors driving f enrichment in shallow and deep groundwater and assess the health hazards of excessive f in drinking water 2 study area as one of the largest groundwater systems worldwide thickness of neogene and paleogene sediments of the north china plain ncp are 1 2 2 5 km and 5 7 km respectively ncp is located in a continental semiarid climate zone with a mean annual temperature ranging from 12 to 13 mean annual precipitation of 583 mm and mean annual evaporation of 1100 2000 mm where the rivers belong to the two basin systems of haihe river and luanhe river the terrain of ncp is flat and the altitude gradually declines from 100 m above mean sea level a m s l of the piedmont to 2 3 m a m s l on the coast from the western piedmont to the east coast the cenozoic strata range from fluvial deposits to alluvial and lacustrine deposits to alluvial deposits with interbedded marine deposits in the coastal plain according to the sedimentary and geographic characteristics the hydrogeological zones of ncp are divided into three parts piedmont alluvial proluvial clinoplain central alluvial lacustrine plain and coastal plain zhang et al 1997 chen et al 2005 cao et al 2013 the study area is the coastal plain of bohai rim and also is the coastal area of the north china plain this area is a regional groundwater discharge zone fig 1 which is underlain by thick 400 600 m alluvial deposits intercalated by marine sediments the quaternary aquifers the main source of groundwater supply are generally separated into four groups aquifer ⅰ holocene aquifer aquifer ⅱ upper pleistocene aquifer aquifer iii middle pleistocene aquifer and aquifer iv lower pleistocene aquifer respectively chen et al 2014 liu et al 2016 aquifer ⅰ consists of estuarine and deltaic facies aquifer ⅱ is predominantly composed of fluvial sediments interbedded with marine sediments aquifer iii is characterized by shallow lacustrine to diluvium aquifer iv is composed mostly of terrigenous deposits originated from river channel and floodplain cai et al 2014 the shallow groundwater mentioned in this study refers to the groundwater in aquifers ⅰ and ⅱ while the deep groundwater refers to the groundwater in aquifers iii and iv 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analysis this study collected 515 groundwater samples including 254 shallow ones and 261 deep ones from july to august of 2017 from agricultural irrigation and domestic wells the coastal plain of the bohai rim groundwater samples were obtained through pumping for 20 min to minimize the disturbance of stagnant water through an in line flow cell under minimal atmospheric contact the groundwater temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured by a multiparameter portable meter hi 9828 hanna groundwater alkalinity was determined by a model 16 900 digital titrator hach in the field with 0 22 μm membrane filters all samples were filtered with ultrapure 6 m hno3 groundwater samples for major cations were acidified to ph 2 0 samples for anion analysis were filtered and stored without being acidified all samples were stored at 4 during shipment and preservation through refrigeration in the laboratory before analysis in the key laboratory of groundwater science and engineering ministry of natural resources concentrations of major cations were determined by icp aes and the analytical precision was 3 0 by ion chromatography dx 120 dionex unacidified aliquots were used to determine major anions with the analytical precision less than 5 0 an ion selective electrode method was applied to determine dissolved fluoride with the analytical precision less than 5 0 about 97 of samples ion charge imbalance are less than 5 3 2 data processing the saturation index si of selected minerals fluorite calcite and dolomite as well as groundwater f and ca2 activities across the study area were computed by the phreeqc version 3 7 1 software to illustrate the influence of mineral dissolution and precipitation on f enrichment the si value can indicate the equilibrium state of minerals si 0 undersaturation si 0 equilibrium si 0 oversaturation piper diagram scatter diagrams and correlation analysis were introduced to illustrate the groundwater s general chemical characteristics and reveal the controlling mechanisms and factors of f enrichment in groundwater before conducting data processing the datasets were checked to determine whether they conform to a normal distribution relative importance can be given to the contribution made by each predictor to r square both alone and in combination with other predictors a new method called relative weights shows significant promise closely approximating the mean increase in r square that is obtained by adding a predictor variable across all possible sub models johnson and lebreton 2004 lebreton and tonidandel 2008 in this study the relweights function of r language was performed to evaluate the relative contributions of multiple controlling mechanisms and factors on f enrichment of groundwater 3 3 health risk assessment the health risk assessment hra model was developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2004 fluoride poses a non carcinogenic risk to humans with oral ingestion being the primary exposure pathway so this study selected oral ingestion data to make assessment on the potential health risk of groundwater f based on a non carcinogen risk assessment model nawale et al 2021 zango et al 2019 cdi c i r e f e d 365 e d b w hq cdi rfd where cdi refers to the daily intake doses of f through oral ingestion c refers to the analyzed concentration of groundwater f ir refers to the daily water consumption 0 65 1 5 2 66 and 3 62 l day for infants children adult females and males respectively zhang et al 2021a ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china 2013 ef and ed refer to the exposure frequency 365 days year and exposure duration 0 5 years for infants 6 years for children 24 years for adult females and males bw denotes the body average weight 6 94 25 9 64 and 73 kg for infants children adult females and males respectively xiao et al 2022 rfd indicates the reference dose of f in a specific exposure pathway 0 06 mg kg d the potential health risks to human health are unacceptable if the calculated hq value is greater than 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 general hydrochemistry and spatial distribution of groundwater f obvious differences in chemical characteristics were observed between shallow and deep groundwater samples across the study area fig 2 shallow groundwater ph ranged from 6 55 to 9 10 with a median of 7 33 the range of tds is 316 0 mg l to 145997 mg l implying a large variety in salinity about 96 5 of groundwater samples exceeded the safe limit for chinese drinking purposes of 1000 mg l gb5749 2022 in terms of tds shallow groundwater alkalinity ranged from 30 5 to 26670 mg l with a median of 1336 2 mg l na was the dominant cation and followed by mg ca2 k with medians of 1188 9 203 4 201 2 and 16 4 mg l respectively the dominant anion in shallow groundwater was cl followed by hco3 and so4 2 with medians of 1860 8 614 7 and 576 9 mg l respectively actually percentages of the sample exceeding the safe limit about na cl and so4 2 were 95 3 95 7 and 80 7 respectively deep groundwater was slightly alkaline with a ph median value of 8 31 groundwater tds ranged from 246 to 18002 mg l and 50 8 of samples exceeded the safe limit the major cation and anion of deep groundwater were na and hco3 with medians of 359 0 and 341 0 mg l respectively compared with shallow groundwater lower percentages of the sample exceeding the limit were observed in deep groundwater with 70 1 for na 48 0 for cl and 16 9 for so4 2 respectively the chemical types of shallow groundwater were dominated by cl na and mixed cl ca mg while the deep groundwater chemical types witnessed a big variation varying from fresh hco3 na type to mixed hco3 na ca to cl na fig 3 the median of shallow groundwater f concentrations was 0 50 mg l ranging from 0 10 to 4 50 mg l while the median of deep groundwater f concentrations was 2 60 mg l ranging from 0 10 to 7 08 mg l about 16 1 of shallow groundwater samples and 84 6 of deep ones were beyond the chinese drinking water limit the shallow high f groundwaters were sporadically distributed in the study area with a chemical type of cl na while the deep high f groundwaters were widely distributed along the coastal plain with chemical types of hco3 na and cl na figs 1 and 3 the result of generally higher f in deep groundwater compared to shallow groundwater is consistent with the finding of han and currell 2022 4 2 hydrogeochemical processes controlling f release 4 2 1 dissolution and precipitation as presented in fig 4 a the si fluorite was less than 0 and had an exponential relationship with f concentration which demonstrated that the dissolution of fluorite might be the main source of dissolved f the si fluorite of deep groundwater was slightly higher than that of shallow groundwater a negative correlation was observed between ca2 and f in deep groundwater r 0 19 p 0 01 which suggests that excess ca2 could potentially restrain the dissolution of fluorite furthermore the si calcite and si dolomite were more than 0 implying that the calcite and dolomite were in states of oversaturation the precipitation of both would consume dissolved ca2 fig 4c d which decreased the dissolved ca2 concentrations and promoted the dissolution of fluorite the dissolution of fluorite was a process of dynamic equilibrium and dissolved f concentrations were regulated by fluorite solubility in groundwater pkfluorite 10 6 when fluorite dissolved congruently the activities of f and ca2 usually fell on line 1 however in this study the activities of both ions in high f groundwater samples fell on the right side of line 1 and also below the line of pkfluorite suggesting that apart from fluorite dissolution there were other sources of ca2 such as calcite and dolomite dissolution fig 4b the activities of f and ca2 were expected to follow line 2 when calcite and fluorite coexisted in sediments and dissolved with a 200 1 ratio guo et al 2012 groundwater samples were located between line 1 and line 2 suggesting that the f concentration was controlled by dissolved ca2 derived from minerals such as fluorite and calcite avtar et al 2013 si calcite greater than 0 for most samples implied that the calcite was under oversaturation fig 4c which contributed to the decrease of dissolved ca2 concentration and further facilitated fluorite dissolution the activities of f and ca2 in shallow high f groundwaters mostly fell between lines 2 and 3 fig 4b indicating that the calcite precipitation contributed to dissovled f concentration in addition the activities of f and ca2 in deep high f groundwaters were mostly plotted between line 1 and line 3 fig 4b implying that in addition to mineral precipitation cation exchange also had a significant influence on f release 4 2 2 cation exchange cation exchange can increase na concentration and decrease ca2 concentration in groundwater which accelerates the dissolution of fluorite and other fluorine containing minerals and further regulates the f enrichment of groundwater in the aquifer liu et al 2015 wang et al 2021b two indicators cai 1 cl na k cl and cai 2 cl na k so4 2 hco3 no3 co3 2 generally reflected the possibility of cation exchange in groundwater as presented in fig 5 a the cai 1 and cai 2 of shallow groundwater were positive while the indices of most deep groundwater samples were negative suggesting that the cation exchange exhibited an important influence on regulating the groundwater chemical composition with this regulation the ca2 and mg2 in groundwater were depleted and further the dissolution of f containing minerals would be promoted the negative relationship between ca2 and f in deep groundwater supported the above assumption r 0 19 p 0 01 in addition concentrations of groundwater f had a positive relationship with na ca2 mg2 molar ratios in groundwater shallow groundwater r 0 38 p 0 01 deep groundwater r 0 48 p 0 01 fig 5b indicating the positive influence of cation exchange on groundwater f concentrations this observation is in accordance with the findings of field and laboratory studies currell et al 2011 su et al 2013 li et al 2019 suggesting that na rich and ca depleted groundwater favor f enrichment 4 2 3 desorption and competitive adsorption desorption of f in groundwater with high ph is an important mechanism of f release in the study area around 70 of high f groundwater samples ph values are greater than 8 0 fig 6 a generally higher than the point of zero charge of most natural minerals 7 to 8 and thus the exchangeable f would be released from negatively charged surfaces of sediments mcnab et al 2009 jeong et al 2013 in shallow groundwater 34 of the high f samples ph values are greater than 8 0 while in deep groundwater the value was as high as 76 indicating that ph was a key factor affecting f enrichment in deep groundwater moreover under high ph conditions the competitive adsorption between oh and f could promote f release from the solid surfaces due to their similar ionic radii sreedevi et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 in addition hco3 concentrations in deep groundwater with high amounts of dissolved f were generally high in our study area and the groundwater chemical type was mainly hco3 na type numerous studies have shown that high f is usually accompanied by high hco3 in groundwater pi et al 2015 wang et al 2021b mcmahon et al 2020 the significantly positive correlation between dissolved f and hco3 concentrations in deep groundwater r 0 51 p 0 01 suggested that the presence of hco3 favored f release fig 6b on the one hand high hco3 facilitated competitive adsorption between negatively charged hco3 and f which resulted in the release of the previously captured f on sediments into groundwater on the other hand the elevated hco3 tended to form low soluble minerals e g calcite and dolomite with ca2 thus reducing the concentration of dissolved ca2 and promoting the dissolution of fluorite rafique et al 2009 puccia et al 2018 wang et al 2021b however in shallow groundwater there was no good correlation between hco3 and f indicating that hco3 had little effect on the release of f 4 3 factors affecting f concentration of groundwater 4 3 1 evaporation as a common hydrological process in nature evaporation increases all ions concentrations in water by concentrating the gibbs diagram showed that the chemical composition of shallow groundwater was regulated by evaporation fig 7 a and b the buried depth of shallow groundwater in the variation of 2 10 m provided favorable conditions for evaporation chen et al 2005 cao et al 2013 li et al 2020 furthermore scatter diagram of f cl molar ratio versus f was performed to evaluate the relationship between groundwater f enrichment and evaporation fig 7c results showed that the ratios of f cl molar ratio in shallow high f groundwater were below the reference value 0 02 of undisturbed precipitation currell et al 2011 confirming the positive influence of evaporation on the enrichment of f some deep groundwater samples had similar chemical characteristics to shallow groundwater affected by evaporation which was mainly due to the downward recharge of shallow groundwater caused by the extraction of deep groundwater in ncp with the increasing f concentrations the ratios of f cl molar ratio of most deep groundwater samples showed an increasing trend indicating a geogenic enrichment which was confirmed by the hco3 na type of deep groundwater furthermore evaporation increased groundwater ph because of loss of co2 and to a certain degree elevated f concentration 4 3 2 seawater intrusion groundwater affected by seawater intrusion is always characterized by high ph tds and na ca2 molar ratio and some studies have concluded that high f groundwater is favorable in conditions with enriched na and hco3 and depleted ca2 ozsvath 2009 fuge 2019 thus seawater intrusion has recently been regarded as an important dynamic affecting groundwater f concentrations chen et al 2020a liu et al 2022 the aquifers in the study area might be affected by seawater intrusion due to their proximity to the bohai sea the key to studying the influence of seawater intrusion on groundwater f enrichment was to determine whether seawater intrusion occurred within the aquifers the major anion in seawater was cl while the major anions in freshwater in the coastal aquifers were hco3 and so4 2 the cl hco3 mass ratios in seawater and groundwater differed by several orders of magnitude and varying levels of seawater intrusion could be the cause of obvious changes in the ratios of groundwater some researchers classified the degree of seawater intrusion into three levels in the relationship diagram between cl hco3 mass ratios and cl concentrations park et al 2012 wang et al 2021a the results showed that 21 of the shallow groundwaters and 53 of the deep groundwaters were brackish while 75 of the shallow groundwaters and 2 of the deep groundwaters were saline fig 7d further cation exchange caused by seawater intrusion together with high ph resulted in the consumption of dissolved ca2 and facilitated f release which was supported by the findings in seawater intrusion area of gaomi city chen et al 2020a 2020b 4 4 relative contributions of controlling mechanisms and factors on f enrichment of groundwater dissolution and precipitation cation exchange as well as desorption and competitive adsorption were the main mechanisms resulting in the spatial variations in groundwater f concentrations which were also regulated by the evaporation and seawater intrusion however the relative contributions of these mechanisms and factors were unclear in this study si fluorite si calcite and si dolomite were proposed to refer to mineral dissolution and precipitation edmunds and smedley 2013 wang et al 2021b na ca2 mg2 molar ratio was proposed to refer to cation exchange li et al 2018 ph and hco3 were proposed to refer to desorption and competitive adsorption pi et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 in addition mass ratios of cl cl hco3 and cl hco3 were proposed to refer to the influences of evaporation and seawater intrusion respectively fuge 2019 mcmahon et al 2020 wang et a 2021a the relweights function was introduced to determine the relative contributions of the above processes results showed that the total contribution of si fluorite si calcite and si dolomite to dissolved f contents was 61 table 1 suggesting that the dissolution of fluorine containing minerals accompanied by the dissolution of calcite and dolomite was the most crucial control mechanism for the formation of high f groundwater this is consistent with the findings of hu et al 2022 and zhang et al 2021b cation exchange contributed 15 and had a more positive impact on f release in deep groundwater than that in shallow groundwater fig 5b the contribution of groundwater ph to f release was 11 although the contribution of hco3 to f release was only 5 in all groundwaters a significant positive correlation between hco3 and f in deep groundwater r 0 51 p 0 01 was observed indicating that the competitive adsorption of hco3 was a key hydrogeochemical process causing f release the contributions of evaporation and seawater intrusion to f enrichment in groundwater were 7 and 1 respectively therefore the dissolution of fluorine containing minerals accompanied by the precipitation of carbonate minerals was the dominant mechanism of groundwater f enrichment followed by cation exchange desorption evaporation and competitive adsorption the influence of seawater intrusion on groundwater f enrichment was ignored 4 5 health hazards of high f groundwater the hq index was used to assess the potential hazards of groundwater f to human health adimalla and qian 2019 results showed that the hq values exhibited obvious changes for infants children adult females and adult males fig 8 the hq values in the shallow groundwater for infants children adult females and adult males ranged between 0 23 and 10 1 median 1 12 0 14 6 25 median 0 69 0 11 4 86 median 0 54 and 0 13 5 61 median 0 62 respectively around 55 of groundwater samples exceeded the safety limit of 1 xiao et al 2022 and led to a health threat to infants followed by 27 to children 22 to adult males and 18 to adult females the hq values in the deep groundwater ranged between 0 23 and 15 90 median 5 84 for infants 0 14 9 83 median 3 79 for children 0 11 7 65 median 2 81 for adult females and 0 13 8 83 median 3 24 for adult males approximately 96 91 89 and 91 of samples threat infants children adult females and adult males health respectively the potential health threat of f in deep groundwater was higher than that in shallow groundwater for the four groups spatially the health hazards of f in shallow groundwater were sporadically distributed in the study area the high health hazards to infants were mainly distributed in the south near the yellow river while the high health hazards of f for children and adult females males were very limited fig 9 in contrast to shallow groundwater deep groundwater posed a more serious f hazard to human health the distribution of high health hazards to infants were primarily in the hai river and ziya river while the high health hazards to other populations were mainly concentrated in the hai river due to the high health hazards faced by the population from deep groundwater f near the hai river it is not proper to take deep groundwater as a priority resource for domestic usages in addition appropriate treatment targeting high f groundwater is required in high health hazard areas 5 conclusion this study was conducted to elucidate the spatial distribution dominant controlling mechanisms and factors and potential health hazards of groundwater f concentrations in the coastal plain of bohai rim the deep groundwater witnessed an extensive excess of fluoride with an excess rate of 84 6 and a median of 2 60 mg l high f groundwater samples were characterized by chemical types of hco3 na and cl na although the excess rate of f in shallow groundwater was 16 1 obviously lower than that of deep groundwater the excess of other components needed be concerned such as 95 7 for cl and 95 3 for na fluorite dissolution was the dominant source of groundwater f regulated by the precipitation of calcite and dolomite the dissolution and precipitation of fluorite calcite and dolomite contributed 61 to f enrichment in groundwater of the coastal plain differences in dissolution and precipitation of these three minerals in the aquifer were the primary cause of the differences in f concentrations between shallow and deep groundwater furthermore cation exchange desorption and evaporation facilitated f enrichment which contributes 15 11 and 7 respectively the weak alkaline environment of deep groundwater with high na ca2 mg2 molar ratios was conducive to the occurrence of cation exchange and desorption while the shallower groundwater table was conducive to the evaporation of shallow groundwater in particular the competitive adsorption hco3 prevailed in deep groundwater the results of hq indicated that around 55 of shallow groundwater samples brought potential health hazards to infants followed by 27 to children 22 to adult females and 18 to adult males and on a more serious note more than 85 of deep groundwater samples brought potential health hazards to the four groups

2506,shale gas and oil as unconventional clean energy sources has shown growing importance to addressing increasingly serious energy crisis the bottleneck limiting widespread shale development and utilization is the large amounts of water consumptions during well drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes however little attention has been paid to water use policies when multiple resources can be concurrently available moreover previous studies using mathematical models can only depend on clear understanding of stringent physical law implied mechanisms and quantitative data focusing on twelve shale regions in southwest china we construct the first knowledge graph kg in the world and then use a ripplenet algorithm rna to fulfill smart recommendation of water use policies base on the kg by comparing results under four scenarios we find that the identified policies vary with accessible cities and water resources depending on the priority experience i e historical records input to rna three mathematically based programming models are parallelly developed to generate optimal water use policies for comparing with those from smart recommendation similarities are found among the policies though discrepancies occur in part of scenarios despite the difficulty in evaluating the priority of each policy the most remarkable advantage in this smart recommendation lie in the 1 independence on quantitative data from monitoring or statistics and mechanism modeling and 2 capability of using a preference probability to suggest the likelihood or preference of each policy to be recommended outputs from this research provides new technical implication on developing conjunctive water use and energy extraction policies data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction global energy demand is rising while conventional energy sources are no longer sufficient triggering global energy crises guo et al 2018 shale gas and oil as unconventional clean energy sources have shown vital importance to addressing such a challenge wang et al 2020 hackley and cardott 2016 one bottleneck limiting widespread shale development is the large amounts of water consumption for well drilling and hydraulic fracturing even where multiple water resources can be conveniently available from surface river and reservoir subsurface aquifer and air rainwater it is still indispensable that highly efficient water use policies be offered this is important especially with the extension of shale extraction that causes intensified water consumption many studies have been undertaken to solve water issues associated with shale resources development chang et al 2019 bonetti et al 2021 kondash et al 2017 middleton et al 2015 llewellyn et al 2015 feng et al 2018 muehlenbachs et al 2015 wang et al 2020 sun et al 2017 middleton et al 2017 focusing on case studies mainly in the united states vengosh et al 2014 pointed out that over extraction of water resources for high volume hydraulic fracturing could induce water shortage or conflicted with other water users particularly in water scarce areas kondash et al 2018 found that the water consumption by shale exploitation increased up to 770 from 2011 to 2016 and the water use intensity also rose in all the u s shale basins except marcellus they suggested that the steady increase of water footprint would require larger volumes of water especially for hydraulic fracturing shi et al 2020 developed a model to estimate the water use at each stage of shale development process targeting at 334 shale wells in fuling the largest production field in china they estimated that the average fracturing water use per well was over thirty thousand m3 accounting for 98 of the total water use chen et al 2021 constructed a comprehensive modeling framework for investigating mixed noise driven shale gas water supply chains and further evaluated the water resources carrying capacity driven by shale development bonetti et al 2021 mentioned that the impact of unconventional oil and gas development on water quality was a major environmental concern leading to the necessity for comprehensive water management little attention has been paid to development of water use policies when multiple resources can be concurrently considered during shale development this issue can be addressed by mathematical modeling approaches such as programming model chen et al 2021 cheng et al 2016a b multicriteria analysis lu et al 2017 and scenario analysis resnouf et al 2017 willuweit and o sullivan 2013 hendrickson and bruguera 2018 one challenge facing mathematical modeling lies in its dependence on the understanding of water recycling mechanisms implied in the shale water nexus while there is lack of substantial domain knowledge however one would face the difficulty in constructing a reasonable modeling framework capable of representing those mechanisms another challenge is the potential application limitation due to data availability generally the data a modeler can rely on could be quantitative and qualitative quantitative data include those such as precipitation runoff and water availability which generally arise from site monitoring or modeling forecasting qualitative data includes prior experience or historical records e g regarding which type of water resource has historically been used by a shale developer or proposed by a decision maker this type of data information is frequently acquired through combined means of web search literature survey expert consultation and site investigation actually there has been increasing tendency and necessity of using such type of subjective non structured and fragmented qualitative data to perform decision making in recent years note that non structured data here refers to those non digitalized text audio video and picture files unfortunately neither mathematical modeling nor conventional artificial intelligence techniques e g machine learning and heuristic algorithms can simultaneously address the two challenges mewes et al 2020 giuliani et al 2019 shen 2018 yang et al 2017 nearing et al 2021 fu et al 2020 kouadri et al 2021 ebtehaj et al 2021 mosavi et al 2018 taormina and chau 2015 shamshirband et al 2019 knowledge graph kg as one of state of the art artificial intelligence techniques has demonstrated its performance in representing factors of concern named entities as well as their relations though a kg it is convenient to identify whether one entity is directly or indirectly via intermediate entities connected to another one hogan et al 2021 similarly it is potentially applicable in representing complex shale water nexus accommodating various entities such as water users water resources shale developers policy makers and even administrative sectors based on the kg a smart recommendation algorithm can further be introduced to 1 provide such information as which tail entities end points are connected or related to a selected head entity start point and 2 how much probability that the tail entities will be found and recommended ripplenet algorithm rna or multi rna mrna are such state of the art artificial intelligence techniques particularly developed for implementation of smart recommendation wang et al 2018 no report has been found on use of integrated kg and rna to solve energy water nexus problems therefore this study attempts to integrated them within a same methodological framework and apply it to fulfill smart recommendation of water use policies during shale development the principal superiority of the integrated approach to those conventional techniques lies in its independence on implied mechanisms and capability of accommodating qualitative data composed of prior experience specific tasks of this research entail 1 constructing the first shale water kg in terms of various investigation results 2 using rna to output recommended water policies and calculate the probability of each policy to be recommended 3 applying the approach to twelve shale development areas located in southwest china and 4 comparing the discrepancy in recommended policies with those by other feasible approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 background of the shale basins we selected twelve shale regions located in southwest china in the study because of the following considerations first southwest china has large requirement for water resources according to report by the chinese academy of engineering and the ministry of land and resources china s shale gas resources volumes are about 80 45 to 134 41 1012 m3 and the recoverable shale gas resources volumes are about 11 5 to 36 1 1012 m3 among the potentially exploitable regions the southwest china has the reserve of about 63 79 1012 m3 and recoverable volume of 10 42 1012 m3 occupying 47 46 and 28 86 of china respectively this means that a huge amount of water has been and will be consumed every year leading to the potentially serious water challenge facing the local government and energy sector second the twelve regions have been operated for over 10 years during which a substantial amount of qualitative and quantitative data have been gathered thus facilitating the application of the proposed methodology third demonstration through this region will benefit to generalizing the methodology to many other shale regions where water resources are in high demand and quantitative data may be inaccessible to acquire zhao and yang 2015 hao et al 2016 2 2 methods and data fig 1 shows the flowchart of research framework of this study which includes a smart recommendation model and three programming models for comparison the smart recommendation model integrates two construction of kgs and implementation of smart recommendation kg was initially proposed by google in 2012 hogan et al 2021 which has been increasingly prominent through commercial and research applications on the web nickel et al 2016 peer et al 2021 holzinger et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 a kg is firstly constructed to provide thorough information showing all the accessible water resources that would be recommended to shale development areas it is essentially defined as the knowledge base of the semantic network different from traditional simple graph only composed of nodes vertex and edges edge kg can be interpreted as a multi relational graph containing multiple types of nodes and edges for example fig a1 a in the appendix represents a simple graph where the nodes and edges represent water resources and their relations respectively for comparison fig a1 b in the appendix shows a multi relational knowledge graph where the nodes can be various types such as cities water users or shale developers and water resources the edges are also multiple which can be relations among different types of nodes in a kg nodes or factors of concern is frequently expressed as entity and edges as relation based on a generated kg a smart recommendation algorithm can be employed in the second step to find a feasible water use policy along the kg and meanwhile calculate the probability of the policy to be recommended 2 2 1 knowledge graph construction the procedures of kg construction include ontology modeling entity identification relation extraction and attribute extraction fig 2 to begin definition 1 is given for mathematically representing a kg knowledge graph g consists of massive entity relation entity triples h r t where h e r r and t e denote the head relation and tail of a knowledge triple respectively ε and r denote the set of entities and relations presented in the kg a diagram explaining these symbols can be seen in fig a1 in the appendix construction of a kg includes steps of ontology modeling knowledge acquisition knowledge extraction knowledge storage and knowledge application 1 ontology modeling ontology modeling can provide a large structured and standardized vocabulary for each field vocabularies are determined in the step aiming to share common understanding of acquired information including historical records domain knowledge etc noy and mcguinness 2001 on shale development and water management among related people and to enable reuse and analysis of this information when constructing a kg we need to use ontology modeling to limit the knowledge range ontology can be modeled by manual editing or automatically by data driven method it can also be revised and confirmed by using a combination of quality assessment methods and manual review currently wordnet hownet and cys are the most popular general ontology vocabularies fellbaum 2010 despite extensive published research on ontology modeling there has been no ontology vocabularies for shale water use recommendations therefore we manually construct a general ontology vocabulary to fill this information gap using the data through the following knowledge acquisition 2 knowledge acquisition knowledge acquisition needs to obtain data from original references the data are mainly from three types of sources the first type includes locations and other relevant information on reservoirs rivers shale regions and cities etc which can be acquired form google map the second is acquired from the national energy administration of china including information on shale development regions durations amounts water uses patterns etc the third is obtained from water resource bulletin and statistical yearbook 2010 2020 including data on quantity and quality of surface ground rain and reservoir waters 3 knowledge extraction knowledge extraction is conducted based on acquired knowledge to extract specified entities relations and attributes i entity identification can be conducted by rule or dictionary based methods as well as statistical machine learning algorithms rau et al 1991 habibi et al 2017 we select the rule based method for entity identification which includes two steps determining the scope of each entity based on the ontology modeling results at first and then extracting the corresponding entity from the collected information ii relation extraction can be conducted by artificial semantic rules and templates or joint reasoning domingos and daniel 2009 we use artificial semantic rules for relation extraction which includes two steps first define the relation between the ontologies second determine the relation between two entities according to the ontology vocabularies to which the two entities belong iii attribute extraction can be conducted using rules and heuristic algorithms rebele et al 2016 we select the rule based method for attribute extraction consisted of two steps formulating rules for attribute extraction of different entities at first and then extracting the attributes from the collected information based on the rules in summary knowledge extraction can be conducted using rule based and machine learning based methods the former requires professionals to write many templates and has high accuracy but poor portability the latter is portable while requires numerous training corpus and high data accuracy however aiming at recommending water use policies for a shale development area there is a problem that the text data characteristics are difficult to obtain thus the rule based method is used to manually knowledge extraction 4 knowledge storage knowledge storage needs to store knowledge as a fixed data model such as resource description framework rdf rdf schema rdfs and web ontology language owl bornea et al 2013 huang et al 2011 sakr and al naymat 2010 in addition it can also be stored by graph database like neo4j miller 2013 which can perfectly visualize the knowledge graph in this research we employ the neo4j graph database to store the generated kg 5 knowledge application the kg application includes knowledge question and answer q a and smart recommendation knowledge q a is an advanced form of information retrieval system which have been detailed in many reports such as apple s intelligent voice assistant siri vimalkumar et al 2021 intelligent recommendations can be performed using such algorithms as rna wang et al 2018 mrna wang et al 2021 cke shine dkn per libfm and wide deep zhang et al 2016a b wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b schaul et al 2015 cheng et al 2016a b details on the algorithms except rna can be seen from references as cited 2 2 2 smart recommendation algorithms rna a water use policy can be recommended via smart recommendation algorithms based on a constructed kg and collected knowledge pieces or historical records showing relations between water users and water resources rna is one of such algorithms that have been theoretically mature and increasingly applied to some real world problems yang and cheng 2021 wang et al 2022 detailed procedures needed by rna can be seen from fig a1 b and a3 in the appendix 1 prerequisite definitions definition 2 is given using an interaction matrix y to indicate the connections between users set u u 1 u 2 and items v v 1 v 2 possibly connected to u each of the matrix element is defined to be y uv u u v v where 1 y uv 1 i f i n t e r a c t i o n u v i s o b s e r v e d 0 o t h e r w i s e the interaction matrix is determined to be the seeds i e initial relations which will propagate through entity jumping or preference propagation along the kg to search a feasible water resource directly and indirectly connected to the start entity given interaction matrix y and knowledge graph g definition 3 is given using a triple e to indicate the k hop relevant entities for user u with its element e u k defined as 2 e u k t h r t g a n d h e u k 1 k 1 2 h where h and r represent head entity or start point and tail entity or end point in a kg respectively r represents the relation between h and r k hop relevant entities indicates that a searcher is allowed to jump for only k times from h to t note that 1 a jump only occurs between the two relevant entities and in the direction of the arrow as shown fig 1 b 2 if no relation exists between the two entities the jump is not allowed for 3 when k times of successful jumps are completed the search for a tail entity t terminates with the corresponding water use policy recommended 4 when k 0 e u 0 is defined to be v u v y uv 1 which is seen as the seed set of user u and indicates that only entities directly related to a certain concerned entity is marked definition 4 is given using a triple s named ripple set to indicate all the relevant entities starting from e u k 1 for user u this means that only ε u k 1 can be counted in the head entities by s the element of ripple set s is defined as 3 s u k h r t h r t g a n d h e u k 1 k 1 2 h in terms of definitions 1 to 3 the recommendation issue is mathematically transformed to the calculation of the probability of y uv 1 2 calculation of relevance given preference propagation given water user u s item matrix vu a 1 hop ripple set s u 1 and v a relevance between u and v pi can be calculated as 4 p i s o f t m a x v t r i h i e x p v t r i h i h r t s u 1 e x p v t r h where ri rd d and hi rd r is a general interaction matrix showing connection between r and h ri is the interaction matrix between r and hi d is the number of heads as shown in the kg t represents transpose pi measure the degree of intimate connections or relations between v and hi softmax is a normalization function to limit the calculated results to fall between 0 and 1 and guarantee the sum of all the results is equal to 1 3 response of the 1 jump preference propagation after obtaining the relevance probabilities and weighted sum of all tail entities ti vector o u 1 can be calculated by 5 o u 1 h i r i t i s u 1 p i t i where ti rd is the embedding of tail t i 4 response of the n jump preference propagation water user u s 2 jump response o u 2 can be obtained by repeating the procedure of preference propagation and by replacing v with o u 1 in equation 4 therefore for higher order corresponding o u 3 o u 4 o u h can also be observed the response of water user u with respect to water resource v can be calculated by combining the responses of all orders 6 u o u 1 o u 2 o u h 5 calculation of recommendation probability finally the predicted preference probability is calculated by combining the users and embeddings 7 y uv σ u t v where σ x 1 1 exp x is sigmoid function wang et al 2018 which is introduced here to calculate the preference probability of each water use policy to be recommended ranging from 0 and 1 some other alternatives such as tanh and relu rectified linear unit functions may also be adopted however they are not considered in this study because 1 their outputs range between 1 1 and 1 infinity respectively which need to be mathematically transformed into their equivalent ranges between 0 1 as measured by probability and 2 the sigmoid function has been applied to many data transformation studies such as neutral networks and rna and demonstrated to be convenient and effective in mathematical treatment von seggern 2007 6 estimation of hyperparameters hyperparameters here refer to those modeling parameters that should be identified as required by rna running it can be performed by maximizing the conditional probability p θ g y given the constructed kg g and identified interaction matrix y 8 max p θ g y where θ is a set of hyperparameters reflecting the features of all the entities and relations in the kg in terms of bayesian theorem p θ g y can also be written as 9 p θ g y p g y p θ p g θ p y θ g where p θ priority probability that θ values are determined can be assumed to have a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a diagonal covariance matrix this assumption is proposed based on the bayesian theorem and has been statistically demonstrated to be reasonable according to zhang et al 2016a b 10 p θ n 0 λ 1 1 i p g θ measures the likelihood of the observed g given θ in rna a three way tensor decomposition method is used to define the likelihood of a kg 11 p g θ h r t ε r ε p h r t θ h r t ε r ε n i h r t h t r t λ 2 1 where the indicator i h r t equals 1 if h r t g is 0 otherwise the p θ g y in equation 9 measures the likelihood of the observed interaction matrix y given θ and y which can be calculated by the product of the following bernoulli distributions 12 p y θ g u v y σ u t v y uv 1 σ u t v 1 y uv based on equations 2 7 for facilitating the optimization calculations the negative logarithm of equation 9 is generally taken leading to the following improved objective i e minimization of the loss function for rna 13 min l log p θ p g θ p y g θ u v y y uv l o g σ u t v 1 y uv l o g 1 σ u t v λ 2 2 r r i r e t r e 2 2 λ 1 2 v 2 2 e 2 2 r r r 2 2 where v and e are the matrices representing all the entities and relations respectively ir is the slice of the indicator tensor i in the kg for relation r and r is the matrix representing relation r in equation 13 the first item denotes minimization of the cross entropy loss l between the observed interactions y and predicted interactions y by rna the second one represents the squared error introduced by rna the third one is added as the regulation item for mitigating over fitting despite the loss of unbiasedness in part wang et al 2018 the objective l here aims to minimize the loss function for rna based on weighted maximum likelihood estimation a convectional objective can be based on square sum of the relative error however the objective of weighted maximum likelihood is employed because it has theoretically and practically demonstrated in not only maintaining asymptotic consistency of estimates and mitigating the overfitting issue 7 rna running rna is run in terms of the following three steps based on procedures 1 to 6 first preparing a dataset containing two parts one is the generated kg obtained through extensive knowledge acquisition and the other is a set of historical records aggregating all the collected knowledge pieces regarding which types of water resources have historically been used by a shale developer or proposed by a decision maker second select a set of hyperparameters that are desired to be estimated this can be performed in terms of equation 13 through conventional gradient algorithms or state of the art learning algorithms e g neural network the performance of the identified hyperparameters can be tested using some statistical indicators such as auc i e area under the curve huang and ling 2005 anon 2013 generally the higher auc values the better performance of the estimated hyperparameters and then the more reliable the recommended water use policies note that in addition to auc other feasible alternatives could be considered such as index of accuracy acc in this study we used auc because it has been demonstrated to be particularly appropriate for treatment of imbalanced datasets while acc is only suitable for dealing with balanced datasets where the classes are equally distributed moreover auc especially works effectively in ranking predictions whose outputs can suggest the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance is ranked higher than a negative one third calculate value of the sigmoid function in terms of equation 7 to perform recommendation of water use policies for a water user or shale developer and meanwhile output the probability that one water use policy is recommended based on the statistically acceptable hyperparameter values 3 results 3 1 results from kg fig 2 shows the results from ontology modeling which generates twelve ontologies table 1 nine relations table 2 and 200 entities twenty five reservoir water entities eight rainwater entities nine groundwater entities twenty three river water entities 135 other entities in this case a total of 12 considerations are taken including water resources city road etc table 1 these considerations are taken because they all have potential impacts on recommended water use policies first shale development cities and areas within them are modelled through ontology modeling second water resources are also incorporated as the supplier to water users four resources are considered for the supporting local shale extraction groundwater rainwater reservoirs and rivers third additional information is also added such as development time development volume water availability vehicles for water transportation and traffic roads mainly because they directly or indirectly determine the demand for water resources in the process of shale extraction through knowledge acquisition knowledge extraction and knowledge storage a kg is constructed showing all available shale development areas water resources as well as their relations and attributes fig 3 this is performed based on the neo4j graph database fig 4 presents detailed information of the thorough kg constructed in this study for better presentation it is separately exhibited through four inter connected sub figures focusing on a river water resources b ground water resources c reservoir water resources and d river water resources fig 4 a mainly shows the entities and relations table 2 associated with river water the entities include river water wujiang river in zhaotong jinsha river in yibin etc city yibin neijiang etc and shale development areas fuling shale development area including fuling 1 fuling 2 and fuling 3 luzhou shale development

area yibin shale development area etc water availability moderate rainfall area rich rainfall area etc and traffic roads entities pipeline 3 2 recommendation water use policies by rna for implementation of smart recommendations we need to depend on a substantial number of knowledge pieces showing historical water use records practically the more records the better in this study we use a total of 2050 records on local water resources use the number of records will keep increasing with the rise of surveyed literatures and experts as well as with the accumulation of shale running experience based on the records we begin to run rna to fulfill smart recommendation and output probabilities of recommended policies given four types of accessible water resources rainwater groundwater reservoir water and river water four scenarios are designed by assuming shale developers are accessible to 1 different water resources from different cities scenario 1 2 different water resources within the same city scenario 2 3 the same water resource in different cities scenario 3 and 4 the same water resource in the same city scenario 4 here the same water resource represents only one type of water resource is allowed to be used and different water resources represents multiple water resources can be concurrently accessible before running rna we identify 6 hyperparameters number of k hops h regular term coefficient λ 1 dimension of embedding d weight of kge term λ2 learning rate lr and size of ripple set n the former two are fixed to be 3 and 10 7 because previous studies have shown that these values help avoid overfitting wang et al 2018 the latter four because of potential impacts on outputs are assumed to vary from 2 to 64 0 to 1 0 to 1 and 2 to 16 respectively figs 5 8 show the water use policies recommended by rna under the four scenarios with the achieved optimal hyperparameters and auc values provided in the figure captions sensitivity analysis has also been performed assuming independent variations of the hyperparameters occur in their respective ranges figs a4 a7 this helps us enhance the learning efficiency in hyperparameter estimations by further constraining the hyperparameters within narrowed ranges results show that a water use policy recommended by rna may be different from historical records but embedded in one of potential connections or relations as indicated in the kg for example in fig 6 one historical record ever shows that fuling shale area has ever only used reservoir water in qingshuitang shaduzi and shuimotan and river water yangtze in chongqing rna simultaneously recommends two potential water resources hongqi reservoir water and jialing river water in chongqing their respective recommendation probabilities are also provided 0 9262 and 0 9151 these two water resources are strongly recommended main because historical records show that 1 hongqi reservoir has been one of the most important and reliable water resources supplied to the neighboring water users and 2 jialing river in chongqing could be a better water resource due to convenient water intake infrastructures compared to the historically used ones in fig 7 one historical record ever shows that zhaotong shale area has ever only used river water niulanjiang in zhaotong and qiandongnan has ever used river water qingshui jiang in qiandongnan and wuyanghe in qiandongnan in terms of rna hengjiang river water and groundwater in zhaotong are recommended their respective recommendation probabilities are close to 1 0 9999 and 0 9991 because the two resources have been concertedly relied on by water users in zhaotong only if the policy is allowed for it should be noted that rna allows for multiple policies to be simultaneously recommended with all the recommending probabilities lie between 0 and 1 as mentioned above for figs 6 and 7 this is similar to many other recommendation algorithms zhang et al 2016 huang et al 2018 grad gyenge et al 2015 sacenti et al 2021 sakurai et al 2022 chicaiza et al 2021 however the probability of a water use policy to be recommended by rna plus that not recommended is equal to 1 for example in scenario 4 fuling shale development area is recommended to use the water resource from bayi reservoir with the probability of 0 9305 this also implies that this policy may not be recommended with the no recommendation probability of 0 0695 i e 1 0 9305 by comparing the recommended policies under the four scenarios fig 9 we can find that the recommended water uses policies vary with accessible cities and available water resources this variation depends on the prior information i e historical records input to rna yet likely inconsistent with the historically used policies for instance in scenario 1 the river water from chongqing section in yangtze river is recommended however it is not covered in the historically used policies while in scenario 3 river water in the qujiang area located in chongqing is ever used previously but not suggested any more in the recommended policies moreover the recommended water supply policies would vary with given scenarios restricted by the natural or administrative conditions for example when multiple water resources are allowable we can find that reservoir riverine and ground waters are frequently be recommended but rainwater is little suggested this implies that rainwater despite a widely advocated source is not so attractive considering its cost matching infrastructures upper limit of availability etc if multiple cities are interconnected options to recommendation policies would be enriched results from comparison of the four scenarios reveal that fuling has been recommended for many times it is suggested for water supply not only within the city but also in support of its connected cities such as zhaotong luzhou and yibin in comparison nanzhou in qiandong and zigong have never been shown in the recommendation policies anyway it is much flexible and helpful that multiple water resources and multiple cities are interconnected and accommodated within the water energy synergic management framework 3 3 reliability analysis reliability analysis is conducted to examine and compare the performance of recommended water use policies in terms of achieved auc values from rna and the other alternatives mrna cke shine dkn per libfm and wide deep table a2 in the appendix shows comparison of the auc values achieved from eight smart recommendation algorithms under the four scenarios we can find that the auc values from rna and mrna are rather higher than those from the other algorithms this indicates that the policies recommended by rna and mrna are relatively more reliable than the other algorithms in this study the auc values from rna and mrna are somewhat close suggesting that mrna has no obvious improvement on the policies reliability compared to rna note that this comparison cannot be generalized such that the reliability analysis is still desired when tackling a new case 3 4 comparison of recommended water use policies among alternative algorithm models as only very limited information is aggregated for constructing the kg and recommending water use policies rna results are compared with an improved mrna wang et al 2020 which can also be used for identifying recommended water use policies with probability indicated though mrna has been demonstrated to have priority to those individual ones in theory small difference between them according to our modeling results fig 10 the exceptions are found in scenarios 1 which selects reservoir waters in the areas of hongqi reservoir while rna selects longqiao reservoir and 4 which selects reservoir waters in the areas of shaduzi reservoir while rna selects shaduzi reservoir and bayi reservoir despite the large similarity in the generated policies there is also slight difference in the probabilities assigned to each of the policies however this would affect the eventually recommended decision makings because the probability only indicates the recommendation preference but not real occurrence frequency the other comparison is to utilize conventional mathematically based programming models which are particularly developed for this study details on the three models are shown in a1 to a4 in the appendix figs 11 13 also present the optimal water uses policies obtained from the three models solved by lingo 11 0 it can be found that there is obvious difference among the results from rna and programming models this disagreement may be attributed to the information asymmetry for those programming models high uncertainty may widely exist because 1 some assumptions e g linear relations between gas production and water use have to be given for simplifying the computation 2 the model structure can hardly reflect the real world shale system with too many factors relations and restrictions neglected and 3 the input coefficients can hardly be accurate because they are usually estimated according to incomplete data information chen et al 2020a b he et al 2018 for this smart approach in contrast no assumptions are needed for developing a mathematical model based on some implying mechanisms and we rather depend on qualitative data from prior experience than quantitative data from monitoring or statistics however there is difficulty in making judgement on which of the approach generates the most appropriate policy because there is lack of appropriate 1 evaluation criteria established to assist in marking and ranking the model performance except auc and 2 mathematical tools developed to help do conduct the evaluation we can still find much similarity by comparing the results from rna with those from programming models for example in scenario 2 river water from chongqing section in yangtze river and groundwater in yangtze river basin are all recommended by rna and programming models this indirectly demonstrates that the smart recommendation policies can be confident to a high degree even without using mathematical models or quantitative data despite well demonstration of the feasibility through these comparisons more approaches still deserve in depth exploration for verifying the performance of smart recommendation from various perspectives we also use equation a2 in the appendix to calculate and compare the net profits revenues minus costs produced from rna mrna and three programming models table a1 in the appendix comparison results reveal that there is difference among the net profits obtained from algorithms models it is obvious that rna and mrna could be much more favorable by decision makers due to rather higher net profits this is in part due to consideration of less constraints such as greenhouse gas ghg emissions we thus examine whether emitted ghgs under the policies recommended by rna and mrna can satisfy the constraints as stated in the programming models results show that all the recommended policies can ensure satisfaction of ghgs constraints probably because of rather relaxed ghg constraints in this study notwithstanding it is desired that the current kg be improved on by introducing more entities and relations related to ghgs to support more reasonable smart recommendations other alternative models may include 1 nonlinear programming models to deal with possible nonlinear characteristics existing in the environmental and economic objective functions 2 inexact programming models tackling multiple uncertainties associated with part of parameters such as ultimate recovery of a shale production well and 3 risk based programming model capable of generating flexible decision alternatives chen et al 2021 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b we do not make comparison for these models because 1 their performance has been demonstrated in the previous studies 2 they cannot be run without a number of quantitative datasets and 3 similar comparison results can be referred to the findings shown in this section we have difficulty in comparing the superiority of water use policies produced by various approaches because little of them can always theoretically reasonable and practically favorable what we can compare is the superiority of the approaches in themselves as well as their application scope therefore we do not substantially analyze the comparison of results obtained from different approaches in general this comparison suggests that 1 integrated kg and rna can perform the same goal as that by mathematical modeling and conventional artificial intelligence techniques and 2 of more superiority its independence on physical mechanisms and capability of tackling qualitative data drives future widespread applications to the water related fields 3 5 discussion water price and transportation costs have been slightly changing in the past years in china the water price in china remained between 4 47 and 4 58 yuan m3 during 2015 2020 the transportation cost has been embedded in the water price he et al 2007 we therefore assume them to be constants during the planning period sensitivity analysis has suggested that slight variation in water price and transportation costs will not change the generated optimal water use policies except optimal net benefit this is mainly because of the model structure where the two factors are merely considered by the optimization objective but not cost constraints we also design four scenarios considering the available water supply approaches and potential water suppliers based on the site investigation results other feasible alternatives could be introduced for example water purchasing and water saving techniques could be considered in the scenario design however due to the lack of data availability on water purchasing and historical records on use of water saving techniques there is difficulty in using knowledge graph to address water use problems if there is further need we will take a longer period of time to gather sufficient historical records to build a new knowledge graph however the results may be improved if the models are extended to other countries for example in the u s water price and transportation costs are key factors affecting the decision making on water sources and even water use efficiency incremental effort is thus desired by the models for the smart recommendation models the data regarding economic considerations such as water treatment and water transportation as well as their associated costs need to be collected for updating the existing kg this likely leads to variations of current recommended water use policies due to appearance of new entities e g water transporter and new relations e g water resource is transported by a water transporter for the programming models a set of cost constraints can be introduced to ensure economic feasibility of generated water use policies one concern is with respect to the probability of each recommended water supply policy this probability can vary with the structure of the generated kg as well as the prior experience input to rna note that this probability does not mean how frequently that the policy will be implemented but how many times the policy would be suggested given a number of repeated recommendation experiments in terms of this probability one can gain insight into preference of a recommendation i e to what degree a recommended policy would be favored by decision makers or water users generally the higher the probability the more likely the policy will be suggested in each of recommending experiment for example in scenario 2 one policy recommending the use of shaduzi reservoir water has a high probability level of 0 7973 this indicates that there are about 80 chances of such a policy being suggested given 100 iterative experiments fulfilled this information is important and instructive particularly when no adequate quantitative information can be available for supporting accurate simulation optimization and assessment of the performance of policies all the water use policies are recommended based on qualitative data as detailed in the section introduction by comparison conventional mathematically models should follow a stringent physical law by comprehensively considering the process of water cycling including transport supply consumption and treatment this inevitably increases the difficulty in making instant decision particularly when facing the lack of data availability and professional knowledge or the challenge in performing large scale and time consuming computation through such smart recommendation water users and shale developers can conveniently figure out their water allocation policies for the next stage even they have not sufficient knowledge background or computation capability what they need to do is to collect as much information regarding historical water use records as possible it is general that the more information obtained the more thorough the constructed kg and then the more convincible the recommended policy probably lowering the failure risk due to inappropriate decision making in comparison qualitative i e non mathematical information as needed by kg is rather easily accessible than quantitative i e mathematical one because a wider range of approaches can be employed such as site investigation expert enquiry public survey literature review and knowledge learning if there is no historical record to be available for a new shale region the approach will still be applicable provided that historical records can be gathered through the following approaches the first and the most important one is from experts who use their professional knowledge and prior experience to recommend feasible water use policies the second is from monitoring records coming from practical shale production the third may come from theoretical policy sets generated through running decision making models under various pre determined scenarios the approaches have shown practically feasible in many of the commercial and research applications in construction and applications of kgs fan et al 2012 alani et al 2003 despite the lack of studies in water energy nexus studies two limitations drive future studies to be undertaken on the one hand evaluation of reasonability and suitability of each recommended policy is to be conducted this challenge can be addressed by 1 enriching the alternative base by adding more information 2 seeking quantitative approaches to assess performance of recommended policies 3 incorporating quantitative information such as water availability water transfer cost and climatic conditions within the kg and 4 designing new models e g policy optimization uncertainty analysis and policy simulation to provide more valuable decision making reference so as to enhance the suitability of smart recommendations on the other hand the kg is constructed based on limited information gathered through various approaches it will increasingly be improved and become complete as the deep going of information gathering however introduction of increased information will lead to enhanced complexity of the kg causing the difficulty in understanding a thorough map showing all the water resources allocation policies it is necessary that user friendly and operation conveniently human machine interface systems be developed to facilitate use of smart recommendation tools these limitations will be addressed in the following studies rather than in this study because of the lack of mature methodology and substantial data to support this research data collection is still in the early stage 4 conclusions a knowledge graph has been constructed for the first time to represent entities such as cities shale developers and water resources as well as their relations a set of intelligence recommendation algorithms such as rna is subsequently introduced to fulfill smart recommendation of water use policies during shale development this approach is only dependent of qualitative data from prior experience rather than quantitative data from monitoring or statistics and without the need of understanding the mechanisms implied in the decision making process moreover each of the recommended policy has been offered a preference probability indicating the degree to which such a policy is favored previously this approach has been applied to the region in southwest china covering twelve shale exploitation areas and recommended a set of water use policies under four scenarios to our knowledge this is the first attempt that one uses to solve water energy nexus problems outputs from this study will not only assist shale developers in making decisions regarding water uses but also provide new technical implication on developing conjunctive water use and energy extraction policies results show that 1 a water use policy recommended by rna may be different from historical records but embedded in one of potential connections or relations as indicated in the kg the rna simultaneously recommends two potential water resources hongqi reservoir water and jialing river water in chongqing with the recommendation probabilities being 0 9262 and 0 9151 respectively 2 the recommended water uses policies vary with accessible cities and available water resources depending on the prior information input to rna yet likely inconsistent with the historically used policies 3 the recommended polices are generally different among the rna and programming models arising from the information asymmetry however similar policies are recommended by both the models i e river water from chongqing section in yangtze river and groundwater in yangtze river basin are important water resources in scenario 2 credit authorship contribution statement l he

share data 1 introduction global energy demand is rising while conventional energy sources are no longer sufficient triggering global energy crises guo et al 2018 shale gas and oil as unconventional clean energy sources have shown vital importance to addressing such a challenge wang et al 2020 hackley and cardott 2016 one bottleneck limiting widespread shale development is the large amounts of water consumption for well drilling and hydraulic fracturing even where multiple water resources can be conveniently available from surface river and reservoir subsurface aquifer and air rainwater it is still indispensable that highly efficient water use policies be offered this is important especially with the extension of shale extraction that causes intensified water consumption many studies have been undertaken to solve water issues associated with shale resources development chang et al 2019 bonetti et al 2021 kondash et al 2017 middleton et al 2015 llewellyn et al 2015 feng et al 2018 muehlenbachs et al 2015 wang et al 2020 sun et al 2017 middleton et al 2017 focusing on case studies mainly in the united states vengosh et al 2014 pointed out that over extraction of water resources for high volume hydraulic fracturing could induce water shortage or conflicted with other water users particularly in water scarce areas kondash et al 2018 found that the water consumption by shale exploitation increased up to 770 from 2011 to 2016 and the water use intensity also rose in all the u s shale basins except marcellus they suggested that the steady increase of water footprint would require larger volumes of water especially for hydraulic fracturing shi et al 2020 developed a model to estimate the water use at each stage of shale development process targeting at 334 shale wells in fuling the largest production field in china they estimated that the average fracturing water use per well was over thirty thousand m3 accounting for 98 of the total water use chen et al 2021 constructed a comprehensive modeling framework for investigating mixed noise driven shale gas water supply chains and further evaluated the water resources carrying capacity driven by shale development bonetti et al 2021 mentioned that the impact of unconventional oil and gas development on water quality was a major environmental concern leading to the necessity for comprehensive water management little attention has been paid to development of water use policies when multiple resources can be concurrently considered during shale development this issue can be addressed by mathematical modeling approaches such as programming model chen et al 2021 cheng et al 2016a b multicriteria analysis lu et al 2017 and scenario analysis resnouf et al 2017 willuweit and o sullivan 2013 hendrickson and bruguera 2018 one challenge facing mathematical modeling lies in its dependence on the understanding of water recycling mechanisms implied in the shale water nexus while there is lack of substantial domain knowledge however one would face the difficulty in constructing a reasonable modeling framework capable of representing those mechanisms another challenge is the potential application limitation due to data availability generally the data a modeler can rely on could be quantitative and qualitative quantitative data include those such as precipitation runoff and water availability which generally arise from site monitoring or modeling forecasting qualitative data includes prior experience or historical records e g regarding which type of water resource has historically been used by a shale developer or proposed by a decision maker this type of data information is frequently acquired through combined means of web search literature survey expert consultation and site investigation actually there has been increasing tendency and necessity of using such type of subjective non structured and fragmented qualitative data to perform decision making in recent years note that non structured data here refers to those non digitalized text audio video and picture files unfortunately neither mathematical modeling nor conventional artificial intelligence techniques e g machine learning and heuristic algorithms can simultaneously address the two challenges mewes et al 2020 giuliani et al 2019 shen 2018 yang et al 2017 nearing et al 2021 fu et al 2020 kouadri et al 2021 ebtehaj et al 2021 mosavi et al 2018 taormina and chau 2015 shamshirband et al 2019 knowledge graph kg as one of state of the art artificial intelligence techniques has demonstrated its performance in representing factors of concern named entities as well as their relations though a kg it is convenient to identify whether one entity is directly or indirectly via intermediate entities connected to another one hogan et al 2021 similarly it is potentially applicable in representing complex shale water nexus accommodating various entities such as water users water resources shale developers policy makers and even administrative sectors based on the kg a smart recommendation algorithm can further be introduced to 1 provide such information as which tail entities end points are connected or related to a selected head entity start point and 2 how much probability that the tail entities will be found and recommended ripplenet algorithm rna or multi rna mrna are such state of the art artificial intelligence techniques particularly developed for implementation of smart recommendation wang et al 2018 no report has been found on use of integrated kg and rna to solve energy water nexus problems therefore this study attempts to integrated them within a same methodological framework and apply it to fulfill smart recommendation of water use policies during shale development the principal superiority of the integrated approach to those conventional techniques lies in its independence on implied mechanisms and capability of accommodating qualitative data composed of prior experience specific tasks of this research entail 1 constructing the first shale water kg in terms of various investigation results 2 using rna to output recommended water policies and calculate the probability of each policy to be recommended 3 applying the approach to twelve shale development areas located in southwest china and 4 comparing the discrepancy in recommended policies with those by other feasible approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 background of the shale basins we selected twelve shale regions located in southwest china in the study because of the following considerations first southwest china has large requirement for water resources according to report by the chinese academy of engineering and the ministry of land and resources china s shale gas resources volumes are about 80 45 to 134 41 1012 m3 and the recoverable shale gas resources volumes are about 11 5 to 36 1 1012 m3 among the potentially exploitable regions the southwest china has the reserve of about 63 79 1012 m3 and recoverable volume of 10 42 1012 m3 occupying 47 46 and 28 86 of china respectively this means that a huge amount of water has been and will be consumed every year leading to the potentially serious water challenge facing the local government and energy sector second the twelve regions have been operated for over 10 years during which a substantial amount of qualitative and quantitative data have been gathered thus facilitating the application of the proposed methodology third demonstration through this region will benefit to generalizing the methodology to many other shale regions where water resources are in high demand and quantitative data may be inaccessible to acquire zhao and yang 2015 hao et al 2016 2 2 methods and data fig 1 shows the flowchart of research framework of this study which includes a smart recommendation model and three programming models for comparison the smart recommendation model integrates two construction of kgs and implementation of smart recommendation kg was initially proposed by google in 2012 hogan et al 2021 which has been increasingly prominent through commercial and research applications on the web nickel et al 2016 peer et al 2021 holzinger et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 a kg is firstly constructed to provide thorough information showing all the accessible water resources that would be recommended to shale development areas it is essentially defined as the knowledge base of the semantic network different from traditional simple graph only composed of nodes vertex and edges edge kg can be interpreted as a multi relational graph containing multiple types of nodes and edges for example fig a1 a in the appendix represents a simple graph where the nodes and edges represent water resources and their relations respectively for comparison fig a1 b in the appendix shows a multi relational knowledge graph where the nodes can be various types such as cities water users or shale developers and water resources the edges are also multiple which can be relations among different types of nodes in a kg nodes or factors of concern is frequently expressed as entity and edges as relation based on a generated kg a smart recommendation algorithm can be employed in the second step to find a feasible water use policy along the kg and meanwhile calculate the probability of the policy to be recommended 2 2 1 knowledge graph construction the procedures of kg construction include ontology modeling entity identification relation extraction and attribute extraction fig 2 to begin definition 1 is given for mathematically representing a kg knowledge graph g consists of massive entity relation entity triples h r t where h e r r and t e denote the head relation and tail of a knowledge triple respectively ε and r denote the set of entities and relations presented in the kg a diagram explaining these symbols can be seen in fig a1 in the appendix construction of a kg includes steps of ontology modeling knowledge acquisition knowledge extraction knowledge storage and knowledge application 1 ontology modeling ontology modeling can provide a large structured and standardized vocabulary for each field vocabularies are determined in the step aiming to share common understanding of acquired information including historical records domain knowledge etc noy and mcguinness 2001 on shale development and water management among related people and to enable reuse and analysis of this information when constructing a kg we need to use ontology modeling to limit the knowledge range ontology can be modeled by manual editing or automatically by data driven method it can also be revised and confirmed by using a combination of quality assessment methods and manual review currently wordnet hownet and cys are the most popular general ontology vocabularies fellbaum 2010 despite extensive published research on ontology modeling there has been no ontology vocabularies for shale water use recommendations therefore we manually construct a general ontology vocabulary to fill this information gap using the data through the following knowledge acquisition 2 knowledge acquisition knowledge acquisition needs to obtain data from original references the data are mainly from three types of sources the first type includes locations and other relevant information on reservoirs rivers shale regions and cities etc which can be acquired form google map the second is acquired from the national energy administration of china including information on shale development regions durations amounts water uses patterns etc the third is obtained from water resource bulletin and statistical yearbook 2010 2020 including data on quantity and quality of surface ground rain and reservoir waters 3 knowledge extraction knowledge extraction is conducted based on acquired knowledge to extract specified entities relations and attributes i entity identification can be conducted by rule or dictionary based methods as well as statistical machine learning algorithms rau et al 1991 habibi et al 2017 we select the rule based method for entity identification which includes two steps determining the scope of each entity based on the ontology modeling results at first and then extracting the corresponding entity from the collected information ii relation extraction can be conducted by artificial semantic rules and templates or joint reasoning domingos and daniel 2009 we use artificial semantic rules for relation extraction which includes two steps first define the relation between the ontologies second determine the relation between two entities according to the ontology vocabularies to which the two entities belong iii attribute extraction can be conducted using rules and heuristic algorithms rebele et al 2016 we select the rule based method for attribute extraction consisted of two steps formulating rules for attribute extraction of different entities at first and then extracting the attributes from the collected information based on the rules in summary knowledge extraction can be conducted using rule based and machine learning based methods the former requires professionals to write many templates and has high accuracy but poor portability the latter is portable while requires numerous training corpus and high data accuracy however aiming at recommending water use policies for a shale development area there is a problem that the text data characteristics are difficult to obtain thus the rule based method is used to manually knowledge extraction 4 knowledge storage knowledge storage needs to store knowledge as a fixed data model such as resource description framework rdf rdf schema rdfs and web ontology language owl bornea et al 2013 huang et al 2011 sakr and al naymat 2010 in addition it can also be stored by graph database like neo4j miller 2013 which can perfectly visualize the knowledge graph in this research we employ the neo4j graph database to store the generated kg 5 knowledge application the kg application includes knowledge question and answer q a and smart recommendation knowledge q a is an advanced form of information retrieval system which have been detailed in many reports such as apple s intelligent voice assistant siri vimalkumar et al 2021 intelligent recommendations can be performed using such algorithms as rna wang et al 2018 mrna wang et al 2021 cke shine dkn per libfm and wide deep zhang et al 2016a b wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b schaul et al 2015 cheng et al 2016a b details on the algorithms except rna can be seen from references as cited 2 2 2 smart recommendation algorithms rna a water use policy can be recommended via smart recommendation algorithms based on a constructed kg and collected knowledge pieces or historical records showing relations between water users and water resources rna is one of such algorithms that have been theoretically mature and increasingly applied to some real world problems yang and cheng 2021 wang et al 2022 detailed procedures needed by rna can be seen from fig a1 b and a3 in the appendix 1 prerequisite definitions definition 2 is given using an interaction matrix y to indicate the connections between users set u u 1 u 2 and items v v 1 v 2 possibly connected to u each of the matrix element is defined to be y uv u u v v where 1 y uv 1 i f i n t e r a c t i o n u v i s o b s e r v e d 0 o t h e r w i s e the interaction matrix is determined to be the seeds i e initial relations which will propagate through entity jumping or preference propagation along the kg to search a feasible water resource directly and indirectly connected to the start entity given interaction matrix y and knowledge graph g definition 3 is given using a triple e to indicate the k hop relevant entities for user u with its element e u k defined as 2 e u k t h r t g a n d h e u k 1 k 1 2 h where h and r represent head entity or start point and tail entity or end point in a kg respectively r represents the relation between h and r k hop relevant entities indicates that a searcher is allowed to jump for only k times from h to t note that 1 a jump only occurs between the two relevant entities and in the direction of the arrow as shown fig 1 b 2 if no relation exists between the two entities the jump is not allowed for 3 when k times of successful jumps are completed the search for a tail entity t terminates with the corresponding water use policy recommended 4 when k 0 e u 0 is defined to be v u v y uv 1 which is seen as the seed set of user u and indicates that only entities directly related to a certain concerned entity is marked definition 4 is given using a triple s named ripple set to indicate all the relevant entities starting from e u k 1 for user u this means that only ε u k 1 can be counted in the head entities by s the element of ripple set s is defined as 3 s u k h r t h r t g a n d h e u k 1 k 1 2 h in terms of definitions 1 to 3 the recommendation issue is mathematically transformed to the calculation of the probability of y uv 1 2 calculation of relevance given preference propagation given water user u s item matrix vu a 1 hop ripple set s u 1 and v a relevance between u and v pi can be calculated as 4 p i s o f t m a x v t r i h i e x p v t r i h i h r t s u 1 e x p v t r h where ri rd d and hi rd r is a general interaction matrix showing connection between r and h ri is the interaction matrix between r and hi d is the number of heads as shown in the kg t represents transpose pi measure the degree of intimate connections or relations between v and hi softmax is a normalization function to limit the calculated results to fall between 0 and 1 and guarantee the sum of all the results is equal to 1 3 response of the 1 jump preference propagation after obtaining the relevance probabilities and weighted sum of all tail entities ti vector o u 1 can be calculated by 5 o u 1 h i r i t i s u 1 p i t i where ti rd is the embedding of tail t i 4 response of the n jump preference propagation water user u s 2 jump response o u 2 can be obtained by repeating the procedure of preference propagation and by replacing v with o u 1 in equation 4 therefore for higher order corresponding o u 3 o u 4 o u h can also be observed the response of water user u with respect to water resource v can be calculated by combining the responses of all orders 6 u o u 1 o u 2 o u h 5 calculation of recommendation probability finally the predicted preference probability is calculated by combining the users and embeddings 7 y uv σ u t v where σ x 1 1 exp x is sigmoid function wang et al 2018 which is introduced here to calculate the preference probability of each water use policy to be recommended ranging from 0 and 1 some other alternatives such as tanh and relu rectified linear unit functions may also be adopted however they are not considered in this study because 1 their outputs range between 1 1 and 1 infinity respectively which need to be mathematically transformed into their equivalent ranges between 0 1 as measured by probability and 2 the sigmoid function has been applied to many data transformation studies such as neutral networks and rna and demonstrated to be convenient and effective in mathematical treatment von seggern 2007 6 estimation of hyperparameters hyperparameters here refer to those modeling parameters that should be identified as required by rna running it can be performed by maximizing the conditional probability p θ g y given the constructed kg g and identified interaction matrix y 8 max p θ g y where θ is a set of hyperparameters reflecting the features of all the entities and relations in the kg in terms of bayesian theorem p θ g y can also be written as 9 p θ g y p g y p θ p g θ p y θ g where p θ priority probability that θ values are determined can be assumed to have a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a diagonal covariance matrix this assumption is proposed based on the bayesian theorem and has been statistically demonstrated to be reasonable according to zhang et al 2016a b 10 p θ n 0 λ 1 1 i p g θ measures the likelihood of the observed g given θ in rna a three way tensor decomposition method is used to define the likelihood of a kg 11 p g θ h r t ε r ε p h r t θ h r t ε r ε n i h r t h t r t λ 2 1 where the indicator i h r t equals 1 if h r t g is 0 otherwise the p θ g y in equation 9 measures the likelihood of the observed interaction matrix y given θ and y which can be calculated by the product of the following bernoulli distributions 12 p y θ g u v y σ u t v y uv 1 σ u t v 1 y uv based on equations 2 7 for facilitating the optimization calculations the negative logarithm of equation 9 is generally taken leading to the following improved objective i e minimization of the loss function for rna 13 min l log p θ p g θ p y g θ u v y y uv l o g σ u t v 1 y uv l o g 1 σ u t v λ 2 2 r r i r e t r e 2 2 λ 1 2 v 2 2 e 2 2 r r r 2 2 where v and e are the matrices representing all the entities and relations respectively ir is the slice of the indicator tensor i in the kg for relation r and r is the matrix representing relation r in equation 13 the first item denotes minimization of the cross entropy loss l between the observed interactions y and predicted interactions y by rna the second one represents the squared error introduced by rna the third one is added as the regulation item for mitigating over fitting despite the loss of unbiasedness in part wang et al 2018 the objective l here aims to minimize the loss function for rna based on weighted maximum likelihood estimation a convectional objective can be based on square sum of the relative error however the objective of weighted maximum likelihood is employed because it has theoretically and practically demonstrated in not only maintaining asymptotic consistency of estimates and mitigating the overfitting issue 7 rna running rna is run in terms of the following three steps based on procedures 1 to 6 first preparing a dataset containing two parts one is the generated kg obtained through extensive knowledge acquisition and the other is a set of historical records aggregating all the collected knowledge pieces regarding which types of water resources have historically been used by a shale developer or proposed by a decision maker second select a set of hyperparameters that are desired to be estimated this can be performed in terms of equation 13 through conventional gradient algorithms or state of the art learning algorithms e g neural network the performance of the identified hyperparameters can be tested using some statistical indicators such as auc i e area under the curve huang and ling 2005 anon 2013 generally the higher auc values the better performance of the estimated hyperparameters and then the more reliable the recommended water use policies note that in addition to auc other feasible alternatives could be considered such as index of accuracy acc in this study we used auc because it has been demonstrated to be particularly appropriate for treatment of imbalanced datasets while acc is only suitable for dealing with balanced datasets where the classes are equally distributed moreover auc especially works effectively in ranking predictions whose outputs can suggest the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance is ranked higher than a negative one third calculate value of the sigmoid function in terms of equation 7 to perform recommendation of water use policies for a water user or shale developer and meanwhile output the probability that one water use policy is recommended based on the statistically acceptable hyperparameter values 3 results 3 1 results from kg fig 2 shows the results from ontology modeling which generates twelve ontologies table 1 nine relations table 2 and 200 entities twenty five reservoir water entities eight rainwater entities nine groundwater entities twenty three river water entities 135 other entities in this case a total of 12 considerations are taken including water resources city road etc table 1 these considerations are taken because they all have potential impacts on recommended water use policies first shale development cities and areas within them are modelled through ontology modeling second water resources are also incorporated as the supplier to water users four resources are considered for the supporting local shale extraction groundwater rainwater reservoirs and rivers third additional information is also added such as development time development volume water availability vehicles for water transportation and traffic roads mainly because they directly or indirectly determine the demand for water resources in the process of shale extraction through knowledge acquisition knowledge extraction and knowledge storage a kg is constructed showing all available shale development areas water resources as well as their relations and attributes fig 3 this is performed based on the neo4j graph database fig 4 presents detailed information of the thorough kg constructed in this study for better presentation it is separately exhibited through four inter connected sub figures focusing on a river water resources b

implementation of smart recommendations we need to depend on a substantial number of knowledge pieces showing historical water use records practically the more records the better in this study we use a total of 2050 records on local water resources use the number of records will keep increasing with the rise of surveyed literatures and experts as well as with the accumulation of shale running experience based on the records we begin to run rna to fulfill smart recommendation and output probabilities of recommended policies given four types of accessible water resources rainwater groundwater reservoir water and river water four scenarios are designed by assuming shale developers are accessible to 1 different water resources from different cities scenario 1 2 different water resources within the same city scenario 2 3 the same water resource in different cities scenario 3 and 4 the same water resource in the same city scenario 4 here the same water resource represents only one type of water resource is allowed to be used and different water resources represents multiple water resources can be concurrently accessible before running rna we identify 6 hyperparameters number of k hops h regular term coefficient λ 1 dimension of embedding d weight of kge term λ2 learning rate lr and size of ripple set n the former two are fixed to be 3 and 10 7 because previous studies have shown that these values help avoid overfitting wang et al 2018 the latter four because of potential impacts on outputs are assumed to vary from 2 to 64 0 to 1 0 to 1 and 2 to 16 respectively figs 5 8 show the water use policies recommended by rna under the four scenarios with the achieved optimal hyperparameters and auc values provided in the figure captions sensitivity analysis has also been performed assuming independent variations of the hyperparameters occur in their respective ranges figs a4 a7 this helps us enhance the learning efficiency in hyperparameter estimations by further constraining the hyperparameters within narrowed ranges results show that a water use policy recommended by rna may be different from historical records but embedded in one of potential connections or relations as indicated in the kg for example in fig 6 one historical record ever shows that fuling shale area has ever only used reservoir water in qingshuitang shaduzi and shuimotan and river water yangtze in chongqing rna simultaneously recommends two potential water resources hongqi reservoir water and jialing river water in chongqing their respective recommendation probabilities are also provided 0 9262 and 0 9151 these two water resources are strongly recommended main because historical records show that 1 hongqi reservoir has been one of the most important and reliable water resources supplied to the neighboring water users and 2 jialing river in chongqing could be a better water resource due to convenient water intake infrastructures compared to the historically used ones in fig 7 one historical record ever shows that zhaotong shale area has ever only used river water niulanjiang in zhaotong and qiandongnan has ever used river water qingshui jiang in qiandongnan and wuyanghe in qiandongnan in terms of rna hengjiang river water and groundwater in zhaotong are recommended their respective recommendation probabilities are close to 1 0 9999 and 0 9991 because the two resources have been concertedly relied on by water users in zhaotong only if the policy is allowed for it should be noted that rna allows for multiple policies to be simultaneously recommended with all the recommending probabilities lie between 0 and 1 as mentioned above for figs 6 and 7 this is similar to many other recommendation algorithms zhang et al 2016 huang et al 2018 grad gyenge et al 2015 sacenti et al 2021 sakurai et al 2022 chicaiza et al 2021 however the probability of a water use policy to be recommended by rna plus that not recommended is equal to 1 for example in scenario 4 fuling shale development area is recommended to use the water resource from bayi reservoir with the probability of 0 9305 this also implies that this policy may not be recommended with the no recommendation probability of 0 0695 i e 1 0 9305 by comparing the recommended policies under the four scenarios fig 9 we can find that the recommended water uses policies vary with accessible cities and available water resources this variation depends on the prior information i e historical records input to rna yet likely inconsistent with the historically used policies for instance in scenario 1 the river water from chongqing section in yangtze river is recommended however it is not covered in the historically used policies while in scenario 3 river water in the qujiang area located in chongqing is ever used previously but not suggested any more in the recommended policies moreover the recommended water supply policies would vary with given scenarios restricted by the natural or administrative conditions for example when multiple water resources are allowable we can find that reservoir riverine and ground waters are frequently be recommended but rainwater is little suggested this implies that rainwater despite a widely advocated source is not so attractive considering its cost matching infrastructures upper limit of availability etc if multiple cities are interconnected options to recommendation policies would be enriched results from comparison of the four scenarios reveal that fuling has been recommended for many times it is suggested for water supply not only within the city but also in support of its connected cities such as zhaotong luzhou and yibin in comparison nanzhou in qiandong and zigong have never been shown in the recommendation policies anyway it is much flexible and helpful that multiple water resources and multiple cities are interconnected and accommodated within the water energy synergic management framework 3 3 reliability analysis reliability analysis is conducted to examine and compare the performance of recommended water use policies in terms of achieved auc values from rna and the other alternatives mrna cke shine dkn per libfm and wide deep table a2 in the appendix shows comparison of the auc values achieved from eight smart recommendation algorithms under the four scenarios we can find that the auc values from rna and mrna are rather higher than those from the other algorithms this indicates that the policies recommended by rna and mrna are relatively more reliable than the other algorithms in this study the auc values from rna and mrna are somewhat close suggesting that mrna has no obvious improvement on the policies reliability compared to rna note that this comparison cannot be generalized such that the reliability analysis is still desired when tackling a new case 3 4 comparison of recommended water use policies among alternative algorithm models as only very limited information is aggregated for constructing the kg and recommending water use policies rna results are compared with an improved mrna wang et al 2020 which can also be used for identifying recommended water use policies with probability indicated though mrna has been demonstrated to have priority to those individual ones in theory small difference between them according to our modeling results fig 10 the exceptions are found in scenarios 1 which selects reservoir waters in the areas of hongqi reservoir while rna selects longqiao reservoir and 4 which selects reservoir waters in the areas of shaduzi reservoir while rna selects shaduzi reservoir and bayi reservoir despite the large similarity in the generated policies there is also slight difference in the probabilities assigned to each of the policies however this would affect the eventually recommended decision makings because the probability only indicates the recommendation preference but not real occurrence frequency the other comparison is to utilize conventional mathematically based programming models which are particularly developed for this study details on the three models are shown in a1 to a4 in the appendix figs 11 13 also present the optimal water uses policies obtained from the three models solved by lingo 11 0 it can be found that there is obvious difference among the results from rna and programming models this disagreement may be attributed to the information asymmetry for those programming models high uncertainty may widely exist because 1 some assumptions e g linear relations between gas production and water use have to be given for simplifying the computation 2 the model structure can hardly reflect the real world shale system with too many factors relations and restrictions neglected and 3 the input coefficients can hardly be accurate because they are usually estimated according to incomplete data information chen et al 2020a b he et al 2018 for this smart approach in contrast no assumptions are needed for developing a mathematical model based on some implying mechanisms and we rather depend on qualitative data from prior experience than quantitative data from monitoring or statistics however there is difficulty in making judgement on which of the approach generates the most appropriate policy because there is lack of appropriate 1 evaluation criteria established to assist in marking and ranking the model performance except auc and 2 mathematical tools developed to help do conduct the evaluation we can still find much similarity by comparing the results from rna with those from programming models for example in scenario 2 river water from chongqing section in yangtze river and groundwater in yangtze river basin are all recommended by rna and programming models this indirectly demonstrates that the smart recommendation policies can be confident to a high degree even without using mathematical models or quantitative data despite well demonstration of the feasibility through these comparisons more approaches still deserve in depth exploration for verifying the performance of smart recommendation from various perspectives we also use equation a2 in the appendix to calculate and compare the net profits revenues minus costs produced from rna mrna and three programming models table a1 in the appendix comparison results reveal that there is difference among the net profits obtained from algorithms models it is obvious that rna and mrna could be much more favorable by decision makers due to rather higher net profits this is in part due to consideration of less constraints such as greenhouse gas ghg emissions we thus examine whether emitted ghgs under the policies recommended by rna and mrna can satisfy the constraints as stated in the programming models results show that all the recommended policies can ensure satisfaction of ghgs constraints probably because of rather relaxed ghg constraints in this study notwithstanding it is desired that the current kg be improved on by introducing more entities and relations related to ghgs to support more reasonable smart recommendations other alternative models may include 1 nonlinear programming models to deal with possible nonlinear characteristics existing in the environmental and economic objective functions 2 inexact programming models tackling multiple uncertainties associated with part of parameters such as ultimate recovery of a shale production well and 3 risk based programming model capable of generating flexible decision alternatives chen et al 2021 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b we do not make comparison for these models because 1 their performance has been demonstrated in the previous studies 2 they cannot be run without a number of quantitative datasets and 3 similar comparison results can be referred to the findings shown in this section we have difficulty in comparing the superiority of water use policies produced by various approaches because little of them can always theoretically reasonable and practically favorable what we can compare is the superiority of the approaches in themselves as well as their application scope therefore we do not substantially analyze the comparison of results obtained from different approaches in general this comparison suggests that 1 integrated kg and rna can perform the same goal as that by mathematical modeling and conventional artificial intelligence techniques and 2 of more superiority its independence on physical mechanisms and capability of tackling qualitative data drives future widespread applications to the water related fields 3 5 discussion water price and transportation costs have been slightly changing in the past years in china the water price in china remained between 4 47 and 4 58 yuan m3 during 2015 2020 the transportation cost has been embedded in the water price he et al 2007 we therefore assume them to be constants during the planning period sensitivity analysis has suggested that slight variation in water price and transportation costs will not change the generated optimal water use policies except optimal net benefit this is mainly because of the model structure where the two factors are merely considered by the optimization objective but not cost constraints we also design four scenarios considering the available water supply approaches and potential water suppliers based on the site investigation results other feasible alternatives could be introduced for example water purchasing and water saving techniques could be considered in the scenario design however due to the lack of data availability on water purchasing and historical records on use of water saving techniques there is difficulty in using knowledge graph to address water use problems if there is further need we will take a longer period of time to gather sufficient historical records to build a new knowledge graph however the results may be improved if the models are extended to other countries for example in the u s water price and transportation costs are key factors affecting the decision making on water sources and even water use efficiency incremental effort is thus desired by the models for the smart recommendation models the data regarding economic considerations such as water treatment and water transportation as well as their associated costs need to be collected for updating the existing kg this likely leads to variations of current recommended water use policies due to appearance of new entities e g water transporter and new relations e g water resource is transported by a water transporter for the programming models a set of cost constraints can be introduced to ensure economic feasibility of generated water use policies one concern is with respect to the probability of each recommended water supply policy this probability can vary with the structure of the generated kg as well as the prior experience input to rna note that this probability does not mean how frequently that the policy will be implemented but how many times the policy would be suggested given a number of repeated recommendation experiments in terms of this probability one can gain insight into preference of a recommendation i e to what degree a recommended policy would be favored by decision makers or water users generally the higher the probability the more likely the policy will be suggested in each of recommending experiment for example in scenario 2 one policy recommending the use of shaduzi reservoir water has a high probability level of 0 7973 this indicates that there are about 80 chances of such a policy being suggested given 100 iterative experiments fulfilled this information is important and instructive particularly when no adequate quantitative information can be available for supporting accurate simulation optimization and assessment of the performance of policies all the water use policies are recommended based on qualitative data as detailed in the section introduction by comparison conventional mathematically models should follow a stringent physical law by comprehensively considering the process of water cycling including transport supply consumption and treatment this inevitably increases the difficulty in making instant decision particularly when facing the lack of data availability and professional knowledge or the challenge in performing large scale and time consuming computation through such smart recommendation water users and shale developers can conveniently figure out their water allocation policies for the next stage even they have not sufficient knowledge background or computation capability what they need to do is to collect as much information regarding historical water use records as possible it is general that the more information obtained the more thorough the constructed kg and then the more convincible the recommended policy probably lowering the failure risk due to inappropriate decision making in comparison qualitative i e non mathematical information as needed by kg is rather easily accessible than quantitative i e mathematical one because a wider range of approaches can be employed such as site investigation expert enquiry public survey literature review and knowledge learning if there is no historical record to be available for a new shale region the approach will still be applicable provided that historical records can be gathered through the following approaches the first and the most important one is from experts who use their professional knowledge and prior experience to recommend feasible water use policies the second is from monitoring records coming from practical shale production the third may come from theoretical policy sets generated through running decision making models under various pre determined scenarios the approaches have shown practically feasible in many of the commercial and research applications in construction and applications of kgs fan et al 2012 alani et al 2003 despite the lack of studies in water energy nexus studies two limitations drive future studies to be undertaken on the one hand evaluation of reasonability and suitability of each recommended policy is to be conducted this challenge can be addressed by 1 enriching the alternative base by adding more information 2 seeking quantitative approaches to assess performance of recommended policies 3 incorporating quantitative information such as water availability water transfer cost and climatic conditions within the kg and 4 designing new models e g policy optimization uncertainty analysis and policy simulation to provide more valuable decision making reference so as to enhance the suitability of smart recommendations on the other hand the kg is constructed based on limited information gathered through various approaches it will increasingly be improved and become complete as the deep going of information gathering however introduction of increased information will lead to enhanced complexity of the kg causing the difficulty in understanding a thorough map showing all the water resources allocation policies it is necessary that user friendly and operation conveniently human machine interface systems be developed to facilitate use of smart recommendation tools these limitations will be addressed in the following studies rather than in this study because of the lack of mature methodology and substantial data to support this research data collection is still in the early stage 4 conclusions a knowledge graph has been constructed for the first time to represent entities such as cities shale developers and water resources as well as their relations a set of intelligence recommendation algorithms such as rna is subsequently introduced to fulfill smart recommendation of water use policies during shale development this approach is only dependent of qualitative data from prior experience rather than quantitative data from monitoring or statistics and without the need of understanding the mechanisms implied in the decision making process moreover each of the recommended policy has been offered a preference probability indicating the degree to which such a policy is favored previously this approach has been applied to the region in southwest china covering twelve shale exploitation areas and recommended a set of water use policies under four scenarios to our knowledge this is the first attempt that one uses to solve water energy nexus problems outputs from this study will not only assist shale developers in making decisions regarding water uses but also provide new technical implication on developing conjunctive water use and energy extraction policies results show that 1 a water use policy recommended by rna may be different from historical records but embedded in one of potential connections or relations as indicated in the kg the rna simultaneously recommends two potential water resources hongqi reservoir water and jialing river water in chongqing with the recommendation probabilities being 0 9262 and 0 9151 respectively 2 the recommended water uses policies vary with accessible cities and available water resources depending on the prior information input to rna yet likely inconsistent with the historically used policies 3 the recommended polices are generally different among the rna and programming models arising from the information asymmetry however similar policies are recommended by both the models i e river water from chongqing section in yangtze river and groundwater in yangtze river basin are important water resources in scenario 2 credit authorship contribution statement l he

has shown growing importance to addressing increasingly serious energy crisis the bottleneck limiting widespread shale development and utilization is the large amounts of water consumptions during well drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes however little attention has been paid to water use policies when multiple resources can be concurrently available moreover previous studies using mathematical models can only depend on clear understanding of stringent physical law implied mechanisms and quantitative data focusing on twelve shale regions in southwest china we construct the first knowledge graph kg in the world and then use a ripplenet algorithm rna to fulfill smart recommendation of water use policies base on the kg by comparing results under four scenarios we find that the identified policies vary with accessible cities and water resources depending on the priority experience i e historical records input to rna three mathematically based programming models are parallelly developed to generate optimal water use policies for comparing with those from smart recommendation similarities are found among the policies though discrepancies occur in part of scenarios despite the difficulty in evaluating the priority of each policy the most remarkable advantage in this smart recommendation lie in the 1 independence on quantitative data from monitoring or statistics and mechanism modeling and 2 capability of using a preference probability to suggest the likelihood or preference of each policy to be recommended outputs from this research provides new technical implication on developing conjunctive water use and energy extraction policies 
2507,the accurate quantification of lake volume is essential for regional water resources management and ecosystem health because of the high cost of traditional full lake depth measurements the bathymetric and volume information for most lakes globally is inaccessible whether the limited field measurements over the lake can be used to estimate lake volume is worth investigating this study aims to propose an effective method for estimating lake mean depth volume based on the lake deepest record we first constructed the empirical model that relies on the linear relationship between lake maximum depth and lake mean depth volume the different machine learning ml methods were then developed and tested based on the available lake deepest record and multi type geospatial parameters although the linear model shows good performance for estimating lake mean depth r2 0 83 it is difficult to predict lake volume r2 0 23 most ml models perform better r2 0 85 than linear models however the support vector machines svm model svm 3 r2 0 54 mape 134 93 and deep neural network dnn model dnn 3 r2 0 83 mape 82 56 constructed with low influential input parameters performed poorly in contrast extremely gradient boosting tree xgboost and random forest rf methods have high stability and accuracy both in predicting lake mean depth xgboost 1 r2 0 87 mape 23 35 rf 1 r2 0 90 mape 22 75 and volume xgboost 3 r2 0 99 mape 31 03 rf 3 r2 0 98 mape 32 63 the rf and xgboost models constructed with a small amount of measured lake depth data in a different region also had a good performance generally the results suggest that the xgboost and rf methods have great potential in lake volume estimation this research is expected to provide a feasible approach to predict lake volume and benefit

acknowledgements section 1 introduction water is an essential resource for all species including humans and is a crucial component of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles lehner and döll 2004 palmer et al 2015 lake comprises one of the largest components of earth s surface liquid freshwater it plays a critical role in supporting agricultural and residential water use and ecosystem services downing et al 2006 pekel et al 2016 verpoorter et al 2014 woolway et al 2020 since the beginning of the 21st century many lakes worldwide have experienced obvious changes due to the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities which pose a significant threat to human water use and the eco environment alsdorf et al 2007 jain et al 2012 lei et al 2019 luo et al 2022 maberly et al 2020 pekel et al 2016 pickens et al 2020 qiao and li 2022 sheng et al 2016 song et al 2013 tao et al 2020 woolway et al 2020 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2007 yi et al 2016 zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore accurately estimating the water mass stored in lakes is crucial for more efficient management of water resources the wide application of remote sensing methods has greatly enhanced the research on the water volume change of global lakes busker et al 2019 cooley et al 2021 crétaux and birkett 2006 crétaux et al 2016 crétaux et al 2011 luo et al 2022 pekel et al 2016 however most previous studies focus on monitoring lake volume changes in response to basin wide hydrologic imbalances in addition a comprehensive knowledge of the reserves of lake water mass is still an unmet challenge as most satellite remote sensing techniques cannot provide direct observations on the lake underwater parts biancamaria et al 2016 crétaux et al 2016 the lack of global bathymetric maps and water depth records for most lakes is a major obstacle to calculating water volume conventionally field measurement using the onboard sonar is a currently conventional method for generating the lake bathymetric map bandini et al 2018 coggins and ghadouani 2019 whereas such a labor intensive and time consuming strategy is difficult to be applied to a regional scale to overcome the disadvantage of the traditional survey some researchers attempted to derive the bathymetric map using remote sensing technologies yang et al 2022 bathymetric lidar devices are currently employed in shallow lakes and favorable water quality conditions kasvi et al 2019 however the maximum penetration depth of airborne lidar is usually less than twice the depth measured by secchi restricting its use in inland lakes with large water depth and high turbidity bandini et al 2018 a few studies have employed optical imagery and satellite altimetry to estimate lake depth from space ma et al 2020 ma et al 2019 pereira et al 2019 such satellite based bathymetry is effective in intermittently flooded areas yet it is still difficult to obtain bathymetric information in permanently inundated water areas for most natural lakes the underwater topography can be considered an extension of the lake shoreline surroundings therefore the exposed terrains around lakes are usually utilized to predict lake bathymetry the spatial prediction methods were proposed to estimate water storages for individual or regional global lakes cael et al 2017 heathcote et al 2015 hollister et al 2011b messager et al 2016 sobek et al 2011 the links between topographic parameters and lake depth volume have been explored thoroughly promoting the development of a geo statistical model for estimating lake depth and volume cael et al 2017 messager et al 2016 due to the offset impact of underestimates and overestimates for different lakes it is generally applicable to estimate the net water volume of lakes on a large scale however the topographic characteristics around lakes were formed by different geological and geomorphologic processes therefore the uncertainties and potential biases of volume estimation should be considered for specific lakes or local scales a few prior studies indicated that a small number of measured lake depths could be essential for improving the extrapolation accuracy of volume estimation models for regional lakes getirana et al 2018 liu and song 2022 therefore an effective lake volume estimation method should be determined under the feasible circumstance of obtaining limited in situ measurements furthermore compared with the high cost of field measurements in full lake coverage measuring only the zone with potential maximum water depths may greatly save labor and economic cost particularly for remote and inaccessible areas dost and mannaerts 2008 hollister et al 2011a liu et al 2022 muñoz et al 2020 shiklomanov and rodda 2004 wessels et al 2015 therefore this study aims to develop an effective method for predicting lake mean depth and volume based only on the deepest water depth record instead of the full lake depth measurements in this study a large number of lakes with bathymetry records in different sizes climates and topographic features in the conterminous united states conus were chosen to construct the estimation model and assess the model performance analyses and discussions on the accuracy of mean depth and volume estimation influences of input variables and training datasets and the application potential of models in other regions were presented subsequently 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the conus is located in central north america including 48 states and the district of columbia fig 1 various landform types such as plains mountains hills deserts lakes and swamps are all distributed in the vast area and the terrain is high in the west and low in the east the eastern and western parts of the conus are roughly demarcated by the eastern foothills of the rocky mountains with great differences in climate and natural conditions baldwin 1973 kittel et al 2002 the climate of conus can be divided into two distinct regions based on the natural distribution of precipitation bounded by 95 w finkelstein and truppi 1991 karl and knight 1998 the 17 western states are arid and semi arid with annual precipitation of less than 500 mm and relatively scarce water resources the western hinterland area is only about 250 mm and the lower catchment of the colorado river is less than 90 mm vano et al 2012 the eastern states are humid and semi humid regions with annual precipitation of 800 to 1000 mm the conus owns approximately 3 5 million water bodies larger than 0 001 km2 mcdonald et al 2012 the great lakes which have a total area of about 245 000 km2 and are well known as the largest freshwater lake group in the world larson and schaetzl 2001 are mostly located in the conus four large lakes are split by the international boundary with canada given that lakes in the conus are distributed from plain to plateau and encompass a wide range of geological types the conus lake group was chosen as the study area in order to prove that the method proposed in this study has the potential to be applied in other regions with different climatic and geological types we also selected the eastern finland as the extension experiment 2 2 lake depth dataset all the lake dataset was collected from a data module named lagos us locus it is one of the key modules of the lagos us platform https lagoslakes org lagos us overview which provides an extendable research ready platform for studying the 479 950 lakes and reservoirs water area 0 01 km2 in the conus cheruvelil et al 2021 these lagos us core modules were created using datasets from various sources such as national scale climate land use cover hydrology data and government tribal and community science lake data further documentation of the data modules used is included in the lagos us locus user guide and the lagos us gis toolbox cheruvelil et al 2021 there are currently four lagos us extension modules including the lagos us depth module either published or in development that will connect to lagos us locus through common lake identifiers the lagos us depth v1 0 module combines in situ measurements of lake depth for 17 675 lakes from 65 different sources fig 1 cheruvelil et al 2021 stachelek et al 2021 there are 17 675 lakes in the depth module with the maximum depth records among which 6 137 lakes have the mean depth records the 6 137 lakes with both maximum and mean depths were chosen as the input dataset for training and validating the lake volume estimation model the dataset includes lakes in different elevations sizes geomorphic characteristics and geometric shapes fig 1 table 1 the bathymetric data for lakes in eastern finland was collected from finnish environment institute

connectivity in this study the key geometric variables include lake area perimeter shoreline development factor maximum length and width of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon fig 2 the shoreline development factor was calculated from the lake water area and perimeter cheruvelil et al 2021 it is a measure of the deviation of lake shape from 1 a perfect circle the maximum length of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon is the maximum possible distance between any two vertices of the smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon note the line connecting these vertices is located within the lake polygon the maximum width of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon is defined along an axis perpendicular to the axis defined by the convex hull length convex hulls were generated with the minimum bounding geometry tool in arcgis the several variables were produced with the calculate geometry tools in arcgis using the albers usgs conical area projection 2 4 digital elevation model dem data for lake topographic characteristics in february 2000 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm used space borne radar observations to acquire terrain elevations at 1 srtm 1 dem and 3 resolution srtm 3 dem in this study the topographic characteristics variables including mean elevation and mean slope within the buffer around the lake were performed on the elevation data provided by srtm 1 dem 3 methodology the main workflow of the study is composed of four parts fig 4 the first part in light cyan involves filtering the initial data and calculating the topographic parameters around the lakes based on dem the second part in brown involves selecting input variables and exploring the effect of different variable combinations on the performances of machine learning ml methods in the third part in light yellow we construct and optimize different ml models based on the training datasets and input variables in addition we also construct the linear statistical model between the lake maximum depth and mean depth or volume for a comparison with the results derived from the ml methods the final part in light blue involves the comparison of different ml model performances and selecting the optimal model further information on the four parts is introduced below 3 1 data filtering and preprocessing high quality sample data is the guarantee of ml model accuracy to ensure data quality we checked and filtered the initial data it is difficult and inaccurate to predict lake depth and volume for a very large lake water area 500 km2 messager et al 2016 compared with the hundreds of millions of small lakes downing et al 2006 verpoorter et al 2014 the number of lakes larger than 500 km2 is rather small furthermore bathymetric measurements of these large lakes are usually well established because of their importance to regional ecosystem health and industrial production herdendorf 1982 thus we focused on precisely predicting water depth for lakes less than 500 km2 therefore four lakes larger than 500 km2 were excluded from the study including salt lakes that are large but shallow in addition to reduce the influences of sample outliers on the model accuracy we also excluded a lake lake chelan that was far deeper mean depth 144 48 m than other lakes in comparable size the geophysical processes that shape a lake basin are the same as those that shape the topography directly surrounding the lake it is reasonable to assume that the elevation difference and slope around the lake are probably related to the lake depths thus the lake topographic characteristics are critical to predicting lake mean depth and volume however the sediment deposition of lakes brings large uncertainty to lake bathymetry estimation zhu et al 2019 therefore field investigation of the lake bottom s water depth is crucial to constraining topographic extrapolation or prediction for this purpose the maximum depth as a key variable was added to the prediction parameters in this study which can effectively reduce the uncertainty caused by the changes in the lake underwater topography due to historical sediment deposition we calculated the minimum surface elevation within the lake as lake surface elevation the mean elevation and slope within the buffer zone width 100 m around the lake based on the lake distribution data and srtm 1 dem data in order to avoid errors caused by the dem data noise the 5 quantile elevation value within the lake polygon was taken as the minimum elevation of the lake surface elevation difference refers to the difference between mean elevation within the buffer zone and lake surface elevation the lakes in this study total n 6132 cover a wide range in area depth and volume fig 3 table 1 the proportion of small lakes is larger 25 75 interquartile range for area 0 09 0 91 km2 mean depth 2 00 5 09 m volume 0 22 3 70 106 m3 as shown in fig 3b the mean depth of lakes in different sizes increases significantly indicating that lake area is one of the key factors determining lake depth 3 2 input variables selection and combination in this study the input variables are divided into 3 types fig 4 the first type is lake bathymetric information maximum depth the second type is the topographic variables around the lake the mean elevation and slope around the lake and the elevation difference the third type is lake shape and geometric variables lake area lake perimeter shoreline development factor maximum length and width of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake in order to analyze the influence of the selection of the variables on the performances of ml in predicting lake mean depth and volume we tested different combinations of the input variables several variables with great influence on model results were selected through feature selection method r package we judge the importance of these variables to the predicted results based on their scores f value the maximum depth is the most important as its f value is much higher than other variables therefore this also indirectly illustrates the feasibility of predicting the mean depth and volume through maximum depth mean slope elevation difference and lake area are also key variables for predicting lake mean depth and volume from the perspective of f values although other factors can be important in different geological situations adding them to the set of predictors yields only a few improvements at the price of greatly increasing model complexity therefore we eventually tested two scenarios of variable combination in the model construction 1 all variables mentioned above were used for predicting all parameters hereinafter and 2 the variable subset including the maximum depth mean slope elevation difference and lake area part parameters 3 3 linear statistical model linear regression is an empirical model widely applied in modeling lake hydrological variables across scales therefore we constructed the linear statistical relationship between the lake maximum depth and mean depth volume for a comparison with the results derived from the ml methods in order to compare with the ml methods we adopt the same segmentation ratio 9 1 of the training dataset and test dataset because the construction of linear model cannot carry out 500 random experiments like the ml methods the selection of training dataset is not randomly generated to avoid the poor accuracy of linear model caused by training dataset we arranged the sample dataset according to the mean depth and repeated coding in the order of 0 9 all the data encoded as 5 were used as the test dataset and the rest as the training dataset the combination method can use the data with the maximum value range as the training dataset which helps enhance the applicability of the model 3 4 different machine learning methods ml methods can effectively explore potential nonlinear relationships between data and have wide application prospects in earth science and remote sensing science lary et al 2016 in this paper four widely used ml methods are selected to construct estimation models for lake mean depth and volume including random forest rf avanzi et al 2019 breiman 2001 extreme gradient boosting tree xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 support vector machines svm hearst et al 1998 platt 1998 smola and schölkopf 2004 and deep neural network dnn lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 the key features of four ml methods are introduced below firstly the training and test dataset are randomly generated from sample data in a certain split ratio which was 9 1 in this study the results did not change significantly in other proportions e g 8 2 and 7 3 benefiting from the availability of a large sample dataset 6132 lakes in this study then the construction of the ml models was optimized using the training dataset the optimization process of the internal model structure was gradually adjusted depending on the loss function yousefi and toffolon 2022 finally the ml performances were examined using the test dataset to ensure that the internal model structure was not an overfitting or underfitting result and could be applied in other cases for data driven ml methods the quality quantity and scope of training data will greatly affect the estimation accuracy of the models chen et al 2019 although the optimization of hyperparameters could influence the accuracy of the model this research aims to construct an optimal model for predicting lake mean depth and volume therefore we did not optimize and adjust the hyperparameters considering the time cost instead the experiment was repeated 500 times changing the training and test dataset constantly and the model with the best validation results the overfitting results were eliminated was chosen 3 4 1 random forest rf rf is an integrated learning method whose basic unit is a decision tree during the training process a large number of independent decision trees are constructed to form a random forest finally the results of these decision trees are integrated to improve the model accuracy such as the output average value the randomness of rf method is mainly reflected in two aspects firstly the bagging method is used to randomly generate training data subsets from the original training dataset during the construction of each decision tree secondly instead of using all the feature variables to participate in the comparison during node splitting a subset is randomly selected from the characteristic variables to participate in node splitting rf method is not easy to overfit and has good tolerance to outliers and noise thanks to the two randomness liaw and wiener 2002 svetnik et al 2003 3 4 2 extreme gradient boosting tree xgboost xgboost is an implementation of the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt by friedman 2001 different from the rf method in which each tree is independent the decision trees in the xgboost method depend on each other and are generated serially xgboost presents a new loss function with regularization which can efficiently use sparse data without overfitting compared with traditional gbdt ding et al 2020 feature segmentation is achieved by continuously creating decision trees in the method in which each decision tree has many leaf nodes matching scores finally the estimation result is the sum of the scores assigned to the leaf nodes of each tree 3 4 3 support vector machines svm svm are supervised learning models with appropriate learning methods used to analyze classification and regression analysis data hearst et al 1998 platt 1998 smola and schölkopf 2004 in addition to linear classification svm can efficiently conduct a nonlinear classification using the kernel trick svm has great advantages in dealing with nonlinear problems and small dataset problems however it is sensitive to data noise and inefficient for large datasets 3 4 4 deep neural network dnn dnn method is a kind of artificial neural network ann with multiple hidden layers i e deep networks between the input layer and the output layer lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 compared with the traditional shallow neural network the deep network of dnn method provides a higher level of nonlinear function approximation and can combine low level features to improve the estimation ability of the model 3 5 model performance evaluation metrics the performances of different models were evaluated based on the test dataset by four statistical metrics the coefficient of determination or r squared r2 mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse specifically these metrics are calculated as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 mape 100 n i 1 n x i y i y i 3 mae i 1 n x i y i n 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where n is the number of test dataset i is the number index x i is the estimated value and y i is the measured value 4 results and analyses 4 1 estimation based on the linear statistical model as shown in fig 5 there is a strong correlation between maximum depth and mean depth r2 0 83 overall the model performed well mae 0 90 m rmse 1 65 m although there was a large difference between estimated and measured values for some deep lakes however the correlation between maximum depth and volume is poor without a robust linear relationship and the accuracy evaluation in the test dataset also shows great errors the linear model is directly constructed based on the relationship between maximum depth and lake volume without considering the topographic and geographic variables e g the lake area mean slope mean elevation etc related to the lake bathymetry although it can simulate the mean depth the conversion of lake area between lake volume and maximum depth was ignored therefore it is difficult to predict the actual water volume of the lake the limitations of the current linear model are mainly the lack of topographic information and lake size classification the complexity of the linear models would be increased with topographic information in addition the advantage of ml methods is to combine different variables and find the optimal model structure quickly and efficiently therefore there was no need to build a complex linear model combining topographic information instead we only consider the possible effects on the linear model derived from lake area classification according to previous studies messager et al 2016 the linear models for different lake area sizes were constructed and compared respectively fig 6 though the accuracy metrics cannot be completely used as a reference standard due to differing sample value ranges lake area and volume the increase in r2 compared with 0 29 fig 5c could illustrate the improved accuracy gained based on lake area size classification in addition the scattered points are clustered near the 1 1 line compared with the previous linear model fig 5c and fig 6 however the improvements of linear models based on lake area size classification are trivial compared with the correlation between maximum depth and mean depth the linear relationship between lake maximum depth and volume could not achieve satisfactory performance therefore it is not advisable to use linear statistical models to predict lake volume directly 4 2 comparison on the estimations from different machine learning models as described in section 3 4 the optimal models based on different ml algorithms were selected for comparison based on model performance metrics after 500 times of random sampling and model construction respectively models for predicting lake mean depth based on different ml methods with all parameters and part parameters were named ml 1 and ml 2 e g xgboost 1 and xgboost 2 similarly the models for predicting lake volume based on different ml methods with all parameters and part parameters were named ml 3 and ml 4 e g xgboost 3 and xgboost 4 except for svm 1 and dnn 1 other mean depth estimation models perform better than the linear statistical model fig 7 table 2 comparing the four ml methods rf 1 and xgboost 1 perform best rf 1 r2 0 90 mae 0 75 m mape 22 75 rmse 1 13 m xgboost 1 r2 0 87 mae 0 77 m mape 23 35 rmse 1 16 m there are obvious differences in the modeling performance as these four ml models have different principles the accuracy of svm models in two scenarios of variable combination all parameters and part parameters was significantly different svm 1 r2 0 54 mae 1 44 m mape 49 25 rmse 2 05 m svm 2 r2 0 85 mae 0 78 m mape 25 50 rmse 1 15 m it suggests that the svm method is highly sensitive to the key input variables this may be because the svm method relies on a small number of support vectors and the model accuracy will deteriorate when samples with random errors are selected as support vectors moreover svm belongs to the classification algorithm which is essentially developed from the linear classification algorithm therefore the svm method is good at classification but not for regression issues in this study in contrast xgboost and rf can identify elements with random errors and ignore them in model construction brazdil and konolige 2012 moreover the xgboost algorithm has a built in cross validation method at each iteration preventing the model from overfitting chen and guestrin 2016 therefore the more input variables of xgboost and rf the better the model performance based on the validation results of different ml models for predicting lake volume fig 8 table 3 rf xgboost and dnn models have achieved satisfactory performances similar to the validation and comparison results of mean depth prediction models rf method and xgboost method perform best xgboost 3 r2 0 99 mae 1 92 106 m3 mape 31 03 rmse 7 94 106 m3 rf 4 r2 0 94 mae 1 83 106 m3 mape 29 24 rmse 9 70 106 m3 when the input parameters with low influence are reduced the svm and dnn methods dnn 2 and svm 2 were obviously improved the value of lake volume is larger relative to mean depth so the model complexity is improved the dnn algorithm usually requires more training data massive labeled samples for model simulation than the other traditional ml algorithms the data used in this study may not have reached this level in addition xgboost and rf methods adopt a similar strategy it supports sampling of samples and features which can effectively control the model complexity and improve the model generalization ability brazdil and konolige 2012 thus the accuracy of dnn models is not better than the rf and xgboost models more importantly the xgboost model uses parallelized implementation to build the process of the sequential trees which can substantially improve the algorithm efficiency overall the xgboost and rf methods have great application potential in lake volume modeling and prediction 4 3 evaluation of the machine learning methods applied to other areas although our ml models effectively estimated lake mean depth and volume in the conus caution should be exercised when applying the method to other areas the models trained in section 4 2 could not be applied in other regions due to the differences in sample value ranges lake depth or volume instead we have revealed that the topographic and geometric characteristics e g the elevation drop of shoreline buffer zone lake size may fundamentally correlate with lake depth and volume and recommend these parameters for developing similar ml models one of the limitations of ml models is that their performance is limited by the representativeness of the training dataset this shows that the model trained based on a local dataset may not be accurate enough when applied to other regions therefore we collected 568 lakes with bathymetric data in eastern finland for training and validation of the local lake volume estimation model these lakes in this region have different sizes fig 9 which are suitable for model construction however due to the small number of sample dataset the segmentation ratio of training dataset and test dataset is set to 7 3 in this section in addition the topographic parameters for finnish lakes were calculated based on the reflectance radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem due to the limited spatial coverage of srtm 1 dem section 4 2 has proved that rf and xgboost models perform well in estimating lake mean depth and volume and the sensitivity influenced by training datasets and input variables is low therefore the rf and xgboost are used to construct estimation models for mean depth and volume respectively these models for lakes located in eastern finland performed better on the test dataset than that of xgboost 1 and rf 1 models described in section 4 2 possibly due to some samples with high water depth and volume included in the xgboost 1 and rf 1 model increasing the mae and rmse fig 10 table 2 and table 3 the constructed model in eastern finland had a good performance indicating that the ml methods were also effective for the different study areas with a small amount of measured lake depth data 5 discussions 5 1 the effect of buffer width and the sensitivity comparison of different machine learning models affected by input variables combination and training dataset as introduced in the method section the input variables are divided into 3 types fig 4 lake bathymetric information topographic variables around the lake and lake shape and geometric variables given that the buffer distance determines the width of the exposed terrains around a lake used for spatial extrapolation we generated lake topographic parameters with different buffer widths to assess the influence of buffer width on the lake mean depth prediction because small lakes would be related to a narrower band of surrounding topography than large lakes heathcote et al 2015 the buffer width is divided into two categories static buffer and dynamic buffer the static buffer size ranges from 50 m to 500 m the dynamic buffer is related to the radius of a circle with an area equal to each lake hereinafter referred to as the equivalent circle radius cr the dynamic buffer size ranges from 25 cr to 100 cr the results showed that the accuracy of the models with different buffer widths is similar fig 11 in comparison the model performance is slightly better when the buffer width is 100 m thus the results in this study were all generated using static parameters with a buffer size of 100 m according to the analysis in section 4 2 fig 7 fig 8 table 2 and table 3 dnn and svm methods are highly sensitive to key input variables in fact for data driven ml methods the quality quantity and scope of training dataset will also greatly affect the estimation accuracy of the method chen et al 2019 thus the sensitivity of models to the training dataset should be determined to examine its universality in our study the experiment was repeated 500 times based on the training datasets that were separated randomly therefore the uncertainties of different models constructed for lake mean depth caused by different training datasets can be explored fig 12 according to the accuracy comparison of 500 experiments lake mean depth on different models dnn method and svm method are highly sensitive to the training dataset especially dnn 1 0 05 r2 0 91 0 88 m mae 2 85 m 25 58 mape 98 39 1 28 m rmse 7 48 m the accuracy of individual experiments was particularly poor possibly due to the lack of deep lakes in the training dataset based on the content of section 4 1 the accuracy of ml models constructed for different lake sizes would likely be improved in contrast xgboost and rf methods have high stability and can achieve high model accuracy for different training datasets xgboost 1 0 67 r2 0 92 0 77 m mae 1 12 m 21 48 mape 33 38 1 16 m rmse 2 97 m rf 1 0 60 r2 0 92 0 75 m mae 1 07 m 20 35 mape 31 31 1 13 m rmse 3 05 m it may be because xgboost and rf can identify and ignore elements with random errors in model construction brazdil and konolige 2012 5 2 comparison of the modeled lake mean depths with previous studies a few earlier researches have estimated the lake volume using depth as a function of the offshore distance hollister and milstead 2010 khazaei et al 2022 they assumed a linear increase in water depth with distance from the shore then the lake depth at any point can be estimated with a simple linear transformation based on maximum lake depth khazaei et al 2022 produced a new global bathymetric globathy dataset of more than 1 4 million water bodies using a gis based framework based on the maximum water depth estimates although the method is easy to replicate they ignore the associations of lake depths with other geospatial variables and different sedimentation rates within the lake different from previous studies we predicted the lake mean depth and volume with maximum lake depth and multi type parameters based on different ml methods in order to compare the two methods we first selected lakes that matched the globathy data and the maximum depth difference for the same lake is less than 1 m it can prevent errors in simulation results due to differences in initial maximum lake depth secondly we calculated the lake mean depth based on the globathy dataset and predicted the mean depth using the optimal rf model rf 1 finally the mean depths calculated by the two methods are evaluated and compared according to the measured lake mean depth as shown in fig 13 a the maximum depth of 348 lakes used for comparison have little difference in the globathy and lagos us depth dataset thus the subsequent lake mean depth estimated by different methods are comparable fig 13b c although there are few differences in the mean depth estimation results for shallow lakes in the globathy dataset the error increases sharply when the mean depth exceeds 10 m the scatter point rapidly deviates from the 1 1 line the accuracy of mean depth predicted by rf model is significantly improved compared with globathy data the scattered points always gather near the 1 1 line the r2 mae and rmse are also better than the former it shows that other geospatial factors not considered in globathy may be indispensable predictors of lake depth 5 3 the influence of grouping by lake type on model accuracy the different genesis of the lake basins was observed to directly affect the simulation accuracy of the lake types in the same area in addition the depth and volume of lake will also be limited by other factors such as the size of the lake catchment and the surrounding climate therefore it is difficult to improve the accuracy of lake mean depth prediction by relying only on a single factor for lake zoning for example we grouped studied lakes by climate zones to determine whether or not pooling the lakes within the region into groups of similarity might improve the model accuracy the köppen climate classification system is the most widely used climate classification system beck et al 2020 therefore lakes were classified into 17 climate zones according to the köppen climate classification in this study however the number of lakes in 14 climate zones is less than 150 the total number of study lakes is 6132 fig 14 they are not suitable for model training and comparing with models rf 1 constructed based on all lakes therefore only the sub climate zone rf models to predict lake mean depth for the other 3 climate zones cfa kg 14 with 197 lakes dfa kg 25 with 1383 lakes and dfb kg 26 with 4134 lakes with more than 150 lakes were constructed and compared with rf 1 model all lakes the result fig 15 shows that the accuracy of the kg 26 model is improved compared with rf 1 model all however the model accuracy of kg 14 and kg 25 decreased especially for kg 14 in addition kg 14 models are highly sensitive to the training dataset this is probably due to the low number of lakes distributed in kg 14 although grouping by climate zone can improve the performance of related individual models some models for lake types without enough training samples perform worse the experiments grouped by watershed also showed similar results currently there is no uniform and precise criteria for the classification of lake types moreover although grouping by lake type improves the homogeneity of lake morphology it significantly reduces the number of samples used for model training the prediction accuracy of ml algorithm will also be reduced due to lack of sufficient training samples 6 conclusion the in situ measurement of lake depth is essential for improving the accuracy of lake volume estimation models yet it is a rather time consuming and labor intensive work whether the reduced spatial domain of field measurements over the lakes e g only in the deepest zone can guarantee the estimation accuracy of lake mean depth and volume is worth being investigated further in this study we aim to propose an efficient method for estimating lake mean depth and volume based only on the deepest record in replace of the full lake water depth measurements linear regression is an empirical model widely applied in modeling lake hydrological variables across scales therefore we first constructed the linear statistical relationship between the maximum lake depth and mean depth volume using different ml methods we then tried to construct lake mean depth volume estimation models based only on the maximum depth and geospatial parameters the application potential of ml models in other regions was also explored the accuracy evaluation and comparison of different models were tested on 6132 lakes with bathymetry records in the conus although the linear statistical model shows acceptable performance for estimating lake mean depth r2 0 83 in the study area it is difficult to predict lake volume r2 0 23 without considering the topographic characteristics around lakes we found that the linear model accuracy can be improved based on lake size classification most models based on ml methods have better performance r2 0 85 than linear models in estimating lake mean depth and volume however the svm model svm 3 r2 0 54 mape 134 93 and dnn model dnn 3 r2 0 83 mape 82 56 constructed with low influential input parameters performed poorly in contrast xgboost and rf methods have high stability and can achieve high model accuracy both in predicting lake mean depth xgboost 1 r2 0 87 mape 23 35 rf 1 r2 0 90 mape 22 75 and volume xgboost 3 r2 0 99 mape 31 03 rf 3 r2 0 98 mape 32 63 the accuracy of models constructed in eastern finland indicates that the ml methods were also effective for other study areas with different sample capacities of measured lake depth records moreover the comparison with the previous study globathy dataset indicates that the accuracy of mean depth predicted by our constructed ml model rf 1 is significantly improved generally our results suggest that the xgboost and rf methods have great application potential in lake volume modeling and prediction this study is expected to provide a practical method for estimating lake water volume in

2507,the accurate quantification of lake volume is essential for regional water resources management and ecosystem health because of the high cost of traditional full lake depth measurements the bathymetric and volume information for most lakes globally is inaccessible whether the limited field measurements over the lake can be used to estimate lake volume is worth investigating this study aims to propose an effective method for estimating lake mean depth volume based on the lake deepest record we first constructed the empirical model that relies on the linear relationship between lake maximum depth and lake mean depth volume the different machine learning ml methods were then developed and tested based on the available lake deepest record and multi type geospatial parameters although the linear model shows good performance for estimating lake mean depth r2 0 83 it is difficult to predict lake volume r2 0 23 most ml models perform better r2 0 85 than linear models however the support vector machines svm model svm 3 r2 0 54 mape 134 93 and deep neural network dnn model dnn 3 r2 0 83 mape 82 56 constructed with low influential input parameters performed poorly in

generally the results suggest that the xgboost and rf methods have great potential in lake volume estimation this research is expected to provide a feasible approach to predict lake volume and benefit

acknowledgements section 1 introduction water is an essential resource for all species including humans and is a crucial component of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles lehner and döll 2004 palmer et al 2015 lake comprises one of the largest components of earth s surface liquid freshwater it plays a critical role in supporting agricultural and residential water use and ecosystem services downing et al 2006 pekel et al 2016 verpoorter et al 2014 woolway et al 2020 since the beginning of the 21st century many lakes worldwide have experienced obvious changes due to the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities which pose a significant threat to human water use and the eco environment alsdorf et al 2007 jain et al 2012 lei et al 2019 luo et al 2022 maberly et al 2020 pekel et al 2016 pickens et al 2020 qiao and li 2022 sheng et al 2016 song et al 2013 tao et al 2020 woolway et al 2020 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2007 yi et al 2016 zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore accurately estimating the water mass stored in lakes is crucial for more efficient management of water resources the wide application of remote sensing methods has greatly enhanced the research on the water volume change of global lakes busker et al 2019 cooley et al 2021 crétaux and birkett 2006 crétaux et al 2016 crétaux et al 2011 luo et al 2022 pekel et al 2016 however most previous studies focus on monitoring lake volume changes in response to basin wide hydrologic imbalances in addition a comprehensive knowledge of the reserves of lake water mass is still an unmet challenge as most satellite remote sensing techniques cannot provide direct observations on the lake underwater parts biancamaria et al 2016 crétaux et al 2016 the lack of global bathymetric maps and water depth records for most lakes is a major obstacle to calculating water volume conventionally field measurement using the onboard sonar is a currently conventional method for generating the lake bathymetric map bandini et al 2018 coggins and ghadouani 2019 whereas such a labor intensive and time consuming strategy is difficult to be applied to a regional scale to overcome the disadvantage of the traditional survey some researchers attempted to derive the bathymetric map using remote sensing technologies yang et al 2022 bathymetric lidar devices are currently employed in shallow lakes and favorable water quality conditions kasvi et al 2019 however the maximum penetration depth of airborne lidar is usually less than twice the depth measured by secchi restricting its use in inland lakes with large water depth and high turbidity bandini et al 2018 a few studies have employed optical imagery and satellite altimetry to estimate lake depth from space ma et al 2020 ma et al 2019 pereira et al 2019 such satellite based bathymetry is effective in intermittently flooded areas yet it is still difficult to obtain bathymetric information in permanently inundated water areas for most natural lakes the underwater topography can be considered an extension of the lake shoreline surroundings therefore the exposed terrains around lakes are usually utilized to predict lake bathymetry the spatial prediction methods were proposed to estimate water storages for individual or regional global lakes cael et al 2017 heathcote et al 2015 hollister et al 2011b messager et al 2016 sobek et al 2011 the links between topographic parameters and lake depth volume have been explored thoroughly promoting the development of a geo statistical model for estimating lake depth and volume cael et al 2017 messager et al 2016 due to the offset impact of underestimates and overestimates for different lakes it is generally applicable to estimate the net water volume of lakes on a large scale however the topographic characteristics around lakes were formed by different geological and geomorphologic processes therefore the uncertainties and potential biases of volume estimation should be considered for specific lakes or local scales a few prior studies indicated that a small number of measured lake depths could be essential for improving the extrapolation accuracy of volume estimation models for regional lakes getirana et al 2018 liu and song 2022 therefore an effective lake volume estimation method should be determined under the feasible circumstance of obtaining limited in situ measurements furthermore compared with the high cost of field measurements in full lake coverage measuring only the zone with potential maximum water depths may greatly save labor and economic cost particularly for remote and inaccessible areas dost and mannaerts 2008 hollister et al 2011a liu et al 2022 muñoz et al 2020 shiklomanov and rodda 2004 wessels et al 2015 therefore this study aims to develop an effective method for predicting lake mean depth and volume based only on the deepest water depth record instead of the full lake depth measurements in this study a large number of lakes with bathymetry records in different sizes climates and topographic features in the conterminous united states conus were chosen to construct the estimation model and assess the model performance analyses and discussions on the accuracy of mean depth and volume estimation influences of input variables and training datasets and the application potential of models in other regions were presented subsequently 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the conus is located in central north america including 48 states and the district of columbia fig 1 various landform types such as plains mountains hills deserts lakes and swamps are all distributed in the vast area and the terrain is high in the west and low in the east the eastern and western parts of the conus are roughly demarcated by the eastern foothills of the rocky mountains with great differences in climate and natural conditions baldwin 1973 kittel et al 2002 the climate of conus can be divided into two distinct regions based on the natural distribution of precipitation bounded by 95 w finkelstein and truppi 1991 karl and knight 1998 the 17 western states are arid and semi arid with annual precipitation of less than 500 mm and relatively scarce water resources the western hinterland area is only about 250 mm and the lower catchment of the colorado river is less than 90 mm vano et al 2012 the eastern states are humid and semi humid regions with annual precipitation of 800 to 1000 mm the conus owns approximately 3 5 million water bodies larger than 0 001 km2 mcdonald et al 2012 the great lakes which have a total area of about 245 000 km2 and are well known as the largest freshwater lake group in the world larson and schaetzl 2001 are mostly located in the conus four large lakes are split by the international boundary with canada given that lakes in the conus are distributed from plain to plateau and encompass a wide range of geological types the conus lake group was chosen as the study area in order to prove that the method proposed in this study has the potential to be applied in other regions with different climatic and geological types we also selected the eastern finland as the extension experiment 2 2 lake depth dataset all the lake dataset was collected from a data module named lagos us locus it is one of the key modules of the lagos us platform https lagoslakes org lagos us overview which provides an extendable research ready platform for studying the 479 950 lakes and reservoirs water area 0 01 km2 in the conus cheruvelil et al 2021 these lagos us core modules were created using datasets from various sources such as national scale climate land use cover hydrology data and government tribal and community science lake data further documentation of the data modules used is included in the lagos us locus user guide and the lagos us gis toolbox cheruvelil et al 2021 there are currently four lagos us extension modules including the lagos us depth module either published or in development that will connect to lagos us locus through common lake identifiers the lagos us depth v1 0 module combines in situ measurements of lake depth for 17 675 lakes from 65 different sources fig 1 cheruvelil et al 2021 stachelek et al 2021 there are 17 675 lakes in the depth module with the maximum depth records among which 6 137 lakes have the mean depth records the 6 137 lakes with both maximum and mean depths were chosen as the input dataset for training and validating the lake volume estimation model the dataset includes lakes in different elevations sizes geomorphic characteristics and geometric shapes fig 1 table 1 the bathymetric data for lakes in eastern finland was collected from finnish environment institute https www syke fi en us publications 2 3 lake geometric characteristics the data records for lake characteristics from lagos us locus include variables on lake geometry and lake hydrologic connectivity in this study the key geometric variables include lake area perimeter shoreline development factor maximum length and width of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon fig 2 the shoreline development factor was calculated from the lake water area and perimeter cheruvelil et al 2021 it is a measure of the deviation of lake shape from 1 a perfect circle the maximum length of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon is the maximum possible distance between any two vertices of the smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon note the line connecting these vertices is located within the lake polygon the maximum width of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake polygon is defined along an axis perpendicular to the axis defined by the convex hull length convex hulls were generated with the minimum bounding geometry tool in arcgis the several variables were produced with the calculate geometry tools in arcgis using the albers usgs conical area projection 2 4 digital elevation model dem data for lake topographic characteristics in february 2000 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm used space borne radar observations to acquire terrain elevations at 1 srtm 1 dem and 3 resolution srtm 3 dem in this study the topographic characteristics variables including mean elevation and mean slope within the buffer around the lake were performed on the elevation data provided by srtm 1 dem 3 methodology the main workflow of the study is composed of four parts fig 4 the first part in light cyan involves filtering the initial data and calculating the topographic parameters around the lakes based on dem the second part in brown involves selecting input variables and exploring the effect of different variable combinations on the performances of machine learning ml methods in the third part in light yellow we construct and optimize different ml models based on the training datasets and input variables in addition we also construct the linear statistical model between the lake maximum depth and mean depth or volume for a comparison with the results derived from the ml methods the final part in light blue involves the comparison of different ml model performances and selecting the optimal model further information on the four parts is introduced below 3 1 data filtering and preprocessing high quality sample data is the guarantee of ml model accuracy to ensure data quality we checked and filtered the initial data it is difficult and inaccurate to predict lake depth and volume for a very large lake water area 500 km2 messager et al 2016 compared with the hundreds of millions of small lakes downing et al 2006 verpoorter et al 2014 the number of lakes larger than 500 km2 is rather small furthermore bathymetric measurements of these large lakes are usually well established because of their importance to regional ecosystem health and industrial production herdendorf 1982 thus we focused on precisely predicting water depth for lakes less than 500 km2 therefore four lakes larger than 500 km2 were excluded from the study including salt lakes that are large but shallow in addition to reduce the influences of sample outliers on the model accuracy we also excluded a lake lake chelan that was far deeper mean depth 144 48 m than other lakes in comparable size the geophysical processes that shape a lake basin are the same as those that shape the topography directly surrounding the lake it is reasonable to assume that the elevation difference and slope around the lake are probably related to the lake depths thus the lake topographic characteristics are critical to predicting lake mean depth and volume however the sediment deposition of lakes brings large uncertainty to lake bathymetry estimation zhu et al 2019 therefore field investigation of the lake bottom s water depth is crucial to constraining topographic extrapolation or prediction for this purpose the maximum depth as a key variable was added to the prediction parameters in this study which can effectively reduce the uncertainty caused by the changes in the lake underwater topography due to historical sediment deposition we calculated the minimum surface elevation within the lake as lake surface elevation the mean elevation and slope within the buffer zone width 100 m around the lake based on the lake distribution data and srtm 1 dem data in order to avoid errors caused by the dem data noise the 5 quantile elevation value within the lake polygon was taken as the minimum elevation of the lake surface elevation difference refers to the difference between mean elevation within the buffer zone and lake surface elevation the lakes in this study total n 6132 cover a wide range in area depth and volume fig 3 table 1 the proportion of small lakes is larger 25 75 interquartile range for area 0 09 0 91 km2 mean depth 2 00 5 09 m volume 0 22 3 70 106 m3 as shown in fig 3b the mean depth of lakes in different sizes increases significantly indicating that lake area is one of the key factors determining lake depth 3 2 input variables selection and combination in this study the input variables are divided into 3 types fig 4 the first type is lake bathymetric information maximum depth the second type is the topographic variables around the lake the mean elevation and slope around the lake and the elevation difference the third type is lake shape and geometric variables lake area lake perimeter shoreline development factor maximum length and width of smallest convex hull enclosing the lake in order to analyze the influence of the selection of the variables on the performances of ml in predicting lake mean depth and volume we tested different combinations of the input variables several variables with great influence on model results were selected through feature selection method r package we judge the importance of these variables to the predicted results based on their scores f value the maximum depth is the most important as its f value is much higher than other variables therefore this also indirectly illustrates the feasibility of predicting the mean depth and volume through maximum depth mean slope elevation difference and lake area are also key variables for predicting lake mean depth and volume from the perspective of f values although other factors can be important in different geological situations adding them to the set of predictors yields only a few improvements at the price of greatly increasing model complexity therefore we eventually tested two scenarios of variable combination in the model construction 1 all variables mentioned above were used for predicting all parameters hereinafter and 2 the variable subset including the maximum depth mean slope elevation difference and lake area part parameters 3 3 linear statistical model linear regression is an empirical model widely applied in modeling lake hydrological variables across scales therefore we constructed the linear statistical relationship between the lake maximum depth and mean depth volume for a comparison with the results derived from the ml methods in order to compare with the ml methods we adopt the same segmentation ratio 9 1 of the training dataset and test dataset because the construction of linear model cannot carry out 500 random experiments like the ml methods the selection of training dataset is not randomly generated to avoid the poor accuracy of linear model caused by training dataset we arranged the sample dataset according to the mean depth and repeated coding in the order of 0 9 all the data encoded as 5 were used as the test dataset and the rest as the training dataset the combination method can use the data with the maximum value range as the training dataset which helps enhance the applicability of the model 3 4 different machine learning methods ml methods can effectively explore potential nonlinear relationships between data and have wide application prospects in earth science and remote sensing science lary et al 2016 in this paper four widely used ml methods are selected to construct estimation models for lake mean depth and volume including random forest rf avanzi et al 2019 breiman 2001 extreme gradient boosting tree xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 support vector machines svm hearst et al 1998 platt 1998 smola and schölkopf 2004 and deep neural network dnn lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 the key features of four ml methods are introduced below firstly the training and test dataset are randomly generated from sample data in a certain split ratio which was 9 1 in this study the results did not change significantly in other proportions e g 8 2 and 7 3 benefiting from the availability of a large sample dataset 6132 lakes in this study then the construction of the ml models was optimized using the training dataset the optimization process of the internal model structure was gradually adjusted depending on the loss function yousefi and toffolon 2022 finally the ml performances were examined using the test dataset to ensure that the internal model structure was not an overfitting or underfitting result and could be applied in other cases for data driven ml methods the quality quantity and scope of training data will greatly affect the estimation accuracy of the models chen et al 2019 although the optimization of hyperparameters could influence the accuracy of the model this research aims to construct an optimal model for predicting lake mean depth and volume therefore we did not optimize and adjust the hyperparameters considering the time cost instead the experiment was repeated 500 times changing the training and test dataset constantly and the model with the best validation results the overfitting results were eliminated was chosen 3 4 1 random forest rf rf is an integrated learning method whose basic unit is a decision tree during the training process a large number of independent decision trees are constructed to form a random forest finally the results of these decision trees are integrated to improve the model accuracy such as the output average value the randomness of rf method is mainly reflected in two aspects firstly the bagging method is used to randomly generate training data subsets from the original training dataset during the construction of each decision tree secondly instead of using all the feature variables to participate in the comparison during node splitting a subset is randomly selected from the characteristic variables to participate in node splitting rf method is not easy to overfit and has good tolerance to outliers and noise thanks to the two randomness liaw and wiener 2002 svetnik et al 2003 3 4 2 extreme gradient boosting tree xgboost xgboost is an implementation of the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt by friedman 2001 different from the rf method in which each tree is independent the decision trees in the xgboost method depend on each other and are generated serially xgboost presents a new loss function with regularization which can efficiently use sparse data without overfitting compared with traditional gbdt ding et al 2020 feature segmentation is achieved by continuously creating decision trees in the method in which each decision tree has many leaf nodes matching scores finally the estimation result is the sum of the scores assigned to the leaf nodes of each tree 3 4 3 support vector machines svm svm are supervised learning models with appropriate learning methods used to analyze classification and regression analysis data hearst et al 1998 platt 1998 smola and schölkopf 2004 in addition to linear classification svm can efficiently conduct a nonlinear classification using the kernel trick svm has great advantages in dealing with nonlinear problems and small dataset problems however it is sensitive to data noise and inefficient for large datasets 3 4 4 deep neural network dnn dnn method is a kind of artificial neural network ann with multiple hidden layers i e deep networks between the input layer and the output layer lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 compared with the traditional shallow neural network the deep network of dnn method provides a higher level of nonlinear function approximation and can combine low level features to improve the estimation ability of the model 3 5 model performance evaluation metrics the performances of different models were evaluated based on the test dataset by four statistical metrics the coefficient of determination or r squared r2 mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse specifically these metrics are calculated as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 mape 100 n i 1 n x i y i y i 3 mae i 1 n x i y i n 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where n is the number of test dataset i is the number index x i is the estimated value and y i is the measured value 4 results and analyses 4 1 estimation based on the linear statistical model as shown in fig 5 there is a strong correlation between maximum depth and mean depth r2 0 83 overall the model performed well mae 0 90 m rmse 1 65 m although there was a large difference between estimated and measured values for some deep lakes however the correlation between maximum depth and volume is poor without a robust linear relationship and the accuracy evaluation in the test dataset also shows great errors the linear model is directly constructed based on the relationship between maximum depth and lake volume without considering the topographic and geographic variables e g the lake area mean slope mean elevation etc related to the lake bathymetry although it can simulate the mean depth the conversion of lake area between lake volume and maximum depth was ignored therefore it is difficult to predict the actual water volume of the lake the limitations of the current linear model are mainly the lack of topographic information and lake size classification the complexity of the linear models would be increased with topographic information in addition the advantage of ml methods is to combine different variables and find the optimal model structure quickly and efficiently therefore there was no need to build a complex linear model combining topographic information instead we only consider the possible effects on the linear model derived from lake area classification according to previous studies messager et al 2016 the linear models for different lake area sizes were constructed and compared respectively fig 6 though the accuracy metrics cannot be completely used as a reference standard due to differing sample value ranges lake area and volume the increase in r2 compared with 0 29 fig 5c could illustrate the improved accuracy gained based on lake area size classification in addition the scattered points are clustered near the 1 1 line compared with the previous linear model fig 5c and fig 6 however the improvements of linear models based on lake area size classification are trivial compared with the correlation between maximum depth and mean depth the linear relationship between lake maximum depth and volume could not achieve satisfactory performance therefore it is not advisable to use linear statistical models to predict lake volume directly 4 2 comparison on the estimations from different machine learning models as described in section 3 4 the optimal models based on different ml algorithms were selected for comparison based on model performance metrics after 500 times of random sampling and model construction respectively models for predicting lake mean depth based on different ml methods with all parameters and part parameters were named ml 1 and ml 2 e g xgboost 1 and xgboost 2 similarly the models for predicting lake volume based on different ml methods with all parameters and part parameters were named ml 3 and ml 4 e g xgboost 3 and xgboost 4 except for svm 1 and dnn 1 other mean depth estimation models perform better than the linear statistical model fig 7 table 2 comparing the four ml methods rf 1 and xgboost 1 perform best rf 1 r2 0 90 mae 0 75 m mape 22 75 rmse 1 13 m xgboost 1 r2 0 87 mae 0 77 m mape 23 35 rmse 1 16 m there are obvious differences in the modeling performance as these four ml models have different principles the accuracy of svm models in two scenarios of variable combination all parameters and part parameters was significantly different svm 1 r2 0 54 mae 1 44 m mape 49 25 rmse 2 05 m svm 2 r2 0 85 mae 0 78 m mape 25 50 rmse 1 15 m it suggests that the svm method is highly sensitive to the key input variables this may be because the svm method relies on a small number of support vectors and the model accuracy will deteriorate when samples with random errors are selected as support vectors moreover svm belongs to the classification algorithm which is essentially developed from the linear classification algorithm therefore the svm method is good at classification but not for regression issues in this study in contrast xgboost and rf can identify elements with random errors and ignore them in model construction brazdil and konolige 2012 moreover the xgboost algorithm has a built in cross validation method at each iteration preventing the model from overfitting chen and guestrin 2016 therefore the more input variables of xgboost and rf the better the model performance based on the validation results of different ml models for predicting lake volume fig 8 table 3 rf xgboost and dnn models have achieved satisfactory performances similar to the validation and comparison results of mean depth prediction models rf method and xgboost method perform best xgboost 3 r2 0 99 mae 1 92 106 m3 mape 31 03 rmse 7 94 106 m3 rf 4 r2 0 94 mae 1 83 106 m3 mape 29 24 rmse 9 70 106 m3 when the input parameters with low influence are reduced the svm and dnn methods dnn 2 and svm 2 were obviously improved the value of lake volume is larger relative to mean depth so the model complexity is improved the dnn algorithm usually requires more training data massive labeled samples for model simulation than the other traditional ml algorithms the data used in this study may not have reached this level in addition xgboost and rf methods adopt a similar strategy it supports sampling of samples and features which can effectively control the model complexity and improve the model generalization ability brazdil and konolige 2012 thus the accuracy of dnn models is not better than the rf and xgboost models more importantly the xgboost model uses parallelized implementation to build the process of the sequential trees which can substantially improve the algorithm efficiency overall the xgboost and rf methods have great application potential in lake volume modeling and prediction 4 3 evaluation of the machine learning methods applied to other areas although our ml models effectively estimated lake mean depth and volume in the conus caution should be exercised when applying the method to other areas the models trained in section 4 2 could not be applied in other regions due to the differences in sample value ranges lake depth or volume instead we have revealed that the topographic and geometric characteristics e g the elevation drop of shoreline buffer zone lake size may fundamentally correlate with lake depth and volume and recommend these parameters for developing similar ml models one of the limitations of ml models is that their performance is limited by the representativeness of the training dataset this shows that the model trained based on a local dataset may not be accurate enough when applied to other regions therefore we collected 568 lakes with bathymetric data in eastern finland for training and validation of the local lake volume estimation model these lakes in this region have different sizes fig 9 which are suitable for model construction however due to the small number of sample dataset the segmentation ratio of training dataset and test dataset is set to 7 3 in this section in addition the topographic parameters for finnish lakes were calculated based on the reflectance radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem due to the limited spatial coverage of srtm 1 dem section 4 2 has proved that rf and xgboost models perform well in estimating lake mean depth and volume and the sensitivity influenced by training datasets and input variables is low therefore the rf and xgboost are used to construct estimation models for mean depth and volume respectively these models for lakes located in eastern finland performed better on the test dataset than that of xgboost 1 and rf 1 models described in section 4 2 possibly due to some samples with high water depth and volume included in the xgboost 1 and rf 1 model increasing the mae and rmse fig 10 table 2 and table 3 the constructed model in eastern finland had a good performance indicating that the ml methods were also effective for the different study areas with a small amount of measured lake depth data 5 discussions 5 1 the effect of buffer width and the sensitivity comparison of different machine learning models affected by input variables combination and training dataset as introduced in the method section the input variables are divided into 3 types fig 4 lake bathymetric information topographic variables around the lake and lake shape and geometric variables given that the buffer distance determines the width of the exposed terrains around a lake used for spatial extrapolation we generated lake topographic parameters with different buffer widths to assess the influence of buffer width on the lake mean depth prediction because small lakes would be related to a narrower band of surrounding topography than large lakes heathcote et al 2015 the buffer width is divided into two categories static buffer and dynamic buffer the static buffer size ranges from 50 m to 500 m the dynamic buffer is related to the radius of a circle with an area equal to each lake hereinafter referred to as the equivalent circle radius cr the dynamic buffer size ranges from 25 cr to 100 cr the results showed that the accuracy of the models with different buffer widths is similar fig 11 in comparison the model performance is slightly better when the buffer width is 100 m thus the results in this study were all generated using static parameters with a buffer size of 100 m according to the analysis in section 4 2 fig 7 fig 8 table 2 and table 3 dnn and svm methods are highly sensitive to key input variables in fact for data driven ml methods the quality quantity and scope of training dataset will also greatly affect the estimation accuracy of the method chen et al 2019 thus the sensitivity of models to the training dataset should be determined to examine its universality in our study the experiment was repeated 500 times based on the training datasets that were separated randomly therefore the uncertainties of different models constructed for lake mean depth caused by different training datasets can be explored fig 12 according to the accuracy comparison of 500 experiments lake mean depth on different models dnn method and svm method are highly sensitive to the training dataset especially dnn 1 0 05 r2 0 91 0 88 m mae 2 85 m 25 58 mape 98 39 1 28 m rmse 7 48 m the accuracy of individual experiments was particularly poor possibly due to the lack of deep lakes in the training dataset based on the content of section 4 1 the accuracy of ml models constructed for different lake sizes would likely be improved in contrast xgboost and rf methods have high stability and can achieve high model accuracy for different training datasets xgboost 1 0 67 r2 0 92 0 77 m mae 1 12 m 21 48 mape 33 38 1 16 m rmse 2 97 m rf 1 0 60 r2 0 92 0 75 m mae 1 07 m 20 35 mape 31 31 1 13 m rmse 3 05 m it may be because xgboost and rf can identify and ignore elements with random errors in model construction brazdil and konolige 2012 5 2 comparison of the modeled lake mean depths with previous studies a few earlier researches have estimated the lake volume using depth as a function of the offshore distance hollister and milstead 2010 khazaei et al 2022 they assumed a linear increase in water depth with distance from the shore then the lake depth at any point can be estimated with a simple linear transformation based on maximum lake depth khazaei et al 2022 produced a new global bathymetric globathy dataset of more than 1 4 million water bodies using a gis based framework based on the maximum water depth estimates although the method is easy to replicate they ignore the associations of lake depths with other geospatial variables and different sedimentation rates within the lake different from previous studies we predicted the lake mean depth and volume with maximum lake depth and multi type parameters based on different ml methods in order to compare the two methods we first selected lakes that matched the globathy data and the maximum depth difference for the same lake is less than 1 m it can prevent errors in simulation results due to differences in initial maximum lake depth secondly we calculated the lake mean depth based on the globathy dataset and predicted the mean depth using the optimal rf model rf 1 finally the mean depths calculated by the two methods are evaluated and compared according to the measured lake mean depth as shown in fig 13 a the maximum depth of 348 lakes used for comparison have little difference in the globathy and lagos us depth dataset thus the subsequent lake mean depth estimated by different methods are comparable fig 13b c although there are few differences in the mean depth estimation results for shallow lakes in the globathy dataset the error increases sharply when the mean depth exceeds 10 m the scatter point rapidly deviates from the 1 1 line the accuracy of mean depth predicted by rf model is significantly improved compared with globathy data the scattered points always gather near the 1 1 line the r2 mae and rmse are also better than the former it shows that other geospatial factors not considered in globathy may be indispensable predictors of lake depth 5 3 the influence of grouping by lake type on model accuracy the different genesis of the lake basins was observed to directly affect the simulation accuracy of the lake types in the same area in addition the depth and volume of lake will also be limited by other factors such as the size of the lake catchment and the surrounding climate therefore it is difficult to improve the accuracy of lake mean depth prediction by relying only on a single factor for lake zoning for example we grouped studied lakes by climate zones to determine whether or not pooling the lakes within the region into groups of similarity might improve the model accuracy the köppen climate classification system is the most widely used climate classification system beck et al 2020 therefore lakes were classified into 17 climate zones according to the köppen climate classification in this study however the number of lakes in 14 climate zones is less than 150 the total number of study lakes is 6132 fig 14 they are not suitable for model training and comparing with models rf 1 constructed based on all lakes therefore only the sub climate zone rf models to predict lake mean depth for the other 3 climate zones cfa kg 14 with 197 lakes dfa kg 25 with 1383 lakes and dfb kg 26 with 4134 lakes with more than 150 lakes were constructed and compared with rf 1 model all lakes the result fig 15 shows that the accuracy of the kg 26 model is improved compared with rf 1 model all however the model accuracy of kg 14 and kg 25 decreased especially for kg 14 in addition kg 14 models are highly sensitive to the training dataset this is probably due to the low number of lakes distributed in kg 14 although grouping by climate zone can improve the performance of related individual models some models for lake types without enough training samples perform worse the experiments grouped by watershed also showed similar results currently there is no uniform and precise criteria for the classification of lake types moreover although grouping by lake type improves the homogeneity of lake morphology it significantly reduces the number of samples used for model training the prediction accuracy of ml algorithm will also be reduced due to lack of sufficient training samples 6 conclusion the in situ measurement of lake depth is essential for improving the accuracy of lake volume estimation models yet it is a rather time consuming and labor intensive work whether the reduced spatial domain of field measurements over the lakes e g only in the deepest zone can guarantee the estimation accuracy of lake mean depth and volume is worth being investigated further in this study we aim to propose an efficient method for estimating lake mean depth and volume based only on the deepest record in replace of the full lake water depth measurements linear regression is an empirical model widely applied in modeling lake hydrological variables across scales therefore we first constructed the linear statistical relationship between the maximum lake depth and mean depth volume using different ml methods we then tried to construct lake mean depth volume estimation models based only on the maximum depth and geospatial parameters the application potential of ml models in other regions was also explored the accuracy evaluation and comparison of different models were tested on 6132 lakes with bathymetry records in the conus although the linear statistical model shows acceptable performance for estimating lake mean depth r2 0 83 in the study area it is difficult to predict lake volume r2 0 23 without considering the topographic characteristics around lakes we found that the linear model accuracy can be improved based on lake size classification most models based on ml methods have better performance r2 0 85 than linear models in estimating lake mean depth and volume however the svm model svm 3 r2 0 54 mape 134 93 and dnn model dnn 3 r2 0 83 mape 82 56 constructed with low influential input parameters performed poorly in contrast xgboost and rf methods have high stability and can achieve high model accuracy both in predicting lake mean depth xgboost 1 r2 0 87 mape 23 35 rf 1 r2 0 90 mape 22 75 and volume xgboost 3 r2 0 99 mape 31 03 rf 3 r2 0 98 mape 32 63 the accuracy of models constructed in eastern finland indicates that the ml methods were also effective for other study areas with different sample capacities of measured lake depth records moreover the comparison with the previous study globathy dataset indicates that the accuracy of mean depth predicted by our constructed ml model rf 1 is significantly improved generally our results suggest that the xgboost and rf methods have great application potential in lake volume modeling and prediction this study is expected to provide a practical method for estimating lake water volume in remote and data scarce areas and promoting lake water resource management credit authorship contribution statement pengfei zhan conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation

2508,in saltwater intrusion problems of coastal regions the dynamics of narrower mixing zones are influenced by the amount of dispersive entrainment and its associated marine discharges modelling low fresh water recharge and high peclet number scenarios gives inaccurate results with the available methods in this study the physical accuracy of the bl solution provided by paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 for such conditions is validated for discharge at outflow face and width of mixing zone wmz with experimentally created datasets and further extended with numerical analysis to quantify the influence of dispersive entrainment on marine discharge and saline circulation by comparing the measured and estimated saltwater outflows the average transverse dispersion for all dimensionless freshwater flux rates a was calculated and it ranged from 0 005 cm to 0 062 cm the study showed that for buoyancy dominated high peclet number flow circumstances the boundary layer solutions can be effectively used to predict the marine discharges up to a 0 5 the combined effects of water flux and dispersion revealed that buoyant force has a considerable impact on the rate of saline circulation as it suppresses the dispersion the findings lend credence to simplicity of the boundary layer solution in reducing numerical model convergence issues for field problems caused by low recharge and low

length and height of saltwater wedge at steady state 1 introduction the mixing zone is regarded as a characteristic feature of any coastal aquifer ecosystem and has received considerable attention in the recent times lu and werner 2013 ahmed 2017 zamora et al 2017 rozos et al 2021 the flow dynamics of this zone need to be known before adopting any aquifer management solutions as it has implications on lateral intrusion of seawater into the coastal aquifer phenomenally described in the form of a wedge this wedge acts as a convection cell and is driven by the net effect of the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer head and the seawater head forced convection and density difference between freshwater fw and seawater free convection through this mixing zone seawater is entrained by outflowing fw further diluting the intruded seawater which eventually contributes as a substantial component of subsurface groundwater discharge sgd the location of this mixing zone influenced by aforementioned causes are often predicted either by sharp interface neglecting mixing or by diffused interface approach considering hydrodynamic dispersion causing mixing this diffused interface method employs iterative numerical techniques to simulate the cyclic nonlinear coupling effect of flow and transport which has been demonstrated to be inexact for thin mixing zones in this study therefore the applicability of boundary layer bl solution to such issues is investigated the process and factors affecting the evolution of the mixing zone and the movement of solutes have been investigated by many researchers abarca et al 2007 bear 1979 chang and clement 2013 oz et al 2015 smith 2004 the width of the mixing zone wmz is the result of coaction of parameters like mechanical dispersion diffusion groundwater discharge and density contrast between the fluids groundwater discharge through the outflow face is influenced by the relative amount of fresh and saltwater sw influxes which is characterised by dimensionless fw flux a it denotes the dominance of advective flux relative to the buoyancy density driven flux if the value of a 1 it will be advection dominated and if a 1 it will be a buoyancy dominated both smith 2004 and abarca et al 2007 posited the significance of quantifying sw flux for velocity dependent dispersion studies smith 2004 carried out a detailed numerical analysis on the mixed convection process and he introduced a single non dimensional recirculation number to incorporate the factors controlling the relative amounts of seawater and terrestrial fw in sgd he further asserted that mixing at the transition zone is effected by aquifer dispersivities which in turn had a strong dependence on convective overturn i e caused due to circulation of sw flux abarca et al 2007 claimed the wmz as a relevant measuring parameter to derive field values of dispersivity their study revealed the contribution of transverse dispersivity in broadening the concentration profile and increasing the slope of the interface whereas that of longitudinal dispersivity was to displace high concentration isolines towards the seaside pool and carrera 2011 incorporated transverse dispersivity in the sw density term and modified strack s single valued potential solution to account for mixing and came up with an empirically corrected equation for the depth of interface the circulation flow patterns within the mixing zone were explored in detail by oz et al 2015 they divided mixing zone into the dispersive region and flow rotation region based on the physical processes of salt transport occurring there and quantified the relative width of two regions for a range of transverse dispersivities they also expressed the significant sensitivity of the flow rotation region on transverse dispersivity the previous studies have elucidated the role of dispersion in mixing and in the evolution of a convective recirculation cell with transverse dispersion dominating once the system has reached equilibrium and is in a steady flow mode in some field aquifers the continuity between sea and aquifer may be reduced due to geographical features such as rocks so that horizontal transmissivity may be considerably less whenever fw recharge is low or pumping is high in an arid aquifer the volume of fw flow through the aquifer is substantially decreased and fw outflow to the sea is reduced the transition zones formed in such case would be thin compared to the horizontal extent of aquifer and value of transverse dispersivity α t would be small as fw velocity will be less the system could be considered then as a buoyancy flux dominated system paster and dagan 2007 reported field values of α t surprisingly low as 0 5 mm to 32 mm and extended their approach to determine a regional scale value to be 40 mm in paster 2010 previous sw intrusion studies conducted in laboratory aquifers also showed a thin mixing layer where the values of longitudinal dispersivity α l in such cases are often found to vary from 0 1 mm to 2 mm goswami and clement 2007 jakovovic et al 2011 and α t would be taken in the range of 1 5 to 1 400 of α l smith 2004 the mixing of fresh and sw is quantified by a dimensionless quantity called the seepage peclet number pes and is defined as l α t where l denotes the thickness of aquifer for thin transition zones described above pes vary in the order of 103 104 in the present study the scope is limited to the mixing due to this small dispersivity dispersive entrainment as well as its related brackish discharge and saline circulation in the thin mixing zone once the saline wedge has achieved the steady state sharp interface based analytic solutions were commonly applied to compute the lateral extent of wedges in coastal aquifers but since it overlooked the role of dispersion in mixing and the formation of a convective recirculation cell it overestimated the length of sw intrusion the available variable density flow and transport numerical models incorporate both advection and dispersion and are successful in simulating broad transition zones in this regard voss and souza 1987 warned about inconsistent approximations in the calculation of flow velocity and provided modifications in the numerical approach while representing narrow transition zones and modelling the effects of low transverse dispersivity the low dispersivity values that generally account for the laboratory results are adopted by fitting model simulation results with the experimental values like matching the point at the x axis where the 50 isochlor line touches this is a tedious process and demands a number of trial and error simulations also it is often difficult to simulate low dispersion data using numerical models due to considerable convergence difficulties younes and fahs 2014 the attempts to quantify mixing using phenomenological bl approximation for stratified flows with thin interface were made by many researchers dagan 1971 rubin 1983 van duijn and peletier 1992 specifically paster and dagan 2007 2008a 2008b undertook and published research devoted to estimating mixing layer variables for non uniform fw flow scenarios associated with seawater intrusion by augmenting the sharp interface solution with the bl approximation further to it a focus on a generaliszed description of the method with application to a real field aquifer was demonstrated by paster 2010 and the same solution was adopted in the present study the mathematical solution developed by paster and dagan 2007 2008a 2008b on the theoretical basis has not been verified so far with experimental measurements in addition it has not been investigated for how much the discharge to the saltwater boundary varies when dispersive entrainment is considered for pes values of order 103 or greater to the authors knowledge there have been no such studies for saline circulation rate comparing buoyancy and balanced flow regimes using experimental datasets to address the aforementioned challenges the following are the objectives of the present study 1 to validate the boundary layer solution of paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 using experimental datasets for establishing the relationship between fw recharge and sw entrainment for the thin transition zone 2 employ the validated model to derive the value of α t and quantify mixing zone variables such as velocity of entrainment through mixing zone wmz and saline circulation within the fw sw interface and 3 recreate the laboratory experiments using a numerical model compare the model results to the measured discharges and subsequently examine the influence of dispersive entrainment on marine discharge and saline circulation to generate the experimental datasets a variable density aquifer with steady flow is developed analogous to conditions assumed by paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 where transverse dispersivity will be holding diminutive values specifically 7 experiments were designed to evaluate the thickness of the mixing zone and rate of sw entrainment subject to different fw flow rates the sw wedges were continuously monitored to ensure that consistent influxes were maintained until they reached a steady state all the variables both experimental and numerical considered in the analyses correspond to the steady state through this study we try to investigate how the fw convective velocity influences the sw circulation rate and how the dispersive entrainment exclusively contributes to the discharge at the outflow face 2 mathematical model in this section the governing equation of steady groundwater flow and theoretical solution derived in paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 hereinafter referred to as bl solution specifically for low transverse dispersion are briefly described the emphasis is on modelling a thin mixing layer under steady state conditions the study examined a vertical cross section of a coastal aquifer in a stable density stratification i e where fw flows above the sw body resulting in saltwater intrusion a mixing layer develops between the two water bodies which is thin when compared to the thickness of aquifer where a density gradient exists between the fw and sw two processes control mixing between sw and fw at the interface upward advection of fw driven by the hydraulic gradient and dispersion of sw downward from the sw boundary the basic equations that are used to simulate density driven flow through a porous medium are conservation of momentum darcy s law conservation of fluid mass conservation of solute and equation of state these equations took the form as given below bear 1979 paster and dagan 2007 abarca et al 2007 smith 2004 1 q κ μ p ρ g 2 ρ q 0 3 c q d c 4 ρ ρ f 1 c c s where q is the specific discharge p is the pressure ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration vector κ is the permeability isotropic of the porous medium μ is the coefficient of viscosity of fresh water c is the fluid salt concentration c s that in seawater and d is the dispersion tensor the density difference ratio ρ s ρ f ρ f relates fluid density to fluid salt concentration as given in eq 4 the boundary layer solution simplifies the mixing problem by retaining only the dominant terms in flow and transport equations the assumptions considered while formulating the bl equations include the linear correlation of density and concentration negligible variations of viscosity and boussinesq s approximation density variations are negligible in the mass conservation of water which are logically correct for weak concentrations such as seawater freshwater mixing zone also the aquifer is conceptualized as homogeneous and isotropic for seawater intrusion problems with meagre transverse dispersion sharp interface equations were generalized to a layered flow where the interaction between flow and density is included the vertical transit of sw through the interface is represented by a velocity dependent dispersion tensor transverse dispersion times the fw flux the detailed step by step derivation of bl equations can be found in paster and dagan 2007 paster 2010 and is not listed here the solution of bl equations for total entrainment of sw along a certain area of the interface q s and thickness of the transition layer δ z in terms of a are 5 q s 2 α t 1 2 β ψ s 1 ψ s 2 k s ψ s 1 2 d ψ s 6 δ z 5 84 α t 1 2 ζ k s ψ s 1 2 where k s ψ s is an auxiliary constant and is given by 7 k s ψ s 0 s 1 ζ 2 d s which denotes the fw discharge along the interface flowing out through the seepage face to the sw boundary ζ represents fw body thickness s representing the distance along the interface and ψ s 1 ψ s 2 denoting sw inflow along certain area of interface stream function these equations are for a generalized 3d problem and this dispersive entrainment could be interpreted as flow due to displacement thickness for the case of 2d seawater intrusion problem in a confined aquifer paster and dagan 2007 had given the value of k in terms of dimensionless fw flux a as 8 k ϕ 0 1 a arcsinh ϕ 0 1 a arcsinh 1 a where ϕ 0 is the specific discharge potential which will take value between 0 to 1 a along the bl the dimensionless freshwater flux a q f k b q f k b is the viscous force and is the density difference factor buoyancy force abarca et al 2007 the flux profile above the sharp interface was approximated using a fourth order polynomial f ζ 2 ζ 2 ζ 3 ζ 4 and a constant β shear friction factor with a value of 0 343 was adopted to visualize the relative position of bl edges as δ l and δ u the limits of thickness of transition zone layer as given in eq 2 the distance from the sharp interface to these limits is computed as given below paster and dagan 2007 9 δ u δ j 10 δ l δ 1 j where j 0 1 f 2 ζ d ζ whose value when applied to flux profile would be 367 630 these equations were applied to generate curves for different values of a up to 0 5 as this range characterized the flatness of the interface with meagre transverse dispersion hence it is obvious that by matching the sw discharge measured experimentally to its computed value this method could be used to find the average value of α t for a buoyancy flux dominated system after delineating the sharp interface obtained experimentally the auxiliary constant k s ψ s could be determined via numerical quadrature the boundary layer analytical solution is restricted to a 0 5 as one of our objectives is to compare the experimental result with the boundary layer analytical solution the values of the parameters in the present study were chosen in such a way that density flux is predominating in the system hence in this study a is taken as the independent variable and is varied between 0 13 and 0 84 the controlling variable is the sw flux and the measuring variables include total discharge and its salinity q s is made non dimensional by dividing the sw discharge with the fw discharge from the total discharge qt measured as outflow to the sw boundary and from its estimated salinity the discharge of sw could be calculated by the chloride mass balance

3 methodology 3 1 laboratory study 3 1 1 experimental setup towards achieving the primary goal experiments were conducted in a transparent rectangular flow tank with a porous medium chamber of length 150 cm and width 6 cm into which medium coarse sand was filled up to a height of 43 5 cm fig 1 the flow tank geometry was chosen such that it would produce a uniform ground water flow field with typical groundwater flow velocities for digitally capturing the evolution and movement of the transition zone the chamber exemplifies a two dimensional vertical cross section of a coastal aquifer in a longitudinal direction with a meagre third dimension to avoid deflection of side walls acrylic nails were drilled at a height of 60 cm well above the aquifer thickness so that flow was not obstructed during the experimentation the sand tank was constructed with a 12 mm thick acrylic sheet in front and a 15 mm at the rare end and two side chambers of length 10 cm each are for fresh water and other for sw which span on either side of it the three compartments were interconnected but the porous media were restrained in the middle chamber by placing a 90 µm mesh cover on the barrier this also prevented the clogging of sand at the outlets provided by maintaining a uniform continuous flow through them left and right side constant head chambers were 10 cm long and filled with fw and sw respectively the schematic diagram and a digital photograph along with accessories of the flow tank front view are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the two reservoirs were kept at a height of 2 5 m above the flow tank arrangement which were connected to two peristaltic pumps bt 600 mm 0 00166 870 ml min 6 4 mm id tubing cartridge to feed fw and sw to the two side chambers the inlets provided with rotameters 1 4 bspm top bottom rear with fine control valve ss 304 0 5 lpm acrylic body operating pressure 0 5 kg cm2 were connected from the downside of the tank to avoid gas formations entering the porous media so that fully saturated condition could be achieved during the experiment the heads in the fw and sw chambers are kept constant as h1 and h2 as given below by maintaining flow adjustable overflow outlets by controlling these head levels different fw discharge rates qdf and darcy fluxes qf were established table 1 shows the water heads inside chambers and the corresponding input fw flux into the chamber during the entire course of experiment water levels were measured accurately to 1 mm using capacitance level transmitters ss 316 probe rugged type with teflon lined which were kept submerged inside each of the side chambers these transmitters were connected to gsm module prysmato rdm quad band 900 mhz store and transmit readings to central server on gsm coverage on the rear end nine piezometric connections were connected to boards kept on either side of flow tank to measure hydraulic head distribution the conceptual diagram showing piezometric connections at rear end is given in fig 3 the porous media chosen for the experiment was clean quartz marine sand with a representative grain size d50 0 65 mm the grain size analysis showed that 75 of the grain size was between 0 4 and 0 85 mm with the coefficient of uniformity cu as 1 8 mm as the value is 4 soil is uniformly graded and the coefficient of curvature cc as 0 625 according to fetter 2001 the porous medium falls in medium sand category the porous media was filled as uniformly as possible visual inspection using a wet filling method the tank was saturated from below and placing of wet sand in layers of 10 cm depth was done from a height of 1 m so that air entrapment could be avoided compaction of porous media evenly with a tamping rod having a rubber based sole ensured uniform levelling seven cycles of saturating and desaturating the tank and re compaction for one week were then followed to ensure a natural consolidation the porosity of sand was then obtained in triplicate as 0 389 using the gravimetric method using these values the saturated fw hydraulic conductivity of the sand k was theoretically estimated using the kozeny carman equation and was found to be 0 302 cm s in situ estimation is regarded as a more appropriate method than the theoretical estimation of hydraulic conductivity oostrom et al 1992 and the same was adopted in this study a range of hydraulic gradients ranging from 0 003 to 0 022 was introduced by adjusting heads in side chambers and after achieving a steady state flow field in vertical as well as horizontal direction fw discharge were measured tank average value of saturated horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity using the darcy law were calculated as 0 294 cm s and 0 245 cm s respectively in the quantitative part of this investigation an isotropic value for k of 0 294 cm s was employed for each set of experiment 150 l of sw solution was made by mixing table salt in tap water in the ratio of 200 g in 1l and was utilized for the entire experimentation the densities of fw and sw were measured using pycnometer and came close to 1 g cm3 and 1 026 g cm3 respectively at 27 c throughout the entire course of experimentation measurements were done to ensure the density value remained constant in order to track the movement of the sw a conservative tracer rhodamine b 500 dye c28h31cln2o3 mol wt 479 02 g mol was mixed in the ratio of 500 mg to 1l of prepared salt solution prior to start of the experiment sorption experiments were performed to monitor the adsorption of rhodamine b to porous medium concentration levels were checked using a ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies cary 100 series uv vis limiting resolution 0 189 nm wavelength range 190 900 nm and the result indicated that concentration level remains same as of the initial value proving non adsorbance of tracer on to porous medium throughout the experiment the salinity of the sw input was kept constant at 37 g l the salinity of fw measured close to 100 mg l and was adopted for calculation a waterproof conductivity meter cc401 with elmetron conductivity cell was used to monitor influx salinity and measure discharge salinity a temperature sensor ct2b 121 a platinum resistor probe with pt 1000b resistor in the range of measurement 0 to 100 c the tolerance error not exceeding 0 8 c was also connected to the conductivity meter so that automatic temperature compensation was applied to measured salinity a dark thick curtain was placed around the experimental setup to avoid day light reflection on the tank pane time lapse photo series were utilized for capturing the flow of sw using the canon xa11full hd camcorder 1920 1080 1 2 84 cmos sensor 20x hd zoom lens the camera was set up over a tripod and kept about 1 5 m from the front end of the sandbox and at a height of 1 5 m from floor level two flood lights wipro d913065 30 watts flood light cool day white square were kept in front of flow tank so that using light reflection technique information on transient nature of intrusion could be clearly captured 3 1 2 data collection methods the experimental preparations were done as explained earlier constant heads were maintained at h1 cm and h2 cm at the fw and sw reservoirs respectively once the flow stabilized maintaining the hydraulic gradient sw was allowed to enter from the right side of the constant head chamber keeping the required gradient varying from 0 003 to 0 022 and when considerable mixing of sw and fw occurred it started displacing the fw eventually colored sw invaded the porous medium a sw wedge started forming towards the bottom of the chamber the system evolved over time and sw wedge started moving towards the fw boundary the movement of this wedge was captured by camera and toe and height of intruded wedge were noted down with respect to elapsed time every 15 min also head measurements at 7 piezometric points and constant head chambers were monitored every 15 min throughout the experiment the fw moving horizontally from the left chamber and discharging to seawater chamber is instantly removed through an outlet salinity and temperature of the discharged water were measured every 15 min multiple measurements were made to ensure the constancy in the value of sw influx 3 1 3 experimental design the set of values for all parameters used in the experiment were adopted by considering the representative values for coastal aquifer settings smith 2004 abarca et al 2007 werner et al 2009 as given in table 2 in this study 7 sets of experiments with varying hydraulic gradient were carried out as shown in table 1 and when net increase in toe advancement was 2 it s safe to believe that the system was near steady state at that stage 3 1 4 experimental results the mixing zone variables examined in the study are illustrated in the conceptual diagram fig 4 given below in this figure qs and qf represents saltwater and fresh water influx and q s and q f corresponding discharges ltoe is the length from the seaside boundary to the point where 50 isochlor touches the base and wmz is the width of the mixing zone the inward fw flux qf has a significant effect in flattening the slope of the sw wedge formed and hence it is taken as an independent variable and varied between 0 0417 15 ml per minute to 0 2778 100 ml per minute cm2 s to accommodate the flux range according to the objective of the study as expected with increase in the fw flow rates the toe of intrusion moved to the sw side pushing the sw wedge towards the sw chamber comparison of steady state toe positions for the various freshwater flux conditions obtained during the experiment study are shown in fig 5 a g below visual inspection of the sw wedge revealed more dilution near the mid of the interface when compared to the toe and tip of the wedge the mixing across the interface flattens the density gradient and the dilution is more pronounced towards the interface s midpoint during the process of achieving equilibrium the shape of sw wedge is significant as it is determined by the relative value of velocity of fw and sw along the corresponding interface region darcy s law implies that an increase in qf k increases the required head gradient for a given fw flux in our study with k held constant the gradient increased from 30 43 to 32 22 when qf was increased from 0 0417 to 0 2778 cm2 s for steady state wedges thereby increasing the head gradient for an increase in fw flux the thickness of the aquifer with fw flow decreased towards the sw boundary which increased velocity near the boundary for the boundary layer solution the coordinate positions observed in the steady state salt wedge positions were delineated and the thickness of fw flow along the interface is the value of k as calculated using eq 7 and is displayed in fig 5 a g corresponding to each fw flux 3 2 design of numerical method we used seawat version 4 to reproduce experimentally obtained wedges which incorporates the codes modflow 2000 and mt3dms version 5 2 seawat is regarded as a standard code for modelling density dependent ground water flow and transport guo and langevin 2002 a two dimensional vertical cross section with grids of dimensions 0 5 cm 0 2 cm 304 cells in the x direction and 218 cells in the z direction was chosen to represent the sand tank discretization was done according to the criteria given by voss and souza 1987 for simulating a thin transition zone a consistent finer grid size of 0 4 cm in both directions was used at first for discretization because the wmz value is very sensitive to the grid resolution used for modelling a finer 0 2 cm size is selected for vertical spacing the quantitative comparison of ltoe and wmz did not differ by more than 5 we ran test simulations to evaluate the model s convergence and concluded that a grid size of 0 5 cm 0 2 cm is best for reproducing this experimental flow tank the left upper corner of the simulated tank was chosen as the origin of the cartesian coordinate system top layer was modelled as confined to represent it as a no flow boundary fw head at the left boundary was varied from 44 cm to 46 8 cm successively for the 7 set of simulations as shown in table 1 whereas the sw head was kept fixed at 43 5 cm for all simulations the value of specific storage was set as 10 6cm 1 the value of transverse dispersivity obtained by comparing paster s solution with experimental results has been used for all simulations the longitudinal dispersivity was determined by fitting the experimentally observed toe of the wedge with the model s predicted value through trial and error concentration of saltwater cs was taken as 0 037 g cm3 and that of freshwater cf was assumed to be nil total variation diminishing tvd package was utilized for modelling advection and fully implicit conditions were taken for dispersion also for intermodal density calculation upstream weighted algorithm was used 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation bl solution for dispersive entrainment was compared with experimentally recorded discharges to the saltwater boundary for various freshwater fluxes here dispersive entrainment refers to the amount of saltwater entrained in freshwater saltwater transition zone for a steady and stable lighter freshwater above heavier saltwater flow system in an aquifer at steady state the amount of water entrained will be the same as that discharged along the outflow face to represent the relative influence of changes in freshwater flux on saltwater discharge in a dimensionless manner it is expressed as discharge ratio 4 1 1 discharge ratio the discharge ratio dimensionless discharge for increasing fw flux predicted by the bl solution and that calculated from experimental data are illustrated in fig 6 discharge ratio is defined as the ratio between discharge of sw q s to discharge of fw q f expressed as mass flux discharge of sw represented the total accumulated sw entrained along the interface and outflowing through the seepage face the total discharge and salinity were measured as explained in section 3 1 2 and amount of saltwater discharge was calculated using the eq 11 it showed an improved decreasing trend for low values of dimensionless fw flux and thereafter a somewhat stable trend for higher values of fw flux the dispersive flux was contributing to achieve the static equilibrium when a 0 5 demonstrating dominance of free convection in the system the published results up to a 0 5 of paster and dagan 2007 were used to compile the analytical data offered here for comparison the result reaffirms that the magnitude of marine discharge component of submarine groundwater discharge sgd should be greater than its terrestrial discharge component for buoyancy dominated system in paster and dagan 2007 q s was taken as 0 05 and q f was varied with max taking values from 1 8 10 4 to 2 10 3 as could be interpreted from the trend shown in fig 6 experimental data was consistent with the bl solution upto a 0 5 the percentage deviation of the discharge ratio value i e bl solution experimental was determined for all cases up to a 0 5 and was 6 96 percent also the nash and sutcliffe index was used to make quantitative comparisons the index was defined as nash and sutcliffe 1970 e 1 i 1 n q i o q i m 2 i 1 n q i o q i o 2 where e denotes the efficiency of the model n the number of data points q o the experimentally obtained discharge flux ratio q m the analytically predicted discharge ratio and q i o the average value of experimental discharge flux ratio a value of 1 points out a perfect match between the observed and predicted whereas 0 denotes the observed values are near to the average value the model efficiency coefficient for the present study for a up to 0 5 was 0 983 this value indicated that the bl solution could simulate sw entrainment with reasonable accuracy further to know the agreement between measured experimental and calculated bl values for saltwater discharge bland altman difference plot method was employed altman and bland 1983 the plot shown below in fig 7 illustrates the difference between the methods on the vertical axis against the best estimate of the experimental value on the horizontal axis the standard error came to 0 4 for intercept and 7 for the slope the bias value is 0 008 and is within the 95 confidence interval this proves the acceptance of the bl method for all the sets of fw flux values considered in the study by correlating the fw discharge values measured experimentally and that calculated analytically the vertical transverse dispersivity value could be calculated from eq 5 the α t value was calculated for the different fw fluxes considered in this study which varied between 0 005 cm and 0 062 cm the average value being 0 03 cm abarca and prabhakar clement 2009 reported a transverse dispersion of 0 005 cm in their study which is consistent with our results it should be mentioned that the inverse pes was varied in the range of an order in paster and dagan s 2007 work which fits the results found in this study 4 1 2 velocity of entrainment after a reasonable match of total sw entrainment across the outflow face was achieved using the analytical bl approach the entrainment along distinct locations of interface was calculated using bl solutions velocity of entrainment is the rate at which fw draws sw through the contact and it is governed by the dilution we hypothesize here that the salinity of this entrained water is correlated to the percentage of sw circulation psc and hence for each of the fw flux rates the next step in the analysis was to estimate the velocity of entrainment along the characteristic length which could be defined as the inclined distance between the toe of intrusion ltoe and tip of wedge zmax calculated along the slope of interface the discharge ratio represented the quantification of saline circulation smith 2004 the steady state interface for the 7 experiments analyzed were drawn after acquiring the interface coordinates through visual inspection of the picture of the sw wedge after determining the slope it was non dimensionalized by dividing it by the dimensionless distance to the toe xf the sw entrainment q ds along each point of interface was found using the eq 5 after incorporating the value of k as given by eq 7 and depicted in fig 8 the result indicated the general trend as well as individual variation across the interface segments the overall pattern of the result obtained was similar to the trend seen in fig 6 for maximum discharge ratio the discharge ratio increases throughout a wide range for low recharge fluxes buoyancy dominating whereas a modest but consistent increase was found for high recharge fluxes balance regime at steady state greater sw influx than fw flow was attributable to the wide range which is especially pronounced towards the sw boundary increase in velocity due to variation in pressure gradient depending on the hydraulic conductivity the sw disperses longitudinally to a larger area as visible by the toe of the interface whereas the spread is limited in the transverse direction due to fw flushing the discharge ratio is rather constant along the contact when a is greater than 0 55 for a smaller than 0 5 the trend of these graphs matched that of paster and dagan 2007 more sw got diluted as fw recharge was increased resulting in more spreading and macroscopic mixing leading to a high transverse dispersivity value this proved that entrainment of sw was predominant for low fw flux recharge regimes specifically a system in which buoyancy flux dominanted over advective flux hence we could infer here that for bl solution a modified sharp interface approach could be satisfactorily used to represent such a system 4 1 3 width of mixing zone wmz physically measuring the mixing zone from the experimentally observed wedge proved to be difficult due to the lateral spread transverse dispersion being of the order of a few mm as a result this variable could not be directly compared to the experimental values the width of the mixing zone wmz was calculated as a function of k for all of the fw flow rates investigated by substituting the value of α t in eq 6 represented by the black circle in fig 9 also to recover the characteristic properties it is made dimensionless by dividing wmz by the fw thickness ζ represented as star in fig 9 fig 9 shows the width of the mixing zone for a 0 13 to a 0 84 at various distances from the seawater boundary we could see that the graph s spread is more pronounced up to a 0 5 beyond which there is only a slight change this could be due to higher buoyancy causing more dispersion longitudinally than laterally the largest wmz was achieved at or near the outflow face as expected because the region s velocity is high and fw flow converged into a narrow zone the computed horizontal velocity from the total discharge ranged from 0 167 cm s to 0 083 cm s at the outflow the dimensionless wmz value exceeded 0 2 to 0 4 near the outflow face whereas it rarely exceeded 0 2 in the toe and center areas because of the higher velocity flux there would be a decrease in pressure at pores causing sw to spread more quickly high transverse dispersion along the outflow face increasing wmz as a result in that region of the interface the linear correlation between density and flux which is a key assumption in the bl method will no longer be valid the maximum wmz near the tip of the interface is recalculated by truncating the values where the value exceeded 0 2 and plotted in fig 10 as a function of dimensionless fw flux as seen from the graph the adjusted maximum wmz doubles as the rate of fw flux increases this could be attributed to reduced density contrast which causes more dispersion to locate the boundary layer and to gain understanding of relative contribution of sw suction and dilution eq 9 and eq 10 were employed to the modified wmz values and is shown in fig 10 the δ u denotes the rate of exchange between the bl and the fw body where as δ l denotes the salt water suction when the fw flow rate is increased the spread of entrained water tends to increase accelerating the dilution the trend of increasing transverse dispersion value with increased rate of fw flux reflects the same the salinity of discharged water decreased from 35 7 to 17 g cm3 with an increase in fw rates this logically supports the statement that the dilution has increased with the fw flow with balanced flow there is only a slight increase in the wmz value smith 2004 also reported a similar pattern stating that the contribution of fw convective velocity to recirculation is negligible 4 2 numerical model results in the subsequent paragraphs we employ the numerical model to conduct simulations and the validated bl solution to compare the effect of fw convective velocity on sw circulation rate as well as the influence of dispersive entrainment on ltoe the discussion here is implied based on the observations and analysis of the sw wedge variables obtained by numerically simulating and comparing it with the experimental counterparts once the steady state is established the numerical simulation employs the transverse dispersivity values derived from the validated bl solution 4 2 1 sw influx further analysing the results the variation of sw influx qs at steady state was compared with fw influx for a 0 13 to a 0 84 the initial value corresponds to α t 0 the results obtained are shown below in fig 11 the general trend from the results revealed that with an increase in fw flux sw flux also increases this was evident for both numerical and experimental results same pattern was reported by pool et al 2011 for fw flux a 0 5 a significant increase in qs was observed which gradually acquired a constant value when a took the value greater than 0 5 for a 0 5 more sw was drawn to attain equilibrium than at a greater than 0 5 here equilibrium denotes the balance between advective flow due to hydraulic gradient and dispersive flux due to density variations when fw influx was little or might be fairly expected to be nil the system was filled with sw preventing any additional qs as could be seen from the graph s beginning point a non monotonic correlation was discovered while comparing fw and sw influxes the value obtained through numerical simulation outweighs the experimental values it may be due to the assumed constant concentration at the sw boundary condition 4 2 2 length of intrusion fig 12 compares the experimental and numerical wedge geometries in terms of ltoe and zmax the geometry matched extremely well for a up to 0 5 however there was a significant discrepancy for a greater than 0 5 this demonstrates the broad acceptance of computed α t up to a 0 5 when fw recharge is minimal dispersive entrainment in the homogeneous aquifer is low allowing for considerable wedge intrusion one of the approximations of the bl solution is that it is suitable to sharp interface problems where the length of intrusion exceeds the aquifer thickness eg regional scale model for a greater than 0 5 the dispersion effect is strong and diluting water in the mixing zone reduces the density difference resulting in more marine discharge to the sw boundary and a shorter duration of intrusion the effect of buoyancy on marine discharge must be carefully analyzed and adopted in the next section as it will affect a value that specifies the position of the wedge s toe 4 2 3 saltwater discharge at the outflow face qs as inferred from the preceding section 4 2 the decrease in ltoe with increasing a could be associated with a concomitant increase of discharge towards the sw boundary to determine the consistency of the results leading to the interpretation of the exclusive sw component in marine discharge we first compared the measured experimental qs with the validated bl solution numerical model and modified ghyben herzberg method using pool and carrera 2011 empirical correction factor all the three methods utilized the same α t value the results obtained using eq 5 was drawn under bl solution and experimental values were measured as described in the section 3 1 2 were plotted further flow rates measured from the simulated numerical model using the method described in section 3 3 were obtained and plotted also the empirical correction term for density difference factor in terms of α t to incorporate the effects of mixing for a broad range of conditions devised by pool and carrera 2011 was utilised the equation could be written as 1 α t d 1 6 where ρ s ρ f ρ f and d is the thickness of the aquifer model the α t obtained for different freshwater flow rates by validating the model was utilised to estimate the modified density difference factor subsequently by modifying a and incorporating the same in the equation for length of intrusion the discharge of sw towards the sw boundary was calculated and plotted the length of intrusion was calculated from the relation l gh d 1 2 a where a is defined in section 2 qs obtained using the different methods is illustrated below in fig 13 which will give an idea about the influence of convective velocity on dispersive entrainment overall the results show an increasing trend for saltwater discharge with a the sw discharge qs calculated using pool s empirical factor exceeded the experimental value by 28 for a 0 13 and by 20 for a 0 84 this variation could be attributed to the fact that the empirical factor was decided based on the results obtained in numerical method and is more suitable for broad transition zones numerical results were derived with the same α l but with validated α t values for a 0 13 the difference of 6 3 is observed where as it increases up to 14 for a 0 84 the α l values were varied and assessed but the simulation result of q s q f remained the same moreover the constant concentration boundary was assigned to saltwater boundary which may have an influence on the discharge value as seen from the fig 13 bl values matched up with the experimentally observed ones reasonably up to a 0 5 thereafter it took stable trend the variation of the dispersive entrainment with respect to the dimensionless freshwater flux was plotted earlier to account for the mixing the variation with respect to seepage also needs to be compared towards this aim the variation of marine discharge calculated using numerical experimental and bl method from the sharp interface solution ghyben herzberg equation considered here was plotted and compared for different seepage peclet number and is illustrated in fig 14 the variation was comparable for numerical and bl solutions corresponding to a 0 5 buoyancy flux whereas it shows high variation for balanced flows same α t was used for all the three methods it could be concluded that α t value obtained by comparing experimentally and analytically bl solution obtained maximum discharge ratio gives accurate results up to a 0 5 i e for buoyancy flow regime thereafter there is a profound variation this proves that the bl theory could be satisfactorily extends the sharp interface solution up to a 0 5 for evaluating thin diffused interfaces while providing a preliminary accurate approximation 4 2 4 saline circulation the percentage of saline circulation psc as defined by smith 2004 is the ratio of components of marine discharge i e sw to fw represented as a percentage smith 2004 estimated the influence of a and pes on seawater circulation in his research his analysis was restricted to pes of 200 in this study his work was extended to higher order pes for the maximum outflow discharge psc was found out for all the fw rate and is plotted in fig 15 from a 0 1 to a 0 5 the graph shows a decreasing trend and from a 0 5 onwards the values reach a steady trend the decreasing trend supports the bl solution and smith s 2004 findings from the average value of transverse dispersivity pes were calculated for all the fw flow rates considered in this study pes decreased with an increase in the mean pore water velocity the values obtained varied from 9635 to 700 which affirms a linear dependence of transverse dispersivity on pes as shown in the graph in fig 16 psc exhibited a decreasing trend with pes the interaction between flow and a porous medium increased dispersion processes within the pores which enhanced mass flux transfer across the sharp interface a mild decrease in the pes after 0 5 could be observed from the graph this could be due to the increased dispersion contributing to enhanced mixing of fw and sw reducing the effect of buoyant forces following smith 2004 the combined effect of a and pes was realized into a constant defined here as saline circulation number scn and the variation of scn is plotted with psc in fig 17 the integral effect shows a decreasing trend with psc varying from 1054 to 229 corresponding to a 0 13 and a 0 84 respectively the maximum value of psc for smith was 180 for type a boundary to 280 for type b boundary see section 5 3 of smith 2004 for description of the types of boundary according to him the dispersion function is fitted by the relation b pes c for dispersion parameters up to 120 with b and c values of 3 and 0 3 respectively in our investigation b and c were calculated to be 4 4 and 0 5 respectively the higher value of 1054 obtained in our study is due to buoyant forces suppressing the dispersion within the pore spaces the buoyant force gets weakened with higher rates of fw flow enhancing transverse dispersion and hence the psc reduced to 229 for a 0 84 4 3 practical implications of buoyancy the result obtained in the present study signifies the effect of buoyancy on the salinization mechanism in the coastal aquifer in order to have a quantitative comparison the mixing zone variables sw entrainment and wmz must be compared between the buoyancy dominated a 0 13 lower α t and advection dispersion balanced a 0 84 higher α t regimes the entrained sw denotes the dispersive flux which is the result of deviations of actual velocity from the average ground water velocity at pore scales owing to density gradient the wmz represents the physical range of spreading and mixing for buoyancy dominated regime the sw entrainment per unit width accounts to 0 0329 cm2 s and for balanced regime it accounts to 0 0286 cm2 s this suggests that there is a variation of 13 for dispersive entrainment for the two types of regimes as described earlier psc value varied between 1054 and 229 the percentage difference accounts to 78 it could be concluded with the above obtained data that even for the 13 increase in dispersive entrainment there is a decrease in convective saline circulation by 78 this is a very important finding that even without considering the heterogeneity of porous media or hydraulic stress caused by pumping rates or tidal forces the individual contribution of buoyancy force to circulation rate is non trivial further the dimensionless wmz for the buoyancy dominated and the balanced regime are 0 0580 and 0 1380 respectively for the sake of practical understanding the wmz is considered to be comprised of two parts sw suction and dilution for buoyancy dominated regime the sw suction of the wmz is 0 0242 and for balanced regime it is 0 0559 the percentage of sw suction for buoyancy and balanced regimes is 41 7 and 40 5 and for dilution part it accounts to 58 3 and 59 49 respectively the result shows not much variation which supports the linearity of density with flux across the mixing zone which is a prime assumption in bl solution this quantitatively proves the validity of bl solution in the buoyancy dominated higher pes aquifer regime it is to be noted that the modified wmz was calculated after truncating the values near the outflow face where a high velocity gradient existed the present work qualitatively discussed sw entrainment across transition zone which is spread upwards and advected sideways by the horizontal fw flux and discharges to sw boundary in a boundary layer perspective it was quantified as the displacement thickness which is accounted for by the non linear displacement of flow owing to buoyancy causing a decrease in velocity the non linearity in flow is due to the dependence of α t on freshwater convective velocity this non linear behavior is different and should not be confused with the mass and solute transfer in non newtonian fluids where shear thinning plays a dominant role aldabesh et al 2020 chu et al 2020 farooq et al 2020 khan and alzahrani 2020 li et al 2021 nayak et al 2021 song et al 2021 the bl solution is intended for an aquifer with a stable homogenous geological formation in steady state conceptually flow and transport in a confined aquifer where the flow field and seawater wedge are in equilibrium by stable aquifer it is meant that the saltwater component of marine outflow is significantly less than the freshwater inflow which is feasible when the aquifer is not sensitive to human activities such as pumping time dependent problems bl solutions are restricted to homogeneous aquifers with constant conductivity values since they are based on a constant velocity potential cross flow produced by density variation in layered aquifers cannot be represented with the bl solution currently being studied it is particularly applicable to regional aquifers when the length of intrusion is greater than the thickness of the aquifer i e a domainwhere the impact of solute advection as a salt transport mechanism is substantially greater than the effective longitudinal dispersion though the field aquifers are heterogeneous in nature in many coastal areas where totally sandy aquifers exist and too much heterogeneity is not present the bl solution can be used for various assessment and design paster 2010 for instance used the bl solution to estimate transverse dispersivity for the 6000 km2 yarkon taninim aquifer which is fairly heterogeneous fractured and has a large transport scale his investigation revealed a result of 0 04 m fiori and dagan 1999 reported values of transverse pore scale dispersivities of 0 5 mm for cape cod and 0 44 mm for the borden site it is possible to use the bl solution in situations when the transverse effect of the pore scale dispersion is predominant in the vertical direction 5 conclusions in the present study experimental investigations using sand tank were performed to validate the bl solution to better comprehend the narrower mixing zone dynamics in coastal seawater intrusion problems the bl solution is adopted here because it is one of the unique solutions that considers exclusively small transverse dispersivity and a narrow mixing zone similar to the present experimental setting this study is distinctive in that it estimates the transverse dispersivity without having to determine the longitudinal dispersivity the bl solution especially applicable for peclet number of the order o 103 is compared with the observed thin transition zone in a laboratory sand tank the discharge seeping into the sw chamber integrated measure of sw entrainment was compared with the analytical solution for the dimensionless maximum sw discharge the agreement gave the confirmation to deduce transverse dispersivity for each fw flux which is assumed as the average value along the characteristic length slope of interface subsequently other transition zone variables such as wmz velocity of sw entrainment along the slope of the interface were calculated based on these average value of transverse dispersivity we investigated the effect of varying fw flux recharge on these variables the interpretations of mixing and spreading along the thin transition zone are further extended using the laboratory experiments in this study to know the integrated effects of varying fw flux and modest transverse dispersion on saline recirculation in a coastal aquifer following are the important conclusions from the study for a buoyancy flux dominated system with a 0 5 and for peclet number pes of the order 103 where the length of the intrusion is greater than the thickness of aquifer bl solution gives fairly accurate results and could be adopted with reasonable accuracy to find dispersive entrainment in the system the value of transverse dispersivity varied from 0 005 cm to 0 062 cm for the freshwater recharge flux considered in this study for the whole stretch of the interface the wmz calculated by bl approach was satisfactory with experimental results showing the same trend though the accuracy was much better in the center zone of the sharp interface near the outflow face the dimensionless wmz value was greater than 0 2 to 0 4 while it was rarely greater than 0 2 in the toe and central regions increased wmz would result from the increased velocity flux producing a decrease in pressure at pores which would allow sw to spread rapidly high transverse dispersion over the outflow face for a 0 5 buoyancy dominated regime the spread of entrained water tends to increase accelerating the dilution whereas 0 5 a 1 balanced regime contribution of fw convective velocity to recirculation increases marginally there is a substantial contribution of buoyancy force to the rate of saline circulation the buoyant force suppresses the dispersion for very low fw recharge conditions while on the contrary upon increasing fw flow rates more spreading enhances dilution resulting in decreasing the pes the influence of buoyant force increases saline circulation which eventually has a negative impact on the system s stability the present results reaffirm that the mixing in the zone needs to be quantified to know the transport process within the wedge which would captivate nutrient and contamination circulation causing a direct impact to coastal life near the shore also the long term density driven circulation is important while quantifying the sgd and for mass balance calculations in the coastal areas before attempting any aquifer management solutions like recharge wells or mitigation strategies like pumping for desalination plants or subsurface barriers future studies may warrant the time dependent evolution of dispersive entrainment and its influence on the convective saline circulation the system s time dependent response must be characterised in order to determine the respective contributions of longitudinal and transverse dispersion in wedge evolution a further numerical analysis would provide more knowledge on the mixing and dispersion of the sw flux during the evolution process and the combined influence of α l and α t on length of intrusion needs to be assessed the simple homogeneous aquifer considered in this study needs to be extended in order to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity on the outcomes credit authorship contribution statement dhanya narayanan

2508,in saltwater intrusion problems of coastal regions the dynamics of narrower mixing zones are influenced by the amount of dispersive entrainment and its associated marine discharges modelling low fresh water recharge and high peclet number scenarios gives inaccurate results with the available methods in this study the physical accuracy of the bl solution provided by paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 for such conditions is validated for discharge at outflow face and width of mixing zone wmz with experimentally created datasets and further extended with numerical analysis to quantify the influence of dispersive entrainment on marine discharge and saline circulation by comparing the measured and estimated saltwater outflows the average transverse dispersion for all dimensionless freshwater flux rates a was calculated and it ranged from 0 005 cm to 0 062 cm the study showed that for buoyancy dominated high peclet number flow circumstances the boundary layer solutions can be effectively used to predict the marine discharges up to a 0 5 the combined effects of water flux and dispersion revealed that buoyant force has a considerable impact on the rate of saline circulation as it suppresses the dispersion the findings lend credence to simplicity of the boundary layer solution in reducing numerical model convergence issues for field problems caused by low recharge and low

length and height of saltwater wedge at steady state 1 introduction the mixing zone is regarded as a characteristic feature of any coastal aquifer ecosystem and has received considerable attention in the recent times lu and werner 2013 ahmed 2017 zamora et al 2017 rozos et al 2021 the flow dynamics of this zone need to be known before adopting any aquifer management solutions as it has implications on lateral intrusion of seawater into the coastal aquifer phenomenally described in the form of a wedge this wedge acts as a convection cell and is driven by the net effect of the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer head and the seawater head forced convection and density difference between freshwater fw and seawater free convection through this mixing zone seawater is entrained by outflowing fw further diluting the intruded seawater which eventually contributes as a substantial component of subsurface groundwater discharge sgd the location of this mixing zone influenced by aforementioned causes are often predicted either by sharp interface neglecting mixing or by diffused interface approach considering hydrodynamic dispersion causing mixing this diffused interface method employs iterative numerical techniques to simulate the cyclic nonlinear coupling effect of flow and transport which has been demonstrated to be inexact for thin mixing zones in this study therefore the applicability of boundary layer bl solution to such issues is investigated the process and factors affecting the evolution of the mixing zone and the movement of solutes have been investigated by many researchers abarca et al 2007 bear 1979 chang and clement 2013 oz et al 2015 smith 2004 the width of the mixing zone wmz is the result of coaction of parameters like mechanical dispersion diffusion groundwater discharge and density contrast between the fluids groundwater discharge through the outflow face is influenced by the relative amount of fresh and saltwater sw influxes which is characterised by dimensionless fw flux a it denotes the dominance of advective flux relative to the buoyancy density driven flux if the value of a 1 it will be advection dominated and if a 1 it will be a buoyancy dominated both smith 2004 and abarca et al 2007 posited the significance of quantifying sw flux for velocity dependent dispersion studies smith 2004 carried out a detailed numerical analysis on the mixed convection process and he introduced a single non dimensional recirculation number to incorporate the factors controlling the relative amounts of seawater and terrestrial fw in sgd he further asserted that mixing at the transition zone is effected by aquifer dispersivities which in turn had a strong dependence on convective overturn i e caused due to circulation of sw flux abarca et al 2007 claimed the wmz as a relevant measuring parameter to derive field values of dispersivity their study revealed the contribution of transverse dispersivity in broadening the concentration profile and increasing the slope of the interface whereas that of longitudinal dispersivity was to displace high concentration isolines towards the seaside pool and carrera 2011 incorporated transverse dispersivity in the sw density term and modified strack s single valued potential solution to account for mixing and came up with an empirically corrected equation for the depth of interface the circulation flow patterns within the mixing zone were explored in detail by oz et al 2015 they divided mixing zone into the dispersive region and flow rotation region based on the physical processes of salt transport occurring there and quantified the relative width of two regions for a range of transverse dispersivities they also expressed the significant sensitivity of the flow rotation region on transverse dispersivity the previous studies have elucidated the role of dispersion in mixing and in the evolution of a convective recirculation cell with transverse dispersion dominating once the system has reached equilibrium and is in a steady flow mode in some field aquifers the continuity between sea and aquifer may be reduced due to geographical features such as rocks so that horizontal transmissivity may be considerably less whenever fw recharge is low or pumping is high in an arid aquifer the volume of fw flow through the aquifer is substantially decreased and fw outflow to the sea is reduced the transition zones formed in such case would be thin compared to the horizontal extent of aquifer and value of transverse dispersivity α t would be small as fw velocity will be less the system could be considered then as a buoyancy flux dominated system paster and dagan 2007 reported field values of α t surprisingly low as 0 5 mm to 32 mm and extended their approach to determine a regional scale value to be 40 mm in paster 2010 previous sw intrusion studies conducted in laboratory aquifers also showed a thin mixing layer where the values of longitudinal dispersivity α l in such cases are often found to vary from 0 1 mm to 2 mm goswami and clement 2007 jakovovic et al 2011 and α t would be taken in the range of 1 5 to 1 400 of α l smith 2004 the mixing of fresh and sw is quantified by a dimensionless quantity called the seepage peclet number pes and is defined as l α t where l denotes the thickness of aquifer for thin transition zones described above pes vary in the order of 103 104 in the present study the scope is limited to the mixing due to this small dispersivity dispersive entrainment as well as its related brackish discharge and saline circulation in the thin mixing zone once the saline wedge has achieved the steady state sharp interface based analytic solutions were commonly applied to compute the lateral extent of wedges in coastal aquifers but since it overlooked the role of dispersion in mixing and the formation of a convective recirculation cell it overestimated the length of sw intrusion the available variable density flow and transport numerical models incorporate both advection and dispersion and are successful in simulating broad transition zones in this regard voss and souza 1987 warned about inconsistent approximations in the calculation of flow velocity and provided modifications in the numerical approach while representing narrow transition zones and modelling the effects of low transverse dispersivity the low dispersivity values that generally account for the laboratory results are adopted by fitting model simulation results with the experimental values like matching the point at the x axis where the 50 isochlor line touches this is a tedious process and demands a number of trial and error simulations also it is often difficult to simulate low dispersion data using numerical models due to considerable convergence difficulties younes and fahs 2014 the attempts to quantify mixing using phenomenological bl approximation for stratified flows with thin interface were made by many researchers dagan 1971 rubin 1983 van duijn and peletier 1992 specifically paster and dagan 2007 2008a 2008b undertook and published research devoted to estimating mixing layer variables for non uniform fw flow scenarios associated with seawater intrusion by augmenting the sharp interface solution with the bl approximation further to it a focus on a generaliszed description of the method with application to a real field aquifer was demonstrated by paster 2010 and the same solution was adopted in the present study the mathematical solution developed by paster and dagan 2007 2008a 2008b on the theoretical basis has not been verified so far with experimental measurements in addition it has not been investigated for how much the discharge to the saltwater boundary varies when dispersive entrainment is considered for pes values of order 103 or greater to the authors knowledge there have been no such studies for saline circulation rate comparing buoyancy and balanced flow regimes using experimental datasets to address the aforementioned challenges the following are the objectives of the present study 1 to validate the boundary layer solution of paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 using experimental datasets for establishing the relationship between fw recharge and sw entrainment for the thin transition zone 2 employ the validated model to derive the value of α t and quantify mixing zone variables such as velocity of entrainment through mixing zone wmz and saline circulation within the fw sw interface and 3 recreate the laboratory experiments using a numerical model compare the model results to the measured discharges and subsequently examine the influence of dispersive entrainment on marine discharge and saline circulation to generate the experimental datasets a variable density aquifer with steady flow is developed analogous to conditions assumed by paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 where transverse dispersivity will be holding diminutive values specifically 7 experiments were designed to evaluate the thickness of the mixing zone and rate of sw entrainment subject to different fw flow rates the sw wedges were continuously monitored to ensure that consistent influxes were maintained until they reached a steady state all the variables both experimental and numerical considered in the analyses correspond to the steady state through this study we try to investigate how the fw convective velocity influences the sw circulation rate and how the dispersive entrainment exclusively contributes to the discharge at the outflow face 2 mathematical model in this section the governing equation of steady groundwater flow and theoretical solution derived in paster and dagan 2007 and paster 2010 hereinafter referred to as bl solution specifically for low transverse dispersion are briefly described the emphasis is on modelling a thin mixing layer under steady state conditions the study examined a vertical cross section of a coastal aquifer in a stable density stratification i e where fw flows above the sw body resulting in saltwater intrusion a mixing layer develops between the two water bodies which is thin when compared to the thickness of aquifer where a density gradient exists between the fw and sw two processes control mixing between sw and fw at the interface upward advection of fw driven by the hydraulic gradient and dispersion of sw downward from the sw boundary the basic equations that are used to simulate density driven flow through a porous medium are conservation of momentum darcy s law conservation of fluid mass conservation of solute and equation of state these equations took the form as given below bear 1979 paster and dagan 2007 abarca et al 2007 smith 2004 1 q κ μ p ρ g 2 ρ q 0 3 c q d c 4 ρ ρ f 1 c c s where q is the specific discharge p is the pressure ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration vector κ is the permeability isotropic of the porous medium μ is the coefficient of viscosity of fresh water c is the fluid salt concentration c s that in seawater and d is the dispersion tensor the density difference ratio ρ s ρ f ρ f relates fluid density to fluid salt concentration as given in eq 4 the boundary layer solution simplifies the mixing problem by retaining only the dominant terms in flow and transport equations the assumptions considered while formulating the bl equations include the linear correlation of density and concentration negligible variations of viscosity and boussinesq s approximation density variations are negligible in the mass conservation of water which are logically correct for weak concentrations such as seawater freshwater mixing zone also the aquifer is conceptualized as homogeneous and isotropic for seawater intrusion problems with meagre transverse dispersion sharp interface equations were generalized to a layered flow where the interaction between flow and density is included the vertical transit of sw through the interface is represented by a velocity dependent dispersion tensor transverse dispersion times the fw flux the detailed step by step derivation of bl equations can be found in paster and dagan 2007 paster 2010 and is not listed here the solution of bl equations for total entrainment of sw along a certain area of the interface q s and thickness of the transition layer δ z in terms of a are 5 q s 2 α t 1 2 β ψ s 1 ψ s 2 k s ψ s 1 2 d ψ s 6 δ z 5 84 α t 1 2 ζ k s ψ s 1 2 where k s ψ s is an auxiliary constant and is given by 7 k s ψ s 0 s 1 ζ 2 d s which denotes the fw discharge along the interface flowing out through the seepage face to the sw boundary ζ represents fw body thickness s representing the distance along the interface and ψ s 1 ψ s 2 denoting sw inflow along certain area of interface stream function these equations are for a generalized 3d problem and this dispersive entrainment could be interpreted as flow due to displacement thickness for the case of 2d seawater intrusion problem in a confined aquifer paster and dagan 2007 had given the value of k in terms of dimensionless fw flux a as 8 k ϕ 0 1 a arcsinh ϕ 0 1 a arcsinh 1 a where ϕ 0 is the specific discharge potential which will take value between 0 to 1 a along the bl the dimensionless freshwater flux a q f k b q f k b is the viscous force and is the density difference factor buoyancy force abarca et al 2007 the flux profile above the sharp interface was approximated using a fourth order polynomial f ζ 2 ζ 2 ζ 3 ζ 4 and a constant β shear friction factor with a value of 0 343 was adopted to visualize the relative position of bl edges as δ l and δ u the limits of thickness of transition zone layer as given in eq 2 the distance from the sharp interface to these limits is computed as given below paster and dagan 2007 9 δ u δ j 10 δ l δ 1 j where j 0 1 f 2 ζ d ζ whose value when applied to flux profile would be 367 630 these equations were applied to generate curves for different values of a up to 0 5 as this range characterized the flatness of the interface with meagre transverse dispersion hence it is obvious that by matching the sw discharge measured experimentally to its computed value this method could be used to find the average value of α t for a buoyancy flux dominated system after delineating the sharp interface obtained experimentally the auxiliary constant k s ψ s could be determined via numerical quadrature the boundary layer analytical solution is restricted to a 0 5 as one of our objectives is to compare the experimental result with the boundary layer analytical solution the values of the parameters in the present study were chosen in such a way that density flux is predominating in the system hence in this study a is taken as the independent variable and is varied between 0 13 and 0 84 the controlling variable is the sw flux and the measuring variables include total discharge and its salinity q s is made non dimensional by dividing the sw discharge with the fw discharge from the total discharge qt measured as outflow to the sw boundary and from its estimated salinity the discharge of sw could be calculated by the chloride mass balance

3 methodology 3 1 laboratory study 3 1 1 experimental setup towards achieving the primary goal experiments were conducted in a transparent rectangular flow tank with a porous medium chamber of length 150 cm and width 6 cm into which medium coarse sand was filled up to a height of 43 5 cm fig 1 the flow tank geometry was chosen such that it would produce a uniform ground water flow field with typical groundwater flow velocities for digitally capturing the evolution and movement of the transition zone the chamber exemplifies a two dimensional vertical cross section of a coastal aquifer in a longitudinal direction with a meagre third dimension to avoid deflection of side walls acrylic nails were drilled at a height of 60 cm well above the aquifer thickness so that flow was not obstructed during the experimentation the sand tank was constructed with a 12 mm thick acrylic sheet in front and a 15 mm at the rare end and two side chambers of length 10 cm each are for fresh water and other for sw which span on either side of it the three compartments were interconnected but the porous media were restrained in the middle chamber by placing a 90 µm mesh cover on the barrier this also prevented the clogging of sand at the outlets provided by maintaining a uniform continuous flow through them left and right side constant head chambers were 10 cm long and filled with fw and sw respectively the schematic diagram and a digital photograph along with accessories of the flow tank front view are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the two reservoirs were kept at a height of 2 5 m above the flow tank arrangement which were connected to two peristaltic pumps bt 600 mm 0 00166 870 ml min 6 4 mm id tubing cartridge to feed fw and sw to the two side chambers the inlets provided with rotameters 1 4 bspm top bottom rear with fine control valve ss 304 0 5 lpm acrylic body operating pressure 0 5 kg cm2 were connected from the downside of the tank to avoid gas formations entering the porous media so that fully saturated condition could be achieved during the experiment the heads in the fw and sw chambers are kept constant as h1 and h2 as given below by maintaining flow adjustable overflow outlets by controlling these head levels different fw discharge rates qdf and darcy fluxes qf were established table 1 shows the water heads inside chambers and the corresponding input fw flux into the chamber during the entire course of experiment water levels were measured accurately to 1 mm using capacitance level transmitters ss 316 probe rugged type with teflon lined which were kept submerged inside each of the side chambers these transmitters were connected to gsm module prysmato rdm quad band 900 mhz store and transmit readings to central server on gsm coverage on the rear end nine piezometric connections were connected to boards kept on either side of flow tank to measure hydraulic head distribution the conceptual diagram showing piezometric connections at rear end is given in fig 3 the porous media chosen for the experiment was clean quartz marine sand with a representative grain size d50 0 65 mm the grain size analysis showed that 75 of the grain size was between 0 4 and 0 85 mm with the coefficient of uniformity cu as 1 8 mm as the value is 4 soil is uniformly graded and the coefficient of curvature cc as 0 625 according to fetter 2001 the porous medium falls in medium sand category the porous media was filled as uniformly as possible visual inspection using a wet filling method the tank was saturated from below and placing of wet sand in layers of 10 cm depth was done from a height of 1 m so that air entrapment could be avoided compaction of porous media evenly with a tamping rod having a rubber based sole ensured uniform levelling seven cycles of saturating and desaturating the tank and re compaction for one week were then followed to ensure a natural consolidation the porosity of sand was then obtained in triplicate as 0 389 using the gravimetric method using these values the saturated fw hydraulic conductivity of the sand k was theoretically estimated using the kozeny carman equation and was found to be 0 302 cm s in situ estimation is regarded as a more appropriate method than the theoretical estimation of hydraulic conductivity oostrom et al 1992 and the same was adopted in this study a range of hydraulic gradients ranging from 0 003 to 0 022 was introduced by adjusting heads in side chambers and after achieving a steady state flow field in vertical as well as horizontal direction fw discharge were measured tank average value of saturated horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity using the darcy law were calculated as 0 294 cm s and 0 245 cm s respectively in the quantitative part of this investigation an isotropic value for k of 0 294 cm s was employed for each set of experiment 150 l of sw solution was made by mixing table salt in tap water in the ratio of 200 g in 1l and was utilized for the entire experimentation the densities of fw and sw were measured using pycnometer and came close to 1 g cm3 and 1 026 g cm3 respectively at 27 c throughout the entire course of experimentation measurements were done to ensure the density value remained constant in order to track the movement of the sw a conservative tracer rhodamine b 500 dye c28h31cln2o3 mol wt 479 02 g mol was mixed in the ratio of 500 mg to 1l of prepared salt solution prior to start of the experiment sorption experiments were performed to monitor the adsorption of rhodamine b to porous medium concentration levels were checked using a ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies cary 100 series uv vis limiting resolution 0 189 nm wavelength range 190 900 nm and the result indicated that concentration level remains same as of the initial value proving non adsorbance of tracer on to porous medium throughout the experiment the salinity of the sw input was kept constant at 37 g l the salinity of fw measured close to 100 mg l and was adopted for calculation a waterproof conductivity meter cc401 with elmetron conductivity cell was used to monitor influx salinity and measure discharge salinity a temperature sensor ct2b 121 a platinum resistor probe with pt 1000b resistor in the range of measurement 0 to 100 c the tolerance error not exceeding 0 8 c was also connected to the conductivity meter so that automatic temperature compensation was applied to measured salinity a dark thick curtain was placed around the experimental setup to avoid day light reflection on the tank pane time lapse photo series were utilized for capturing the flow of sw using the canon xa11full hd camcorder 1920 1080 1 2 84 cmos sensor 20x hd zoom lens the camera was set up over a tripod and kept about 1 5 m from the front end of the sandbox and at a height of 1 5 m from floor level two flood lights wipro d913065 30 watts flood light cool day white square were kept in front of flow tank so that using light reflection technique information on transient nature of intrusion could be clearly captured 3 1 2 data collection methods the experimental preparations were done as explained earlier constant heads were maintained at h1 cm and h2 cm at the fw and sw reservoirs respectively once the flow stabilized maintaining the hydraulic gradient sw was allowed to enter from the right side of the constant head chamber keeping the required gradient varying from 0 003 to 0 022 and when considerable mixing of sw and fw occurred it started displacing the fw eventually colored sw invaded the porous medium a sw wedge started forming towards the bottom of the chamber the system evolved over time and sw wedge started moving towards the fw boundary the movement of this wedge was captured by camera and toe and height of intruded wedge were noted down with respect to elapsed time every 15 min also head measurements at 7 piezometric points and constant head chambers were monitored every 15 min throughout the experiment the fw moving horizontally from the left chamber and discharging to seawater chamber is instantly removed through an outlet salinity and temperature of the discharged water were measured every 15 min multiple measurements were made to ensure the constancy in the value of sw influx 3 1 3 experimental design the set of values for all parameters used in the experiment were adopted by considering the representative values for coastal aquifer settings smith 2004 abarca et al 2007 werner et al 2009 as given in table 2 in this study 7 sets of experiments with varying hydraulic gradient were carried out as shown in table 1 and when net increase in toe advancement was 2 it s safe to believe that the system was near steady state at that stage 3 1 4 experimental results the mixing zone variables examined in the study are illustrated in the conceptual diagram fig 4 given below in this figure qs and qf represents saltwater and fresh water influx and q s and q f corresponding discharges ltoe is the length from the seaside boundary to the point where 50 isochlor touches the base and wmz is the width of the mixing zone the inward fw flux qf has a significant effect in flattening the slope of the sw wedge formed and hence it is taken as an independent variable and varied between 0 0417 15 ml per minute to 0 2778 100 ml per minute cm2 s to accommodate the flux range according to the objective of the study as expected with increase in the fw flow rates the toe of intrusion moved to the sw side pushing the sw wedge towards the sw chamber comparison of steady state toe positions for the various freshwater flux conditions obtained during the experiment study are shown in fig 5 a g below visual inspection of the sw wedge revealed more dilution near the mid of the interface when compared to the toe and tip of the wedge the mixing across the interface flattens the density gradient and the dilution is more pronounced towards the interface s midpoint during the process of achieving equilibrium the shape of sw wedge is significant as it is determined by the relative value of velocity of fw and sw along the corresponding interface region darcy s law implies that an increase in qf k increases the required head gradient for a given fw flux in our study with k held constant the gradient increased from 30 43 to 32 22 when qf was increased from 0 0417 to 0 2778 cm2 s for steady state wedges thereby increasing the head gradient for an increase in fw flux the thickness of the aquifer with fw flow decreased towards the sw boundary which increased velocity near the boundary for the boundary layer solution the coordinate positions observed in the steady state salt wedge positions were delineated and the thickness of fw flow along the interface is the value of k as calculated using eq 7 and is displayed in fig 5 a g corresponding to each fw flux 3 2 design of numerical method we used seawat version 4 to reproduce experimentally obtained wedges which incorporates the codes modflow 2000 and mt3dms version 5 2 seawat is regarded as a standard code for modelling density dependent ground water flow and transport guo and langevin 2002 a two dimensional vertical cross section with grids of dimensions 0 5 cm 0 2 cm 304 cells in the x direction and 218 cells in the z direction was chosen to represent the sand tank discretization was done according to the criteria given by voss and souza 1987 for simulating a thin transition zone a consistent finer grid size of 0 4 cm in both directions was used at first for discretization because the wmz value is very sensitive to the grid resolution used for modelling a finer 0 2 cm size is selected for vertical spacing the quantitative comparison of ltoe and wmz did not differ by more than 5 we ran test simulations to evaluate the model s convergence and concluded that a grid size of 0 5 cm 0 2 cm is best for reproducing this experimental flow tank the left upper corner of the simulated tank was chosen as the origin of the cartesian coordinate system top layer was modelled as confined to represent it as a no flow boundary fw head at the left boundary was varied from 44 cm to 46 8 cm successively for the 7 set of simulations as shown in table 1 whereas the sw head was kept fixed at 43 5 cm for all simulations the value of specific storage was set as 10 6cm 1 the value of transverse dispersivity obtained by comparing paster s solution with experimental results has been used for all simulations the longitudinal dispersivity was determined by fitting the experimentally observed toe of the wedge with the model s predicted value through trial and error concentration of saltwater cs was taken as 0 037 g cm3 and that of freshwater cf was assumed to be nil total variation diminishing tvd package was utilized for modelling advection and fully implicit conditions were taken for dispersion also for intermodal density calculation upstream weighted algorithm was used 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation bl solution for dispersive entrainment was compared with experimentally recorded discharges to the saltwater boundary for various freshwater fluxes here dispersive entrainment refers to the amount of saltwater entrained in freshwater saltwater transition zone for a steady and stable lighter freshwater above heavier saltwater flow system in an aquifer at steady state the amount of water entrained will be the same as that discharged along the outflow face to represent the relative influence of changes in freshwater flux on saltwater discharge in a dimensionless manner it is expressed as discharge ratio 4 1 1 discharge ratio the discharge ratio dimensionless discharge for increasing fw flux predicted by the bl solution and that calculated from experimental data are illustrated in fig 6 discharge ratio is defined as the ratio between discharge of sw q s to discharge of fw q f expressed as mass flux discharge of sw represented the total accumulated sw entrained along the interface and outflowing through the seepage face the total discharge and salinity were measured as explained in section 3 1 2 and amount of saltwater discharge was calculated using the eq 11 it showed an improved decreasing trend for low values of dimensionless fw flux and thereafter a somewhat stable trend for higher values of fw flux the dispersive flux was contributing to achieve the static equilibrium when a 0 5 demonstrating dominance of free convection in the system the published results up to a 0 5 of paster and dagan 2007 were used to compile the analytical data offered here for comparison the result reaffirms that the magnitude of marine discharge component of submarine groundwater discharge sgd should be greater than its terrestrial discharge component for buoyancy dominated system in paster and dagan 2007 q s was taken as 0 05 and q f was varied with max taking values from 1 8 10 4 to 2 10 3 as could be interpreted from the trend shown in fig 6 experimental data was consistent with the bl solution upto a 0 5 the percentage deviation of the discharge ratio value i e bl solution experimental was determined for all cases up to a 0 5 and was 6 96 percent also the nash and sutcliffe index was used to make quantitative comparisons the index was defined as nash and sutcliffe 1970 e 1 i 1 n q i o q i m 2 i 1 n q i o q i o 2 where e denotes the efficiency of the model n the number of data points q o the experimentally obtained discharge flux ratio q m the analytically predicted discharge ratio and q i o the average value of experimental discharge flux ratio a value of 1 points out a perfect match between the observed and predicted whereas 0 denotes the observed values are near to the average value the model efficiency coefficient for the present study for a up to 0 5 was 0 983 this value indicated that the bl solution could simulate sw entrainment with reasonable accuracy further to know the agreement between measured experimental and calculated bl values for saltwater discharge bland altman difference plot method was employed altman and bland 1983 the plot shown below in fig 7 illustrates the difference between the methods on the vertical axis against the best estimate of the experimental value on the horizontal axis the standard error came to 0 4 for intercept and 7 for the slope the bias value is 0 008 and is within the 95 confidence interval this proves the acceptance of the bl method for all the sets of fw flux values considered in the study by correlating the fw discharge values measured experimentally and that calculated analytically the vertical transverse dispersivity value could be calculated from eq 5 the α t value was calculated for the different fw fluxes considered in this study which varied between 0 005 cm and 0 062 cm the average value being 0 03 cm abarca and prabhakar clement 2009 reported a transverse dispersion of 0 005 cm in their study which is consistent with our results it should be mentioned that the inverse pes was varied in the range of an order in paster and dagan s 2007 work which fits the results found in this study 4 1 2 velocity of entrainment after a reasonable match of total sw entrainment across the outflow face was achieved using the analytical bl approach the entrainment along distinct locations of interface was calculated using bl solutions velocity of entrainment is the rate at which fw draws sw through the contact and it is governed by the dilution we hypothesize here that the salinity of this entrained water is correlated to the percentage of sw circulation psc and hence for each of the fw flux rates the next step in the analysis was to estimate the velocity of entrainment along the characteristic length which could be defined as the inclined distance between the toe of intrusion ltoe and tip of wedge zmax calculated along the slope of interface the discharge ratio represented the quantification of saline circulation smith 2004 the steady state interface for the 7 experiments analyzed were drawn after acquiring the interface coordinates through visual inspection of the picture of the sw wedge after determining the slope it was non dimensionalized by dividing it by the dimensionless distance to the toe xf the sw entrainment q ds along each point of interface was found using the eq 5 after incorporating the value of k as given by eq 7 and depicted in fig 8 the result indicated the general trend as well as individual variation across the interface segments the overall pattern of the result obtained was similar to the trend seen in fig 6 for maximum discharge ratio the discharge ratio increases throughout a wide range for low recharge fluxes buoyancy dominating whereas a modest but consistent increase was found for high recharge fluxes balance regime at steady state greater sw influx than fw flow was attributable to the wide range which is especially pronounced towards the sw boundary increase in velocity due to variation in pressure gradient depending on the hydraulic conductivity the sw disperses longitudinally to a larger area as visible by the toe of the interface whereas the spread is limited in the transverse direction due to fw flushing the discharge ratio is rather constant along the contact when a is greater than 0 55 for a smaller than 0 5 the trend of these graphs matched that of paster and dagan 2007 more sw got diluted as fw recharge was increased resulting in more spreading and macroscopic mixing leading to a high transverse dispersivity value this proved that entrainment of sw was predominant for low fw flux recharge regimes specifically a system in which buoyancy flux dominanted over advective flux hence we could infer here that for bl solution a modified sharp interface approach could be satisfactorily used to represent such a system 4 1 3 width of mixing zone wmz physically measuring the mixing zone from the experimentally observed wedge proved to be difficult due to the lateral spread transverse dispersion being of the order of a few mm as a result this variable could not be directly compared to the experimental values the width of the mixing zone wmz was calculated as a function of k for all of the fw flow rates investigated by substituting the value of α t in eq 6 represented by the black circle in fig 9 also to recover the characteristic properties it is made dimensionless by dividing wmz by the fw thickness ζ represented as star in fig 9 fig 9 shows the width of the mixing zone for a 0 13 to a 0 84 at various distances from the seawater boundary we could see that the graph s spread is more pronounced up to a 0 5 beyond which there is only a slight change this could be due to higher buoyancy causing more dispersion longitudinally than laterally the largest wmz was achieved at or near the outflow face as expected because the region s velocity is high and fw flow converged into a narrow zone the computed horizontal velocity from the total discharge ranged from 0 167 cm s to 0 083 cm s at the outflow the dimensionless wmz value exceeded 0 2 to 0 4 near the outflow face whereas it rarely exceeded 0 2 in the toe and center areas because of the higher velocity flux there would be a decrease in pressure at pores causing sw to spread more quickly high transverse dispersion along the outflow face increasing wmz as a result in that region of the interface the linear correlation between density and flux which is a key assumption in the bl method will no longer be valid the maximum wmz near the tip of the interface is recalculated by truncating the values where the value exceeded 0 2 and plotted in fig 10 as a function of dimensionless fw flux as seen from the graph the adjusted maximum wmz doubles as the rate of fw flux increases this could be attributed to reduced density contrast which causes more dispersion to locate the boundary layer and to gain understanding of relative contribution of sw suction and dilution eq 9 and eq 10 were employed to the modified wmz values and is shown in fig 10 the δ u denotes the rate of exchange between the bl and the fw body where as δ l denotes the salt water suction when the fw flow rate is increased the spread of entrained water tends to increase accelerating the dilution the trend of increasing transverse dispersion value with increased rate of fw flux reflects the same the salinity of discharged water decreased from 35 7 to 17 g cm3 with an increase in fw rates this logically supports the statement that the dilution has increased with the fw flow with balanced flow there is only a slight increase in the wmz value smith 2004 also reported a similar pattern stating that the contribution of fw convective velocity to recirculation is negligible 4 2 numerical model results in the subsequent paragraphs we employ the numerical model to conduct simulations and the validated bl solution to compare the effect of fw convective velocity on sw circulation rate as well as the influence of dispersive entrainment on ltoe the discussion here is implied based on the observations and analysis of the sw wedge variables obtained by numerically simulating and comparing it with the experimental counterparts once the steady state is established the numerical simulation employs the transverse dispersivity values derived from the validated bl solution 4 2 1 sw influx further analysing the results the variation of sw influx qs at steady state was compared with fw influx for a 0 13 to a 0 84 the initial value corresponds to α t 0 the results obtained are shown below in fig 11 the general trend from the results revealed that with an increase in fw flux sw flux also increases this was evident for both numerical and experimental results same pattern was reported by pool et al 2011 for fw flux a 0 5 a significant increase in qs was observed which gradually acquired a constant value when a took the value greater than 0 5 for a 0 5 more sw was drawn to attain equilibrium than at a greater than 0 5 here equilibrium denotes the balance between advective flow due to hydraulic gradient and dispersive flux due to density variations when fw influx was little or might be fairly expected to be nil the system was filled with sw preventing any additional qs as could be seen from the graph s beginning point a non monotonic correlation was discovered while comparing fw and sw influxes the value obtained through numerical simulation outweighs the experimental values it may be due to the assumed constant concentration at the sw boundary condition 4 2 2 length of intrusion fig 12 compares the experimental and numerical wedge geometries in terms of ltoe and zmax the geometry matched extremely well for a up to 0 5 however there was a significant discrepancy for a greater than 0 5 this demonstrates the broad acceptance of computed α t up to a 0 5 when fw recharge is minimal dispersive entrainment in the homogeneous aquifer is low allowing for considerable wedge intrusion one of the approximations of the bl solution is that it is suitable to sharp interface problems where the length of intrusion exceeds the aquifer thickness eg regional scale model for a greater than 0 5 the dispersion effect is strong and diluting water in the mixing zone reduces the density difference resulting in more marine discharge to the sw boundary and a shorter duration of intrusion the effect of buoyancy on marine discharge must be carefully analyzed and adopted in the next section as it will affect a value that specifies the position of the wedge s toe 4 2 3 saltwater discharge at the outflow face qs as inferred from the preceding section 4 2 the decrease in ltoe with increasing a could be associated with a concomitant increase of discharge towards the sw boundary to determine the consistency of the results leading to the interpretation of the exclusive sw component in marine discharge we first compared the measured experimental qs with the validated bl solution numerical model and modified ghyben herzberg method using pool and carrera 2011 empirical correction factor all the three methods utilized the same α t value the results obtained using eq 5 was drawn under bl solution and experimental values were measured as described in the section 3 1 2 were plotted further flow rates measured from the simulated numerical model using the method described in section 3 3 were obtained and plotted also the empirical correction term for density difference factor in terms of α t to incorporate the effects of mixing for a broad range of conditions devised by pool and carrera 2011 was utilised the equation could be written as 1 α t d 1 6 where ρ s ρ f ρ f and d is the thickness of the aquifer model the α t obtained for different freshwater flow rates by validating the model was utilised to estimate the modified density difference factor subsequently by modifying a and incorporating the same in the equation for length of intrusion the discharge of sw towards the sw boundary was calculated and plotted the length of intrusion was calculated from the relation l gh d 1 2 a where a is defined in section 2 qs obtained using the different methods is illustrated below in fig 13 which will give an idea about the influence of convective velocity on dispersive entrainment overall the results show an increasing trend for saltwater discharge with a the sw discharge qs calculated using pool s empirical factor exceeded the experimental value by 28 for a 0 13 and by 20 for a 0 84 this variation could be attributed to the fact that the empirical factor was decided based on the results obtained in numerical method and is more suitable for broad transition zones numerical results were derived with the same α l but with validated α t values for a 0 13 the difference of 6 3 is observed where as it increases up to 14 for a 0 84 the α l values were varied and assessed but the simulation result of q s q f remained the same moreover the constant concentration boundary was assigned to saltwater boundary which may have an influence on the discharge value as seen from the fig 13 bl values matched up with the experimentally observed ones reasonably up to a 0 5 thereafter it took stable trend the variation of the dispersive entrainment with respect to the dimensionless freshwater flux was plotted earlier to account for the mixing the variation with respect to seepage also needs to be compared towards this aim the variation of marine discharge calculated using numerical experimental and bl method from the sharp interface solution ghyben herzberg equation considered here was plotted and compared for different seepage peclet number and is illustrated in fig 14 the variation was comparable for numerical and bl solutions corresponding to a 0 5 buoyancy flux whereas it shows high variation for balanced flows same α t was used for all the three methods it could be concluded that α t value obtained by comparing experimentally and analytically bl solution obtained maximum discharge ratio gives accurate results up to a 0 5 i e for buoyancy flow regime thereafter there is a profound variation this proves that the bl theory could be satisfactorily extends the sharp interface solution up to a 0 5 for evaluating thin diffused interfaces while providing a preliminary accurate approximation 4 2 4 saline circulation the percentage of saline circulation psc as defined by smith 2004 is the ratio of components of marine discharge i e sw to fw represented as a percentage smith 2004 estimated the influence of a and pes on seawater circulation in his research his analysis was restricted to pes of 200 in this study his work was extended to higher order pes for the maximum outflow discharge psc was found out for all the fw rate and is plotted in fig 15 from a 0 1 to a 0 5 the graph shows a decreasing trend and from a 0 5 onwards the values reach a steady trend the decreasing trend supports the bl solution and smith s 2004 findings from the average value of transverse dispersivity pes were calculated for all the fw flow rates considered in this study pes decreased with an increase in the mean pore water velocity the values obtained varied from 9635 to 700 which affirms a linear dependence of transverse dispersivity on pes as shown in the graph in fig 16 psc exhibited a decreasing trend with pes the interaction between flow and a porous medium increased dispersion processes within the pores which enhanced mass flux transfer across the sharp interface a mild decrease in the pes after 0 5 could be observed from the graph this could be due to the increased dispersion contributing to enhanced mixing of fw and sw reducing the effect of buoyant forces following smith 2004 the combined effect of a and pes was realized into a constant defined here as saline circulation number scn and the variation of scn is plotted with psc in fig 17 the integral effect shows a decreasing trend with psc varying from 1054 to 229 corresponding to a 0 13 and a 0 84 respectively the maximum value of psc for smith was 180 for type a boundary to 280 for type b boundary see section 5 3 of smith 2004 for description of the types of boundary according to him the dispersion function is fitted by the relation b pes c for dispersion parameters up to 120 with b and c values of 3 and 0 3 respectively in our investigation b and c were calculated to be 4 4 and 0 5 respectively the higher value of 1054 obtained in our study is due to buoyant forces suppressing the dispersion within the pore spaces the buoyant force gets weakened with higher rates of fw flow enhancing transverse dispersion and hence the psc reduced to 229 for a 0 84 4 3 practical implications of buoyancy the result obtained in the present study signifies the effect of buoyancy on the salinization mechanism in the coastal aquifer in order to have a quantitative comparison the mixing zone variables sw entrainment and wmz must be compared between the buoyancy dominated a 0 13 lower α t and advection dispersion balanced a 0 84 higher α t regimes the entrained sw denotes the dispersive flux which is the result of deviations of actual velocity from the average ground water velocity at pore scales owing to density gradient the wmz represents the physical range of spreading and mixing for buoyancy dominated regime the sw entrainment per unit width accounts to 0 0329 cm2 s and for balanced regime it accounts to 0 0286 cm2 s this suggests that there is a variation of 13 for dispersive entrainment for the two types of regimes as described earlier psc value varied between 1054 and 229 the percentage difference accounts to 78 it could be concluded with the above obtained data that even for the 13 increase in dispersive entrainment there is a decrease in convective saline circulation by 78 this is a very important finding that even without considering the heterogeneity of porous media or hydraulic stress caused by pumping rates or tidal forces the individual contribution of buoyancy force to circulation rate is non trivial further the dimensionless wmz for the buoyancy dominated and the balanced regime are 0 0580 and 0 1380 respectively for the sake of practical understanding the wmz is considered to be comprised of two parts sw suction and dilution for buoyancy dominated regime the sw suction of the wmz is 0 0242 and for balanced regime it is 0 0559 the percentage of sw suction for buoyancy and balanced regimes is 41 7 and 40 5 and for dilution part it accounts to 58 3 and 59 49 respectively the result shows not much variation which supports the linearity of density with flux across the mixing zone which is a prime assumption in bl solution this quantitatively proves the validity of bl solution in the buoyancy dominated higher pes aquifer regime it is to be noted that the modified wmz was calculated after truncating the values near the outflow face where a high velocity gradient existed the present work qualitatively discussed sw entrainment across transition zone which is spread upwards and advected sideways by the horizontal fw flux and discharges to sw boundary in a boundary layer perspective it was quantified as the displacement thickness which is accounted for by the non linear displacement of flow owing to buoyancy causing a decrease in velocity the non linearity in flow is due to the dependence of α t on freshwater convective velocity this non linear behavior is different and should not be confused with the mass and solute transfer in non newtonian fluids where shear thinning plays a dominant role aldabesh et al 2020 chu et al 2020 farooq et al 2020 khan and alzahrani 2020 li et al 2021 nayak et al 2021 song et al 2021 the bl solution is intended for an aquifer with a stable homogenous geological formation in steady state conceptually flow and transport in a confined aquifer where the flow field and seawater wedge are in equilibrium by stable aquifer it is meant that the saltwater component of marine outflow is significantly less than the freshwater inflow which is feasible when the aquifer is not sensitive to human activities such as pumping time dependent problems bl solutions are restricted to homogeneous aquifers with constant conductivity values since they are based on a constant velocity potential cross flow produced by density variation in layered aquifers cannot be represented with the bl solution currently being studied it is particularly applicable to regional aquifers when the length of intrusion is greater than the thickness of the aquifer i e a domainwhere the impact of solute advection as a salt transport mechanism is substantially greater than the effective longitudinal dispersion though the field aquifers are heterogeneous in nature in many coastal areas where totally sandy aquifers exist and too much heterogeneity is not present the bl solution can be used for various assessment and design paster 2010 for instance used the bl solution to estimate transverse dispersivity for the 6000 km2 yarkon taninim aquifer which is fairly heterogeneous fractured and has a large transport scale his investigation revealed a result of 0 04 m fiori and dagan 1999 reported values of transverse pore scale dispersivities of 0 5 mm for cape cod and 0 44 mm for the borden site it is possible to use the bl solution in situations when the transverse effect of the pore scale dispersion is predominant in the vertical direction 5 conclusions in the present study experimental investigations using sand tank were performed to validate the bl solution to better comprehend the narrower mixing zone dynamics in coastal seawater intrusion problems the bl solution is adopted here because it is one of the unique solutions that considers exclusively small transverse dispersivity and a narrow mixing zone similar to the present experimental setting this study is distinctive in that it estimates the transverse dispersivity without having to determine the longitudinal dispersivity the bl solution especially applicable for peclet number of the order o 103 is compared with the observed thin transition zone in a laboratory sand tank the discharge seeping into the sw chamber integrated measure of sw entrainment was compared with the analytical solution for the dimensionless maximum sw discharge the agreement gave the confirmation to deduce transverse dispersivity for each fw flux which is assumed as the average value along the characteristic length slope of interface subsequently other transition zone variables such as wmz velocity of sw entrainment along the slope of the interface were calculated based on these average value of transverse dispersivity we investigated the effect of varying fw flux recharge on these variables the interpretations of mixing and spreading along the thin transition zone are further extended using the laboratory experiments in this study to know the integrated effects of varying fw flux and modest transverse dispersion on saline recirculation in a coastal aquifer following are the important conclusions from the study for a buoyancy flux dominated system with a 0 5 and for peclet number pes of the order 103 where the length of the intrusion is greater than the thickness of aquifer bl solution gives fairly accurate results and could be adopted with reasonable accuracy to find dispersive entrainment in the system the value of transverse dispersivity varied from 0 005 cm to 0 062 cm for the freshwater recharge flux considered in this study for the whole stretch of the interface the wmz calculated by bl approach was satisfactory with experimental results showing the same trend though the accuracy was much better in the center zone of the sharp interface near the outflow face the dimensionless wmz value was greater than 0 2 to 0 4 while it was rarely greater than 0 2 in the toe and central regions increased wmz would result from the increased velocity flux producing a decrease in pressure at pores which would allow sw to spread rapidly high transverse dispersion over the outflow face for a 0 5 buoyancy dominated regime the spread of entrained water tends to increase accelerating the dilution whereas 0 5 a 1 balanced regime contribution of fw convective velocity to recirculation increases marginally there is a substantial contribution of buoyancy force to the rate of saline circulation the buoyant force suppresses the dispersion for very low fw recharge conditions while on the contrary upon increasing fw flow rates more spreading enhances dilution resulting in decreasing the pes the influence of buoyant force increases saline circulation which eventually has a negative impact on the system s stability the present results reaffirm that the mixing in the zone needs to be quantified to know the transport process within the wedge which would captivate nutrient and contamination circulation causing a direct impact to coastal life near the shore also the long term density driven circulation is important while quantifying the sgd and for mass balance calculations in the coastal areas before attempting any aquifer management solutions like recharge wells or mitigation strategies like pumping for desalination plants or subsurface barriers future studies may warrant the time dependent evolution of dispersive entrainment and its influence on the convective saline circulation the system s time dependent response must be characterised in order to determine the respective contributions of longitudinal and transverse dispersion in wedge evolution a further numerical analysis would provide more knowledge on the mixing and dispersion of the sw flux during the evolution process and the combined influence of α l and α t on length of intrusion needs to be assessed the simple homogeneous aquifer considered in this study needs to be extended in order to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity on the outcomes credit authorship contribution statement dhanya narayanan

2509,flood risks are increasing due to climate change and urbanization to alleviate flooding problems the development of flood resilience is necessary however existing metrics based on the system performance curve and grid cells only consider the impacts of the water depth the system performance thresholds are typically determined based on expert experience and study area conditions resulting in the subjectivity of resilience metrics this study proposes a novel flood resilience metric that considers the water velocity and duration of system performance being impacted the flood hazard rating index and incipient velocity were used to objectively determine system performance thresholds the system performance of traffic land was determined by considering the instability mechanisms of residents and vehicles during floods the proposed metric was evaluated in the minzhi region of shenzhen city china under different rainfall intensities comparisons with an existing metric were conducted and the contributions of flood resilience area loss of different land use types under different rainfall intensities were analyzed the results suggest that an increase in rainfall intensity reduces flood resilience the higher the rainfall intensity the longer the flood impact duration is in the study area and in different land use types floods and rainfall intensity have larger influences on traffic land than on other land use types the proposed metric provides better performance for quantifying the impacts of floods than the existing metric under the rainfall intensity variation the land use type with the greatest impact on the overall flood resilience changes from residential land to traffic land a decrease in the flood resilience of greenspace contributes the least to a decrease in the overall flood resilience traffic land should be the priority land use type in flood resilience improvement projects the results of the in depth analysis of urban flood resilience assessment in this study provide reference for flood mitigation and risk reduction keywords flood resilience system performance curve water velocity duration of system performance being impacted instability mechanisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction risks arising from natural disasters such as floods are increasing due to urbanization and an increasing population urbanization land use change and global warming have resulted in more severe floods and increased damage jamali et al 2018 traditional flood resistant measures are no longer sufficient to address the evolving flood risks in the modern world linkov et al 2014 the concept of flood resilience has received growing attention in recent years and theories and strategies based on resilience have been adapted by scholars worldwide to cope with sudden and uncertain disasters wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2019 it will be a key component of sustainable development and is a complementary attribute that uses measures of adaption and mitigation to improve traditional flood risk management linkov et al 2014 two interpretations of resilience have been provided in a seminal work engineering resilience and ecological resilience holling 1996 engineering resilience emphasizes the ability of a system to return to its original state after disturbances wang and blackmore 2009 while ecological resilience focuses on a system s capacity to adjust to external shocks and changes in controlling interactions pickett et al 2014 the extant literature provides more than 70 definitions of resilience fisher 2015 this diversity and lack of clarity on what should and should not constitute resilience have led to diverse resilience metrics and assessment frameworks argyroudis et al 2020 li et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 urban flood resilience can be understood as the capacity of a city to tolerate floods and maintain its current identity to prevent casualties and socioeconomic losses liao 2012 a literature review indicates that there are two common types of metrics used in urban flood resilience assessment i e indices based and performance based metrics indices based metrics describe resilience by multiple indices from different aspects to reflect the hazard exposure and susceptibility of the system during floods bertilsson et al 2019 miguez and veról 2017 ruan et al 2021 although indices based metrics are the most widely used to evaluate flood resilience the indices selection is often subjective besides these metrics cannot reflect changes in the functionality of a system during a single flood event with the belief that resilience is affected by time the performance based metrics quantify resilience using the system performance curve to reflect the magnitude and duration of the effects of floods on a system s function chen et al 2021 leandro et al 2020 wang et al 2019 these metrics can be combined with flood models for dynamically assessing the ability of a system to cope with floods thus they provide more precise and efficient flood resilience results than indices based metrics chen et al 2021 some researchers have recently evaluated urban flood resilience using grid cell based flood models and the system performance curve at the catchment scale chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 system performance reflects the degree to which the system s function and characteristics are affected by a flood the system performance of each grid cell is determined by the land use type and water depth thresholds however potential dangers caused by water velocity should not be ignored especially on traffic land which is densely populated and full of vehicles floodwaters with a shallow water depth but a high velocity may cause a high risk of injury to residents and overturn vehicles xia et al 2011b 2014a chen et al 2021 and wang et al 2019 found that water depth thresholds for system performance changes have non negligible impacts on the resilience results however their determinations of thresholds depended highly on the characteristics of land use types in the chosen area and expert experience resulting in subjective resilience metrics additionally the duration of system performance being impacted dspi is also critical for assessing flood resilience it is defined as the duration when the system performance value is not equal to its initial value during floods existing resilience metrics evaluate flood resilience based on the area enclosed by the system performance curve and the x axis however two significantly different systems with different function losses and recovery times may have an identical area abbasnejadfard et al 2022 in this case the one with a shorter dspi should have higher flood resilience due to its stronger ability to adapt to and recover from floods this study focuses on engineering resilience concerning the capacity of the urban system to withstand resist and recover from flood disruptions chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 a novel grid cell based flood resilience metric is proposed and the dspi is included in this metric the flood hazard rating index hr wallingford et al 2006 is utilized to consider the impacts of the water velocity on flood resilience and the objective thresholds of system performance changes are established since the stability of residents and vehicles in floodwaters involves complicated mechanisms xia et al 2014a 2014b xia et al 2011b xia et al 2011a the incipient velocities of residents and vehicles in floods obtained from theoretical analyses and experimental studies wang et al 2021b xia et al 2016 2014b are utilized to evaluate the system performance and improve the realism of the resilience assessment of traffic land in this study we have considered traditional factors such as water depth and land use type in flood resilience evaluation chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 as well as the water velocity the duration when the functionality of a system is affected and the instability mechanisms of residents and vehicles on traffic land the proposed flood resilience index and metric provide more comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the impacts of the flood related factors on the system than the existing metrics this approach is suitable for the multi faceted concept of resilience qasim et al 2016 and provides new insights into grid cell based flood resilience assessment the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly introduces the materials and methodology section 3 describes the case study section 4 presents the results of the case study and the discussion is provided in section 5 the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 materials and methods a logical structure diagram of the works in this section is shown in fig 1 2 1 infoworks icm infoworks integrated catchment management icm is a powerful software that enables users to integrate one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic and two dimensional 2d surface inundation models in urban environments and river floodplains chen et al 2021 innovyze 2014 song et al 2021 it can fully simulate the urban rainwater cycle and integrate urban drainage network and river models providing a realistic simulation of the interaction between the underground drainage pipe network and the surface waterbody the 1d hydrodynamic model predicts the range and depth of inundation whereas the 2d surface inundation model simulates the process of water flowing and receding on the ground the storm water management model swmm is the computational core of the 1d pipe model in infoworks icm wang et al 2021c however it uses the water stage volume curves method to simulate surface water depth which has too many subjective components and cannot accurately describe the movement of floodwaters chen et al 2018 2 2 existing system performance metrics drawing on ganin et al 2016 wang et al 2019 assigned the grid cells a value of 0 not flooded or 1 flooded they assumed the study area was an integrated system and established the system performance curve the system performance of the study area was determined by calculating the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total number of grid cells each land use type was assigned a water depth threshold based on expert experience to determine whether a grid cell was flooded or not the system performance curve is shown in fig 2 the dashed line represents the original performance of a grid cell value of 1 the area enclosed by the solid and dashed lines represents the flood severity ts is the time when the system performance begins to decrease tps is the time when the system performance reaches the lowest value pf tpe is the time when the system performance begins to recover te is the time when the system performance reverts to 1 tn is the simulation duration ts to te is the dspi based on wang et al 2019 chen et al 2021 divided the study area into multiple grid cells they regarded each grid cell as an individual system and extended the system performance value of each grid cell to the range of 0 to 1 this metric reflects the gradual change in system performance during floods the system performance was calculated by eq 1 1 p 0 i t 1 d i t 0 h min i h max i d i t h max i h min i d i t h min i h max i 0 d i t h max i where p 0 i t is the system performance of grid cell i at time t obtained using the existing metric h max i is the maximum water depth threshold of grid cell i m h min i is the minimum water depth threshold of grid cell i m and d i t is the water depth of grid cell i at time t m h max i and h min i depend on the land use type of grid cell i and they are determined by expert experience and the study area conditions the experts use their experience to determine the water depths when the functionality of a land use type in the study area is lost or reduced without considering the hydraulic conditions 2 3 existing grid cell based flood resilience metrics flood resilience at the catchment scale is the aggregation of the system performance during the simulation duration wang et al 2019 it is calculated by eq 2 and reflects the change in system performance over time chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 2 r 0 i 1 t n 0 t n p 0 i t d t where r 0 i is the flood resilience of grid cell i obtained using the existing metric and tn is the simulation duration min the flood resilience value ranges from 0 to 1 2 4 an improved system performance metric this study proposes an improved system performance metric that considers each grid cell as an individual system the flood hazard rating index hr hr wallingford et al 2006 is applied in this metric which can be described by eq 3 3 hr i t d i t v i t 0 5 d f i where hr i t is the flood hazard to people in grid cell i at time t v i t is the water velocity in grid cell i at time t m s and df i is the debris factor of grid cell i which represents the debris carried by the flood and depends on the land use type water depth and water velocity of grid cell i the values of df can be determined using table 1 floodwater causes almost no danger to people if the hr value is lower than 0 75 but poses a risk if it exceeds 2 5 hr wallingford et al 2006 a higher hr value indicates a higher flood risk hence the thresholds 0 75 and 2 5 are used to calculate the system performance and classify it using eq 4 4 p i t 1 h r i t 0 0 75 2 5 h r i t 1 75 h r i t 0 75 2 5 0 h r i t 2 5 where p i t is the system performance of grid cell i at time t obtained using the improved metric table 1 and eq 4 show that the impacts of the water velocity on the land use types are considered in the improved system performance metric this approach to determining the critical values is more objective for calculating system performance than existing subjective metrics equation 5 demonstrates that the system performance of traffic land ranges from 0 to 1 the improved system performance metric of traffic land is based on the instability mechanism based empirical equations 5 p i t 1 v i t u c i t v i t u c i t 0 v i t u c i t where p i t is the system performance of grid cell i which is dominated by traffic land and uc i t is the incipient velocity of grid cell i at time t representing the critical water velocity at which residents or vehicles become unstable m s the incipient velocity of residents can be calculated by piecewise functions eqs 6 and 7 wang et al 2021b xia et al 2016 the first terms of both equations represent the incipient velocity at which residents slide and the second terms represent the incipient velocity at which residents topple the values of the parameters are listed in table 2 two assumptions are proposed to ensure functions are realistic wang et al 2021b first residents are assumed to become unstable when the floodwater reaches their necks second the total height from a person s head to their neck is assumed to be 25 cm thus the maximum water depths at which adults with an average height of 1 77 m and children with an average height of 1 26 m can maintain their stability are 1 52 and 1 01 m respectively for adults u c α p d h p β p m p ρ d h p a 1 d h p b 1 a 2 m p b 2 h p 2 d 0 0 22 α p d h p β p m p ρ d 2 a 1 h p 2 b 1 d h p a 2 m p b 2 d 0 22 1 52 for children 7 u c α p d h p β p m p ρ d h p a 1 d h p b 1 a 2 m p b 2 h p 2 d 0 0 16 α p d h p β p m p ρ d 2 a 1 h p 2 b 1 d h p a 2 m p b 2 d 0 16 1 01 where uc is the incipient velocity of residents m s αp is the characteristic parameter of the human body βp is the characteristic parameter of the experimental water tank d is the depth of the incoming water m hp is the height of a resident m mp is the mass of a resident kg and ρ is the density of the incoming water kg m3 a 1 and b 1 are parameters related to the characteristics of residents and a 1 b 1 1 a 2 and b 2 are coefficients of the linear relationship between the residents volume vp and mp which can be expressed as vp a 2 mp b 2 for vehicles the incipient velocity of suvs and cars can be calculated by eq 8 xia et al 2014b the values of the parameters are listed in table 3 8 u c α v d h c β v 2 g l c ρ c h c ρ f d r f orientation angles 0 or 180 α v d h c β v 2 g b c ρ c h c ρ f d r f orientation angle 90 where uc is the incipient velocity of vehicles m s αv and βv are the parameters of the vehicles reflecting the shape tire type and roughness of the road surface hc is the height of the vehicle m and g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 lc is the length of the vehicle m bc is the width of the vehicle m ρc and ρf are the densities of the vehicle and incoming water respectively kg m3 and rf hcγc hkγf where hk represents the critical depth at which the vehicle begins to float m hence rf is the ratio between the weight of the vehicle and the total weight of the water expelled from and immersed in the vehicle as it begins to float equation 8 is based on experiments conducted at water depths of only 0 6 and 0 4 m xia et al 2014b the critical depths for suvs and cars are close to 0 6 and 0 4 m respectively thus the water depths at which suvs and cars begin to float are respectively 0 6 and 0 4 m wang et al 2021b based on the most unfavorable principle the system performance of traffic land should decrease if residents or vehicles start to be impacted by floods hence the thresholds accounting for the system performance change of traffic land should be the minimum incipient velocities of residents and vehicles under different conditions the incipient velocity uc i t for the system performance change of grid cell i for traffic land can be calculated by eq 9 9 u c i t 9 684 d i t 1 26 0 109 0 0202 d i t 0 007 d i t 0 005 d i t 0 0 16 6 034 d i t 1 26 0 383 0 0255 d 2 i t 0 01 0 004 d i t d i t 0 16 0

i t d i t 1 01 1 52 it should be noted that if d i t exceeds 1 52 m p i t is equal to 0 regardless of the relationship between v i t and uc i t 2 5 an improved flood resilience metric equation 10 defines the improved flood resilience metric using the system performance curve this metric reflects a change in system performance during the simulation period and the duration during which the system performance of a grid cell is impacted by floods 10 r i 1 t n 0 t n p i t d t dspi i t n where r i is the flood resilience of grid cell i obtained using the improved metric and dspi i is the dspi of grid cell i min since the value of the bottom number ranges from 0 and 1 the greater the dspi i the lower the r i is equations 11 and 12 define the flood resilience and dspi of different land use types 11 r lui j 1 n i r j a j j 1 n i a j where rlui is the flood resilience of land use type i obtained using the proposed metric ni is the total number of grid cells belonging to land use type i r j is the flood resilience of grid cell j belonging to land use type i and a j is the area of grid cell j belonging to land use type i m2 12 dsp i lui j 1 n i dspi j a j j 1 n i a j where dspilui is the dspi of land use type i obtained using the proposed metric min and dspi j is the dspi of grid cell j belonging to land use type i min since the system performance curve is calculated for a grid cell rather than areas composed of multiple grid cells the system performance of a land use type is equal to the average system performance of the grid cells of this land use type weighted by their area 3 case study 3 1 study area the minzhi region of shenzhen city china was chosen as the study area its location is shown in fig 3 a and the land use types are depicted in fig 3 b as described in section 2 4 fig 3 b was reclassified as fig 3 c to determine the hr values of different land use types this area is highly urbanized with flat terrain in the central and northern regions and high terrain dominated by hills and mountains in the southern region 3 2 rainfall events the rainfall intensities were calculated by eq 13 four rainfall return periods 10 20 50 and 100 years were chosen to generate rainfall events with a 2 h rainfall duration the rainfall processes are depicted in fig 4 13 q 1535 398 1 0 46 lg p t 6 84 0 555 where q is the designed rainfall intensity l s ha t is the rainfall duration min and p is the rainfall return period years 3 3 flood modeling a 1d 2d coupled urban flood model was established in infoworks icm the modeling area was 25 52 km2 the building interiors in the model were submergible for calculating resilience a total of 40 989 unstructured grid cells were generated in the 2d model more details on the model establishment and verification are provided in the supplementary materials the simulation duration tn was 480 min considering the rainfall duration and the calculation complexity of quantifying resilience the results show that the water depths and velocities of the grid cells reached relatively stable states at a simulation duration of 480 min 3 4 flood resilience quantification the flood resilience of each grid cell was calculated using the improved metrics it should be noted that some of the southern and western regions of the study area are mainly forests which have relatively high flood resistance and recover quickly from disturbances moreover waterbodies can regulate and receive the water flow from floods accordingly the flood resilience of these areas was 1 4 results 4 1 system performance fig 5 illustrates the system performances of the study area and the different land use types over time for four rainfall return periods the overall system performance shows similar trends under all scenarios and its minimum values occur almost at the same time lagging behind the peak rainfall intensity chen et al 2021 this is because the peak inundation volumes typically occur after the peak rainfall chen et al 2018 the system performances of the study area and different land use types decrease with an increase in rainfall intensity implicating that the increase in rainfall intensity makes it more difficult for the study area to maintain its functions and characteristics all system performance curves first decrease sharply but then increase gradually and finally stabilize around 1 which is consistent with the results obtained by chen et al 2021 and wang et al 2019 traffic land has the largest differences in the system performance curves for different rainfall intensities its minimum values of system performance are the lowest among all land use types for the same rainfall intensity the reason is that greenspace and other regions covered with woodlands can regulate and absorb floodwaters enabling them to compensate for the adverse effects of high rainfall intensity residents and vehicles on traffic land have greater exposure to floodwaters than those in commercial and residential areas because the latter two land use types have dense buildings that can protect them from floods thus the functions and characteristics of traffic land are affected the most by floods and are more easily affected by the rainfall intensity than other land use types 4 2 duration of system performance being impacted fig 6 exhibits the dspis of the study area and different land use types for four rainfall return periods the dspis of the study area and different land use types increase with an increase in rainfall intensity this means that the higher the rainfall intensity the longer the duration when the study area and different land use types is affected by floods the dspis of the study area and different land use types are relatively short even at high rainfall intensities the reason is that most grid cells in the study area were not inundated during the entire simulation period greenspace has the shortest dspi land use types except traffic land have similar dspis in all scenarios their dspis also differ slightly when comparing with each other in all scenarios it can be inferred that the functionalities of these land use types are affected for a similar length of time under all scenarios traffic land has a much longer dspi than other land use types as shown in fig 5 the system performance of traffic land declines earlier than that of the other land use types the system performance curves of traffic land exhibit the largest decline due to the negative effects of floods and the response is substantially different from that of the other land use types for different rainfall intensities this result shows that floods have the greatest impacts on traffic land and it is much more difficult and time consuming for traffic land to recover from the most unfavorable state to its original state than other land use types traffic land exhibits larger differences in the dspi than other land use types as the rainfall return period increases the reason is that floods significantly affect the system performance of traffic land due to the greater exposure of residents and vehicles and the inability to regulate floodwaters 4 3 flood resilience the flood resilience of the study area was classified using an ordinal scale i e very low low moderate high very high and natural breaks jenks classification method the area of each level in the four rainfall return periods is shown in table 4 most areas have very high flood resilience in the four return periods showing that most areas can adequately withstand the adverse effects of floods even under intense rainfall regions with very low flood resilience have the smallest area for all rainfall return periods as the rainfall return period increases areas classified as very low low and moderate flood resilience increase whereas those with very high flood resilience decrease indicating that an increase in rainfall intensity has adverse effects on flood resilience areas with a high level of flood resilience increase between the rainfall return periods of 10 and 20 years but decrease between 20 and 50 years and between 50 and 100 years the reason is that most areas classified as very high flood resilience in the 10 year rainfall return period change to high flood resilience in the 20 year rainfall return period and to other flood resilience levels in the rainfall return periods from 20 to 50 and from 50 to 100 years 5 discussion 5 1 qualitative analysis of the proposed metric it is necessary to conduct a qualitative analysis because it ensures that the proposed flood resilience metric is in line with the objective laws this analysis focused on the following aspects 1 flood resilience should be dimensionless and range from 0 to 1 2 flood resilience of a grid cell should be 1 if its dspi is 0 3 if the dspi of two grid cells is the same the one with a larger average system performance value should have higher flood resilience 4 if the average system performance value of two grid cells is the same the one with a lower dspi should have higher flood resilience we have demonstrated that the proposed metric meets these criteria and can be applied to flood resilience evaluation 5 2 comparison with existing metric due to differences in the factors and equations of the system performance and resilience the results differ for the existing and proposed metrics a comparison with the existing metric is necessary to identify these differences and demonstrate the rationality of the proposed metric the flood resilience calculated using eqs 1 and 2 was considered with reference to chen et al 2021 table 5 lists the water depth thresholds and their references for different land use types fig 7 a presents the flood resilience of each grid cell derived from the existing metric r 0 and the proposed metric r for p 100 years as shown in fig 7 a most of the grid cells have the same flood resilience value 1 for the two metrics the reason is that the system performance of 36 093 of the 40 989 grid cells was 1 throughout the simulation period thus their dspi was 0 and their flood resilience was 1 some striking differences are observed in the grid cells with differences in flood resilience value taking grid cells 1 to 6 in fig 7 a as examples fig 7 b illustrates the average system performances and water velocities of the six grid cells derived from the two metrics for p 100 years fig 8 presents the system performance and water velocity of grid cells 3 to 6 over time for p 100 years grid cells 1 and 2 have the same flood resilience for the existing metric but grid cell 1 has substantially higher flood resilience than grid cell 2 for the proposed metric as shown in fig 7 b grid cells 1 and 2 have the same average system performance value for the existing metric resulting in the same flood resilience in contrast when the proposed metric is used grid cell 1 has a substantially higher average system performance than grid cell 2 the likely reason is that the average water velocity of grid cell 2 is five times higher than that of grid cell 1 in addition the land use type of grid cell 2 is traffic land whereas that of grid cell 1 is residential land the far higher water velocity in grid cell 2 poses a greater threat to residents and vehicles than the velocity in grid cell 1 furthermore because grid cells 1 and 2 have similar water depths during the simulation and similar dpsis grid cell 1 should be more resilient to flooding than grid cell 2 the flood resilience of grid cell 3 is lower than that of grid cell 4 based on the existing metric but the opposite trend is observed for the proposed metric as shown in fig 7 b the reason is that the average system performance of grid cell 3 is substantially lower than that of grid cell 4 using the existing metric however when the influence of the water velocity is considered grid cell 3 has a slightly higher average system performance than grid cell 4 fig 8 a shows that the system performances of grid cells 3 and 4 are 0 at 60 min based on the existing metric indicating that their functions were completely disabled at this time however since the land use type of grid cells 3 and 4 is traffic land and their water velocities are lower than their incipient velocities their functions and characteristics should not have completely failed the incipient velocity is lower for grid cell 3 than for grid cell 4 because of the higher water depth of grid cell 3 although the water velocity of grid cell 3 is lower than that of grid cell 4 at 60 min fig 8 b its system performance should have been lower because its water velocity is much closer to its incipient velocity therefore the results obtained from the proposed metric in fig 7 a are reasonable fig 8 a shows that the amount of time required for the system performance to recover from the lowest value and stabilize is shorter for grid cell 3 than for grid cell 4 the final system performance of grid cell 3 is higher than that of grid cell 4 thus grid cell 3 has a greater ability to recover from the most unfavorable state in addition the shorter dspi further indicates that the flood resilience of grid cell 3 should be higher than that of grid cell 4 when the existing metric is used grid cells 5 and 6 have the same flood resilience close to 0 however grid cell 6 has higher flood resilience than grid cell 5 and their flood resilience values obtained from the proposed metric are close to 1 fig 7 b shows that grid cells 5 and 6 have the same average system performance resulting in identical flood resilience based on the existing metric although grid cell 5 has a lower average water velocity and a slightly higher average system performance than grid cell 6 for the proposed metric the much shorter dspi of grid cell 6 results in a higher final flood resilience than that of grid cell 5 moreover the land use types of grid cells 5 and 6 are traffic land and commercial land respectively the water velocity has a greater influence on traffic land than on commercial land because the floodwaters follow the traffic land and residents and vehicles are more protected by dense buildings in commercial land thus it is rational that grid cell 6 which has a higher water velocity during the simulation period fig 8 b has higher final flood resilience than grid cell 5 fig 8 a shows that the changes in the system performance of grid cells 5 and 6 are the same for the existing metric and the system performance dips to 0 beginning at 30 min however because grid cell 5 is traffic land in the situation of a high water depth but low water velocity residents and vehicles can maintain their stability and the system performance of the grid cell should be close to 1 according to eqs 3 and 4 the inundation of grid cell 6 during the simulation period does not cause substantial flood risks to residents this results demonstrates that the existing metric which considers only the water depth overestimates the flood hazard in the study area in summary the proposed metric considers more factors and provides a more realistic and holistic flood resilience quantification than the existing metric 5 3 the contributions of flood resilience area loss of land use types it is critical to quantify the contributions of flood resilience area loss alc of various land use types because it helps to distinguish the land use types with serious flood resilience loss and propose specific measures to efficiently improve the overall flood resilience of the study area the resilience area loss of each grid cell and land use type should be first calculated before calculating the alc which are defined by eqs 14 and 15 respectively 14 ral i a i 1 r i where ral i is the resilience area loss of grid cell i 15 ra l lui j 1 n i ral j where rallui is the ral of land use type i ral j is the ral of grid cell j belonging to land use type i the alc of a land use type is defined as the proportion of its ral to the total ral chen et al 2021 the alc values of different land use types are listed in table 6 residential land has the highest alc values for the 10 and 20 year rainfall return periods and traffic land has the highest alc values for 50 and 100 years these results indicate that a decrease in the flood resilience of residential land traffic land has the greatest impact on the overall flood resilience for low high rainfall intensity the alc values of greenspace are the lowest in all rainfall return periods demonstrating that a decrease in the flood resilience of greenspace contributes the least to a decrease in overall flood resilience as the rainfall intensity increases the alc value of greenspace decreases whereas that of traffic land increases it can be inferred that the flood resilience of greenspace is the least affected by an increase in rainfall intensity because of its strong adjustment and adaption to floods and its contribution to the decrease in flood resilience of the study area decreases gradually as the rainfall intensity increases a decrease in the flood resilience of traffic land contributes more to a decrease in the flood resilience of the study area therefore the focus should be on traffic land to nurture the flood resilience of the study area 5 4 limitations and outlook the factors considered in the proposed resilience metric i e water velocity water depth and dspi are objective however previous studies have proven that incorporating value laden indices into resilience assessments yields benefits for this kind of objective measurements because people would have legitimate understanding of their capacities to deal with floods based on their experience affecting their flood preparation jones and tanner 2017 nguyen and james 2013 subjective factors reflect the flood adaptions of citizens and provide valuable insights into how they cope with and benefit from floods jones et al 2018 therefore the awareness of citizens on floods such as preparedness evacuation routes and meeting points protective actions and house repair after flooding bodoque et al 2016 can be considered to improve the resilience metric 6 conclusions a novel objective grid cell based resilience metric that considers the impacts of water velocity and dspi was proposed the instability mechanisms of residents and vehicles during a flood were considered in quantifying the system performance of traffic land the proposed metric was applied to the minzhi region of shenzhen city china the system performance and dspi of the study area and different land use types were determined comparisons with the existing metric were performed and the contributions of the flood resilience area loss of different land use types under different scenarios were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 an increase in rainfall intensity reduced the capacity of the system to maintain its functions and characteristics the overall system performance showed similar trends under all scenarios and its minimum value occurred almost at the same time lagging behind the peak rainfall intensity the functions and characteristics of traffic land were affected the most by the adverse effects of floods and were more easily affected by the rainfall intensity than other land use types 2 the higher the rainfall intensity the longer the duration during which the study area and different land use types were affected by floods the functionalities of all land use types except traffic land were affected for a similar length of time for all the rainfall intensities greenspace functioned normally for the longest time and floods had the most significant impacts on traffic land 3 most areas were relatively resilient to floods even under intense rainfall regions with very low flood resilience had the smallest area under all scenarios as the rainfall intensity increased areas with very low low and moderate flood resilience increased whereas areas with very high resilience decreased most areas with very high flood resilience in the 10 year rainfall return period changed to high flood resilience in the 20 year return period and other levels in the return period from 20 to 50 years and from 50 to 100 years 4 although most grid cells had the same flood resilience for the existing and proposed metrics striking differences were observed in some grid cells the existing metric overestimates the flood hazard in the study area the proposed metric includes more details and more accurately quantifies the impacts of floods on the study area 5 under the rainfall intensity variation the land use type with the greatest impact on the overall flood resilience changed from residential land to traffic land a decrease in the flood resilience of greenspace contributed the least to a decrease in the overall flood resilience the focus should be on traffic land to improve the flood resilience of the study area although the proposed grid cell based flood resilience metric showed good performances this study has some limitations further studies can consider incorporating subjective factors in flood resilience assessment to improve

2509,flood risks are increasing due to climate change and urbanization to alleviate flooding problems the development of flood resilience is necessary however existing metrics based on the system performance curve and grid cells only consider the impacts of the water depth the system performance thresholds are typically determined based on expert experience and study area conditions resulting in the subjectivity of resilience metrics this study proposes a novel flood resilience metric that considers the water velocity and duration of system performance being impacted the flood hazard rating index and incipient velocity were used to objectively determine system performance thresholds the system performance of traffic land was determined by considering the instability mechanisms of residents and vehicles during floods the proposed metric was evaluated in the minzhi region of shenzhen city china under different rainfall intensities comparisons with an existing metric were conducted and the contributions of flood resilience area loss of different land use types under different rainfall intensities were analyzed the results suggest that an increase in rainfall intensity reduces flood resilience the higher the rainfall intensity the longer the flood impact duration is in the study area and in different land use types floods and rainfall intensity have larger influences on traffic land than on other land use types the proposed metric provides better performance for quantifying the impacts of floods than the existing metric under the rainfall intensity variation the land use type with the greatest impact on the overall flood resilience changes from residential land to traffic land a decrease in the flood resilience of greenspace contributes the least to a decrease in the overall flood resilience traffic land should be the priority land use type in flood resilience improvement projects the results of the in depth analysis of urban flood resilience assessment in this study provide reference for flood mitigation and risk reduction keywords flood resilience system performance curve water velocity duration of system performance being impacted instability mechanisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction risks arising from natural disasters such as floods are increasing due to urbanization and an increasing population urbanization land use change and global warming have resulted in more severe floods and increased damage jamali et al 2018 traditional flood resistant measures are no longer sufficient to address the evolving flood risks in the modern world linkov et al 2014 the concept of flood resilience has received growing attention in recent years and theories and strategies based on resilience have been adapted by scholars worldwide to cope with sudden and uncertain disasters wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2019 it will be a key component of sustainable development and is a complementary attribute that uses measures of adaption and mitigation to improve traditional flood risk management linkov et al 2014 two interpretations of resilience have been provided in a seminal work engineering resilience and ecological resilience holling 1996 engineering resilience emphasizes the ability of a system to return to its original state after disturbances wang and blackmore 2009 while ecological resilience focuses on a system s capacity to adjust to external shocks and changes in controlling interactions pickett et al 2014 the extant literature provides more than 70 definitions of resilience fisher 2015 this diversity and lack of clarity on what should and should not constitute resilience have led to diverse resilience metrics and assessment frameworks argyroudis et al 2020 li et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 urban flood resilience can be understood as the capacity of a city to tolerate floods and maintain its current identity to prevent casualties and socioeconomic losses liao 2012 a literature review indicates that there are two common types of metrics used in urban flood resilience assessment i e indices based and performance based metrics indices based metrics describe resilience by multiple indices from different aspects to reflect the hazard exposure and susceptibility of the system during floods bertilsson et al 2019 miguez and veról 2017 ruan et al 2021 although indices based metrics are the most widely used to evaluate flood resilience the indices selection is often subjective besides these metrics cannot reflect changes in the functionality of a system during a single flood event with the belief that resilience is affected by time the performance based metrics quantify resilience using the system performance curve to reflect the magnitude and duration of the effects of floods on a system s function chen et al 2021 leandro et al 2020 wang et al 2019 these metrics can be combined with flood models for dynamically assessing the ability of a system to cope with floods thus they provide more precise and efficient flood resilience results than indices based metrics chen et al 2021 some researchers have recently evaluated urban flood resilience using grid cell based flood models and the system performance curve at the catchment scale chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 system performance reflects the degree to which the system s function and characteristics are affected by a flood the system performance of each grid cell is determined by the land use type and water depth thresholds however potential dangers caused by water velocity should not be ignored especially on traffic land which is densely populated and full of vehicles floodwaters with a shallow water depth but a high velocity may cause a high risk of injury to residents and overturn vehicles xia et al 2011b 2014a chen et al 2021 and wang et al 2019 found that water depth thresholds for system performance changes have non negligible impacts on the resilience results however their determinations of thresholds depended highly on the characteristics of land use types in the chosen area and expert experience resulting in subjective resilience metrics additionally the duration of system performance being impacted dspi is also critical for assessing flood resilience it is defined as the duration when the system performance value is not equal to its initial value during floods existing resilience metrics evaluate flood resilience based on the area enclosed by the system performance curve and the x axis however two significantly different systems with different function losses and recovery times may have an identical area abbasnejadfard et al 2022 in this case the one with a shorter dspi should have higher flood resilience due to its stronger ability to adapt to and recover from floods this study focuses on engineering resilience concerning the capacity of the urban system to withstand resist and recover from flood disruptions chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 a novel grid cell based flood resilience metric is proposed and the dspi is included in this metric the flood hazard rating index hr wallingford et al 2006 is utilized to consider the impacts of the water velocity on flood resilience and the objective thresholds of system performance changes are established since the stability of residents and vehicles in floodwaters involves complicated mechanisms xia et al 2014a 2014b xia et al 2011b xia et al 2011a the incipient velocities of residents and vehicles in floods obtained from theoretical analyses and experimental studies wang et al 2021b xia et al 2016 2014b are utilized to evaluate the system performance and improve the realism of the resilience assessment of traffic land in this study we have considered traditional factors such as water depth and land use type in flood resilience evaluation chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 as well as the water velocity the duration when the functionality of a system is affected and the instability mechanisms of residents and vehicles on traffic land the proposed flood resilience index and metric provide more comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the impacts of the flood related factors on the system than the existing metrics this approach is suitable for the multi faceted concept of resilience qasim et al 2016 and provides new insights into grid cell based flood resilience assessment the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly introduces the materials and methodology section 3 describes the case study section 4 presents the results of the case study and the discussion is provided in section 5 the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 materials and methods a logical structure diagram of the works in this section is shown in fig 1 2 1 infoworks icm infoworks integrated catchment management icm is a powerful software that enables users to integrate one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic and two dimensional 2d surface inundation models in urban environments and river floodplains chen et al 2021 innovyze 2014 song et al 2021 it can fully simulate the urban rainwater cycle and integrate urban drainage network and river models providing a realistic simulation of the interaction between the underground drainage pipe network and the surface waterbody the 1d hydrodynamic model predicts the range and depth of inundation whereas the 2d surface inundation model simulates the process of water flowing and receding on the ground the storm water management model swmm is the computational core of the 1d pipe model in infoworks icm wang et al 2021c however it uses the water stage volume curves method to simulate surface water depth which has too many subjective components and cannot accurately describe the movement of floodwaters chen et al 2018 2 2 existing system performance metrics drawing on ganin et al 2016 wang et al 2019 assigned the grid cells a value of 0 not flooded or 1 flooded they assumed the study area was an integrated system and established the system performance curve the system performance of the study area was determined by calculating the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total number of grid cells each land use type was assigned a water depth threshold based on expert experience to determine whether a grid cell was flooded or not the system performance curve is shown in fig 2 the dashed line represents the original performance of a grid cell value of 1 the area enclosed by the solid and dashed lines represents the flood severity ts is the time when the system performance begins to decrease tps is the time when the system performance reaches the lowest value pf tpe is the time when the system performance begins to recover te is the time when the system performance reverts to 1 tn is the simulation duration ts to te is the dspi based on wang et al 2019 chen et al 2021 divided the study area into multiple grid cells they regarded each grid cell as an individual system and extended the system performance value of each grid cell to the range of 0 to 1 this metric reflects the gradual change in system performance during floods the system performance was calculated by eq 1 1 p 0 i t 1 d i t 0 h min i h max i d i t h max i h min i d i t h min i h max i 0 d i t h max i where p 0 i t is the system performance of grid cell i at time t obtained using the existing metric h max i is the maximum water depth threshold of grid cell i m h min i is the minimum water depth threshold of grid cell i m and d i t is the water depth of grid cell i at time t m h max i and h min i depend on the land use type of grid cell i and they are determined by expert experience and the study area conditions the experts use their experience to determine the water depths when the functionality of a land use type in the study area is lost or reduced without considering the hydraulic conditions 2 3 existing grid cell based flood resilience metrics flood resilience at the catchment scale is the aggregation of the system performance during the simulation duration wang et al 2019 it is calculated by eq 2 and reflects the change in system performance over time chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 2 r 0 i 1 t n 0 t n p 0 i t d t where r 0 i is the flood resilience of grid cell i obtained using the existing metric and tn is the simulation duration min the flood resilience value ranges from 0 to 1 2 4 an improved system performance metric this study proposes an improved system performance metric that considers each grid cell as an individual system the flood hazard rating index hr hr wallingford et al 2006 is applied in this metric which can be described by eq 3 3 hr i t d i t v i t 0 5 d f i where hr i t is the flood hazard to people in grid cell i at time t v i t is the water velocity in grid cell i at time t m s and df i is the debris factor of grid cell i which represents the debris carried by the flood and depends on the land use type water depth and water velocity of grid cell i the values of df can be determined using table 1 floodwater causes almost no danger to people if the hr value is lower than 0 75 but poses a risk if it exceeds 2 5 hr wallingford et al 2006 a higher hr value indicates a higher flood risk hence the thresholds 0 75 and 2 5 are used to calculate the system performance and classify it using eq 4 4 p i t 1 h r i t 0 0 75 2 5 h r i t 1 75 h r i t 0 75 2 5 0 h r i t 2 5 where p i t is the system performance of grid cell i at time t obtained using the improved metric table 1 and eq 4 show that the impacts of the water velocity on the land use types are considered in the improved system performance metric this approach to determining the critical values is more objective for calculating system performance than existing subjective metrics equation 5 demonstrates that the system performance of traffic land ranges from 0 to 1 the improved system performance metric of traffic land is based on the instability mechanism based empirical equations 5 p i t 1 v i t u c i t v i t u c i t 0 v i t u c i t where p i t is the system performance of grid cell i which is dominated by traffic land and uc i t is the incipient velocity of grid cell i at time t representing the critical water velocity at which residents or vehicles become unstable m s the incipient velocity of residents can be calculated by piecewise functions eqs 6 and 7 wang et al 2021b xia et al 2016 the first terms of both equations represent the incipient velocity at which residents slide and the second terms represent the incipient velocity at which residents topple the values of the parameters are listed in table 2 two assumptions are proposed to ensure functions are realistic wang et al 2021b first residents are assumed to become unstable when the floodwater reaches their necks second the total height from a person s head to their neck is assumed to be 25 cm thus the maximum water depths at which adults with an average height of 1 77 m and children with an average height of 1 26 m can maintain their stability are 1 52 and 1 01 m respectively for adults u c α p d h p β p m p ρ d h p a 1 d h p b 1 a 2 m p b 2 h p 2 d 0 0 22 α p d h p β p m p ρ d 2 a 1 h p 2 b 1 d h p a 2 m p b 2 d 0 22 1 52 for children 7 u c α p d h p β p m p ρ d h p a 1 d h p b 1 a 2 m p b 2 h p 2 d 0 0 16 α p d h p β p m p ρ d 2 a 1 h p 2 b 1 d h p a 2 m p b 2 d 0 16 1 01 where uc is the incipient velocity of residents m s αp is the characteristic parameter of the human body βp is the characteristic parameter of the experimental water tank d is the depth of the incoming water m hp is the height of a resident m mp is the mass of a resident kg and ρ is the density of the incoming water kg m3 a 1 and b 1 are parameters related to the characteristics of residents and a 1 b 1 1 a 2 and b 2 are coefficients of the linear relationship between the residents volume vp and mp which can be expressed as vp a 2 mp b 2 for vehicles the incipient velocity of suvs and cars can be calculated by eq 8 xia et al 2014b the values of the parameters are listed in table 3 8 u c α v d h c β v 2 g l c ρ c h c ρ f d r f orientation angles 0 or 180 α v d h c β v 2 g b c ρ c h c ρ f d r f orientation angle 90 where uc is the incipient velocity of vehicles m s αv and βv are the parameters of the vehicles reflecting the shape tire type and roughness of the road surface hc is the height of the vehicle m and g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 lc is the length of the vehicle m bc is the width of the vehicle m ρc and ρf are the densities of the vehicle and incoming water respectively kg m3 and rf hcγc hkγf where hk represents the critical depth at which the vehicle begins to float m hence rf is the ratio between the weight of the vehicle and the total weight of the water expelled from and immersed in the vehicle as it begins to float equation 8 is based on experiments conducted at water depths of only 0 6 and 0 4 m xia et al 2014b the critical depths for suvs and cars are close to 0 6 and 0 4 m respectively thus the water depths at which suvs and cars begin to float are respectively 0 6 and 0 4 m wang et al 2021b based on the most unfavorable principle the system performance of traffic land should decrease if residents or vehicles start to be impacted by floods hence the thresholds accounting for the system performance change of traffic land should be the minimum incipient velocities of residents and vehicles under different conditions the incipient velocity uc i t for the system performance change of grid cell i for traffic land can be calculated by eq 9 9 u c i t 9 684 d i t 1 26 0 109 0 0202 d i t 0 007 d i t 0 005 d i t 0 0 16 6 034 d i t 1 26 0 383 0 0255 d 2 i t 0 01 0 004 d i t d i t 0 16 0

defines the improved flood resilience metric using the system performance curve this metric reflects a change in system performance during the simulation period and the duration during which the system performance of a grid cell is impacted by floods 10 r i 1 t n 0 t n p i t d t dspi i t n where r i is the flood resilience of grid cell i obtained using the improved metric and dspi i is the dspi of grid cell i min since the value of the bottom number ranges from 0 and 1 the greater the dspi i the lower the r i is equations 11 and 12 define the flood resilience and dspi of different land use types 11 r lui j 1 n i r j a j j 1 n i a j where rlui is the flood resilience of land use type i obtained using the proposed metric ni is the total number of grid cells belonging to land use type i r j is the flood resilience of grid cell j belonging to land use type i and a j is the area of grid cell j belonging to land use type i m2 12 dsp i lui j 1 n i dspi j a j j 1 n i a j where dspilui is the dspi of land use type i obtained using the proposed metric min and dspi j is the dspi of grid cell j belonging to land use type i min since the system performance curve is calculated for a grid cell rather than areas composed of multiple grid cells the system performance of a land use type is equal to the average system performance of the grid cells of this land use type weighted by their area 3 case study 3 1 study area the minzhi region of shenzhen city china was chosen as the study area its location is shown in fig 3 a and the land use types are depicted in fig 3 b as described in section 2 4 fig 3 b was reclassified as fig 3 c to determine the hr values of different land use types this area is highly urbanized with flat terrain in the central and northern regions and high terrain dominated by hills and mountains in the southern region 3 2 rainfall events the rainfall intensities were calculated by eq 13 four rainfall return periods 10 20 50 and 100 years were chosen to generate rainfall events with a 2 h rainfall duration the rainfall processes are depicted in fig 4 13 q 1535 398 1 0 46 lg p t 6 84 0 555 where q is the designed rainfall intensity l s ha t is the rainfall duration min and p is the rainfall return period years 3 3 flood modeling a 1d 2d coupled urban flood model was established in infoworks icm the modeling area was 25 52 km2 the building interiors in the model were submergible for calculating resilience a total of 40 989 unstructured grid cells were generated in the 2d model more details on the model establishment and verification are provided in the supplementary materials the simulation duration tn was 480 min considering the rainfall duration and the calculation complexity of quantifying resilience the results show that the water depths and velocities of the grid cells reached relatively stable states at a simulation duration of 480 min 3 4 flood resilience quantification the flood resilience of each grid cell was calculated using the improved metrics it should be noted that some of the southern and western regions of the study area are mainly forests which have relatively high flood resistance and recover quickly from disturbances moreover waterbodies can regulate and receive the water flow from floods accordingly the flood resilience of these areas was 1 4 results 4 1 system performance fig 5 illustrates the system performances of the study area and the different land use types over time for four rainfall return periods the overall system performance shows similar trends under all scenarios and its minimum values occur almost at the same time lagging behind the peak rainfall intensity chen et al 2021 this is because the peak inundation volumes typically occur after the peak rainfall chen et al 2018 the system performances of the study area and different land use types decrease with an increase in rainfall intensity implicating that the increase in rainfall intensity makes it more difficult for the study area to maintain its functions and characteristics all system performance curves first decrease sharply but then increase gradually and finally stabilize around 1 which is consistent with the results obtained by chen et al 2021 and wang et al 2019 traffic land has the largest differences in the system performance curves for different rainfall intensities its minimum values of system performance are the lowest among all land use types for the same rainfall intensity the reason is that greenspace and other regions covered with woodlands can regulate and absorb floodwaters enabling them to compensate for the adverse effects of high rainfall intensity residents and vehicles on traffic land have greater exposure to floodwaters than those in commercial and residential areas because the latter two land use types have dense buildings that can protect them from floods thus the functions and characteristics of traffic land are affected the most by floods and are more easily affected by the rainfall intensity than other land use types 4 2 duration of system performance being impacted fig 6 exhibits the dspis of the study area and different land use types for four rainfall return periods the dspis of the study area and different land use types increase with an increase in rainfall intensity this means that the higher the rainfall intensity the longer the duration when the study area and different land use types is affected by floods the dspis of the study area and different land use types are relatively short even at high rainfall intensities the reason is that most grid cells in the study area were not inundated during the entire simulation period greenspace has the shortest dspi land use types except traffic land have similar dspis in all scenarios their dspis also differ slightly when comparing with each other in all scenarios it can be inferred that the functionalities of these land use types are affected for a similar length of time under all scenarios traffic land has a much longer dspi than other land use types as shown in fig 5 the system performance of traffic land declines earlier than that of the other land use types the system performance curves of traffic land exhibit the largest decline due to the negative effects of floods and the response is substantially different from that of the other land use types for different rainfall intensities this result shows that floods have the greatest impacts on traffic land and it is much more difficult and time consuming for traffic land to recover from the most unfavorable state to its original state than other land use types traffic land exhibits larger differences in the dspi than other land use types as the rainfall return period increases the reason is that floods significantly affect the system performance of traffic land due to the greater exposure of residents and vehicles and the inability to regulate floodwaters 4 3 flood resilience the flood resilience of the study area was classified using an ordinal scale i e very low low moderate high very high and natural breaks jenks classification method the area of each level in the four rainfall return periods is shown in table 4 most areas have very high flood resilience in the four return periods showing that most areas can adequately withstand the adverse effects of floods even under intense rainfall regions with very low flood resilience have the smallest area for all rainfall return periods as the rainfall return period increases areas classified as very low low and moderate flood resilience increase whereas those with very high flood resilience decrease indicating that an increase in rainfall intensity has adverse effects on flood resilience areas with a high level of flood resilience increase between the rainfall return periods of 10 and 20 years but decrease between 20 and 50 years and between 50 and 100 years the reason is that most areas classified as very high flood resilience in the 10 year rainfall return period change to high flood resilience in the 20 year rainfall return period and to other flood resilience levels in the rainfall return periods from 20 to 50 and from 50 to 100 years 5 discussion 5 1 qualitative analysis of the proposed metric it is necessary to conduct a qualitative analysis because it ensures that the proposed flood resilience metric is in line with the objective laws this analysis focused on the following aspects 1 flood resilience should be dimensionless and range from 0 to 1 2 flood resilience of a grid cell should be 1 if its dspi is 0 3 if the dspi of two grid cells is the same the one with a larger average system performance value should have higher flood resilience 4 if the average system performance value of two grid cells is the same the one with a lower dspi should have higher flood resilience we have demonstrated that the proposed metric meets these criteria and can be applied to flood resilience evaluation 5 2 comparison with existing metric due to differences in the factors and equations of the system performance and resilience the results differ for the existing and proposed metrics a comparison with the existing metric is necessary to identify these differences and demonstrate the rationality of the proposed metric the flood resilience calculated using eqs 1 and 2 was considered with reference to chen et al 2021 table 5 lists the water depth thresholds and their references for different land use types fig 7 a presents the flood resilience of each grid cell derived from the existing metric r 0 and the proposed metric r for p 100 years as shown in fig 7 a most of the grid cells have the same flood resilience value 1 for the two metrics the reason is that the system performance of 36 093 of the 40 989 grid cells was 1 throughout the simulation period thus their dspi was 0 and their flood resilience was 1 some striking differences are observed in the grid cells with differences in flood resilience value taking grid cells 1 to 6 in fig 7 a as examples fig 7 b illustrates the average system performances and water velocities of the six grid cells derived from the two metrics for p 100 years fig 8 presents the system performance and water velocity of grid cells 3 to 6 over time for p 100 years grid cells 1 and 2 have the same flood resilience for the existing metric but grid cell 1 has substantially higher flood resilience than grid cell 2 for the proposed metric as shown in fig 7 b grid cells 1 and 2 have the same average system performance value for the existing metric resulting in the same flood resilience in contrast when the proposed metric is used grid cell 1 has a substantially higher average system performance than grid cell 2 the likely reason is that the average water velocity of grid cell 2 is five times higher than that of grid cell 1 in addition the land use type of grid cell 2 is traffic land whereas that of grid cell 1 is residential land the far higher water velocity in grid cell 2 poses a greater threat to residents and vehicles than the velocity in grid cell 1 furthermore because grid cells 1 and 2 have similar water depths during the simulation and similar dpsis grid cell 1 should be more resilient to flooding than grid cell 2 the flood resilience of grid cell 3 is lower than that of grid cell 4 based on the existing metric but the opposite trend is observed for the proposed metric as shown in fig 7 b the reason is that the average system performance of grid cell 3 is substantially lower than that of grid cell 4 using the existing metric however when the influence of the water velocity is considered grid cell 3 has a slightly higher average system performance than grid cell 4 fig 8 a shows that the system performances of grid cells 3 and 4 are 0 at 60 min based on the existing metric indicating that their functions were completely disabled at this time however since the land use type of grid cells 3 and 4 is traffic land and their water velocities are lower than their incipient velocities their functions and characteristics should not have completely failed the incipient velocity is lower for grid cell 3 than for grid cell 4 because of the higher water depth of grid cell 3 although the water velocity of grid cell 3 is lower than that of grid cell 4 at 60 min fig 8 b its system performance should have been lower because its water velocity is much closer to its incipient velocity therefore the results obtained from the proposed metric in fig 7 a are reasonable fig 8 a shows that the amount of time required for the system performance to recover from the lowest value and stabilize is shorter for grid cell 3 than for grid cell 4 the final system performance of grid cell 3 is higher than that of grid cell 4 thus grid cell 3 has a greater ability to recover from the most unfavorable state in addition the shorter dspi further indicates that the flood resilience of grid cell 3 should be higher than that of grid cell 4 when the existing metric is used grid cells 5 and 6 have the same flood resilience close to 0 however grid cell 6 has higher flood resilience than grid cell 5 and their flood resilience values obtained from the proposed metric are close to 1 fig 7 b shows that grid cells 5 and 6 have the same average system performance resulting in identical flood resilience based on the existing metric although grid cell 5 has a lower average water velocity and a slightly higher average system performance than grid cell 6 for the proposed metric the much shorter dspi of grid cell 6 results in a higher final flood resilience than that of grid cell 5 moreover the land use types of grid cells 5 and 6 are traffic land and commercial land respectively the water velocity has a greater influence on traffic land than on commercial land because the floodwaters follow the traffic land and residents and vehicles are more protected by dense buildings in commercial land thus it is rational that grid cell 6 which has a higher water velocity during the simulation period fig 8 b has higher final flood resilience than grid cell 5 fig 8 a shows that the changes in the system performance of grid cells 5 and 6 are the same for the existing metric and the system performance dips to 0 beginning at 30 min however because grid cell 5 is traffic land in the situation of a high water depth but low water velocity residents and vehicles can maintain their stability and the system performance of the grid cell should be close to 1 according to eqs 3 and 4 the inundation of grid cell 6 during the simulation period does not cause substantial flood risks to residents this results demonstrates that the existing metric which considers only the water depth overestimates the flood hazard in the study area in summary the proposed metric considers more factors and provides a more realistic and holistic flood resilience quantification than the existing metric 5 3 the contributions of flood resilience area loss of land use types it is critical to quantify the contributions of flood resilience area loss alc of various land use types because it helps to distinguish the land use types with serious flood resilience loss and propose specific measures to efficiently improve the overall flood resilience of the study area the resilience area loss of each grid cell and land use type should be first calculated before calculating the alc which are defined by eqs 14 and 15 respectively 14 ral i a i 1 r i where ral i is the resilience area loss of grid cell i 15 ra l lui j 1 n i ral j where rallui is the ral of land use type i ral j is the ral of grid cell j belonging to land use type i the alc of a land use type is defined as the proportion of its ral to the total ral chen et al 2021 the alc values of different land use types are listed in table 6 residential land has the highest alc values for the 10 and 20 year rainfall return periods and traffic land has the highest alc values for 50 and 100 years these results indicate that a decrease in the flood resilience of residential land traffic land has the greatest impact on the overall flood resilience for low high rainfall intensity the alc values of greenspace are the lowest in all rainfall return periods demonstrating that a decrease in the flood resilience of greenspace contributes the least to a decrease in overall flood resilience as the rainfall intensity increases the alc value of greenspace decreases whereas that of traffic land increases it can be inferred that the flood resilience of greenspace is the least affected by an increase in rainfall intensity because of its strong adjustment and adaption to floods and its contribution to the decrease in flood resilience of the study area decreases gradually as the rainfall intensity increases a decrease in the flood resilience of traffic land contributes more to a decrease in the flood resilience of the study area therefore the focus should be on traffic land to nurture the flood resilience of the study area 5 4 limitations and outlook the factors considered in the proposed resilience metric i e water velocity water depth and dspi are objective however previous studies have proven that incorporating value laden indices into resilience assessments yields benefits for this kind of objective measurements because people would have legitimate understanding of their capacities to deal with floods based on their experience affecting their flood preparation jones and tanner 2017 nguyen and james 2013 subjective factors reflect the flood adaptions of citizens and provide valuable insights into how they cope with and benefit from floods jones et al 2018 therefore the awareness of citizens on floods such as preparedness evacuation routes and meeting points protective actions and house repair after flooding bodoque et al 2016 can be considered to improve the resilience metric 6 conclusions a novel objective grid cell based resilience metric that considers the impacts of water velocity and dspi was proposed the instability mechanisms of residents and vehicles during a flood were considered in quantifying the system performance of traffic land the proposed metric was applied to the minzhi region of shenzhen city china the system performance and dspi of the study area and different land use types were determined comparisons with the existing metric were performed and the contributions of the flood resilience area loss of different land use types under different scenarios were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 an increase in rainfall intensity reduced the capacity of the system to maintain its functions and characteristics the overall system performance showed similar trends under all scenarios and its minimum value occurred almost at the same time lagging behind the peak rainfall intensity the functions and characteristics of traffic land were affected the most by the adverse effects of floods and were more easily affected by the rainfall intensity than other land use types 2 the higher the rainfall intensity the longer the duration during which the study area and different land use types were affected by floods the functionalities of all land use types except traffic land were affected for a similar length of time for all the rainfall intensities greenspace functioned normally for the longest time and floods had the most significant impacts on traffic land 3 most areas were relatively resilient to floods even under intense rainfall regions with very low flood resilience had the smallest area under all scenarios as the rainfall intensity increased areas with very low low and moderate flood resilience increased whereas areas with very high resilience decreased most areas with very high flood resilience in the 10 year rainfall return period changed to high flood resilience in the 20 year return period and other levels in the return period from 20 to 50 years and from 50 to 100 years 4 although most grid cells had the same flood resilience for the existing and proposed metrics striking differences were observed in some grid cells the existing metric overestimates the flood hazard in the study area the proposed metric includes more details and more accurately quantifies the impacts of floods on the study area 5 under the rainfall intensity variation the land use type with the greatest impact on the overall flood resilience changed from residential land to traffic land a decrease in the flood resilience of greenspace contributed the least to a decrease in the overall flood resilience the focus should be on traffic land to improve the flood resilience of the study area although the proposed grid cell based flood resilience metric showed good performances this study has some limitations further studies can consider incorporating subjective factors in flood resilience assessment to improve
