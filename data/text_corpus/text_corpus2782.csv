13910,this investigation reveals the possibility of effective photocatalytic purification of aqueous solutions of organic pollutants in an experimental unit with an automatically cleaned photocatalytic coating the automatic cleaning process is realizing by friction of rotating cylindrical photocatalytic coating carriers against a replaceable brush module based on data on phase analysis and sorption activity an optimal silicate carrier was selected for further formation of a continuous coating with high photocatalytic activity on its surface the effect of its multiple applications 1 4 and temperature 500 c and 700 c on the formation phase composition morphology and photocatalytic properties of the coating was studied it is shown that the highest photocatalytic activity of the coating is achieved with a double application and annealing temperature of 500 c phase analysis and electron microscopy data indicate that with the above synthesis parameters a continuous coating consisting of a strontium bismuthate phase in strontium to bismuth ratio close to 1 5 is formed in an experimental wastewater purification unit equipped with samples of the coating that had the highest photocatalytic activity the efficiency of photo oxidation of real organic pollutants of wastewater was assessed by bio testing with lemna minor as a biological object comparative assessment of the efficiency of toxic impact reduction was carried out for two types of organic pollutants 1 single stage oxidizing 2 having photo oxidation intermediates for both types of organic pollutants the effectiveness of the photocatalytic material in reducing the toxic impact on the biological site has been demonstrated keywords silicate carrier strontium bismuthate photocatalytic coating purification unit bio testing 1 introduction at present due to the growth of industrial production volumes the problem of environmental pollution has become very acute discharge of untreated industrial effluents consisting hazardous organic substances the effects of which are exacerbated by various man made disasters frequently cause long term damage to water resources and soil and render them unsuitable for agricultural activities increased incidence of cancers and an overall increase in the environmental risks to animal and human habitats 1 5 the main scientific research for improving the environmental situation is aimed at finding effective and inexpensive methods to reduce the toxic impact of substances that pollute the human and animal environment these methods include phytoremediation 6 8 filtration 9 ozonisation 10 and combinations of these methods at the same time in recent decades interest in the study of photocatalytic water purification of toxic organic pollutants by the action of light of the visible spectrum 11 12 has not diminished tio2 in the form of anatase 13 is recognised as one of the most effective photocatalysts and is often used as a benchmark in studies for comparison of photocatalytic processes this photocatalyst is widely used in water purification units for neutralising toxic organic pollutants 14 however this semiconductor uses only uv radiation which forms only 3 6 of the sunlight spectrum this is a fundamental disadvantage of anatase and limits its wider application in industrial wastewater purification units 15 16 however the larger part of solar insolation is the visible spectrum therefore the search for new photocatalysts capable of using the energy of visible light has been widely pursued 17 20 several works 21 26 have been devoted to sensitisation of anatase to visible light and they show that doping anatase with additives often leads to the reduction of thermodynamic stability of anatase and its structuring as a photocatalytically inactive material rutile 27 also impurities in the doping materials often act as recombination centres for electron hole pairs which causes a reduction in the total concentration of charge carriers which leads to a decrease in the efficiency of photolysis of water molecules and accordingly a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the material 28 therefore the search for new photocatalysts that use visible light is very relevant among a large group of photocatalytically active systems capable of absorbing visible light bismuth compounds are particularly promising because many of bismuth oxides and salts are narrowband semiconductors 29 35 further bismuth compounds have extremely low biogenic toxicity 36 as compared with the compounds of other heavy metals this eliminates the possibility of the residues of photocatalyst causing pollution early studies showed that bismuthates of alkali earth metals in the presence of the visible range of the spectrum have a sufficiently high photocatalytic activity 37 39 the most promising among these are strontium bismuthates in heterostructural compositions 30 also compositions containing bismuth silicates of different stoichiometries in their composition when irradiated with visible range light show high photocatalytic activity of 40 42 as it is known for industrial use photocatalysts are not used in individual state but they create on their basis highly developed surface of catalytically active coatings with 43 since catalytically active components are usually very expensive they are used with a cheap and easily available substratum on which they are coated as a layer of catalytically active coating that contains the minimal amount of the catalytically active phase necessary to achieve the required level of activity as a rule a catalytically active compound will not exceed 1 5 of the mass of the finished catalytic material selecting a carrier for photocatalytic coating is a complex exercise as it involves several factors to ensure the durability of the catalytically active layer it must have sufficient adhesion with the carrier surface at the same time excessive interaction of the catalytic component of the material with the carrier is not desirable as it leads to a change in the chemical composition of the catalytic coating and reduction of its catalytic activity to solve these problems special intermediate layers are created to separate the catalyst from its carrier while maintaining a strong adhesion between the two however the creation of intermediate layers of various compositions complicates the technology and increases its final cost 44 an alternative solution to the problem of creating a catalytically active layer is to select suitable carrier and precursor substances chemical interaction with which produce a photocatalytically active coating in a single stage another important problem when using photocatalytic coatings in wastewater treatment plants is the contamination of their surfaces with products of decomposition of photo oxidized organic pollutants 45 46 such contaminants sharply reduce the efficiency of photocatalytic coatings at decomposing toxic organic substances dissolved in wastewater in this regard the task of cleaning the photocatalytic coatings becomes an important part of a wastewater treatment system a photocatalytic wastewater purification system should ideally involves four interrelated factors 1 maximising the area of contact between the photocatalytic coating and the purified water 2 maximising the area of the photocatalytic coating that is subjected to photostimulating irradiation from its source 3 optimal thickness of the purified water layer between the photocatalytic coating and the source of photostimulating radiation and 4 the as quick as possible purification of the photocatalytic coating currently the most widely used photocatalytic coating carriers in photocatalytic purification units are the flat mesh 12 or spherical 47 carriers of photocatalytic coatings each of the above mentioned geometrical forms has its positive and negative sides while the photocatalytic coverings put on flat mesh carriers are easy to be freed mechanically of extraneous contaminants such carriers are bulky and occupy large spaces in wastewater purification units and their surfaces have a low absorption coefficient of photostimulating radiation spherical carriers are tightly packed to maximise the surface area in contact with contaminated water and exposure to the source of photostimulating radiation the negative side of the use of spherical carriers is the difficulty in fixing in the photocatalytic units which requires the use of a placer bulk loading of spherical carriers in flowing photocatalytic purification units inevitably causes the carriers to rub against each other which causes mechanical damage to the photocatalytic coating another important problem with the spherical carriers is the difficulty in the cleaning of their surface to free them of foreign pollutants that cannot be photo oxidised the solution of the described problems can be the creation of a photocatalytic unit consisting of hollow cylindrical carriers that can be rotational on the surface of treated wastewater as the hollow cylindrical carriers roll their entire surface coated with photocatalytic material receives maximum of the illumination also it is a structurally simple and effective system that automatic cleaning system for the photocatalytic coating the environmental safety of photocatalytically oxidized organic pollutants is another important problem the methods of gas liquid chromatography 48 evaluation of physicochemical parameters such as turbidity redox potential electrical conductivity 49 and methods of bio testing of aquatic organisms 50 53 are widely used in the quality control of photocatalytically purified water however in most purification plants only the indirect methods of estimation of efficiency photocatalytic material such as by the degree of bleaching of an organic dye 17 26 29 35 or the physical characteristics of quality of treated water are used without actually determining the concentration of organic toxins 49 these approaches to assessing the quality of wastewater do not guarantee the safety of treated water because quantitative characteristics of the initial pollutants and toxicity of the subsequent photo oxidation products are not taken into account to find solutions to these problems more complex research on the ecological safety of photocatalytically purified water by physical chemical and bio testing methods is necessary given the foregoing the purpose of this work is to obtain effective automatic cleaning bismuth silicate photocatalytic coatings with subsequent assessment of the quality of photo oxidation of aqueous solutions of organic toxins based on bio testing results 2 experimental 2 1 forming the photocatalytic coating three varieties of silicate materials produced by sera germany were chosen as photocatalytic coatings for the test the selected carriers were hollow cylinders due to the developed gradient porous structure are used in the treatment buildings of the fish breeding factory depending on the type of silicate material and the dimensions the symbols presented in table 1 are used to indicate the carriers in the sections that follow the photocatalytic coatings were obtained by the following method initial reagents strontium nitrate sr no3 2 bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no3 3 5h2o and sorbit c6h14o6 were abraded in molar ratio sr to bi 1 4 to form a transparent viscous solution the obtained sorbite nitrate solution was diluted with nitric acid in ethyl alcohol 1 10 to achieve a mass concentration of metal nitrates of 10 wt then silicate carriers were impregnated with the solution of the precursor mixture for one minute and dried at room temperature for 24 h the decomposition of the organic component and annealing of residual pyrolytic carbon was carried out in two one hour stages at 200 c and 450 c the final heat treatment for the synthesis of photocatalytic coating based on strontium bismuthate was carried out at 500 c for 6 h the synthesis of the photocatalytic coating based on bismuth silicates and strontium bismuthate was carried out at 700 c for 3 h 2 2 water purification unit the schematic diagram and appearance of the experimental purification unit are shown in fig 1 in the fabricated purification unit a flow type of contact of photocatalytic coating with treated water is obtained the flow rate of treated water is 0 7 l min for automatic removal of hardly oxidisable substances from the photocatalytic coated surface is achieved during operation with replaceable brush modules that brush against the hollow cylindrical carriers the rotational speed of the cylindrical carrier is 25 rpm the rotating cylindrical carriers of 12 pieces arranged in a geometric pattern suitable for the most effective illumination of the photocatalytic coating by the source of radiation 2 3 characterisation the initial phase composition of silicate carriers and the phase composition of photocatalytic coatings were investigated using x ray diffraction xrd using a dron 7 diffractometer with cuk α λ 1 5406a as the radiation source which operated at 40 kv and 40 ma the morphology of the synthesised photocatalytic coatings on the surface of a silicate carrier was studied using a scanning electron microscopy sem vega3 tescan the study of the compressive strength limit at load application perpendicular to the plane of the cylindrical carrier axis was determined with the help of ip 250 m press sorption activity of initial test silicate carriers depending on annealing temperature as well as sorption activity of photocatalytic coatings applied to the silicate carrier were determined with 250 ml of methylene blue mb solutions of progressively lower concentration starting with an initial concentration of 20 μmol l at room temperature during 10 h by sampling 50 minutes intervals following the japanese industrial standard jis r 1703 2 2014 the photocatalytic coatings were irradiated with aqua arc osram sylvania 250 w continuous spectrum λ 380 850 nm metal halogen lamp with a spectrum range identical with the solar visible spectrum the power density at a distance of 20 cm from the photocatalytic coating was 800 w m2 before photocatalytic studies to account for sorption processes silicate carriers with photocatalytic coating were placed in mb aqueous solution 10 μmol l for 12 h in the dark the photocatalytic activity of the synthesised coatings was determined by the drop in the optical density of 250 ml of mb solution with the initial concentration of 10 μmol l where the silicate carriers coated with photocatalyst were mounted in groups of 5 pieces the total irradiation time for each photocatalytic experiment was 400 min the change in the optical density of mb was estimated with a 20 minute discretion by photometric method using fec 4 1 tests on the performance of automatically cleaning photocatalytic coatings were carried out in a purification unit fig 1 with rotating silicate carriers in the amount of 12 pieces with photo oxidation of mb in the amount of 10 cycles at the end of each cycle the total mass loss of silicate carriers with photocatalytic coating was investigated with the help of ml54 01 mettler toledo ag scales as well as the mb semi conversion time samples of photocatalytic coated silicate carriers were dried at 70 c for 5 h before the weight loss studies the cleaning unit run time for each test cycle was 2 h at a 0 7 l min aqueous solution flow rate 2 4 bio testing assessment of water treatment quality from organic pollutants by the most effective photocatalytic coating was carried out based on bio testing using an indicative biological object lemna minor lm ethylene glycol eg and formic acid fa solutions in equimolar concentrations of 0 134 and 0 100 g l respectively were selected as organic pollutants photo oxidation of 300 ml eg and fa solutions was carried out in the purification unit with the most effective photocatalytic coating on a silicate carrier in separate experiments the time t of photo oxidation of fa and eg solutions for further bio testing was 0 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 h the flow rate of the purified solution through the unit was 0 7 l min the degree of toxicity of the purified solution after photo oxidation was estimated by changing the total area st of the green biomass lm and changing the values of live weight mt in comparison with the control sample without toxin the photo oxidised solution after each experiment was divided into three equal parts and placed in identical cylindrical cuvettes of 100 ml volume and 3 3 cm base diameter lm was cultivated in the cuvette for 6 days at a temperature of 25 2 c under 12 h phytospectral led lighting the number of single lm plants in each cuvette was chosen so that the total area s0 of lm green biomass in each cuvette corresponded to 40 2 of the cuvette area which corresponded to 51 3 plants the average st value for the three experiments was estimated by photofixing and counting the number of pixels of green ranges inside the image boundaries of lm leaf plates using specialised software that we developed the total live weight of lm plants in three cuvettes was determined using an ml54 01 mettler toledo ag scale changes in the ph of fa and eg solutions as a function of photo oxidation time were determined using a seven compact ph ion s220 mettler toledo ag ph meter 3 results and discussions 3 1 selection of silicate carrier biologically inert porous materials used in water treatment systems of fish farms were chosen as carriers for photocatalytic coatings because each of these materials represented a type of silicate material the following materials were chosen for research porous glass carrier s ceramic carrier b and glass ceramic carrier f the xrd data show that they belong to the specified silicate material types fig 2 the diffractogram patterns of the porous glass carrier s shows a wide range halo at 20 30 2θ and single low intensity reflexes which are typical for silicate glasses wide low intensity peaks belonging to aluminosilicates of magnesium calcium as well as sodium are noted in the diffractogram of ceramic carrier b two groups of reflexes can be distinguished in the diffractogram of the glass ceramic carrier f the first group these are the reflexes with the highest intensity belonging to sio2 crystal quartz the second group of reflexes belongs to sodium aluminosilicate close to na1 16al2si77o158 38 their intensity is much less expressed therefore sio2 in the form of crystalline quartz is the main component of this silicate carrier following the description of the synthesis of photocatalytically active compositions based on solid solutions of strontium bismuthate 30 and bismuth silicates 40 42 mentioned in the literature two temperatures of isothermal annealing 500 c and 700 c respectively were selected for fixing the photocatalytic coating on the carrier when creating photocatalytic coatings the carrier must meet the following characteristics 1 have an open porous structure 2 the thermal stability of the bulk porous structure of the carrier should be higher than the synthesis temperature of the catalytically active layer qualitative evaluation of the porous structure of the test silicate carriers depending on the temperature of isothermal annealing and the number of heating cycles was carried out by examining mb sorption activity on their surface fig 3 heating of samples with isothermal exposure at 500 c and 700 c fig 3a showed that only carrier f meets the specified requirements for preserving acceptable porosity estimated from mb sorption carrier s showed the highest initial value of sorption activity but the fusion of its porous structure begins before the temperature of photocatalytic coatings synthesis carrier b is characterised by the lowest porosity among investigated carriers fig 3a based on a comparative analysis of sorption activity carrier f was chosen for research on the influence of heating cyclicity on the preservation of the porous structure fig 3 b it maintained an acceptable porous structure through up to three cycles of heating at 500 c and 700 c it after each of the three 3 h cycles of heating a decrease in sorption activity was observed at both temperatures of isothermal annealing based on the research carried out a carrier f was selected for photocatalytic coatings with a maximum coating quantity of four 3 2 characterisation of photocatalytic coating for the creation of photocatalytically active coatings the method of impregnation of silicate carrier f with 10 solution of complexes of strontium nitrate and bismuth with sorbite in ethanol was used the following were investigated compressive strength limit surface morphology phase composition sorption activity and photocatalytic properties of coatings applied from 1 4 times on silicate carrier f after isothermal annealing at 500 c and 700 c the designations of the obtained photocatalytic coatings in the form of x y where x is the annealing temperature of coatings and y is the multiple coating applications that are accepted in the article appearance sem results and compressive strength of samples annealed at 500 c are shown in fig 4 according to sem data an increase in the amount of applied photocatalytic phase is observed in the samples coated 1 2 times while the 3 and 4 coatings show agglomeration and crystallisation of this phase the study of the compressive strength limit shows a drop in its values for samples coated 1 4 times which is probably due to the incorporation of bismuth and strontium into the structure of silicate carrier with an increase in the number of coating times indirectly the same is shown by the decrease in the degree of colouration of samples in a row from 2 to 4 coatings because among the compounds under consideration the most pigmented in yellow colour are phases of strontium bismuthate fig 4 analysis of the surface morphology of annealed carrier f samples coated with a precursor mixture 1 4 times at 700 c shows a gradual fusing of the phase that stains the sample in yellow with the formation of a new phase that is uncoloured and probably refers to bismuth or strontium silicates of different stoichiometry fig 5 a 1 5 fold increase in the compressive strength of 700 4 specimens compared to 500 4 specimens can be explained by the formation of a melt of the synthesised phases that covers the entire surface of the silicate carrier decrease of the intensity of colour in a row of samples from the first coating to the fourth is probably caused by embedding bismuth and strontium in the structure of a silicate carrier with the formation of poorly coloured silicate phases on all diffractograms of samples fig 6 three main groups of reflexes can be distinguished with different number of coatings 1 reflexes of the initial carrier 2 reflexes of strontium bismuthate that form a catalytic coating 3 reflexes of the phases resulting from the chemical interaction of the coating substance with the substance carrier f detailed identification of individual phases is difficult since for many of them the most intense reflexes are superposition among the diffractograms of all investigated samples the most intense reflexes are seen in sio2 which is one of the main phases of carrier f fig 2 the intensity of this reflex decreases as the multiplicity of coatings in both series of samples increases the intensity of the remaining reflexes of the carrier f also decreases proportionally on the contrary the intensity of the peaks belonging to the new phases of chemical interaction of the carrier and the coating as well as the reflexes of the applied strontium bismuthate increases the formation of strontium bismuthate phases at a variety of annealing temperatures is different for a series of annealed samples at 500 c there is a gradual increase in the intensity of reflexes of strontium bismuthate corresponding to several solid solutions based on srbi4o7 fig 6a the highest intensity of strontium bismuthate reflexes is registered in sample 500 4 the position of the reflexes largely corresponds with that of strontium bismuthate with stoichiometry close to sr bi 1 5 as the number of coatings increases the sr bi ratio changes due to a more intense interaction of strontium with silicate phases as a result the photocatalytic coating with strontium is impoverished which is confirmed by the appearance of strontium silicate phases fig 6a for a series of the samples annealed at 700 c a different sequence of photocatalytically active coatings formation is observed fig 6b strontium bismuthate reflexes are noted only for 700 1 and 700 2 samples at a higher coating index for 700 3 and 700 4 samples strontium bismuthate reflexes disappear completely instead the reflexes belonging to strontium silicate sr2sio4 and sr3sio5 and bismuth silicate bi4si3o12 appear as a result the photocatalytically active coating at more than two applications and 700 c annealing temperature is fully involved in the chemical interaction with the substance carrier f with the formation of corresponding silicates this process is typical for samples obtained both at 500 c and 700 c but for a series of samples annealed at 700 c it is much more intense due to the higher annealing temperature to the maximum extent the process is expressed for the sample 700 4 which is obtained at the highest number of coatings and the annealing temperature thus obtaining a photocatalytic material at 500 c at carrier f is optimal for the formation of the photocatalytic phase of strontium bismuthate analysis of sorption activity table 2 of samples with different number of coatings and annealed at temperatures of 500 c and 700 c showed a tendency of decreasing at average 1 77 times for samples with 1 and 2 coatings and 2 17 times for samples with 3 and 4 coatings compared to the initial carrier f annealed at the same temperatures the obtained comparative results of the sorption activity study are satisfactory with the sem data figs 4 and 5 the decrease in values of sorption activity is explained by the decrease in surface porosity of the carrier due to agglomeration and fusion of the applied coating in samples coated 3 and 4 times during isothermal annealing photocatalytic activity of the samples under study was estimated from the decrease in mb concentration in 400 min after the sorption equilibrium between the catalyst and the substrate was established before the photocatalytic experiment the samples under study were placed in the dark for 12 h in mb solution of 10 μmol l concentration to account for the sorption processes the photocatalytic activity of coatings synthesised at different temperatures on carrier f in comparison with the experiment without photocatalytic coating is presented in fig 7 analysis of photocatalytic curves for samples obtained at different temperatures on carrier f shows that all samples have photocatalytic activity in comparison with uncoated carrier f samples coated 1 2 times at the two synthesis temperatures show the best result the best photocatalytic activity is characterised by the sample 500 2 fig 7a due to the optimal distribution of the coating on the carrier fig 4 as well as the appearance of photo active phases of strontium bismuthate in its structure fig 6a which is indirectly confirmed by an increase in the degree of colouration of the sample further application of coatings on the carrier f at 500 c leads to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of 500 3 and 500 4 samples due to the agglomeration of the photo active phase and a decrease in the surface area of mb contact with the coating fig 4 on the other hand three and fourfold annealing of samples at 500 c leads to the destruction of the photocatalyst containing strontium bismuthate due to the transition of a part of bismuth and strontium into the structure of a silicate carrier and is accompanied by the formation of phases of bismuth and strontium silicates fig 6a for samples obtained at 700 c a decrease in the photocatalytic activity from 700 1 to 700 4 fig 7b is observed due to the gradual destruction of the photo active phase of strontium bismuthate and the formation of less photo active phases of bismuth and strontium silicates fig 6b which in turn is indirectly confirmed by the data of scanning electron microscopy and a decrease in the colour of samples fig 5 thus according to the data on compression strength sorption activity and the best photocatalytic activity carrier f with a twofold photocatalytic coating annealed at 500 c was chosen for further studies 3 3 stability of photocatalytic coating one of the main technological requirements for photocatalytic materials is that their photocatalytic activity must not be reduced through repeated use however in systems that automatically clean the photocatalytic material coating the adhesion and mechanical strength factor of photocatalytic coating with the carrier is important in this respect to assess of the photocatalytic activity and mechanical stability with repeated use of the photocatalytic coating sample 500 2 was put through ten repeated uses for photo oxidation of mb in a purification unit fig 1 after each photo oxidation cycle the mb semi conversion time and the total mass of 12 samples 500 2 after pre drying were evaluated table 3 it was observed that during the three initial photo oxidation cycles the total mass of samples decreased and the mb semi conversion time increased this may have been caused by flaking off of the top layers of photocatalytic coating due to low adhesion under the friction of rotating silicate carriers against the cleaning brush module of the unit fig 1 beyond the third cycle of photo oxidation the loss of mass of the photocatalytic samples was not significant this indicates a strong adhesion and good mechanical strength of photocatalytic coating of 500 2 sample also due to the clearing of the surface of the photocatalytic coating from the deposits of mb decomposition products by the brush modules a stable photo oxidation operation of the photocatalytic coating is observed after the 3rd cycle of photo oxidation table 3 3 4 water purification bio testing researches show 54 56 that photocatalytic oxidation of organic substances is carried out by highly active particles photo hole h hydroxyl radicals oh and peroxide forms of oxygen o2 data show 38 56 that the ratio and number of oxidative particles largely depend on the elemental and phase composition of photocatalytic material these factors make the task of determining the path of photochemical decomposition of toxic organic compounds into safe substances laborious the path of decomposition depends on the type of photocatalyst used and the chemical structure of the organic toxin a theoretical substantiation of the pathways of photochemical decomposition of organic toxins would permit us to assume the probable composition of the mixture of products of photo oxidation and based on that estimate their total toxicity in comparison with the initial pollutant content in the solution such an approach will facilitate the advance estimation of the degree of environmental risks when justifying the choice of time for photocatalytic oxidation of an organic pollutant incorrect estimation of the photocatalytic oxidation time of an organic pollutant may lead to the accumulation of decomposition products in the solution to be cleaned the resulting toxicity may even exceed toxicity original substance in this study the following were selected as real organic pollutants eg as a substance with toxic products by photo oxidation fa as the substance that in one stage converts to safe compounds water and carbon dioxide based on the data given in table 4 and the theoretically possible observed paths of photo oxidation of eg lead simultaneously to up to seven products of photo oxidation that process of photochemical purification in solution theoretically can be as shown in fig 8 at least three decomposition substances of eg formaldehyde formic acid and oxalic acid exceed in toxicity the initial eg by 3 40 times table 4 at the same time the substances that directly convert to water and carbon dioxide according to fig 8 are carboxylic acids formic acid or oxalic acid on the one hand these compounds are capable of shifting the ph of the purified aqueous solution towards the acidic which would increase the chemical load on the photocatalytic material on the other hand increased acidity would make it impossible to use bio testing of these solutions because of the rapid death of living organisms in the solution taking into account these problems the photo oxidation efficiency of photocatalytic material 500 2 for aqueous solutions of organic pollutants eg and fa in the developed purification unit was estimated at initial concentrations to be 0 134 and 0 100 g l respectively eg is one of the most common components of aqueous coolants in various industrial systems eg concentrations in aqueous coolants range from 40 to 60 which unless disposed of properly can greatly increase environmental risks disposal of untreated used coolants from car repair shops pose risk to aquatic life fa is the last of the carbon containing organic pollutants that are theoretically decomposable by photochemical oxidation the degree of toxicity of eg and fa solutions subjected to photochemical oxidation during 0 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 h has been estimated by the changes that occurred in the areas of green plates st and the value of live weight mt of aquatic biological object lm relative to the idle experience without adding pollutants table 5 changes in the ph of eg and fa aqueous solutions depending on the photo oxidation time were studied fig 9 during the operation the photocatalyst can generate a fixed amount of highly active particles and the accumulation of photo oxidation products from the initial pollutant leads to the redistribution of these particles for oxidation both the pollutant itself and products of its decomposition conversion of all photo oxidation products into non toxic water and carbon dioxide passes through the limiting stages of oxidation of organic acids fig 8 the maximum oxidised eg products according to the scheme are formic acid and oxalic acid given the limited number of oxidising particles it can be assumed that photo oxidation at the initial stages will lead to the accumulation of organic acids in the treated aqueous solution which will increase the overall toxicity of the solution and a shift its ph towards the higher acidity this pattern is confirmed by the analysis of bio test results using lm and the study of ph change in eg solution subjected to photo oxidation within 1 16 h fig 9a the following 16 h of photo oxidation of the aqueous eg solution did not lead to complete detoxication and shifting of ph towards a neutrality the probable reasons for this could be the accumulation of difficult to oxidise substances in the solution decrease of photocatalyst activity due to the shift in the ph of the solution redistribution of the oxidising particles generated by the photocatalyst in as photochemical decomposition products of eg the quantitative analysis of the decline in the eg concentration and the analysis of the changes in the eg concentration in the products of its photo oxidation were not the main aims of this study on the other hand photo oxidation of fa within 32 h showed a complete absence of toxic effects of the pollutant on lm fig 9b this result can be explained by the fact that all highly active oxidising particles generated by the photocatalyst were spent on oxidation of only one substance fa this agrees closely with the data on the increase of ph 6 8 towards the neutral medium after 32 h of photo oxidation of fa fig 9b this experiment indirectly confirms that the selected photocatalyst is stable under conditions of changing ph the estimation of the change in st value was made using the software developed by us in automatic mode to compensate for the possible error in the automatic measurement of st value an additional control parameter was introduced namely the assessed effect of photo oxidised solutions of eg and fa on lm as indicated by the total live weight of plants mt the dynamics of st value change coincided satisfactorily with the change in mt values depending on photo oxidation time table 5 it facilitated the consideration of errors of automatic measurement of the surface area of the above water part of lm as an acceptable measure for estimating the degree of toxicity of the pollutants resulting from photo oxidisation for bio testing a study to assess the degree of toxicity of treated eg and fa aqueous solutions has shown the importance of ensuring the completeness of photo oxidation of organic toxins by photocatalytic treatment systems because the total toxicity of photo oxidation products may turn out to be much higher than the toxicity of the original pollutant therefore the assessment of photocatalyst s performance based on the analysis of the degree of bleaching of organic dyes of different chemical nature 58 61 cannot be an indicator of an effective reduction of the degree of toxicity of real pollutants in wastewater treatment similarly assessment of the quality of wastewater treatment by photocatalytic systems by express tests is based on measurements of physico chemical indicators 49 62 electrical conductivity redox potential amount of dissolved oxygen turbidity can give false confidence in the safety of treated wastewater because express sensors cannot characterise the presence of toxic decomposition products of the original pollutants in this regard for a maximum consideration of the degree of environmental risks associated with photo oxidation processes it is necessary to conduct qualitative and quantitative studies of the degree of organic pollutant destruction by photocatalyst using the methods of analytical chemistry gas liquid chromatography in close conjunction with the assessment of biotoxicity as indicated by the changes in the populations of aquatic organisms 4 conclusions 1 an experimental purification unit was fabricated photocatalyst placed on rotating cylindrical carriers was placed in the unit cylindrical carriers make a rotational motion in the surface layer of the water solution of the pollutant a distinctive structural feature of the developed unit was the presence of a module for automatic cleaning of the photocatalytic coating on the surface of the cylinders the unit created a flow type of contact of polluted water with rotating 25 rpm carriers of photocatalytic material at a liquid flow rate of 0 7 l min 2 based on the evaluation of sorption activity a glass ceramic carrier was selected to preserve the required porosity at the temperatures 500 c and 700 c used for forming the photocatalytic coating it was observed that the best combination of durability and photocatalytic characteristics was obtained in silicate carrier by twofold coating with stoichiometry close to sr bi 1 5 formed at 500 c analysis of xrd and sem data shows the presence of a continuous coating of strontium bismuthate the increase of annealing temperature up to 700 c and increase of the number of coats up to four led to more intensive chemical interaction of photocatalytic coating with silicate carrier this led to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of samples obtained at the highest annealing temperature and a greater number of coats the average mb semi conversion time after four cycles of testing was 93 min 3 samples of the coated carriers that showed the highest photocatalytic activity at mb oxidation were tested for photo oxidation efficiency with actual organic pollutants a comparative assessment of the effectiveness of reduction in toxic effects was made by testing with pollutants 1 oxidising one stage fa and another 2 that resulted in photo oxidation intermediates eg it was observed that the dynamics of the potential changes in the biotoxicity of water runoff after the stage of photocatalytic treatment depended on the type of pollutant using the analysis of growth suppression of the indicator object lm using eg as the example the accumulation of toxic chemical compounds in the treated solution that were more than in the original pollutant was experimentally confirmed it was shown that photo oxidation by the material developed from eg solution in 32 h caused only partial reduction in the biotoxicity of the pollutant and the intermediates this makes it possible to recommend increasing the photocatalytic treatment time for wastewater containing organic pollutants with photo oxidation intermediates and additional studies to determine the safety of the treated wastewater oxidation of fa under the same conditions showed complete absence of toxic effect of photocatalytically treated solution on lm growth process therefore for wastewaters containing organic pollutants that oxidise in one stage it is sufficient to select only the optimal photo oxidation time 4 application of the structural solution implemented in the experimental purification unit namely automatic cleaning of the surface of the cylinders coated with strontium bismuthate photocatalytic material in industrial wastewater purification can be an effective strategy for achieving higher efficiency in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors state that there is no conflict of interest 
13910,this investigation reveals the possibility of effective photocatalytic purification of aqueous solutions of organic pollutants in an experimental unit with an automatically cleaned photocatalytic coating the automatic cleaning process is realizing by friction of rotating cylindrical photocatalytic coating carriers against a replaceable brush module based on data on phase analysis and sorption activity an optimal silicate carrier was selected for further formation of a continuous coating with high photocatalytic activity on its surface the effect of its multiple applications 1 4 and temperature 500 c and 700 c on the formation phase composition morphology and photocatalytic properties of the coating was studied it is shown that the highest photocatalytic activity of the coating is achieved with a double application and annealing temperature of 500 c phase analysis and electron microscopy data indicate that with the above synthesis parameters a continuous coating consisting of a strontium bismuthate phase in strontium to bismuth ratio close to 1 5 is formed in an experimental wastewater purification unit equipped with samples of the coating that had the highest photocatalytic activity the efficiency of photo oxidation of real organic pollutants of wastewater was assessed by bio testing with lemna minor as a biological object comparative assessment of the efficiency of toxic impact reduction was carried out for two types of organic pollutants 1 single stage oxidizing 2 having photo oxidation intermediates for both types of organic pollutants the effectiveness of the photocatalytic material in reducing the toxic impact on the biological site has been demonstrated keywords silicate carrier strontium bismuthate photocatalytic coating purification unit bio testing 1 introduction at present due to the growth of industrial production volumes the problem of environmental pollution has become very acute discharge of untreated industrial effluents consisting hazardous organic substances the effects of which are exacerbated by various man made disasters frequently cause long term damage to water resources and soil and render them unsuitable for agricultural activities increased incidence of cancers and an overall increase in the environmental risks to animal and human habitats 1 5 the main scientific research for improving the environmental situation is aimed at finding effective and inexpensive methods to reduce the toxic impact of substances that pollute the human and animal environment these methods include phytoremediation 6 8 filtration 9 ozonisation 10 and combinations of these methods at the same time in recent decades interest in the study of photocatalytic water purification of toxic organic pollutants by the action of light of the visible spectrum 11 12 has not diminished tio2 in the form of anatase 13 is recognised as one of the most effective photocatalysts and is often used as a benchmark in studies for comparison of photocatalytic processes this photocatalyst is widely used in water purification units for neutralising toxic organic pollutants 14 however this semiconductor uses only uv radiation which forms only 3 6 of the sunlight spectrum this is a fundamental disadvantage of anatase and limits its wider application in industrial wastewater purification units 15 16 however the larger part of solar insolation is the visible spectrum therefore the search for new photocatalysts capable of using the energy of visible light has been widely pursued 17 20 several works 21 26 have been devoted to sensitisation of anatase to visible light and they show that doping anatase with additives often leads to the reduction of thermodynamic stability of anatase and its structuring as a photocatalytically inactive material rutile 27 also impurities in the doping materials often act as recombination centres for electron hole pairs which causes a reduction in the total concentration of charge carriers which leads to a decrease in the efficiency of photolysis of water molecules and accordingly a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the material 28 therefore the search for new photocatalysts that use visible light is very relevant among a large group of photocatalytically active systems capable of absorbing visible light bismuth compounds are particularly promising because many of bismuth oxides and salts are narrowband semiconductors 29 35 further bismuth compounds have extremely low biogenic toxicity 36 as compared with the compounds of other heavy metals this eliminates the possibility of the residues of photocatalyst causing pollution early studies showed that bismuthates of alkali earth metals in the presence of the visible range of the spectrum have a sufficiently high photocatalytic activity 37 39 the most promising among these are strontium bismuthates in heterostructural compositions 30 also compositions containing bismuth silicates of different stoichiometries in their composition when irradiated with visible range light show high photocatalytic activity of 40 42 as it is known for industrial use photocatalysts are not used in individual state but they create on their basis highly developed surface of catalytically active coatings with 43 since catalytically active components are usually very expensive they are used with a cheap and easily available substratum on which they are coated as a layer of catalytically active coating that contains the minimal amount of the catalytically active phase necessary to achieve the required level of activity as a rule a catalytically active compound will not exceed 1 5 of the mass of the finished catalytic material selecting a carrier for photocatalytic coating is a complex exercise as it involves several factors to ensure the durability of the catalytically active layer it must have sufficient adhesion with the carrier surface at the same time excessive interaction of the catalytic component of the material with the carrier is not desirable as it leads to a change in the chemical composition of the catalytic coating and reduction of its catalytic activity to solve these problems special intermediate layers are created to separate the catalyst from its carrier while maintaining a strong adhesion between the two however the creation of intermediate layers of various compositions complicates the technology and increases its final cost 44 an alternative solution to the problem of creating a catalytically active layer is to select suitable carrier and precursor substances chemical interaction with which produce a photocatalytically active coating in a single stage another important problem when using photocatalytic coatings in wastewater treatment plants is the contamination of their surfaces with products of decomposition of photo oxidized organic pollutants 45 46 such contaminants sharply reduce the efficiency of photocatalytic coatings at decomposing toxic organic substances dissolved in wastewater in this regard the task of cleaning the photocatalytic coatings becomes an important part of a wastewater treatment system a photocatalytic wastewater purification system should ideally involves four interrelated factors 1 maximising the area of contact between the photocatalytic coating and the purified water 2 maximising the area of the photocatalytic coating that is subjected to photostimulating irradiation from its source 3 optimal thickness of the purified water layer between the photocatalytic coating and the source of photostimulating radiation and 4 the as quick as possible purification of the photocatalytic coating currently the most widely used photocatalytic coating carriers in photocatalytic purification units are the flat mesh 12 or spherical 47 carriers of photocatalytic coatings each of the above mentioned geometrical forms has its positive and negative sides while the photocatalytic coverings put on flat mesh carriers are easy to be freed mechanically of extraneous contaminants such carriers are bulky and occupy large spaces in wastewater purification units and their surfaces have a low absorption coefficient of photostimulating radiation spherical carriers are tightly packed to maximise the surface area in contact with contaminated water and exposure to the source of photostimulating radiation the negative side of the use of spherical carriers is the difficulty in fixing in the photocatalytic units which requires the use of a placer bulk loading of spherical carriers in flowing photocatalytic purification units inevitably causes the carriers to rub against each other which causes mechanical damage to the photocatalytic coating another important problem with the spherical carriers is the difficulty in the cleaning of their surface to free them of foreign pollutants that cannot be photo oxidised the solution of the described problems can be the creation of a photocatalytic unit consisting of hollow cylindrical carriers that can be rotational on the surface of treated wastewater as the hollow cylindrical carriers roll their entire surface coated with photocatalytic material receives maximum of the illumination also it is a structurally simple and effective system that automatic cleaning system for the photocatalytic coating the environmental safety of photocatalytically oxidized organic pollutants is another important problem the methods of gas liquid chromatography 48 evaluation of physicochemical parameters such as turbidity redox potential electrical conductivity 49 and methods of bio testing of aquatic organisms 50 53 are widely used in the quality control of photocatalytically purified water however in most purification plants only the indirect methods of estimation of efficiency photocatalytic material such as by the degree of bleaching of an organic dye 17 26 29 35 or the physical characteristics of quality of treated water are used without actually determining the concentration of organic toxins 49 these approaches to assessing the quality of wastewater do not guarantee the safety of treated water because quantitative characteristics of the initial pollutants and toxicity of the subsequent photo oxidation products are not taken into account to find solutions to these problems more complex research on the ecological safety of photocatalytically purified water by physical chemical and bio testing methods is necessary given the foregoing the purpose of this work is to obtain effective automatic cleaning bismuth silicate photocatalytic coatings with subsequent assessment of the quality of photo oxidation of aqueous solutions of organic toxins based on bio testing results 2 experimental 2 1 forming the photocatalytic coating three varieties of silicate materials produced by sera germany were chosen as photocatalytic coatings for the test the selected carriers were hollow cylinders due to the developed gradient porous structure are used in the treatment buildings of the fish breeding factory depending on the type of silicate material and the dimensions the symbols presented in table 1 are used to indicate the carriers in the sections that follow the photocatalytic coatings were obtained by the following method initial reagents strontium nitrate sr no3 2 bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no3 3 5h2o and sorbit c6h14o6 were abraded in molar ratio sr to bi 1 4 to form a transparent viscous solution the obtained sorbite nitrate solution was diluted with nitric acid in ethyl alcohol 1 10 to achieve a mass concentration of metal nitrates of 10 wt then silicate carriers were impregnated with the solution of the precursor mixture for one minute and dried at room temperature for 24 h the decomposition of the organic component and annealing of residual pyrolytic carbon was carried out in two one hour stages at 200 c and 450 c the final heat treatment for the synthesis of photocatalytic coating based on strontium bismuthate was carried out at 500 c for 6 h the synthesis of the photocatalytic coating based on bismuth silicates and strontium bismuthate was carried out at 700 c for 3 h 2 2 water purification unit the schematic diagram and appearance of the experimental purification unit are shown in fig 1 in the fabricated purification unit a flow type of contact of photocatalytic coating with treated water is obtained the flow rate of treated water is 0 7 l min for automatic removal of hardly oxidisable substances from the photocatalytic coated surface is achieved during operation with replaceable brush modules that brush against the hollow cylindrical carriers the rotational speed of the cylindrical carrier is 25 rpm the rotating cylindrical carriers of 12 pieces arranged in a geometric pattern suitable for the most effective illumination of the photocatalytic coating by the source of radiation 2 3 characterisation the initial phase composition of silicate carriers and the phase composition of photocatalytic coatings were investigated using x ray diffraction xrd using a dron 7 diffractometer with cuk α λ 1 5406a as the radiation source which operated at 40 kv and 40 ma the morphology of the synthesised photocatalytic coatings on the surface of a silicate carrier was studied using a scanning electron microscopy sem vega3 tescan the study of the compressive strength limit at load application perpendicular to the plane of the cylindrical carrier axis was determined with the help of ip 250 m press sorption activity of initial test silicate carriers depending on annealing temperature as well as sorption activity of photocatalytic coatings applied to the silicate carrier were determined with 250 ml of methylene blue mb solutions of progressively lower concentration starting with an initial concentration of 20 μmol l at room temperature during 10 h by sampling 50 minutes intervals following the japanese industrial standard jis r 1703 2 2014 the photocatalytic coatings were irradiated with aqua arc osram sylvania 250 w continuous spectrum λ 380 850 nm metal halogen lamp with a spectrum range identical with the solar visible spectrum the power density at a distance of 20 cm from the photocatalytic coating was 800 w m2 before photocatalytic studies to account for sorption processes silicate carriers with photocatalytic coating were placed in mb aqueous solution 10 μmol l for 12 h in the dark the photocatalytic activity of the synthesised coatings was determined by the drop in the optical density of 250 ml of mb solution with the initial concentration of 10 μmol l where the silicate carriers coated with photocatalyst were mounted in groups of 5 pieces the total irradiation time for each photocatalytic experiment was 400 min the change in the optical density of mb was estimated with a 20 minute discretion by photometric method using fec 4 1 tests on the performance of automatically cleaning photocatalytic coatings were carried out in a purification unit fig 1 with rotating silicate carriers in the amount of 12 pieces with photo oxidation of mb in the amount of 10 cycles at the end of each cycle the total mass loss of silicate carriers with photocatalytic coating was investigated with the help of ml54 01 mettler toledo ag scales as well as the mb semi conversion time samples of photocatalytic coated silicate carriers were dried at 70 c for 5 h before the weight loss studies the cleaning unit run time for each test cycle was 2 h at a 0 7 l min aqueous solution flow rate 2 4 bio testing assessment of water treatment quality from organic pollutants by the most effective photocatalytic coating was carried out based on bio testing using an indicative biological object lemna minor lm ethylene glycol eg and formic acid fa solutions in equimolar concentrations of 0 134 and 0 100 g l respectively were selected as organic pollutants photo oxidation of 300 ml eg and fa solutions was carried out in the purification unit with the most effective photocatalytic coating on a silicate carrier in separate experiments the time t of photo oxidation of fa and eg solutions for further bio testing was 0 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 h the flow rate of the purified solution through the unit was 0 7 l min the degree of toxicity of the purified solution after photo oxidation was estimated by changing the total area st of the green biomass lm and changing the values of live weight mt in comparison with the control sample without toxin the photo oxidised solution after each experiment was divided into three equal parts and placed in identical cylindrical cuvettes of 100 ml volume and 3 3 cm base diameter lm was cultivated in the cuvette for 6 days at a temperature of 25 2 c under 12 h phytospectral led lighting the number of single lm plants in each cuvette was chosen so that the total area s0 of lm green biomass in each cuvette corresponded to 40 2 of the cuvette area which corresponded to 51 3 plants the average st value for the three experiments was estimated by photofixing and counting the number of pixels of green ranges inside the image boundaries of lm leaf plates using specialised software that we developed the total live weight of lm plants in three cuvettes was determined using an ml54 01 mettler toledo ag scale changes in the ph of fa and eg solutions as a function of photo oxidation time were determined using a seven compact ph ion s220 mettler toledo ag ph meter 3 results and discussions 3 1 selection of silicate carrier biologically inert porous materials used in water treatment systems of fish farms were chosen as carriers for photocatalytic coatings because each of these materials represented a type of silicate material the following materials were chosen for research porous glass carrier s ceramic carrier b and glass ceramic carrier f the xrd data show that they belong to the specified silicate material types fig 2 the diffractogram patterns of the porous glass carrier s shows a wide range halo at 20 30 2θ and single low intensity reflexes which are typical for silicate glasses wide low intensity peaks belonging to aluminosilicates of magnesium calcium as well as sodium are noted in the diffractogram of ceramic carrier b two groups of reflexes can be distinguished in the diffractogram of the glass ceramic carrier f the first group these are the reflexes with the highest intensity belonging to sio2 crystal quartz the second group of reflexes belongs to sodium aluminosilicate close to na1 16al2si77o158 38 their intensity is much less expressed therefore sio2 in the form of crystalline quartz is the main component of this silicate carrier following the description of the synthesis of photocatalytically active compositions based on solid solutions of strontium bismuthate 30 and bismuth silicates 40 42 mentioned in the literature two temperatures of isothermal annealing 500 c and 700 c respectively were selected for fixing the photocatalytic coating on the carrier when creating photocatalytic coatings the carrier must meet the following characteristics 1 have an open porous structure 2 the thermal stability of the bulk porous structure of the carrier should be higher than the synthesis temperature of the catalytically active layer qualitative evaluation of the porous structure of the test silicate carriers depending on the temperature of isothermal annealing and the number of heating cycles was carried out by examining mb sorption activity on their surface fig 3 heating of samples with isothermal exposure at 500 c and 700 c fig 3a showed that only carrier f meets the specified requirements for preserving acceptable porosity estimated from mb sorption carrier s showed the highest initial value of sorption activity but the fusion of its porous structure begins before the temperature of photocatalytic coatings synthesis carrier b is characterised by the lowest porosity among investigated carriers fig 3a based on a comparative analysis of sorption activity carrier f was chosen for research on the influence of heating cyclicity on the preservation of the porous structure fig 3 b it maintained an acceptable porous structure through up to three cycles of heating at 500 c and 700 c it after each of the three 3 h cycles of heating a decrease in sorption activity was observed at both temperatures of isothermal annealing based on the research carried out a carrier f was selected for photocatalytic coatings with a maximum coating quantity of four 3 2 characterisation of photocatalytic coating for the creation of photocatalytically active coatings the method of impregnation of silicate carrier f with 10 solution of complexes of strontium nitrate and bismuth with sorbite in ethanol was used the following were investigated compressive strength limit surface morphology phase composition sorption activity and photocatalytic properties of coatings applied from 1 4 times on silicate carrier f after isothermal annealing at 500 c and 700 c the designations of the obtained photocatalytic coatings in the form of x y where x is the annealing temperature of coatings and y is the multiple coating applications that are accepted in the article appearance sem results and compressive strength of samples annealed at 500 c are shown in fig 4 according to sem data an increase in the amount of applied photocatalytic phase is observed in the samples coated 1 2 times while the 3 and 4 coatings show agglomeration and crystallisation of this phase the study of the compressive strength limit shows a drop in its values for samples coated 1 4 times which is probably due to the incorporation of bismuth and strontium into the structure of silicate carrier with an increase in the number of coating times indirectly the same is shown by the decrease in the degree of colouration of samples in a row from 2 to 4 coatings because among the compounds under consideration the most pigmented in yellow colour are phases of strontium bismuthate fig 4 analysis of the surface morphology of annealed carrier f samples coated with a precursor mixture 1 4 times at 700 c shows a gradual fusing of the phase that stains the sample in yellow with the formation of a new phase that is uncoloured and probably refers to bismuth or strontium silicates of different stoichiometry fig 5 a 1 5 fold increase in the compressive strength of 700 4 specimens compared to 500 4 specimens can be explained by the formation of a melt of the synthesised phases that covers the entire surface of the silicate carrier decrease of the intensity of colour in a row of samples from the first coating to the fourth is probably caused by embedding bismuth and strontium in the structure of a silicate carrier with the formation of poorly coloured silicate phases on all diffractograms of samples fig 6 three main groups of reflexes can be distinguished with different number of coatings 1 reflexes of the initial carrier 2 reflexes of strontium bismuthate that form a catalytic coating 3 reflexes of the phases resulting from the chemical interaction of the coating substance with the substance carrier f detailed identification of individual phases is difficult since for many of them the most intense reflexes are superposition among the diffractograms of all investigated samples the most intense reflexes are seen in sio2 which is one of the main phases of carrier f fig 2 the intensity of this reflex decreases as the multiplicity of coatings in both series of samples increases the intensity of the remaining reflexes of the carrier f also decreases proportionally on the contrary the intensity of the peaks belonging to the new phases of chemical interaction of the carrier and the coating as well as the reflexes of the applied strontium bismuthate increases the formation of strontium bismuthate phases at a variety of annealing temperatures is different for a series of annealed samples at 500 c there is a gradual increase in the intensity of reflexes of strontium bismuthate corresponding to several solid solutions based on srbi4o7 fig 6a the highest intensity of strontium bismuthate reflexes is registered in sample 500 4 the position of the reflexes largely corresponds with that of strontium bismuthate with stoichiometry close to sr bi 1 5 as the number of coatings increases the sr bi ratio changes due to a more intense interaction of strontium with silicate phases as a result the photocatalytic coating with strontium is impoverished which is confirmed by the appearance of strontium silicate phases fig 6a for a series of the samples annealed at 700 c a different sequence of photocatalytically active coatings formation is observed fig 6b strontium bismuthate reflexes are noted only for 700 1 and 700 2 samples at a higher coating index for 700 3 and 700 4 samples strontium bismuthate reflexes disappear completely instead the reflexes belonging to strontium silicate sr2sio4 and sr3sio5 and bismuth silicate bi4si3o12 appear as a result the photocatalytically active coating at more than two applications and 700 c annealing temperature is fully involved in the chemical interaction with the substance carrier f with the formation of corresponding silicates this process is typical for samples obtained both at 500 c and 700 c but for a series of samples annealed at 700 c it is much more intense due to the higher annealing temperature to the maximum extent the process is expressed for the sample 700 4 which is obtained at the highest number of coatings and the annealing temperature thus obtaining a photocatalytic material at 500 c at carrier f is optimal for the formation of the photocatalytic phase of strontium bismuthate analysis of sorption activity table 2 of samples with different number of coatings and annealed at temperatures of 500 c and 700 c showed a tendency of decreasing at average 1 77 times for samples with 1 and 2 coatings and 2 17 times for samples with 3 and 4 coatings compared to the initial carrier f annealed at the same temperatures the obtained comparative results of the sorption activity study are satisfactory with the sem data figs 4 and 5 the decrease in values of sorption activity is explained by the decrease in surface porosity of the carrier due to agglomeration and fusion of the applied coating in samples coated 3 and 4 times during isothermal annealing photocatalytic activity of the samples under study was estimated from the decrease in mb concentration in 400 min after the sorption equilibrium between the catalyst and the substrate was established before the photocatalytic experiment the samples under study were placed in the dark for 12 h in mb solution of 10 μmol l concentration to account for the sorption processes the photocatalytic activity of coatings synthesised at different temperatures on carrier f in comparison with the experiment without photocatalytic coating is presented in fig 7 analysis of photocatalytic curves for samples obtained at different temperatures on carrier f shows that all samples have photocatalytic activity in comparison with uncoated carrier f samples coated 1 2 times at the two synthesis temperatures show the best result the best photocatalytic activity is characterised by the sample 500 2 fig 7a due to the optimal distribution of the coating on the carrier fig 4 as well as the appearance of photo active phases of strontium bismuthate in its structure fig 6a which is indirectly confirmed by an increase in the degree of colouration of the sample further application of coatings on the carrier f at 500 c leads to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of 500 3 and 500 4 samples due to the agglomeration of the photo active phase and a decrease in the surface area of mb contact with the coating fig 4 on the other hand three and fourfold annealing of samples at 500 c leads to the destruction of the photocatalyst containing strontium bismuthate due to the transition of a part of bismuth and strontium into the structure of a silicate carrier and is accompanied by the formation of phases of bismuth and strontium silicates fig 6a for samples obtained at 700 c a decrease in the photocatalytic activity from 700 1 to 700 4 fig 7b is observed due to the gradual destruction of the photo active phase of strontium bismuthate and the formation of less photo active phases of bismuth and strontium silicates fig 6b which in turn is indirectly confirmed by the data of scanning electron microscopy and a decrease in the colour of samples fig 5 thus according to the data on compression strength sorption activity and the best photocatalytic activity carrier f with a twofold photocatalytic coating annealed at 500 c was chosen for further studies 3 3 stability of photocatalytic coating one of the main technological requirements for photocatalytic materials is that their photocatalytic activity must not be reduced through repeated use however in systems that automatically clean the photocatalytic material coating the adhesion and mechanical strength factor of photocatalytic coating with the carrier is important in this respect to assess of the photocatalytic activity and mechanical stability with repeated use of the photocatalytic coating sample 500 2 was put through ten repeated uses for photo oxidation of mb in a purification unit fig 1 after each photo oxidation cycle the mb semi conversion time and the total mass of 12 samples 500 2 after pre drying were evaluated table 3 it was observed that during the three initial photo oxidation cycles the total mass of samples decreased and the mb semi conversion time increased this may have been caused by flaking off of the top layers of photocatalytic coating due to low adhesion under the friction of rotating silicate carriers against the cleaning brush module of the unit fig 1 beyond the third cycle of photo oxidation the loss of mass of the photocatalytic samples was not significant this indicates a strong adhesion and good mechanical strength of photocatalytic coating of 500 2 sample also due to the clearing of the surface of the photocatalytic coating from the deposits of mb decomposition products by the brush modules a stable photo oxidation operation of the photocatalytic coating is observed after the 3rd cycle of photo oxidation table 3 3 4 water purification bio testing researches show 54 56 that photocatalytic oxidation of organic substances is carried out by highly active particles photo hole h hydroxyl radicals oh and peroxide forms of oxygen o2 data show 38 56 that the ratio and number of oxidative particles largely depend on the elemental and phase composition of photocatalytic material these factors make the task of determining the path of photochemical decomposition of toxic organic compounds into safe substances laborious the path of decomposition depends on the type of photocatalyst used and the chemical structure of the organic toxin a theoretical substantiation of the pathways of photochemical decomposition of organic toxins would permit us to assume the probable composition of the mixture of products of photo oxidation and based on that estimate their total toxicity in comparison with the initial pollutant content in the solution such an approach will facilitate the advance estimation of the degree of environmental risks when justifying the choice of time for photocatalytic oxidation of an organic pollutant incorrect estimation of the photocatalytic oxidation time of an organic pollutant may lead to the accumulation of decomposition products in the solution to be cleaned the resulting toxicity may even exceed toxicity original substance in this study the following were selected as real organic pollutants eg as a substance with toxic products by photo oxidation fa as the substance that in one stage converts to safe compounds water and carbon dioxide based on the data given in table 4 and the theoretically possible observed paths of photo oxidation of eg lead simultaneously to up to seven products of photo oxidation that process of photochemical purification in solution theoretically can be as shown in fig 8 at least three decomposition substances of eg formaldehyde formic acid and oxalic acid exceed in toxicity the initial eg by 3 40 times table 4 at the same time the substances that directly convert to water and carbon dioxide according to fig 8 are carboxylic acids formic acid or oxalic acid on the one hand these compounds are capable of shifting the ph of the purified aqueous solution towards the acidic which would increase the chemical load on the photocatalytic material on the other hand increased acidity would make it impossible to use bio testing of these solutions because of the rapid death of living organisms in the solution taking into account these problems the photo oxidation efficiency of photocatalytic material 500 2 for aqueous solutions of organic pollutants eg and fa in the developed purification unit was estimated at initial concentrations to be 0 134 and 0 100 g l respectively eg is one of the most common components of aqueous coolants in various industrial systems eg concentrations in aqueous coolants range from 40 to 60 which unless disposed of properly can greatly increase environmental risks disposal of untreated used coolants from car repair shops pose risk to aquatic life fa is the last of the carbon containing organic pollutants that are theoretically decomposable by photochemical oxidation the degree of toxicity of eg and fa solutions subjected to photochemical oxidation during 0 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 h has been estimated by the changes that occurred in the areas of green plates st and the value of live weight mt of aquatic biological object lm relative to the idle experience without adding pollutants table 5 changes in the ph of eg and fa aqueous solutions depending on the photo oxidation time were studied fig 9 during the operation the photocatalyst can generate a fixed amount of highly active particles and the accumulation of photo oxidation products from the initial pollutant leads to the redistribution of these particles for oxidation both the pollutant itself and products of its decomposition conversion of all photo oxidation products into non toxic water and carbon dioxide passes through the limiting stages of oxidation of organic acids fig 8 the maximum oxidised eg products according to the scheme are formic acid and oxalic acid given the limited number of oxidising particles it can be assumed that photo oxidation at the initial stages will lead to the accumulation of organic acids in the treated aqueous solution which will increase the overall toxicity of the solution and a shift its ph towards the higher acidity this pattern is confirmed by the analysis of bio test results using lm and the study of ph change in eg solution subjected to photo oxidation within 1 16 h fig 9a the following 16 h of photo oxidation of the aqueous eg solution did not lead to complete detoxication and shifting of ph towards a neutrality the probable reasons for this could be the accumulation of difficult to oxidise substances in the solution decrease of photocatalyst activity due to the shift in the ph of the solution redistribution of the oxidising particles generated by the photocatalyst in as photochemical decomposition products of eg the quantitative analysis of the decline in the eg concentration and the analysis of the changes in the eg concentration in the products of its photo oxidation were not the main aims of this study on the other hand photo oxidation of fa within 32 h showed a complete absence of toxic effects of the pollutant on lm fig 9b this result can be explained by the fact that all highly active oxidising particles generated by the photocatalyst were spent on oxidation of only one substance fa this agrees closely with the data on the increase of ph 6 8 towards the neutral medium after 32 h of photo oxidation of fa fig 9b this experiment indirectly confirms that the selected photocatalyst is stable under conditions of changing ph the estimation of the change in st value was made using the software developed by us in automatic mode to compensate for the possible error in the automatic measurement of st value an additional control parameter was introduced namely the assessed effect of photo oxidised solutions of eg and fa on lm as indicated by the total live weight of plants mt the dynamics of st value change coincided satisfactorily with the change in mt values depending on photo oxidation time table 5 it facilitated the consideration of errors of automatic measurement of the surface area of the above water part of lm as an acceptable measure for estimating the degree of toxicity of the pollutants resulting from photo oxidisation for bio testing a study to assess the degree of toxicity of treated eg and fa aqueous solutions has shown the importance of ensuring the completeness of photo oxidation of organic toxins by photocatalytic treatment systems because the total toxicity of photo oxidation products may turn out to be much higher than the toxicity of the original pollutant therefore the assessment of photocatalyst s performance based on the analysis of the degree of bleaching of organic dyes of different chemical nature 58 61 cannot be an indicator of an effective reduction of the degree of toxicity of real pollutants in wastewater treatment similarly assessment of the quality of wastewater treatment by photocatalytic systems by express tests is based on measurements of physico chemical indicators 49 62 electrical conductivity redox potential amount of dissolved oxygen turbidity can give false confidence in the safety of treated wastewater because express sensors cannot characterise the presence of toxic decomposition products of the original pollutants in this regard for a maximum consideration of the degree of environmental risks associated with photo oxidation processes it is necessary to conduct qualitative and quantitative studies of the degree of organic pollutant destruction by photocatalyst using the methods of analytical chemistry gas liquid chromatography in close conjunction with the assessment of biotoxicity as indicated by the changes in the populations of aquatic organisms 4 conclusions 1 an experimental purification unit was fabricated photocatalyst placed on rotating cylindrical carriers was placed in the unit cylindrical carriers make a rotational motion in the surface layer of the water solution of the pollutant a distinctive structural feature of the developed unit was the presence of a module for automatic cleaning of the photocatalytic coating on the surface of the cylinders the unit created a flow type of contact of polluted water with rotating 25 rpm carriers of photocatalytic material at a liquid flow rate of 0 7 l min 2 based on the evaluation of sorption activity a glass ceramic carrier was selected to preserve the required porosity at the temperatures 500 c and 700 c used for forming the photocatalytic coating it was observed that the best combination of durability and photocatalytic characteristics was obtained in silicate carrier by twofold coating with stoichiometry close to sr bi 1 5 formed at 500 c analysis of xrd and sem data shows the presence of a continuous coating of strontium bismuthate the increase of annealing temperature up to 700 c and increase of the number of coats up to four led to more intensive chemical interaction of photocatalytic coating with silicate carrier this led to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of samples obtained at the highest annealing temperature and a greater number of coats the average mb semi conversion time after four cycles of testing was 93 min 3 samples of the coated carriers that showed the highest photocatalytic activity at mb oxidation were tested for photo oxidation efficiency with actual organic pollutants a comparative assessment of the effectiveness of reduction in toxic effects was made by testing with pollutants 1 oxidising one stage fa and another 2 that resulted in photo oxidation intermediates eg it was observed that the dynamics of the potential changes in the biotoxicity of water runoff after the stage of photocatalytic treatment depended on the type of pollutant using the analysis of growth suppression of the indicator object lm using eg as the example the accumulation of toxic chemical compounds in the treated solution that were more than in the original pollutant was experimentally confirmed it was shown that photo oxidation by the material developed from eg solution in 32 h caused only partial reduction in the biotoxicity of the pollutant and the intermediates this makes it possible to recommend increasing the photocatalytic treatment time for wastewater containing organic pollutants with photo oxidation intermediates and additional studies to determine the safety of the treated wastewater oxidation of fa under the same conditions showed complete absence of toxic effect of photocatalytically treated solution on lm growth process therefore for wastewaters containing organic pollutants that oxidise in one stage it is sufficient to select only the optimal photo oxidation time 4 application of the structural solution implemented in the experimental purification unit namely automatic cleaning of the surface of the cylinders coated with strontium bismuthate photocatalytic material in industrial wastewater purification can be an effective strategy for achieving higher efficiency in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors state that there is no conflict of interest

nanosheets this work delineates adsorption mechanism and merits of incorporating graphene for enhancing adsorbent s potential for selenium removal from contaminated water the extraordinary electronic and textural properties of graphene sheets make it a physical support to stabilize γ feooh nanoflakes substantially improving adsorption capacities and kinetics besides strengthening particle stability maximum adsorption capacity of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples estimated by langmuir adsorption isotherms observed to be 40 09 and 83 44 mg g respectively the adsorption mechanism of se vi to the surfaces of adsorbents was found to be monolayer and of chemisorption in nature the ph dependence experiments showed that γ feooh exhibited maximum adsorption capacity at a ph close to the pzc 5 97 1 which are in suitable for real ground water conditions keywords lepidocrocite graphene nanoflakes water purification se removal 1 introduction worldwide natural water bodies are being polluted by irrational industrial and domestic discharge resulting in great stress for potable water heavy metals in drinking water are of serious concern in human health and environment point of view due to their extreme toxicity selenium se is one such pollutant which is already recognized as an emerging pollutant of concern in india and many other countries 1 in addition to its natural presence in groundwater se is a major industrial pollutant that diffuses into the environment mainly through several industrial activities high doses of se are hazardous not only to human beings but also to animals and plants high se doses are presumably the major risk for the development of critical tumours ailments related to kidney and liver colorectal and breast cancers melanoma and lymphoid neoplasms 2 4 world health organization who has set the maximum acceptable se concentration in drinking water at 40 μg l 4 and recommended that 25 35 μg day of se is essential for human body nutrition mainly through food and water 5 in this regard recent studies recommend to decrease the who limit of se in drinking water to 1 μg l due to its acute toxicity 4 se iv and se vi forms are the most toxic 4 5 with se iv species being relatively more toxic than se vi species 5 8 however se vi species are more frequently present and more difficult to be removed from water in comparison of se iv species 5 6 therefore in the present study se vi removal from water has been attempted successfully india has threatening levels of se in ground and surface water of some locations especially in northern parts of the country 9 12 this warrants development of low cost and effective technologies to remove such toxic ions from water adsorption is considered as one of the most effective technologies for removing toxic inorganic ions from water in this regard the development of new generation adsorbents which show maximum high removal capacity and no toxicity are of prime attention in the related research area nowadays iron oxy hydroxides are an important class of ubiquitous minerals in soil and aquatic environments they are environmentally pertinent systems responsible for numerous geological and biological processes including adsorption alloying and phase transformations among many lepidocrocite γ feooh is the second most prevalent iron oxy hydroxide polymorph thermodynamically stable next to goethite interestingly the stability of γ feooh increases profoundly with a concomitant decrease in their particles size at nanoscale particles 13 with a moderate occurrence γ feooh forms naturally in soils at different anaerobic conditions typically in companion with goethite 14 more than that γ feooh is a major corrosion product from many ferrous constructions and carbon steel based products in association with magnetite and hematite 14 15 the crystal structure of γ feooh is orthorhombic based on cubic close packing sequence built by double chains of fe octahedra placed on their corners these corners are attached to the adjacent corners forming zigzag sheets stabilized by hydrogen atoms between the layers the layers are arranged perpendicular to 010 basal face in the direction of c axis 16 26 lath like morphology and tubular shapes are the common geometries for γ feooh polymorph both natural and synthetic forms 17 for instance studies however inferred that γ feooh initially forms rod like particles and subjected to time dependent self aggregation at 010 surfaces to form lath like morphology with remarkable decrease in its specific surface area 18 this structural system accounts for 84 of the total surface area which is major surface characteristic responsible for adsorption properties 16 the crystallinity of γ feooh could be controlled by aging time and temperature long hours aging results in higher crystallinity 14 γ feooh phase is typically formed by reduction of fe2 precursors the hydrolysis of iron precursors commonly occurs at neutral or slightly acidic conditions and temperature of 60 100 c this synthesis process is the most widely used method for the synthesis of γ feooh phase 19 20 tresintsi and his team 20 have designed reactor for continuous production of γ feooh with high synthesis rate of 0 25 g h at ph ranges of 5 5 8 on the other hand electrochemical synthesis protocol has also been explored for the synthesis of γ feooh 21 22 like other iron oxy hydroxides γ feooh nanostructures have been effectively used for the removal of heavy metals from water 5 6 12 16 20 23 28 the adsorption of se ions to γ feooh surfaces follows inner sphere mechanism 20 23 28 however the exact mechanism is still debated to date few studies on the use of γ feooh for selenium uptake from water were reported 12 28 s das et al 12 have studied the adsorption of se by ferrihydrite goethite and γ feooh with a high adsorption affinity to ferrihydrite followed by γ feooh however their findings found no adsorption on γ feooh surfaces at low doses 1 g l mainly due to macro size particles the results show that at extremely high dose of 15 g l only 59 of se vi ions initial concentration of 8000 ppb were adsorbed y kang et al 28 have studied the adsorption capacities of hematite goethite and γ feooh adsorbents for uptake of se from water the obtained results show that maximum adsorption capacity qmax of γ feooh adsorbent was 4 5 and 1 5 mg g for se iv and se vi respectively nowadays research on the use of graphene based composites for heavy metals removal from water has received increased attention 29 magnetic iron oxides graphene oxide composite has been used to remove selenium se iv and se vi ions from water and the results show quick adsorption kinetics for se iv 6 the results also investigate the impacts of graphene on the adsorption properties however in the previous study 6 iron oxides themselves show negligible se adsorption capacity and accordingly improper composite candidates were selected leading to low adsorption capacities moreover it is well reported that magnetic iron oxides 30 and oxy hydroxides 31 possess intrinsic enzyme like peroxidase activity which is a useful property for degradation of hydrogen peroxide phenols and other enzymes from solutions 30 reduced graphene oxide γ feooh composite was also synthesized by the aid of hydrazine hydrate reducing agent and used for the degradation of phenols 31 to date however no study has thoroughly investigated the sorption of se on the surface of γ feooh and γ feooh decorated on graphene sheets in the present study γ feooh nanoflakes of high se adsorption capacity have been added through in situ synthesis with multi layered graphene mlg to form a novel and multifunctional adsorbent with extraordinary adsorption properties as a matter of fact graphene increases the surface adsorption sites and decreases the surface energy of bare nanoparticles 29 33 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nabh4 alfa aeser 99 and fecl3 sigma aldrich acs reagent 97 were used as reducing agent and precursor respectively distilled water was prepared in the laboratory using water purification system merck milli pore make and was used as a solvent and for washing purposes in the experiments laboratory ph meter thermo make was used to measure ph during the synthesis and adsorption studies ph meter was calibrated using the commercially available buffer solutions of ph 4 01 ph 7 0 ph 10 01 thermo scientific orion all laboratory ar grade chemicals were used as purchased without further purification 2 2 synthesis of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples in a simple two step hydrolysis method 4 86 g of fecl3 and 1 1 g of nabh4 were properly dissolved in 300 and 100 ml distilled water in the first step respectively in the subsequent step nabh4 solution was incrementally added to the fecl3 solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 15 min until all iron precipitates black precipitate of fe totally in water under high acidic medium ph 1 5 in next step 0 38 g of nabh4 was properly dissolved in 50 ml distilled water and this solution was again added to the above solution the resultant suspension was stirred for 3 h until the color of the suspension changed to yellowish red indicating the formation of γ feooh the precipitate was filtered using vacuum pump filtration system and washed with copious quantity of water and ethanol and then dried at 120 c for 2 h in air conditions in the case of γ feooh mlg sample 100 mg of mlg was well dispersed in 100 ml ethanol and added to the precursor solution during the first step the rest of the synthesis process remains unchanged 2 3 adsorption experiments γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples in powder form were used as adsorbents for uptake se vi ions from water at different doses se vi concentrations contact times and ph these parameters are used to study the adsorption properties of these adsorbents at different conditions specially to explore its potential under different conditions of practical relevance such studies are also equally important to understand the overall properties of adsorbent for its possible modification inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms was used for selenium concentration determination in water samples the calibration was done using high purity selenium standards distilled water spiked with pre determined concentrations of se vi was used for adsorption experiments graphene supported γ feooh composite was also studied for the removal of se vi and the impact of graphene on the adsorption properties was systematically explored the experiments for se vi removal from water were performed by adding predefined doses of lepidocrocite adsorbent to the se vi solutions batch and kinetic studies were repeated at a wider range of se vi concentrations 300 10000 μg l to further understand the adsorption process se vi stock solutions were prepared by adding appropriate amounts of 1000 mg l se vi selenate inorganic ventures usa to distilled water and used as test solutions adsorption kinetics was studied using an optimized adsorbent doses in the range of 10 1000 mg l and the adsorption process was monitored at different contact times of the adsorbent with the test solution starting from 1 min to 24 h all adsorption experiments were carried out with 100 ml of selenate solution by varying the adsorbent dose in the range of 0 01 1 0 g l ph study was performed at se vi concentration of 600 ppb and adsorbent dose of 250 mg l and the experiments were performed at varying ph of 3 5 7 9 and 12 the ph was altered by addition of 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh solutions merck the flasks containing se vi solutions with adsorbent in all adsorption experiments were exposed to a uniform shaking using a laboratory shaker make remi at 150 rpm for several hours at room temperature in the final step samples were filtered using 0 22 μm disposable membrane filters and the filtered water samples were analyzed by icp ms perkin elmer nexion 300x test solution was optimized along with each experiment to estimate the initial se vi concentrations adsorption capacity of the adsorbents with respect to se vi was studied using langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetics was also investigated using pseudo 1st and 2nd order isotherms and adsorption parameters were calculated in each case test solutions selenate solution without adsorbent dose were analyzed in each experiment to estimate the initial concentration of selenate se vi 2 4 zeta potential measurements aqueous solutions of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples were prepared by addition of 10 mg l 1 γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples to distilled water and then subjected to ultrasonication sonicator pci analytics for 30 min the ph of the stock solution was 6 5 0 1 the desired ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 n hcl sigma aldrich and 0 1 n naoh merck solutions the ph was monitored by ph meter oakion eutech instruments suspensions were shaken for 30 min to ensure equilibrium final ph of the suspensions was measured and point zero charge was determined with nanosizer sz 100 horiba scientific japan at 25 c using dynamic light scattering method 2 5 characterization field emission scanning electron microscope fesem model zeiss ultra 55 operated at accelerating voltages of 5 kv was used to record the micrographs transmission electron microscope tem model fei technai g2 s twin operated at accelerating voltage of 200 kv was used to study the morphology and crystallinity qualitative of the samples x ray diffraction xrd study was carried out to identify the structure of the materials as well as to understand the crystallinity the powder xrd patterns were recorded at a scanning rate of 0 020 s 1 in the 2θ range of typically 10 70 using x bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å operated at 40 kv 30 ma the diffraction patterns were compared with standard patterns available in the internationally accepted databases icdd raman spectroscopic study to understand the phase characteristics of different samples was carried out by using 532 nm laser line of nd yag laser the spectral resolution of all the measurements was 3 cm 1 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy model nicolet 380 measurements were mainly used to study the possible functional groups on the particles surfaces optical properties of the samples were characterized by using uv vis spectroscopy jasco v 570 it uses a resolution of 1 nm in the range of 200 800 nm at a scanning speed of 200 nm min specific surface area was measured by the bet brunauer emmett teller model using a micromeritics surface area analyzer asap 2020 samples were vacuum degassed using liquid n2 at 60 c for at least 10 h the point zero charge of the γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples was measured with nanosizer sz 100 horiba scientific japan using light scattering method thermo gravimetric analysis perkin elmer sta 6000 of the adsorbents performed by heating the sample from 25 c to 600 c in air the rate of heating was 10 c min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural analysis the peaks in the x ray diffractograms fig 1 a of both the samples γ feooh and γ feooh mlg are matched well and inferred as crystalline phases of lepidocrocite the structure of the samples is constituted of an orthorhombic crystal system icdd file no 00 044 1415 in γ feooh mlg sample peaks of multilayer graphene icdd file no 00 025 0284 were also observed as shown in fig 1a and b bet specific surface area of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples was estimated as high as 121 2 m2 g and 192 5 m2 g respectively this substantial increase of sample s surface area is expected to increase exposure of adsorption sites and hence adsorptive uptake of se vi ions the obtained results from xrd analysis fig 1c of γ feooh sample in both fresh and used forms after selenium adsorption at high concentrations of 10 000 μg l indicate that se vi ions adsorbed to the γ feooh surfaces have no considerable changes to the structure due to the se vi corporation correspondingly the obtained results from fig 1e of γ feooh mlg sample both fresh and selenate containing samples point out that no phase changes due to the adsorption of 10 000 μg l of se vi ions to the γ feooh mlg surfaces high magnification observations from xrd patterns were plotted and shown in fig 1d and f for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples respectively it was observed that a shift towards a lower 2θ is clearly shown in all the peaks and depends mainly on the se concentration specifically adsorption data shows that γ feooh sample fig 1d contains 7500 μg l of se vi ions less than that of 10 000 μg l on the surface of γ feooh mlg sample fig 1f therefore a uniform shift to the left was observed in the samples peaks with 2θ of 0 16 and 0 2 for γ feooh with the range 2θ of 25 29 and γ feooh mlg with the range 2θ of 34 7 39 0 samples respectively this increase in shift in the case of γ feooh mlg sample is mainly due to the adsorption of higher se ions which acts as a surface dopant 52 3 2 sem and tem analysis fig 2 a c shows scanning electron micrographs of γ feooh sample the images show uniform and faceted nano flakes of about 20 nm thickness and up to 600 nm length fig 2d f exhibits sem micrographs of γ feooh mlg sample the results show nano flakes with dimension much less than in the previous case 5 nm thickness and 200 nm length that is plausibly owing to the role of graphene that prohibited crystal growth of the nano flakes fig 3 a d shows tem micrographs and saed pattern of γ feooh sample the observation from the micrographs reveal that each flake that is shown in fig 2 is a combination of several nanorods with different aspect ratio adhered together to make nanosheets however results from fig 3a show the presence of nanoparticles along with the nanoflakes which support the arguments that fine nanoparticles is produced at an early stage of the reaction and they are recrystallized to rods followed by nanoflakes 33 later on these nanorods continue growing in the same direction along 001 plane fig 3c with the same manner particles followed by rods and then rods aggregates to form flakes to make nano flakes of γ feooh high resolution tem image fig 3c shows the lattice spaces of γ feooh nanoflakes the lattice spacing of 6 45 å is matching with 200 crystalline planes of γ feooh 24 27 selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 3d obtained from γ feooh sample inferred that the sample is highly crystalline and single phase in nature fig 3 e h shows tem micrographs and saed pattern of γ feooh mlg sample the obtained results from tem micrographs confirm the presence of mlg and indicate that nanoflakes were dispersed well amongst the graphene sheets these nanoflakes however have smaller sizes and flatter surfaces it can be inferred from tem micrographs that three types of γ feooh morphologies were observed in γ feooh mlg sample nanorods nanoflakes and small nanoparticles but nanoflakes seem to be the dominant morphology the presence of small nanoparticles however might be due to impurities of iron oxides 38 these observations are consistent with reported results 31 and can be explained that dense carboxyl hydroxyl and other active groups on the graphene surfaces create strong pinning anchoring forces to the small particles which in turn hinder their growth in other directions or even recrystallization to other geometries 32 further lattice spacing of 3 4 å shown for individual γ feooh nanorod fig 3g is matching with 101 crystalline planes saed pattern showing dotted ring pattern as depicted in fig 3h confirmed that γ feooh nanoparticles on mlg are polycrystalline in nature thus this saed pattern reconfirms that graphene does not allow individual crystals to grow 3 3 effect of ph on the synthesis of γ feooh the effect of solution ph on the phase structure and morphology was studied in general lepidocrocite synthesis was performed in mild acidic medium ph 5 fig 5 shows xrd diffractograms of as synthesized samples at different ph the results inferred that γ feooh formation was favored in mild acidic conditions at strong acidic conditions ph 5 the peaks are broader but with lower intensity indicating presence of fine crystallite and amorphous nature of material it is worth mentioning that the high production yield at strong acidity is difficult due to the dissolution of iron species at these conditions at mild acidic reaction condition ph 5 γ feooh xrd peaks observed are intense but not broader indicating the formation of highly crystalline γ feooh but with larger crystallite dimensions than previous case at neutral ph condition a mixed morphology of γ feooh γ fe2o3 was observed but the dominant peaks are for γ fe2o3 phase in basic ph conditions basicity facilitates the oxidation and favors the formation of single phase γ fe2o3 therefore addition of naoh becomes unfavorable when γ feooh was sought as the final product the morphology of the as synthesized materials at different ph was observed with significant changes the obtained particles are nanoflakes at ph 3 and ph 5 however the nanoflakes obtained at ph 3 were of smaller features than those of ph 5 fig 5a b these observations were also consistent with the broadening of xrd peaks of fig 4 a and b morphology and structure of the γ feooh tend to slightly change to mixed phase of γ feooh γ fe2o3 as shown in xrd results fig 4 with increasing ph value ph 7 mixed morphology of nanoflakes and nanoparticles was observed as shown in fig 5 c consequently with increasing the ph above neutral base catalyzed dehydration of lepidocrocite leads to the formation of single phase maghemite γ fe2o3 fig 5d with irregular morphology without the presence of nanoflakes or nanorods 34 3 4 surface properties of γ feooh surface properties of as synthesized γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples were also studied by using zeta potential measurements fig 6 a the influence of solution ph on the adsorption properties and phase stability was also studied the point of zero charge pzc is defined as the isoelectric point at which the surface charge density equals to zero less hydrated or high oxidation compounds have low pzc and vice versa 43 generally zeta potential curve as a function of ph shows positive charge at acidic solutions and negative charges at alkaline solutions 36 43 at pzc the surface charge is neutral and the electrostatic attraction forces between surface of adsorbent and adsorbate ions is negligible the adsorption of anions such as selenate vi is more favored at ph below pzc due to positively charges surface of adsorbent that results ionic attractive forces for adsorption the experimental results show that pzc of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples were recorded at ph 5 97 and ph 6 4 respectively fig 6a this little increase can be explained in view of the extraordinary electronic and textural properties of graphene which undoubtedly affects the pzc these values correlate well with previous studies 23 40 ph adsorption study fig 6b and its influence on the adsorption properties and kinetics of se vi removal from water were explored at room conditions t 25 c fixed adsorbent dose 250 mg l and fixed se vi concentration 650 ppb the acidic and basic solutions of se vi were prepared by adding dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh solutions fig 6b depicts adsorption data of se removal percentage as a function of ph which is a useful parameter for studying adsorption behavior under different conditions iron oxy hydroxides such as β feooh and γ feooh get stabilized at acidic solutions therefore improved adsorption performance of γ feooh can be expected below the neutral ph for γ feooh adsorbent rapid adsorption kinetics was observed at ph 3 5 and 7 however slight decrease in adsorption at ph 5 and 3 may be due to the slow leaching or dissolution of fe cations into the solution however above neutral ph the se vi uptake drastically decreases as the ph increases specifically the results show that at ph 9 only 12 5 of the se vi ions were adsorbed and 4 2 removal at ph 12 this is due to repulsive forces that arise due to negatively charged surface at basic ph which is above the adsorbent s pzc value also at higher ph hydroxyl ion concentration is steadily increased and are adsorbed on the surface of γ feooh nanoflakes thus strongly competing with se vi for occupying the adsorption sites interestingly the main advantage derived from the previous results of γ feooh adsorbent is its high adsorption at ph around neutral ph 5 7 which is a range close to the real groundwater for γ feooh mlg sample adsorption was maximized at a wide ph range of 3 7 carbon nanomaterials typically show good adsorption properties in acidic ph 46 specifically the results show that 99 4 17 8 and 7 2 of the se vi ions were adsorbed at ph 7 ph 9 and ph 12 respectively this significant drop in adsorption observed at highly basic solution ph 9 and 12 is correlated to pzc value as similar to observed in case of γ feooh the thermo gravimetric analysis fig s1 supplementary information of the samples γ feooh and γ feooh mlg shows thermal stability up to 200 c ftir spectra of both the samples γ feooh and γ feooh mlg figs s3a and s3b supplementary information shows disappearance or weakening of oh stretching vibration modes after se adsorption which indicates hydrogen bonding interaction of selenate anions as a mechanism of strong adsorption chemisorption this also leads to replacement of adsorbed water in the interlayers showing disappearance or weakening of bands at 1620 cm 1 the main raman vibration modes observed for the γ feooh mlg sample were represented in high intensity peaks at 1333 cm 1 1577 cm 1 and 2700 cm 1 corresponding to d band g band and 2d band of graphene layers respectively the raman peaks of se adsorbed γ feooh mlg sample are more intense than those observed for as synthesized γ feooh mlg sample this is plausibly due to the doping of se ions to the sample which enhance the excitation of electrons under laser irradiation further discussion on tga ftir and raman analysis are provided in supplementary information 3 5 adsorption results and discussion the adsorption study aims to investigate the adsorption capability of γ feooh γ feooh mlg and mlg samples to uptake se vi ion from water below the world health organization who prescribed limit for selenium in drinking water se 40 ppb in the present study sequences of adsorbent and adsorbate batches and kinetics studies were performed for these adsorbents mainly γ feooh and γ feooh g to understand the adsorption properties of these materials for se vi ions proper washing of the adsorbents prior to the use minimizes the cl anions content in the powder which shows adverse effect on adsorption properties of selenium 39 fig 7 shows the dose adsorption results obtained from γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents at different selenium se vi concentrations and at different contact times fig 7a shows adsorption dose data of γ feooh at different se vi concentrations 300 600 and 1000 ppb the results show that adsorption saturation occurs at 100 200 and 500 mg l of γ feooh doses corresponding to se vi concentrations of 300 600 and 1000 ppb respectively incorporating 10 of graphene in the γ feooh sample fig 7c highly enhances the adsorption properties the results show instantaneous saturation at very low γ feooh mlg dose of 20 mg l which is sufficient to reach the plateau even at se vi concentration up to 300 ppb and dose of 40 mg l is sufficient to remove se vi concentration up to 600 ppb however with increasing se vi concentration to 1000 ppb the dose of 240 mg l is sufficient to remove se vi of high concentration 1000 ppb below the who standard limit dose study of the samples was also carried out at three contact times 10 min 1 h and 3 h as shown in fig 7b and d the obtained results inferred that more than 98 of the adsorption process was carried out in the first one hour and after that slow diffusion was observed the rapid adsorption suggests that adsorption was mainly to the surface of the lepidocrocite the high density of se vi on the surface of γ feooh pushes selenium ions through inter layer adsorption and ionic exchange which likely occurs in the second step the kinetic enhancement due to the graphene addition is clearly observed the results show that adsorption of 1000 ppb of se vi by γ feooh mlg adsorbent is faster than the adsorption of 600 ppb of se vi by γ feooh sample without graphene the results conclude that strong adsorption and no desorption were observed for dose experiments implying the strong bonding and high activity of γ feooh adsorption the results also indicate that 200 mg l of γ feooh mlg is equivalent to 500 mg l of γ feooh to remove the same se concentration of 1000 ppb below who standard line similarly 20 mg l of γ feooh mlg is equivalent to 100 mg l of γ feooh to remove the same se concentration of 300 ppb below who standard line in less than 10 min fig 8 b d show that 90 of the adsorption is performed in the first 10 min for γ feooh mlg adsorbent and 60 min for γ feooh adsorbent fig 7e shows the main dose adsorption data of γ feooh γ feooh mlg and graphene adsorbents at 600 μg l se vi concentration and 6 h contact time this comparison study is necessary to elucidate the role of graphene in the adsorption process at these conditions 0 25 g l of γ feooh is adequate dose to reach plateau however γ feooh mlg adsorbent exhibits instantaneous adsorption at low doses in the range of 0 025 g l unlike other adsorbents graphene itself has low adsorption affinity with low removal percentage not more than 24 at high doses however graphene works as substrate to functionalize the surfaces of γ feooh with active functional groups and a large number of active adsorption sites fig 7f explains the role of selenium concentrations on the adsorption properties of the adsorbents which is an important experiment to verify the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents experimentally in this study adsorbent dose was fixed at 1 g l and the results studied at different contact times 10 min 1 h and 6 h for both adsorbents γ feooh and γ feooh mlg se vi concentrations were altered from 300 to 10 000 μg l and plotted on x axis this study was performed to study the effect of adsorbate dose se vi on the adsorption properties and kinetics of the studied adsorbents the recorded results from icp ms were formulated in form of removal efficiency removal and plotted on y axis all experimental data were presented in fig 7f at low se vi concentrations below 5000 ppb almost complete adsorption was observed due to the implementation of high γ feooh adsorbent dose 1 g l however at high se vi concentrations above 5000 ppb the uptake efficiency decreases gradually with the increase of se vi concentration until it becomes 74 8 removal at 10 000 ppb se vi concentration after 6 h contact time which suggests adsorption capacity below these concentrations for γ feooh adsorbent the results mentioned above are applicable only to γ feooh adsorbent on the contrary γ feooh mlg adsorbent shows complete adsorption even at high se vi concentrations 10 000 ppb in a short time the complete adsorption is an indication to the high adsorption capacity of γ feooh mlg above the studied se vi concentration ranges these findings will be further theoretically supported by the estimated adsorption capacity by adsorption isotherms in the next section as a matter of fact the adsorption of se ions to the γ feooh surfaces was rarely studied in the literature the structure of γ feooh polymorph and its surface functional groups are the main driving forces to understand the mechanism of adsorption possible surface complexes of se ions to γ feooh can be explained in either by se ions bonded to the exposed lattice planes such as 111 which shows most free surface fe 3 depicting inner sphere mechanism 48 the interlayer anions in the γ feooh structure are highly exchangeable with a variety of inorganic and organic anions 26 ion exchanges of oh cl anions or h2o molecules with interlayer anions that are hydrogen bonded to hydroxyl groups of lepidocrocite in γ feooh structure with se ions are highly applicable depicting outer sphere mechanism but might lead to the structural defect and therefore create a structural disorder and stability fault the largest face 100 face is sacked by fe2oh groups between layers 16 other two minor faces 010 and 001 have reactive sites feo and fe3o 26 the remaining adsorption sites are tentatively assigned to the ion exchange of se with lepidocrocite anion layers the mechanism of selenium adsorption of γ feooh can be considered neither completely inner sphere nor completely outer sphere mechanism but a mixture of both also the primary adsorption process occurs by chemisorption mechanism with slightly lower ability to interlayer and ion exchange the mixed mechanisms explain the instantaneous se vi uptake to the adsorbents surfaces these findings are in line with the adsorption of selenium to other iron oxy hydroxide adsorbents 44 the use of ferric chloride as a precursor 48 or the addition of nacl 18 enhances the adsorption capacity also these authors 48 have found that adsorption capacity of selenate se vi to hematite adsorbent increased from 1 5 to 5 4 mg g due to the suspension of cl ions in the reaction interestingly their findings for selenite se iv adsorption were completely different the adsorption capacity has decreased from 17 to 4 6 mg g when cl ions were suspended in a similar way our preliminary experiments for selenate show that γ feooh prepared from ferric nitrate precursors show negligible adsorption affinity at all conditions unlike of ferric chloride precursors there was however no considerable difference in the structure morphology and aggregation in both cases this increase in the adsorption by chloride ions could be attributed to the altering of surface free energy 48 3 6 kinetic adsorption analysis fig 8 depicts the adsorption kinetics of se vi on γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents at different doses and different se vi concentrations it was observed that the adsorption of se ions onto γ feooh nanoflakes is strongly dependent on the initial se concentration and or initial adsorbent doses for all se concentrations in use there was a prompt uptake during the first few minutes and then intimately reached a plateau level the contact time required to reach this plateau increases with the increase in se concentrations but never exceeds 30 min as shown in fig 8a similar behavior was noticed at different γ feooh doses as shown in fig 8c specifically for initial se concentrations of 300 600 and 1000 μg l the removal efficiency at 30 min were 99 1 95 35 and 87 56 respectively fig 8a and slight increases to the removal efficiency after 6 h shaking to reach 99 96 96 83 and 89 23 these results suggest that more than 98 of the removal percentage was performed in the first stage which account for 30 min similarly for initial γ feooh dose of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 g l the removal efficiency at 30 min were 68 12 97 39 and 99 54 respectively fig 8c and a negligible removal adsorption during the period of 30 min to 6 h to be 70 7 98 45 and 99 91 respectively in the second step 30 min 6 h where saturation is a dominance process few se ions were adsorbed this suggest that in the first stage most of se ions were diffused speedily to the surface of the adsorbent until all adsorption sites were occupied in the second step the high density of selenium ions on the surface of the adsorbent pushes them for ion exchange on γ feooh which is relatively a slow adsorption process at low se concentration suspended se vi ions in water adhere to the adsorption surfaces of γ feooh and stabilizes on its surfaces subsequently no excess se ions for ion exchange and as a result rapid adsorption was observed from the above discussion it is clear that with increasing initial concentration of se vi the removal efficiency decreases besides the observed results from fig 8c infer that γ feooh adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l is insufficient dose to remove se ions 600 ppb to well below who standards 40 ppb however an adsorbent dose of 0 25 g l and above is adequate dose to uptake se ions abruptly from the above discussion it is clear that with increasing initial concentration of se vi the removal efficiency decreases and higher adsorbent doses is however required fig 8b depicts the adsorption kinetics of γ feooh mlg adsorbent at various se concentrations and at a wide range of adsorbent doses fig 8d the results depicted from fig 8b show rapid se vi removal even at high concentrations 1000 ppb indicating the high adsorption capacity of γ feooh mlg composite specifically selenium ions were rapidly absorbed within first 30 min of the reaction irrespective of the high initial selenium concentration similarly the results obtained from fig 8d show instantaneous removal in term of several seconds at high γ feooh mlg doses 0 5 g l to 30 min at low doses 0 1 g l these results indicated large number of adsorption sites on the surface of lepidocrocite nanoflakes formed in presence of graphene sheets rendering the quick adsorption of se ions the dose of 0 25 g l was sufficient to reduce the higher se vi concentration 1000 μg l below who limits of drinking water the contact time of less than 1 h was sufficient to reduce the se vi to the safe level the plateau lines were obtained above 98 removal efficiency for all studied se concentrations which indicates quick and efficient se adsorption by using graphene composites 3 7 adsorption isotherms fig 9 a and a1 and b and b1 shows langmuir adsorption isotherm was plotted for se vi uptake by γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents it describes the monolayer adsorption of se vi on to the adsorbent surface and represented by eq 1 41 1 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e n o n l i n e a r f o r m where qe and ce is the amount of se vi adsorbed per unit mass of the γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents and the concentration of se vi ion remained in the solution mg l at the equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent respectively kl l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant qmax and kl calculated by non linear regression method fig 9a and a1 langmuir parameters are shown in table 1 the coefficients of determination r2 are close to the unity the maximum adsorption capacities qmax calculated by langmuir isotherm were 40 09 mg g and 83 44 mg g for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively this is indicative of higher adsorption capabilities of γ feooh mlg as also seen in earlier sections higher value of langmuir coefficients kl indicates higher strength of adsorption sites in γ feooh mlg compared to γ feooh that lead to quick uptake of se vi ions fig 9b and b1 describes freundlich adsorption isotherm of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents to uptake se vi ions from water it uses the same data as that for langmuir isotherm and the freundlich parameters are illustrated in table 1 this isotherm aims to identify the overall strength as well as heterogeneity in strength of adsorption sites the non linear equation of freundlich isotherm 42 is described in eq 2 2 q k f c e n kf and n are specific adsorption coefficient and exponent n is related to the energetic heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface and determines the curvature of the isotherm respectively the values of these parameters were obtained from the freundlich isotherm plot fig 9b and b1 kf denotes adsorption strength its higher value indicates higher adsorbent loading that is achievable for a particular adsorbent its value was determined from eq 2 to be 225 59 and 676 72 mg g l mg n for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively this indicates higher se vi adsorption affinity to γ feooh mlg adsorbent than γ feooh adsorbent the values of n as calculated from freundlich isotherm were 0 749 and 0 694 for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively if n 1 it indicates the high adsorbent loading at low concentrations therefore they are referred to as favorable isotherms 37 these values indicate that se vi adsorption also relatively follow freundlich isotherm the regression coefficients of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents were 0 998 and 0 999 respectively which indicates also possible heterogeneous adsorption mechanism all in all adsorption mechanisms of se vi uptake to feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents are fitted well with langmuir isotherm which suggest monolayer adsorption to the surfaces the possible interlayer adsorption and ion exchange are plausible reasons for freundlich fitting to understand the kinetics of interaction between se vi ions in water with γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents surfaces the experimental kinetic data observed from kinetic study of high se concentration were fitted into pseudo first order and pseudo second order isotherms pseudo first order kinetic isotherm plots were shown in fig 9c the linear form was represented by lagergren equation in eq 3 45 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 t where qt is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at time t measured in mg g k1 is equilibrium rate constant of pseudo first order adsorption the linearized plots of log qe qt vs time t give the rate constants the results obtained from fig 9c were recorded in table 2 and indicate that the adsorption mechanism does not fit well with pseudo first order which confirms that the adsorption mechanism is not by physical interactions 35 pseudo second order isotherm fig 9d is a nonlinear model which explains the surface adsorption in terms of physiochemical interaction between se vi ions and adsorbent surfaces in other words chemical bonding and functional groups are responsible for the se vi uptake pseudo second order isotherm usually plotted in its linear form based on the following equation eq 4 4 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2 is a constant represents the pseudo 2nd order sorption rate measured by g mg min units k2 and qe could be calculated from the intercept and slope of t vs t q plot respectively for γ feooh adsorbent the pseudo second order parameters are tabulated in table 3 which infer that the theoretical adsorption capacities are qe 8 13 and 16 72 mg g for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively these values are correlated well with qmax calculated by langmuir adsorption isotherm see table 2 this is an experimental evidence to the effective adsorption of se iii by γ feooh and feooh mlg adsorbents the very higher values of regression coefficients r2 obtained from for pseudo second order recommend that the use of pseudo second order model is an appropriate model to identify the adsorption kinetics all in all the kinetic interaction of se vi adsorption to γ feooh and feooh mlg adsorbents follow pseudo 2nd order sorption isotherm which suggests that the adsorption mechanism is of chemical nature 35 these findings are well matched with previous studies 32 the rapid diffusion of se high concentrations on the γ feooh surfaces forces se vi ions through the interlayers distance and plausibly ion exchange this multi step process requires more energy which is an index for chemisorption adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents are typically higher in comparison to most of the previous studies on other adsorbents 6 46 51 table 3 summarizes a comparison data of se vi adsorption parameters to the adsorbents being used in the present study and other adsorbents from literature at almost similar conditions there are four main findings could be concluded from table 3 1 metal oxides including iron oxides in general show low adsorption affinity to se vi 2 alumina based composites are excellent adsorbents for se vi from aqueous solution but adsorption rate kinetic is slow 3 iron oxy hydroxides including lepidocrocite are good adsorbents for se vi removal both capacity wise as well as kinetically and 4 graphene based iron oxy hydroxide composites are a new generation of adsorbents which can be considered one of the best adsorbents for se vi removal in water systems both in terms of capacities and kinetics in summary we have successfully synthesized lepidocrocite γ feooh nanoflakes and lepidocrocite decorated on multi layered graphene γ feooh mlg adsorbents for efficient se vi removal from water the simple hydrolysis synthesis method is easy rapid and up scalable the formation of lepidocrocite γ feooh nanoflakes was verified by xrd fesem tem saed ftir and raman spectroscopy based studies the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of γ feooh which is calculated from langmuir isotherm for lepidocrocite γ feooh and lepidocrocite mlg γ feooh mlg adsorbents found to be 40 09 and 83 44 mg g respectively from the present study we observed that 0 25 gl 1 dose of lepidocrocite γ feooh adsorbent could effectively remove 600μgl 1 se vi ions from water adsorption kinetic results showed best fitting to pseudo second order model indicating the possibility of chemisorption the main advantage derived from the results of γ feooh adsorbent is its high adsorption at ph around neutral ph 5 7 which is a range close to the real groundwater whereas γ feooh mlg sample adsorption was maximized at a broader ph range of ph i e 3 9 the mechanism of selenium adsorption to γ feooh can be considered neither inner sphere nor outer sphere mechanism but a mixture of both also most of the adsorption process follow chemisorption mechanism with a little ability to interlayer and ion exchange the findings obtained from the present study revealed that lepidocrocite γ feooh nanoflakes and lepidocrocite decorated on multi layered graphene γ feooh mlg show excellent se vi adsorption properties graphene based 2 d mineral composites show exceptional adsorption capacity and rapid kinetics this warrants the development of graphene based iron oxy hydroxide composites for real world adsorption systems the rapid decrease in graphene production costs and recently the availability of high yield and facile production technologies have made graphene based nano materials as the feasible candidates as new generation adsorbents for toxic ions uptake therefore lepidocrocite γ feooh and lepidocrocite mlg γ feooh mlg adsorbents are promising adsorbents for treating se contaminated water with great

13911,the development of robust cost effective remediation technologies of selenium uptake from ground and surface water is challenging and at the same time urgently needed the present study provides a new facile synthesis protocol for lepidocrocite γ feooh nanoflakes and lepidocrocite decorated on multi layered graphene γ feooh mlg and their possible application for selenate se vi ions removal from drinking water the morphological and structural properties of γ feooh were studied by using different techniques there is a limited data on the adsorption of se vi ions onto the 2d γ feooh nanosheets this work delineates adsorption mechanism and merits of incorporating graphene for enhancing adsorbent s potential for selenium removal from contaminated water the extraordinary electronic and textural properties of graphene sheets make it a physical support to stabilize γ feooh nanoflakes substantially improving adsorption capacities and kinetics besides strengthening particle stability maximum adsorption capacity of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples estimated by langmuir adsorption isotherms observed to be 40 09 and 83 44 mg g respectively the adsorption mechanism of se vi to the surfaces of adsorbents was found to be monolayer and of chemisorption in nature the ph dependence experiments showed that γ feooh exhibited maximum adsorption capacity at a ph close to the pzc 5 97 1 which are in suitable for real ground water conditions keywords lepidocrocite graphene nanoflakes water purification se removal 1 introduction worldwide natural water bodies are being polluted by irrational industrial and domestic discharge resulting in great stress for potable water heavy metals in drinking water are of serious concern in human health and environment point of view due to their extreme toxicity selenium se is one such pollutant which is already recognized as an emerging pollutant of concern in india and many other countries 1 in addition to its natural presence in groundwater se is a major industrial pollutant that diffuses into the environment mainly through several industrial activities high doses of se are hazardous not only to human beings but also to animals and plants high se doses are presumably the major risk for the development of critical tumours ailments related to kidney and liver colorectal and breast cancers melanoma and lymphoid neoplasms 2 4 world health organization who has set the maximum acceptable se concentration in drinking water at 40 μg l 4 and recommended that 25 35 μg day of se is essential for human body nutrition mainly through food and water 5 in this regard recent studies recommend to decrease the who limit of se in drinking water to 1 μg l due to its acute toxicity 4 se iv and se vi forms are the most toxic 4 5 with se iv species being relatively more toxic than se vi species 5 8 however se vi species are more frequently present and more difficult to be removed from water in comparison of se iv species 5 6 therefore in the present study se vi removal from water has been attempted successfully india has threatening levels of se in ground and surface water of some locations especially in northern parts of the country 9 12 this warrants development of low cost and effective technologies to remove such toxic ions from water adsorption is considered as one of the most effective technologies for removing toxic inorganic ions from water in this regard the development of new generation adsorbents which show maximum high removal capacity and no toxicity are of prime attention in the related research area nowadays iron oxy hydroxides are an important class of ubiquitous minerals in soil and aquatic environments they are environmentally pertinent systems responsible for numerous geological and biological processes including adsorption alloying and phase transformations among many lepidocrocite γ feooh is the second most prevalent iron oxy hydroxide polymorph thermodynamically stable next to goethite interestingly the stability of γ feooh increases profoundly with a concomitant decrease in their particles size at nanoscale particles 13 with a moderate occurrence γ feooh forms naturally in soils at different anaerobic conditions typically in companion with goethite 14 more than that γ feooh is a major corrosion product from many ferrous constructions and carbon steel based products in association with magnetite and hematite 14 15 the crystal structure of γ feooh is orthorhombic based on cubic close packing sequence built by double chains of fe octahedra placed on their corners these corners are attached to the adjacent corners forming zigzag sheets stabilized by hydrogen atoms between the layers the layers are arranged perpendicular to 010 basal face in the direction of c axis 16 26 lath like morphology and tubular shapes are the common geometries for γ feooh polymorph both natural and synthetic forms 17 for instance studies however inferred that γ feooh initially forms rod like particles and subjected to time dependent self aggregation at 010 surfaces to form lath like morphology with remarkable decrease in its specific surface area 18 this structural system accounts for 84 of the total surface area which is major surface characteristic responsible for adsorption properties 16 the crystallinity of γ feooh could be controlled by aging time and temperature long hours aging results in higher crystallinity 14 γ feooh phase is typically formed by reduction of fe2 precursors the hydrolysis of iron precursors commonly occurs at neutral or slightly acidic conditions and temperature of 60 100 c this synthesis process is the most widely used method for the synthesis of γ feooh phase 19 20 tresintsi and his team 20 have designed reactor for continuous production of γ feooh with high synthesis rate of 0 25 g h at ph ranges of 5 5 8 on the other hand electrochemical synthesis protocol has also been explored for the synthesis of γ feooh 21 22 like other iron oxy hydroxides γ feooh nanostructures have been effectively used for the removal of heavy metals from water 5 6 12 16 20 23 28 the adsorption of se ions to γ feooh surfaces follows inner sphere mechanism 20 23 28 however the exact mechanism is still debated to date few studies on the use of γ feooh for selenium uptake from water were reported 12 28 s das et al 12 have studied the adsorption of se by ferrihydrite goethite and γ feooh with a high adsorption affinity to ferrihydrite followed by γ feooh however their findings found no adsorption on γ feooh surfaces at low doses 1 g l mainly due to macro size particles the results show that at extremely high dose of 15 g l only 59 of se vi ions initial concentration of 8000 ppb were adsorbed y kang et al 28 have studied the adsorption capacities of hematite goethite and γ feooh adsorbents for uptake of se from water the obtained results show that maximum adsorption capacity qmax of γ feooh adsorbent was 4 5 and 1 5 mg g for se iv and se vi respectively nowadays research on the use of graphene based composites for heavy metals removal from water has received increased attention 29 magnetic iron oxides graphene oxide composite has been used to remove selenium se iv and se vi ions from water and the results show quick adsorption kinetics for se iv 6 the results also investigate the impacts of graphene on the adsorption properties however in the previous study 6 iron oxides themselves show negligible se adsorption capacity and accordingly improper composite candidates were selected leading to low adsorption capacities moreover it is well reported that magnetic iron oxides 30 and oxy hydroxides 31 possess intrinsic enzyme like peroxidase activity which is a useful property for degradation of hydrogen peroxide phenols and other enzymes from solutions 30 reduced graphene oxide γ feooh composite was also synthesized by the aid of hydrazine hydrate reducing agent and used for the degradation of phenols 31 to date however no study has thoroughly investigated the sorption of se on the surface of γ feooh and γ feooh decorated on graphene sheets in the present study γ feooh nanoflakes of high se adsorption capacity have been added through in situ synthesis with multi layered graphene mlg to form a novel and multifunctional adsorbent with extraordinary adsorption properties as a matter of fact graphene increases the surface adsorption sites and decreases the surface energy of bare nanoparticles 29 33 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nabh4 alfa aeser 99 and fecl3 sigma aldrich acs reagent 97 were used as reducing agent and precursor respectively distilled water was prepared in the laboratory using water purification system merck milli pore make and was used as a solvent and for washing purposes in the experiments laboratory ph meter thermo make was used to measure ph during the synthesis and adsorption studies ph meter was calibrated using the commercially available buffer solutions of ph 4 01 ph 7 0 ph 10 01 thermo scientific orion all laboratory ar grade chemicals were used as purchased without further purification 2 2 synthesis of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples in a simple two step hydrolysis method 4 86 g of fecl3 and 1 1 g of nabh4 were properly dissolved in 300 and 100 ml distilled water in the first step respectively in the subsequent step nabh4 solution was incrementally added to the fecl3 solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 15 min until all iron precipitates black precipitate of fe totally in water under high acidic medium ph 1 5 in next step 0 38 g of nabh4 was properly dissolved in 50 ml distilled water and this solution was again added to the above solution the resultant suspension was stirred for 3 h until the color of the suspension changed to yellowish red indicating the formation of γ feooh the precipitate was filtered using vacuum pump filtration system and washed with copious quantity of water and ethanol and then dried at 120 c for 2 h in air conditions in the case of γ feooh mlg sample 100 mg of mlg was well dispersed in 100 ml ethanol and added to the precursor solution during the first step the rest of the synthesis process remains unchanged 2 3 adsorption experiments γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples in powder form were used as adsorbents for uptake se vi ions from water at different doses se vi concentrations contact times and ph these parameters are used to study the adsorption properties of these adsorbents at different conditions specially to explore its potential under different conditions of practical relevance such studies are also equally important to understand the overall properties of adsorbent for its possible modification inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms was used for selenium concentration determination in water samples the calibration was done using high purity selenium standards distilled water spiked with pre determined concentrations of se vi was used for adsorption experiments graphene supported γ feooh composite was also studied for the removal of se vi and the impact of graphene on the adsorption properties was systematically explored the experiments for se vi removal from water were performed by adding predefined doses of lepidocrocite adsorbent to the se vi solutions batch and kinetic studies were repeated at a wider range of se vi concentrations 300 10000 μg l to further understand the adsorption process se vi stock solutions were prepared by adding appropriate amounts of 1000 mg l se vi selenate inorganic ventures usa to distilled water and used as test solutions adsorption kinetics was studied using an optimized adsorbent doses in the range of 10 1000 mg l and the adsorption process was monitored at different contact times of the adsorbent with the test solution starting from 1 min to 24 h all adsorption experiments were carried out with 100 ml of selenate solution by varying the adsorbent dose in the range of 0 01 1 0 g l ph study was performed at se vi concentration of 600 ppb and adsorbent dose of 250 mg l and the experiments were performed at varying ph of 3 5 7 9 and 12 the ph was altered by addition of 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh solutions merck the flasks containing se vi solutions with adsorbent in all adsorption experiments were exposed to a uniform shaking using a laboratory shaker make remi at 150 rpm for several hours at room temperature in the final step samples were filtered using 0 22 μm disposable membrane filters and the filtered water samples were analyzed by icp ms perkin elmer nexion 300x test solution was optimized along with each experiment to estimate the initial se vi concentrations adsorption capacity of the adsorbents with respect to se vi was studied using langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetics was also investigated using pseudo 1st and 2nd order isotherms and adsorption parameters were calculated in each case test solutions selenate solution without adsorbent dose were analyzed in each experiment to estimate the initial concentration of selenate se vi 2 4 zeta potential measurements aqueous solutions of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples were prepared by addition of 10 mg l 1 γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples to distilled water and then subjected to ultrasonication sonicator pci analytics for 30 min the ph of the stock solution was 6 5 0 1 the desired ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 n hcl sigma aldrich and 0 1 n naoh merck solutions the ph was monitored by ph meter oakion eutech instruments suspensions were shaken for 30 min to ensure equilibrium final ph of the suspensions was measured and point zero charge was determined with nanosizer sz 100 horiba scientific japan at 25 c using dynamic light scattering method 2 5 characterization field emission scanning electron microscope fesem model zeiss ultra 55 operated at accelerating voltages of 5 kv was used to record the micrographs transmission electron microscope tem model fei technai g2 s twin operated at accelerating voltage of 200 kv was used to study the morphology and crystallinity qualitative of the samples x ray diffraction xrd study was carried out to identify the structure of the materials as well as to understand the crystallinity the powder xrd patterns were recorded at a scanning rate of 0 020 s 1 in the 2θ range of typically 10 70 using x bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å operated at 40 kv 30 ma the diffraction patterns were compared with standard patterns available in the internationally accepted databases icdd raman spectroscopic study to understand the phase characteristics of different samples was carried out by using 532 nm laser line of nd yag laser the spectral resolution of all the measurements was 3 cm 1 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy model nicolet 380 measurements were mainly used to study the possible functional groups on the particles surfaces optical properties of the samples were characterized by using uv vis spectroscopy jasco v 570 it uses a resolution of 1 nm in the range of 200 800 nm at a scanning speed of 200 nm min specific surface area was measured by the bet brunauer emmett teller model using a micromeritics surface area analyzer asap 2020 samples were vacuum degassed using liquid n2 at 60 c for at least 10 h the point zero charge of the γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples was measured with nanosizer sz 100 horiba scientific japan using light scattering method thermo gravimetric analysis perkin elmer sta 6000 of the adsorbents performed by heating the sample from 25 c to 600 c in air the rate of heating was 10 c min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural analysis the peaks in the x ray diffractograms fig 1 a of both the samples γ feooh and γ feooh mlg are matched well and inferred as crystalline phases of lepidocrocite the structure of the samples is constituted of an orthorhombic crystal system icdd file no 00 044 1415 in γ feooh mlg sample peaks of multilayer graphene icdd file no 00 025 0284 were also observed as shown in fig 1a and b bet specific surface area of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples was estimated as high as 121 2 m2 g and 192 5 m2 g respectively this substantial increase of sample s surface area is expected to increase exposure of adsorption sites and hence adsorptive uptake of se vi ions the obtained results from xrd analysis fig 1c of γ feooh sample in both fresh and used forms after selenium adsorption at high concentrations of 10 000 μg l indicate that se vi ions adsorbed to the γ feooh surfaces have no considerable changes to the structure due to the se vi corporation correspondingly the obtained results from fig 1e of γ feooh mlg sample both fresh and selenate containing samples point out that no phase changes due to the adsorption of 10 000 μg l of se vi ions to the γ feooh mlg surfaces high magnification observations from xrd patterns were plotted and shown in fig 1d and f for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples respectively it was observed that a shift towards a lower 2θ is clearly shown in all the peaks and depends mainly on the se concentration specifically adsorption data shows that γ feooh sample fig 1d contains 7500 μg l of se vi ions less than that of 10 000 μg l on the surface of γ feooh mlg sample fig 1f therefore a uniform shift to the left was observed in the samples peaks with 2θ of 0 16 and 0 2 for γ feooh with the range 2θ of 25 29 and γ feooh mlg with the range 2θ of 34 7 39 0 samples respectively this increase in shift in the case of γ feooh mlg sample is mainly due to the adsorption of higher se ions which acts as a surface dopant 52 3 2 sem and tem analysis fig 2 a c shows scanning electron micrographs of γ feooh sample the images show uniform and faceted nano flakes of about 20 nm thickness and up to 600 nm length fig 2d f exhibits sem micrographs of γ feooh mlg sample the results show nano flakes with dimension much less than in the previous case 5 nm thickness and 200 nm length that is plausibly owing to the role of graphene that prohibited crystal growth of the nano flakes fig 3 a d shows tem micrographs and saed pattern of γ feooh sample the observation from the micrographs reveal that each flake that is shown in fig 2 is a combination of several nanorods with different aspect ratio adhered together to make nanosheets however results from fig 3a show the presence of nanoparticles along with the nanoflakes which support the arguments that fine nanoparticles is produced at an early stage of the reaction and they are recrystallized to rods followed by nanoflakes 33 later on these nanorods continue growing in the same direction along 001 plane fig 3c with the same manner particles followed by rods and then rods aggregates to form flakes to make nano flakes of γ feooh high resolution tem image fig 3c shows the lattice spaces of γ feooh nanoflakes the lattice spacing of 6 45 å is matching with 200 crystalline planes of γ feooh 24 27 selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 3d obtained from γ feooh sample inferred that the sample is highly crystalline and single phase in nature fig 3 e h shows tem micrographs and saed pattern of γ feooh mlg sample the obtained results from tem micrographs confirm the presence of mlg and indicate that nanoflakes were dispersed well amongst the graphene sheets these nanoflakes however have smaller sizes and flatter surfaces it can be inferred from tem micrographs that three types of γ feooh morphologies were observed in γ feooh mlg sample nanorods nanoflakes and small nanoparticles but nanoflakes seem to be the dominant morphology the presence of small nanoparticles however might be due to impurities of iron oxides 38 these observations are consistent with reported results 31 and can be explained that dense carboxyl hydroxyl and other active groups on the graphene surfaces create strong pinning anchoring forces to the small particles which in turn hinder their growth in other directions or even recrystallization to other geometries 32 further lattice spacing of 3 4 å shown for individual γ feooh nanorod fig 3g is matching with 101 crystalline planes saed pattern showing dotted ring pattern as depicted in fig 3h confirmed that γ feooh nanoparticles on mlg are polycrystalline in nature thus this saed pattern reconfirms that graphene does not allow individual crystals to grow 3 3 effect of ph on the synthesis of γ feooh the effect of solution ph on the phase structure and morphology was studied in general lepidocrocite synthesis was performed in mild acidic medium ph 5 fig 5 shows xrd diffractograms of as synthesized samples at different ph the results inferred that γ feooh formation was favored in mild acidic conditions at strong acidic conditions ph 5 the peaks are broader but with lower intensity indicating presence of fine crystallite and amorphous nature of material it is worth mentioning that the high production yield at strong acidity is difficult due to the dissolution of iron species at these conditions at mild acidic reaction condition ph 5 γ feooh xrd peaks observed are intense but not broader indicating the formation of highly crystalline γ feooh but with larger crystallite dimensions than previous case at neutral ph condition a mixed morphology of γ feooh γ fe2o3 was observed but the dominant peaks are for γ fe2o3 phase in basic ph conditions basicity facilitates the oxidation and favors the formation of single phase γ fe2o3 therefore addition of naoh becomes unfavorable when γ feooh was sought as the final product the morphology of the as synthesized materials at different ph was observed with significant changes the obtained particles are nanoflakes at ph 3 and ph 5 however the nanoflakes obtained at ph 3 were of smaller features than those of ph 5 fig 5a b these observations were also consistent with the broadening of xrd peaks of fig 4 a and b morphology and structure of the γ feooh tend to slightly change to mixed phase of γ feooh γ fe2o3 as shown in xrd results fig 4 with increasing ph value ph 7 mixed morphology of nanoflakes and nanoparticles was observed as shown in fig 5 c consequently with increasing the ph above neutral base catalyzed dehydration of lepidocrocite leads to the formation of single phase maghemite γ fe2o3 fig 5d with irregular morphology without the presence of nanoflakes or nanorods 34 3 4 surface properties of γ feooh surface properties of as synthesized γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples were also studied by using zeta potential measurements fig 6 a the influence of solution ph on the adsorption properties and phase stability was also studied the point of zero charge pzc is defined as the isoelectric point at which the surface charge density equals to zero less hydrated or high oxidation compounds have low pzc and vice versa 43 generally zeta potential curve as a function of ph shows positive charge at acidic solutions and negative charges at alkaline solutions 36 43 at pzc the surface charge is neutral and the electrostatic attraction forces between surface of adsorbent and adsorbate ions is negligible the adsorption of anions such as selenate vi is more favored at ph below pzc due to positively charges surface of adsorbent that results ionic attractive forces for adsorption the experimental results show that pzc of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg samples were recorded at ph 5 97 and ph 6 4 respectively fig 6a this little increase can be explained in view of the extraordinary electronic and textural properties of graphene which undoubtedly affects the pzc these values correlate well with previous studies 23 40 ph adsorption study fig 6b and its influence on the adsorption properties and kinetics of se vi removal from water were explored at room conditions t 25 c fixed adsorbent dose 250 mg l and fixed se vi concentration 650 ppb the acidic and basic solutions of se vi were prepared by adding dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh solutions fig 6b depicts adsorption data of se removal percentage as a function of ph which is a useful parameter for studying adsorption behavior under different conditions iron oxy hydroxides such as β feooh and γ feooh get stabilized at acidic solutions therefore improved adsorption performance of γ feooh can be expected below the neutral ph for γ feooh adsorbent rapid adsorption kinetics was observed at ph 3 5 and 7 however slight decrease in adsorption at ph 5 and 3 may be due to the slow leaching or dissolution of fe cations into the solution however above neutral ph the se vi uptake drastically decreases as the ph increases specifically the results show that at ph 9 only 12 5 of the se vi ions were adsorbed and 4 2 removal at ph 12 this is due to repulsive forces that arise due to negatively charged surface at basic ph which is above the adsorbent s pzc value also at higher ph hydroxyl ion concentration is steadily increased and are adsorbed on the surface of γ feooh nanoflakes thus strongly competing with se vi for occupying the adsorption sites interestingly the main advantage derived from the previous results of γ feooh adsorbent is its high adsorption at ph around neutral ph 5 7 which is a range close to the real groundwater for γ feooh mlg sample adsorption was maximized at a wide ph range of 3 7 carbon nanomaterials typically show good adsorption properties in acidic ph 46 specifically the results show that 99 4 17 8 and 7 2 of the se vi ions were adsorbed at ph 7 ph 9 and ph 12 respectively this significant drop in adsorption observed at highly basic solution ph 9 and 12 is correlated to pzc value as similar to observed in case of γ feooh the thermo gravimetric analysis fig s1 supplementary information of the samples γ feooh and γ feooh mlg shows thermal stability up to 200 c ftir spectra of both the samples γ feooh and γ feooh mlg figs s3a and s3b supplementary information shows disappearance or weakening of oh stretching vibration modes after se adsorption which indicates hydrogen bonding interaction of selenate anions as a mechanism of strong adsorption chemisorption this also leads to replacement of adsorbed water in the interlayers showing disappearance or weakening of bands at 1620 cm 1 the main raman vibration modes observed for the γ feooh mlg sample were represented in high intensity peaks at 1333 cm 1 1577 cm 1 and 2700 cm 1 corresponding to d band g band and 2d band of graphene layers respectively the raman peaks of se adsorbed γ feooh mlg sample are more intense than those observed for as synthesized γ feooh mlg sample this is plausibly due to the doping of se ions to the sample which enhance the excitation of electrons under laser irradiation further discussion on tga ftir and raman analysis are provided in supplementary information 3 5 adsorption results and discussion the adsorption study aims to investigate the adsorption capability of γ feooh γ feooh mlg and mlg samples to uptake se vi ion from water below the world health organization who prescribed limit for selenium in drinking water se 40 ppb in the present study sequences of adsorbent and adsorbate batches and kinetics studies were performed for these adsorbents mainly γ feooh and γ feooh g to understand the adsorption properties of these materials for se vi ions proper washing of the adsorbents prior to the use minimizes the cl anions content in the powder which shows adverse effect on adsorption properties of selenium 39 fig 7 shows the dose adsorption results obtained from γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents at different selenium se vi concentrations and at different contact times fig 7a shows adsorption dose data of γ feooh at different se vi concentrations 300 600 and 1000 ppb the results show that adsorption saturation occurs at 100 200 and 500 mg l of γ feooh doses corresponding to se vi concentrations of 300 600 and 1000 ppb respectively incorporating 10 of graphene in the γ feooh sample fig 7c highly enhances the adsorption properties the results show instantaneous saturation at very low γ feooh mlg dose of 20 mg l which is sufficient to reach the plateau even at se vi concentration up to 300 ppb and dose of 40 mg l is sufficient to remove se vi concentration up to 600 ppb however with increasing se vi concentration to 1000 ppb the dose of 240 mg l is sufficient to remove se vi of high concentration 1000 ppb below the who standard limit dose study of the samples was also carried out at three contact times 10 min 1 h and 3 h as shown in fig 7b and d the obtained results inferred that more than 98 of the adsorption process was carried out in the first one hour and after that slow diffusion was observed the rapid adsorption suggests that adsorption was mainly to the surface of the lepidocrocite the high density of se vi on the surface of γ feooh pushes selenium ions through inter layer adsorption and ionic exchange which likely occurs in the second step the kinetic enhancement due to the graphene addition is clearly observed the results show that adsorption of 1000 ppb of se vi by γ feooh mlg adsorbent is faster than the adsorption of 600 ppb of se vi by γ feooh sample without graphene the results conclude that strong adsorption and no desorption were observed for dose experiments implying the strong bonding and high activity of γ feooh adsorption the results also indicate that 200 mg l of γ feooh mlg is equivalent to 500 mg l of γ feooh to remove the same se concentration of 1000 ppb below who standard line similarly 20 mg l of γ feooh mlg is equivalent to 100 mg l of γ feooh to remove the same se concentration of 300 ppb below who standard line in less than 10 min fig 8 b d show that 90 of the adsorption is performed in the first 10 min for γ feooh mlg adsorbent and 60 min for γ feooh adsorbent fig 7e shows the main dose adsorption data of γ feooh γ feooh mlg and graphene adsorbents at 600 μg l se vi concentration and 6 h contact time this comparison study is necessary to elucidate the role of graphene in the adsorption process at these conditions 0 25 g l of γ feooh is adequate dose to reach plateau however γ feooh mlg adsorbent exhibits instantaneous adsorption at low doses in the range of 0 025 g l unlike other adsorbents graphene itself has low adsorption affinity with low removal percentage not more than 24 at high doses however graphene works as substrate to functionalize the surfaces of γ feooh with active functional groups and a large number of active adsorption sites fig 7f explains the role of selenium concentrations on the adsorption properties of the adsorbents which is an important experiment to verify the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents experimentally in this study adsorbent dose was fixed at 1 g l and the results studied at different contact times 10 min 1 h and 6 h for both adsorbents γ feooh and γ feooh mlg se vi concentrations were altered from 300 to 10 000 μg l and plotted on x axis this study was performed to study the effect of adsorbate dose se vi on the adsorption properties and kinetics of the studied adsorbents the recorded results from icp ms were formulated in form of removal efficiency removal and plotted on y axis all experimental data were presented in fig 7f at low se vi concentrations below 5000 ppb almost complete adsorption was observed due to the implementation of high γ feooh adsorbent dose 1 g l however at high se vi concentrations above 5000 ppb the uptake efficiency decreases gradually with the increase of se vi concentration until it becomes 74 8 removal at 10 000 ppb se vi concentration after 6 h contact time which suggests adsorption capacity below these concentrations for γ feooh adsorbent the results mentioned above are applicable only to γ feooh adsorbent on the contrary γ feooh mlg adsorbent shows complete adsorption even at high se vi concentrations 10 000 ppb in a short time the complete adsorption is an indication to the high adsorption capacity of γ feooh mlg above the studied se vi concentration ranges these findings will be further theoretically supported by the estimated adsorption capacity by adsorption isotherms in the next section as a matter of fact the adsorption of se ions to the γ feooh surfaces was rarely studied in the literature the structure of γ feooh polymorph and its surface functional groups are the main driving forces to understand the mechanism of adsorption possible surface complexes of se ions to γ feooh can be explained in either by se ions bonded to the exposed lattice planes such as 111 which shows most free surface fe 3 depicting inner sphere mechanism 48 the interlayer anions in the γ feooh structure are highly exchangeable with a variety of inorganic and organic anions 26 ion exchanges of oh cl anions or h2o molecules with interlayer anions that are hydrogen bonded to hydroxyl groups of lepidocrocite in γ feooh structure with se ions are highly applicable depicting outer sphere mechanism but might lead to the structural defect and therefore create a structural disorder and stability fault the largest face 100 face is sacked by fe2oh groups between layers 16 other two minor faces 010 and 001 have reactive sites feo and fe3o 26 the remaining adsorption sites are tentatively assigned to the ion exchange of se with lepidocrocite anion layers the mechanism of selenium adsorption of γ feooh can be considered neither completely inner sphere nor completely outer sphere mechanism but a mixture of both also the primary adsorption process occurs by chemisorption mechanism with slightly lower ability to interlayer and ion exchange the mixed mechanisms explain the instantaneous se vi uptake to the adsorbents surfaces these findings are in line with the adsorption of selenium to other iron oxy hydroxide adsorbents 44 the use of ferric chloride as a precursor 48 or the addition of nacl 18 enhances the adsorption capacity also these authors 48 have found that adsorption capacity of selenate se vi to hematite adsorbent increased from 1 5 to 5 4 mg g due to the suspension of cl ions in the reaction interestingly their findings for selenite se iv adsorption were completely different the adsorption capacity has decreased from 17 to 4 6 mg g when cl ions were suspended in a similar way our preliminary experiments for selenate show that γ feooh prepared from ferric nitrate precursors show negligible adsorption affinity at all conditions unlike of ferric chloride precursors there was however no considerable difference in the structure morphology and aggregation in both cases this increase in the adsorption by chloride ions could be attributed to the altering of surface free energy 48 3 6 kinetic adsorption analysis fig 8 depicts the adsorption kinetics of se vi on γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents at different doses and different se vi concentrations it was observed that the adsorption of se ions onto γ feooh nanoflakes is strongly dependent on the initial se concentration and or initial adsorbent doses for all se concentrations in use there was a prompt uptake during the first few minutes and then intimately reached a plateau level the contact time required to reach this plateau increases with the increase in se concentrations but never exceeds 30 min as shown in fig 8a similar behavior was noticed at different γ feooh doses as shown in fig 8c specifically for initial se concentrations of 300 600 and 1000 μg l the removal efficiency at 30 min were 99 1 95 35 and 87 56 respectively fig 8a and slight increases to the removal efficiency after 6 h shaking to reach 99 96 96 83 and 89 23 these results suggest that more than 98 of the removal percentage was performed in the first stage which account for 30 min similarly for initial γ feooh dose of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 g l the removal efficiency at 30 min were 68 12 97 39 and 99 54 respectively fig 8c and a negligible removal adsorption during the period of 30 min to 6 h to be 70 7 98 45 and 99 91 respectively in the second step 30 min 6 h where saturation is a dominance process few se ions were adsorbed this suggest that in the first stage most of se ions were diffused speedily to the surface of the adsorbent until all adsorption sites were occupied in the second step the high density of selenium ions on the surface of the adsorbent pushes them for ion exchange on γ feooh which is relatively a slow adsorption process at low se concentration suspended se vi ions in water adhere to the adsorption surfaces of γ feooh and stabilizes on its surfaces subsequently no excess se ions for ion exchange and as a result rapid adsorption was observed from the above discussion it is clear that with increasing initial concentration of se vi the removal efficiency decreases besides the observed results from fig 8c infer that γ feooh adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l is insufficient dose to remove se ions 600 ppb to well below who standards 40 ppb however an adsorbent dose of 0 25 g l and above is adequate dose to uptake se ions abruptly from the above discussion it is clear that with increasing initial concentration of se vi the removal efficiency decreases and higher adsorbent doses is however required fig 8b depicts the adsorption kinetics of γ feooh mlg adsorbent at various se concentrations and at a wide range of adsorbent doses fig 8d the results depicted from fig 8b show rapid se vi removal even at high concentrations 1000 ppb indicating the high adsorption capacity of γ feooh mlg composite specifically selenium ions were rapidly absorbed within first 30 min of the reaction irrespective of the high initial selenium concentration similarly the results obtained from fig 8d show instantaneous removal in term of several seconds at high γ feooh mlg doses 0 5 g l to 30 min at low doses 0 1 g l these results indicated large number of adsorption sites on the surface of lepidocrocite nanoflakes formed in presence of graphene sheets rendering the quick adsorption of se ions the dose of 0 25 g l was sufficient to reduce the higher se vi concentration 1000 μg l below who limits of drinking water the contact time of less than 1 h was sufficient to reduce the se vi to the safe level the plateau lines were obtained above 98 removal efficiency for all studied se concentrations which indicates quick and efficient se adsorption by using graphene composites 3 7 adsorption isotherms fig 9 a and a1 and b and b1 shows langmuir adsorption isotherm was plotted for se vi uptake by γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents it describes the monolayer adsorption of se vi on to the adsorbent surface and represented by eq 1 41 1 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e n o n l i n e a r f o r m where qe and ce is the amount of se vi adsorbed per unit mass of the γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents and the concentration of se vi ion remained in the solution mg l at the equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent respectively kl l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant qmax and kl calculated by non linear regression method fig 9a and a1 langmuir parameters are shown in table 1 the coefficients of determination r2 are close to the unity the maximum adsorption capacities qmax calculated by langmuir isotherm were 40 09 mg g and 83 44 mg g for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively this is indicative of higher adsorption capabilities of γ feooh mlg as also seen in earlier sections higher value of langmuir coefficients kl indicates higher strength of adsorption sites in γ feooh mlg compared to γ feooh that lead to quick uptake of se vi ions fig 9b and b1 describes freundlich adsorption isotherm of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents to uptake se vi ions from water it uses the same data as that for langmuir isotherm and the freundlich parameters are illustrated in table 1 this isotherm aims to identify the overall strength as well as heterogeneity in strength of adsorption sites the non linear equation of freundlich isotherm 42 is described in eq 2 2 q k f c e n kf and n are specific adsorption coefficient and exponent n is related to the energetic heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface and determines the curvature of the isotherm respectively the values of these parameters were obtained from the freundlich isotherm plot fig 9b and b1 kf denotes adsorption strength its higher value indicates higher adsorbent loading that is achievable for a particular adsorbent its value was determined from eq 2 to be 225 59 and 676 72 mg g l mg n for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively this indicates higher se vi adsorption affinity to γ feooh mlg adsorbent than γ feooh adsorbent the values of n as calculated from freundlich isotherm were 0 749 and 0 694 for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively if n 1 it indicates the high adsorbent loading at low concentrations therefore they are referred to as favorable isotherms 37 these values indicate that se vi adsorption also relatively follow freundlich isotherm the regression coefficients of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents were 0 998 and 0 999 respectively which indicates also possible heterogeneous adsorption mechanism all in all adsorption mechanisms of se vi uptake to feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents are fitted well with langmuir isotherm which suggest monolayer adsorption to the surfaces the possible interlayer adsorption and ion exchange are plausible reasons for freundlich fitting to understand the kinetics of interaction between se vi ions in water with γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents surfaces the experimental kinetic data observed from kinetic study of high se concentration were fitted into pseudo first order and pseudo second order isotherms pseudo first order kinetic isotherm plots were shown in fig 9c the linear form was represented by lagergren equation in eq 3 45 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 t where qt is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at time t measured in mg g k1 is equilibrium rate constant of pseudo first order adsorption the linearized plots of log qe qt vs time t give the rate constants the results obtained from fig 9c were recorded in table 2 and indicate that the adsorption mechanism does not fit well with pseudo first order which confirms that the adsorption mechanism is not by physical interactions 35 pseudo second order isotherm fig 9d is a nonlinear model which explains the surface adsorption in terms of physiochemical interaction between se vi ions and adsorbent surfaces in other words chemical bonding and functional groups are responsible for the se vi uptake pseudo second order isotherm usually plotted in its linear form based on the following equation eq 4 4 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2 is a constant represents the pseudo 2nd order sorption rate measured by g mg min units k2 and qe could be calculated from the intercept and slope of t vs t q plot respectively for γ feooh adsorbent the pseudo second order parameters are tabulated in table 3 which infer that the theoretical adsorption capacities are qe 8 13 and 16 72 mg g for γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents respectively these values are correlated well with qmax calculated by langmuir adsorption isotherm see table 2 this is an experimental evidence to the effective adsorption of se iii by γ feooh and feooh mlg adsorbents the very higher values of regression coefficients r2 obtained from for pseudo second order recommend that the use of pseudo second order model is an appropriate model to identify the adsorption kinetics all in all the kinetic interaction of se vi adsorption to γ feooh and feooh mlg adsorbents follow pseudo 2nd order sorption isotherm which suggests that the adsorption mechanism is of chemical nature 35 these findings are well matched with previous studies 32 the rapid diffusion of se high concentrations on the γ feooh surfaces forces se vi ions through the interlayers distance and plausibly ion exchange this multi step process requires more energy which is an index for chemisorption adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity of γ feooh and γ feooh mlg adsorbents are typically higher in comparison to most of the previous studies on other adsorbents 6 46 51 table 3 summarizes a comparison data of se vi adsorption parameters to the adsorbents being used in the present study and other adsorbents from literature at almost similar conditions there are four main findings could be concluded from table 3 1 metal oxides including iron oxides in general show low adsorption affinity to se vi 2 alumina based composites are excellent adsorbents for se vi from aqueous solution but adsorption rate kinetic is slow 3 iron oxy hydroxides including lepidocrocite are good adsorbents for se vi removal both capacity wise as well as kinetically and 4 graphene based iron oxy hydroxide composites are a new generation of adsorbents which can be considered one of the best adsorbents for se vi removal in water systems both in terms of capacities and kinetics in summary we have successfully synthesized lepidocrocite γ feooh nanoflakes and lepidocrocite decorated on multi layered graphene γ feooh mlg adsorbents for efficient se vi removal from water the simple hydrolysis synthesis method is easy rapid and up scalable the formation of lepidocrocite γ feooh nanoflakes was verified by xrd fesem tem saed ftir and raman spectroscopy based studies the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of γ feooh which is calculated from langmuir isotherm for lepidocrocite γ feooh and lepidocrocite mlg γ feooh mlg adsorbents found to be 40 09 and 83 44 mg g respectively from the present study we observed that 0 25 gl 1 dose of lepidocrocite γ feooh adsorbent could effectively remove 600μgl 1 se vi ions from water adsorption kinetic results showed best fitting to pseudo second order model indicating the possibility of chemisorption the main advantage derived from the results of γ feooh adsorbent is its high adsorption at ph around neutral ph 5 7 which is a range close to the real groundwater whereas γ feooh mlg sample adsorption was maximized at a broader ph range of ph i e 3 9 the mechanism of selenium adsorption to γ feooh can be considered neither inner sphere nor outer sphere mechanism but a mixture of both also most of the adsorption process follow chemisorption mechanism with a little ability to interlayer and ion exchange the findings obtained from the present study revealed that lepidocrocite γ feooh nanoflakes and lepidocrocite decorated on multi layered graphene γ feooh mlg show excellent se vi adsorption properties graphene based 2 d mineral composites show exceptional adsorption capacity and rapid kinetics this warrants the development of graphene based iron oxy hydroxide composites for real world adsorption systems the rapid decrease in graphene production costs and recently the availability of high yield and facile production technologies have made graphene based nano materials as the feasible candidates as new generation adsorbents for toxic ions uptake therefore lepidocrocite γ feooh and lepidocrocite mlg γ feooh mlg adsorbents are promising adsorbents for treating se contaminated water with great

13912,the objective of this work is to evaluate simultaneously the impact of nickel and lead on the fungus trametes pubescence growth and laccase production and their removal efficiency by t pubescence here laccase activity and production were investigated in both in vitro and in vivo fungal growth conditions at the presence of either pb or ni with the results showing inhibitory effects of pb and ni on t pubescence growth and laccase activity in particular t pubescence was seen to be able to withstand 1000 mg l 1 of pb and ni while the fungus was capable of removing 99 of pb and 8 6 of ni respectively most importantly it was found that although only live cells will secrete laccase both live and dead fungal biomass can accumulate heavy metals in the aqueous solutions the laccase production can thus be coupled with heavy metal removal for potential waste water treatment keywords biosorption fungus heavy metal laccase trametes pubescence 1 introduction heavy metals have been considered as hazardous elements which may accumulate in plants to inhibit their growth and yield for the soil ecosystem 1 or harm fishes and other aquatic organisms in water through inducing reactive oxygen species 2 the main sources of heavy metals pollution are such as mining extraction operations metal processing in refineries coal burning in power plants petroleum combustion plastics microelectronics and textile industries 3 8 metal ions such as copper iron and nickel can act as co factors to benefit cellular growth with even trace level they would become toxic in excess amount to majority of the living systems 9 other metals such as aluminium al antinomy sb arsenic as beryllium be bismuth bi cadmium cd gallium ga gold au indium in lead pb lithium li and mercury hg have no biological functions 10 it needs to be noted that the non degradable nature of heavy metals has caused them to remain and accumulate in the environment and threat seriously the viability of eco systems 4 microbial approaches to diminish the toxicity of some heavy metal ions or transform them to less harmful reduced states have been reported in the literature 11 17 some fungi are found to be effective in degrading compounds with lignin structure among them trametes is mostly reported to be an efficient degrader 18 20 among the species of this genus trametes pubescence is selected to perform the present work since it is able to produce considerable amounts of laccase 21 laccase benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductase ec 1 10 3 2 is a group of copper containing oxidase which can degrade a wide range of aromatic and non aromatic compounds 22 27 which is found in many plants fungi and bacteria 28 29 so far there are only few reports to investigate the production of laccase of fungi in the presence of heavy metals for the degradation of lignocellulosic materials 30 31 and some recalcitrant compounds such as azo dyes 21 in the wastewater environments it was found that the dead fungal biomass can accumulate heavy metals in the literature 32 34 furthermore it was seen that the heavy metal ions entrapped by dead cells were bound to functional groups of cell wall first 35 then transformed into less toxic elements by live cells through different biosorption mechanisms such as binding with protein and efflux pumping 36 38 this study aimed to determine the effect of two heavy metals pb and ni on the laccase activity in trametes pubescence and at the same time the heavy metal removal by the fungus which to our knowledge has not been reported to date in particular the mechanisms of pb and ni removal from the aqueous solutions using viable biomass of t pubescence cells were ascertained through scanning electron microscopy sem transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray fourier transform infrared ftir assay it was found that although only live cells will secrete laccase both live and dead fungal biomass can accumulate heavy metals the laccase production can thus be coupled with heavy metal removal for potential waste water treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 fungal strain trametes pubescens mb 89 cbs 696 94 centraalbureau voor

and the fungus was able to tolerate pb better than ni ec50 of 9 9 in solid culture 3 2 effects of pb and ni on t pubescence laccase activity stability and production the results obtained by different concentration of pb and ni on the laccase activity in figs 2 showed the stability of laccase activity in the presence of heavy metals although the laccase activities for the growth with pb or ni were slightly lower comparing to the control it can be seen in fig 2 that when pb concentration was 100 ppm the laccase stability was decreased while it kept increasing at 200 400 and 600 ppm of pb due to precipitation of pb further increase in pb concentration would lead to constant decrease of the laccase activity the negative effect of pb is mainly due to the inactivation of enzyme by the metal the laccase production in the presence of ni was different 10 and 25 ppm of ni caused to increase of the activity while it would decrease by the further increase in the concentration of ni the impact of pb and ni on laccase production in flasks can be seen in fig 3 it shows that comparing to the control the laccase production was decreased in the presence of pb while it was increased in the presence of ni up to 50 ppm after 144 h of exposure to the heavy metal in the literature inhibition effects of cd2 and mn2 and pb2 on activity of laccase from trametes versicolor daedalea quercina and pleurotus ostreatus have been reported respectively 29 42 43 in general our results are in agreement with their findings it is found that the induction of the laccase activity only occurred at low concentration of ni when the ni concentration was increased to higher concentration the laccase production would be declined similarly the induction of laccase activity of micromycetes exposed to 0 005 m ni has been recorded after 21 days of cultivation that increased 1 3 3 3 times in comparison with the control 44 whereas concentration of 0 01 m of nicl2 depressed the laccase activity in all micromycetes galactomyces geotrichum achieved 1 5 times increase of the laccase activity on the 18th day of cultivation in comparison with the control in summary production of laccase was found to be related to the presence of metal ions in fungal cell cultures 44 45 3 3 pb and ni removal from the aqueous solutions our previous experimental data 21 indicates that there were two cultivation phases of t pubescence growth in the liquid cultures phase 1 fungal growth for about 8 days at day 3 0 5 mm cu2 was added as an inducer for later laccase production and phase 2 t pubescence cell growth into stationary phase laccase production was started we thus introduced pb and ni into liquid culture of t pubescence after 8 days of fungal growth fig 4 is the figure for the biosorption and removal of pb and ni at 1000 mg l 1 by t pubescence on exposure to ni the highest biosorption rate 8 6 by t pubescence was obtained while a maximum pb removal and biosorption was 97 3 and 99 56 after 72 h respectively in the literature about 66 3 maximum pb removal by pleurotus ostreatus hau 2 in liquid culture contain 1500 mg l 1 of pb has been reported after 10 days exposure to pb 30 additionally a maximal pb removal rate and uptake of 71 04 and 76 06 mg g 1 by a lentulus fj172995 was observed at 1000 mg l 1 of pb after 5 days exposure to pb the pb uptake capacity of fungus increased by initial concentration of p b 46 in another report the pb biosorption capacity for a flavus was 20 75 93 65 mg g with initial concentration 200 1400 ppm 47 it can be observed that our t pubescence strain was more effective for pb removal at the high concentration such as 1000 ppm after 3 days exposure to the heavy metal one of promising strategy in treatment of contaminated the waste water containing heavy metals is the use of filamentous fungi to remove those toxic metals 46 extracellular adsorption and intracellular bioaccumulation are mainly mechanisms of heavy metal removal by fungi 48 metal ions transported through the cell wall is facilitated via different mechanisms such as ion exchange hydrolytic adsorption and surface precipitation 30 while the metal ions taken into the cells are reduced by intracellular metal binding and sequestration sites the maximum pb bioaccumulation by our fungus has reached 367 mg g 1 which was higher than those recorded by other fungi such as 165 mg g 1 for p ostreatus hau 30 t pubescence biomass was measured in the presence of pb and ni fig 5 the results showed the decrease in biomass exposed to ni compared to control and increase of that in the presence of pb the increased biomass exposed to pb was due to absorbed pb weight after 4 days of pb exposure the biomass of t pubescence was 50 higher than that for the control without pb on the other hand the biomass of t pubescence grown with ni reached 34 of that for the control only at day 4 similar results were observed by moore et al 49 who had reported that ni ii caused a significant inhibitory effect on the fungal biomass production an interesting difference was observed between the fungal tolerance in agar and liquid medium containing pb and specially ni our tolerance test in agar medium fig 1 shows that ni was toxic metal to fungi however in liquid media they could tolerate both pb and ni elements even at 1000 mg l 1 this difference might be due to the varying bioavailability of metals in agar and liquid medium we have found that t pubescence was not to remove ni from the medium while there are some reports in the literature that other fungi may be able to remove ni 50 for this research the authors have isolated a niger strain tolerant to cadmium chromium cobalt copper and nickel the strain was able to remove nickel from the solution at maximum level of 98 after 100 h of culturing with the metal 6 5 mm while it failed to remove other metals in another study 98 removal rate of nickel by aspergillus lentulus fj172995 at 140 mg l 1 with the ni concentration of 11 05 mg g 1 in medium has been reported 46 the viability of fungi exposed to heavy metals was determined by cultivation of three plugs of t pubescence in fresh medium the laccase activity of each treatment showed the ability of t pubescence to grow and produce laccase although laccase production was lower in flasks containing pb compared to t pubescence exposed to ni fig 6 these tests show also the possibility of reusing fungi to remove pb from the environment up to now most of the researches applied non viable microorganisms for removal of heavy metals 51 52 preparation of these biosorbents needs to harvest and dry collected biomass which disables continuous operation of the systems 53 54 while in living system there is no need to separate biomass self replenishment and continuous metabolic absorption would thus give benefits for the use of living microorganisms to treat contaminated environments 55 3 4 k content of liquid culture heavy metals exchanged with k na ca and mg is one of the biosorption mechanisms of fungi 56 58 in our work potassium content of liquid culture showed the difference between control and pb treated medium k concentration of medium in control was 239 04 mg l 1 and increased significantly p 0 05 to 268 82 mg l 1 after 48 h of treatment with pb 3 5 ftir analysis and xrd pattern shifts in the cellular functional group of fungal biomass exposed to pb and ni were observed in ftir spectra table 1 displays the present peaks for the samples of mycelium after 72 h in contact with pb and ni in comparison with the control in free metal medium it is seen that changes in vibrational frequencies using ftir analysis on the metal treated t pubescence revealed the involvement of the fungus in binding of pb in particular the shift in the region of 3500 3300 cm 1 indicates that the nh or carboxyl group stretching vibration 59 happened to the pb and ni treated fungal culture additionally for the ni treated t pubescence a distinct change in the ftir spectra in the region of 3000 to 1600 cm 1 was seen which was related to the carboxyl group co of cooh in appearance of a band of 2091 cm 1 a new peak at 957 cm 1 corresponding to phosphate po4 appeared in the spectrum for the t pubescence growth with ni appearance of the peak at 927 cm 1 correspond to phosphate group were detected for zn treated penicillium simplicissimum 60 furthermore the peaks at 1077 cm 1 control corresponding to the groups of amide band 61 or phosphate groups 58 was changed to 1079 5 cm 1 for the t pubescence growth with ni loaded the complete masking of peaks related to the carboxylic 1314 00 cm 1 and phosphate group 1155 2 and 1077 cm 1 was observed in the presence of pb ii in the literature disappearance of carboxylic group in the ftir spectra of bacillus sp in contact with pb ii was reported previously 62 in that research peaks at 1385 571 6 540 6 and 519 6 cm 1 for amide iii nitro compounds and disulfide groups were observed in the presence of pb ii it was explained that the peak at 2926 cm 1 region in the spectrum of metal free mycelia was related to the alkyl groups whereas in ni loaded samples the peak was slightly shifted to 2928 cm 1 moreover broad peak of 3402 cm 1 appeared in the spectrum of mycelium in contact with pb in comparison to the control which indicated stretching vibration of oh or nh group compared to the control shift appeared in the spectrum of pb and ni loaded mycelium in the region 1655 1545 cm 1 represented the nh amide i and amide ii shift peaks at 519 571 cm 1 of the pb loaded fungus presented nitro compounds and disulfide group s role at metal compelxation these ftir results revealed a possible involvement of negatively charged functional groups of fungus mycelium in metal interaction for pb removal from the medium 33 63 the xrd pattern of pb treated samples and control shown in figure s1 revealed the difference between the two types of samples which exhibited the main peak at 29 96 for the pb loaded mycelium 3 6 sem edx tem and afm analysis the sem images of fungal biomass control and pb treated showed a visible difference in surface morphology of mycelia pellets exposed to pb a clear cylindrical mycelium without any particles figure s2a was observed in the control while the rough and ruptured mycelium was observed in the surface of the t pubescence cells grown with pb some particles were observed on the mycelia surface figure s2b the mycelia surface changes were also reported in the study with aspergillus terreus 64 and trametes versicolor 65 grown with heavy metals it must be noted that the hyphae were denser and packed in the presence of pb ii which might be the fungi s strategy to prevent the toxicity of pb 9 our edx results indicate that the elemental composition of mycelium which mainly was carbon oxygen phosphorous and lead figure s3 the peak for the t pubescence growth in the presence of lead confirmed that pb was bound to mycelium surface binding metal ions in cell wall or extracellular matrix through the adsorption or precipitation has been reported as mechanisms of white rot fungi to prevent cellular damage by heavy metals 66 our results are in agreement with the previous studies the pb 31 1 wt and p 1 8 wt elements was respectively detected in edx analysis of mycelia surface that suggested precipitation of pb 60 since no phosphorus was in the culture medium we concluded that the low peak of phosphorus in analysis was most probably originated from t pubescence cells the t pubescence hyphae grown at free pb medium indicated well defined structure figure s4a via tem image whereas visible dark spots was indicated inside the pb loaded sample figure s4b which was might be due to pb bioaccumulation dark area was also reported in cell membrane and cytoplasm of pb treated beauveria bassiana 67 68 a visible change in morphology of fungal cells was also observed in presence of pb through afm image compared to the control the afm analysis of t pubescence cells grown with pb ii clearly indicated the increase in roughness of the fungal surface in comparison to the control the height distribution of mycelia surface showed the difference between mycelia exposed to pb and control figure s5 the increase in height confirmed the precipitation of pb on the surface of mycelium 4 conclusions this work examined the impact of ni and pb on laccase stability of t pubescence and the removal of two heavy metals from aqueous solutions analysis of the laccase production and activity stability indicated varying responses of t pubescence against these metals ftir results demonstrated the involvement of intracellular functional groups in removal of heavy metals fungi are beneficial microorganisms that exist widely in soil and water ecosystem the fungus trametes pubescens from the trametes genus is known to be abundant with laccase our study indicates that the fungal trametes pubescens is effective in the heavy metal removal from the water environment while their laccase production is not inhibited the approach developed in this work may be further extended into the waste

13912,the objective of this work is to evaluate simultaneously the impact of nickel and lead on the fungus trametes pubescence growth and laccase production and their removal efficiency by t pubescence here laccase activity and production were investigated in both in vitro and in vivo fungal growth conditions at the presence of either pb or ni with the results showing inhibitory effects of pb and ni on t pubescence growth and laccase activity in particular t pubescence was seen to be able to withstand 1000 mg l 1 of pb and ni while the fungus was capable of removing 99 of pb and 8 6 of ni respectively most importantly it was found that although only live cells will secrete laccase both live and dead fungal biomass can accumulate heavy metals in the aqueous solutions the laccase production can thus be coupled with heavy metal removal for potential waste water treatment keywords biosorption fungus heavy metal laccase trametes pubescence 1 introduction heavy metals have been considered as hazardous elements which may accumulate in plants to inhibit their growth and yield for the soil ecosystem 1 or harm fishes and other aquatic organisms in water through inducing reactive oxygen species 2 the main sources of heavy metals pollution are such as mining extraction operations metal processing in refineries coal burning in power plants petroleum combustion plastics microelectronics and textile industries 3 8 metal ions such as copper iron and nickel can act as co factors to benefit cellular growth with even trace level they would become toxic in excess amount to majority of the living systems 9 other metals such as aluminium al antinomy sb arsenic as beryllium be bismuth bi cadmium cd gallium ga gold au indium in lead pb lithium li and mercury hg have no biological functions 10 it needs to be noted that the non degradable nature of heavy metals has caused them to remain and accumulate in the environment and threat seriously the viability of eco systems 4 microbial approaches to diminish the toxicity of some heavy metal ions or transform them to less harmful reduced states have been reported in the literature 11 17 some fungi are found to be effective in degrading compounds with lignin structure among them trametes is mostly reported to be an efficient degrader 18 20 among the species of this genus trametes pubescence is selected to perform the present work since it is able to produce considerable amounts of laccase 21 laccase benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductase ec 1 10 3 2 is a group of copper containing oxidase which can degrade a wide range of aromatic and non aromatic compounds 22 27 which is found in many plants fungi and bacteria 28 29 so far there are only few reports to investigate the production of laccase of fungi in the presence of heavy metals for the degradation of lignocellulosic materials 30 31 and some recalcitrant compounds such as azo dyes 21 in the wastewater environments it was found that the dead fungal biomass can accumulate heavy metals in the literature 32 34 furthermore it was seen that the heavy metal ions entrapped by dead cells were bound to functional groups of cell wall first 35 then transformed into less toxic elements by live cells through different biosorption mechanisms such as binding with protein and efflux pumping 36 38 this study aimed to determine the effect of two heavy metals pb and ni on the laccase activity in trametes pubescence and at the same time the heavy metal removal by the fungus which to our knowledge has not been reported to date in particular the mechanisms of pb and ni removal from the aqueous solutions using viable biomass of t pubescence cells were ascertained through scanning electron microscopy sem transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray fourier transform infrared ftir assay it was found that although only live cells will secrete laccase both live and dead fungal biomass can accumulate heavy metals the laccase production can thus be coupled with heavy metal removal for potential waste water treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 fungal strain trametes pubescens mb 89 cbs 696 94 centraalbureau voor

solutions was adjusted with 1 mm of phosphate citrate buffer at 4 5 the samples were taken once a day for 5 days and filtered through 0 2 μm millipore membrane ﬁlters to measure laccase activity and pb and ni concentration by atomic absorption spectrometer tas 990 super afg beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd beijing china at the end of experiment the t pubescence biomass was separated and washed two time with sterile ultra pure water to release the adsorbed metals from the surface 40 albert et al 2018 afterwards the collected biomass was dried at 60 c and digested by aqua regia to extract metals from the fungus 40 the liquid and digested samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometer all experiments were repeated three times and the average results were presented a control was prepared in the same condition in a medium containing heavy metals and without fungus to evaluate the effect of medium on metals the metal removal and bioaccumulation were calculated using

version 16 3 results and discussion 3 1 metals effect on fungal growth in agar plates radius growth diameter of t pubescence in solid medium supplemented with different concentration of pb and ni has been presented in fig 1 the ec50 and ec80 of pb and ni fig 1 showed different effect of metals on the t pubescence growth the growth was decreased with the increase in both pb and ni concentrations the figure shows that t pubescence was more tolerant against pb than ni in comparison it has been reported in the literature that growth of the fungus absidia cylindrospora was viable in the medium containing lead at 10 50 and 100 ppm while the growth was inhibited at 1000 ppm 40 in another study ic50 of 50 mg l 1 for pb has been recorded for absidia cylindrospora 40 joshi et al 41 reported growth inhibition of different fungi isolates such as phanerochaete chrysosporium aspergillus awamori aspergillus ﬂavus trichoderma viride in the presence of pb and ni with different concentration 25 50 100 and 400 ppm they have shown the pb and ni tolerance at the concentration of 25 ppm only our result indicated by ec50 of 73 4 for pb that is higher than that in the mentioned above literature and the fungus was able to tolerate pb better than ni ec50 of 9 9 in solid culture 3 2 effects of pb and ni on t pubescence laccase activity stability and production the results obtained by different concentration of pb and ni on the laccase activity in figs 2 showed the stability of laccase activity in the presence of heavy metals although the laccase activities for the growth with pb or ni were slightly lower comparing to the control it can be seen in fig 2 that when pb concentration was 100 ppm the laccase stability was decreased while it kept increasing at 200 400 and 600 ppm of pb due to precipitation of pb further increase in pb concentration would lead to constant decrease of the laccase activity the negative effect of pb is mainly due to the inactivation of enzyme by the metal the laccase production in the presence of ni was different 10 and 25 ppm of ni caused to increase of the activity while it would decrease by the further increase in the concentration of ni the impact of pb and ni on laccase production in flasks can be seen in fig 3 it shows that comparing to the control the laccase production was decreased in the presence of pb while it was increased in the presence of ni up to 50 ppm after 144 h of exposure to the heavy metal in the literature inhibition effects of cd2 and mn2 and pb2 on activity of laccase from trametes versicolor daedalea quercina and pleurotus ostreatus have been reported respectively 29 42 43 in general our results are in agreement with their findings it is found that the induction of the laccase activity only occurred at low concentration of ni when the ni concentration was increased to higher concentration the laccase production would be declined similarly the induction of laccase activity of micromycetes exposed to 0 005 m ni has been recorded after 21 days of cultivation that increased 1 3 3 3 times in comparison with the control 44 whereas concentration of 0 01 m of nicl2 depressed the laccase activity in all micromycetes galactomyces geotrichum achieved 1 5 times increase of the laccase activity on the 18th day of cultivation in comparison with the control in summary production of laccase was found to be related to the presence of metal ions in fungal cell cultures 44 45 3 3 pb and ni removal from the aqueous solutions our previous experimental data 21 indicates that there were two cultivation phases of t pubescence growth in the liquid cultures phase 1 fungal growth for about 8 days at day 3 0 5 mm cu2 was added as an inducer for later laccase production and phase 2 t pubescence cell growth into stationary phase laccase production was started we thus introduced pb and ni into liquid culture of t pubescence after 8 days of fungal growth fig 4 is the figure for the biosorption and removal of pb and ni at 1000 mg l 1 by t pubescence on exposure to ni the highest biosorption rate 8 6 by t pubescence was obtained while a maximum pb removal and biosorption was 97 3 and 99 56 after 72 h respectively in the literature about 66 3 maximum pb removal by pleurotus ostreatus hau 2 in liquid culture contain 1500 mg l 1 of pb has been reported after 10 days exposure to pb 30 additionally a maximal pb removal rate and uptake of 71 04 and 76 06 mg g 1 by a lentulus fj172995 was observed at 1000 mg l 1 of pb after 5 days exposure to pb the pb uptake capacity of fungus increased by initial concentration of p b 46 in another report the pb biosorption capacity for a flavus was 20 75 93 65 mg g with initial concentration 200 1400 ppm 47 it can be observed that our t pubescence strain was more effective for pb removal at the high concentration such as 1000 ppm after 3 days exposure to the heavy metal one of promising strategy in treatment of contaminated the waste water containing heavy metals is the use of filamentous fungi to remove those toxic metals 46 extracellular adsorption and intracellular bioaccumulation are mainly mechanisms of heavy metal removal by fungi 48 metal ions transported through the cell wall is facilitated via different mechanisms such as ion exchange hydrolytic adsorption and surface precipitation 30 while the metal ions taken into the cells are reduced by intracellular metal binding and sequestration sites the maximum pb bioaccumulation by our fungus has reached 367 mg g 1 which was higher than those recorded by other fungi such as 165 mg g 1 for p ostreatus hau 30 t pubescence biomass was measured in the presence of pb and ni fig 5 the results showed the decrease in biomass exposed to ni compared to control and increase of that in the presence of pb the increased biomass exposed to pb was due to absorbed pb weight after 4 days of pb exposure the biomass of t pubescence was 50 higher than that for the control without pb on the other hand the biomass of t pubescence grown with ni reached 34 of that for the control only at day 4 similar results were observed by moore et al 49 who had reported that ni ii caused a significant inhibitory effect on the fungal biomass production an interesting difference was observed between the fungal tolerance in agar and liquid medium containing pb and specially ni our tolerance test in agar medium fig 1 shows that ni was toxic metal to fungi however in liquid media they could tolerate both pb and ni elements even at 1000 mg l 1 this difference might be due to the varying bioavailability of metals in agar and liquid medium we have found that t pubescence was not to remove ni from the medium while there are some reports in the literature that other fungi may be able to remove ni 50 for this research the authors have isolated a niger strain tolerant to cadmium chromium cobalt copper and nickel the strain was able to remove nickel from the solution at maximum level of 98 after 100 h of culturing with the metal 6 5 mm while it failed to remove other metals in another study 98 removal rate of nickel by aspergillus lentulus fj172995 at 140 mg l 1 with the ni concentration of 11 05 mg g 1 in medium has been reported 46 the viability of fungi exposed to heavy metals was determined by cultivation of three plugs of t pubescence in fresh medium the laccase activity of each treatment showed the ability of t pubescence to grow and produce laccase although laccase production was lower in flasks containing pb compared to t pubescence exposed to ni fig 6 these tests show also the possibility of reusing fungi to remove pb from the environment up to now most of the researches applied non viable microorganisms for removal of heavy metals 51 52 preparation of these biosorbents needs to harvest and dry collected biomass which disables continuous operation of the systems 53 54 while in living system there is no need to separate biomass self replenishment and continuous metabolic absorption would thus give benefits for the use of living microorganisms to treat contaminated environments 55 3 4 k content of liquid culture heavy metals exchanged with k na ca and mg is one of the biosorption mechanisms of fungi 56 58 in our work potassium content of liquid culture showed the difference between control and pb treated medium k concentration of medium in control was 239 04 mg l 1 and increased significantly p 0 05 to 268 82 mg l 1 after 48 h of treatment with pb 3 5 ftir analysis and xrd pattern shifts in the cellular functional group of fungal biomass exposed to pb and ni were observed in ftir spectra table 1 displays the present peaks for the samples of mycelium after 72 h in contact with pb and ni in comparison with the control in free metal medium it is seen that changes in vibrational frequencies using ftir analysis on the metal treated t pubescence revealed the involvement of the fungus in binding of pb in particular the shift in the region of 3500 3300 cm 1 indicates that the nh or carboxyl group stretching vibration 59 happened to the pb and ni treated fungal culture additionally for the ni treated t pubescence a distinct change in the ftir spectra in the region of 3000 to 1600 cm 1 was seen which was related to the carboxyl group co of cooh in appearance of a band of 2091 cm 1 a new peak at 957 cm 1 corresponding to phosphate po4 appeared in the spectrum for the t pubescence growth with ni appearance of the peak at 927 cm 1 correspond to phosphate group were detected for zn treated penicillium simplicissimum 60 furthermore the peaks at 1077 cm 1 control corresponding to the groups of amide band 61 or phosphate groups 58 was changed to 1079 5 cm 1 for the t pubescence growth with ni loaded the complete masking of peaks related to the carboxylic 1314 00 cm 1 and phosphate group 1155 2 and 1077 cm 1 was observed in the presence of pb ii in the literature disappearance of carboxylic group in the ftir spectra of bacillus sp in contact with pb ii was reported previously 62 in that research peaks at 1385 571 6 540 6 and 519 6 cm 1 for amide iii nitro compounds and disulfide groups were observed in the presence of pb ii it was explained that the peak at 2926 cm 1 region in the spectrum of metal free mycelia was related to the alkyl groups whereas in ni loaded samples the peak was slightly shifted to 2928 cm 1 moreover broad peak of 3402 cm 1 appeared in the spectrum of mycelium in contact with pb in comparison to the control which indicated stretching vibration of oh or nh group compared to the control shift appeared in the spectrum of pb and ni loaded mycelium in the region 1655 1545 cm 1 represented the nh amide i and amide ii shift peaks at 519 571 cm 1 of the pb loaded fungus presented nitro compounds and disulfide group s role at metal compelxation these ftir results revealed a possible involvement of negatively charged functional groups of fungus mycelium in metal interaction for pb removal from the medium 33 63 the xrd pattern of pb treated samples and control shown in figure s1 revealed the difference between the two types of samples which exhibited the main peak at 29 96 for the pb loaded mycelium 3 6 sem edx tem and afm analysis the sem images of fungal biomass control and pb treated showed a visible difference in surface morphology of mycelia pellets exposed to pb a clear cylindrical mycelium without any particles figure s2a was observed in the control while the rough and ruptured mycelium was observed in the surface of the t pubescence cells grown with pb some particles were observed on the mycelia surface figure s2b the mycelia surface changes were also reported in the study with aspergillus terreus 64 and trametes versicolor 65 grown with heavy metals it must be noted that the hyphae were denser and packed in the presence of pb ii which might be the fungi s strategy to prevent the toxicity of pb 9 our edx results indicate that the elemental composition of mycelium which mainly was carbon oxygen phosphorous and lead figure s3 the peak for the t pubescence growth in the presence of lead confirmed that pb was bound to mycelium surface binding metal ions in cell wall or extracellular matrix through the adsorption or precipitation has been reported as mechanisms of white rot fungi to prevent cellular damage by heavy metals 66 our results are in agreement with the previous studies the pb 31 1 wt and p 1 8 wt elements was respectively detected in edx analysis of mycelia surface that suggested precipitation of pb 60 since no phosphorus was in the culture medium we concluded that the low peak of phosphorus in analysis was most probably originated from t pubescence cells the t pubescence hyphae grown at free pb medium indicated well defined structure figure s4a via tem image whereas visible dark spots was indicated inside the pb loaded sample figure s4b which was might be due to pb bioaccumulation dark area was also reported in cell membrane and cytoplasm of pb treated beauveria bassiana 67 68 a visible change in morphology of fungal cells was also observed in presence of pb through afm image compared to the control the afm analysis of t pubescence cells grown with pb ii clearly indicated the increase in roughness of the fungal surface in comparison to the control the height distribution of mycelia surface showed the difference between mycelia exposed to pb and control figure s5 the increase in height confirmed the precipitation of pb on the surface of mycelium 4 conclusions this work examined the impact of ni and pb on laccase stability of t pubescence and the removal of two heavy metals from aqueous solutions analysis of the laccase production and activity stability indicated varying responses of t pubescence against these metals ftir results demonstrated the involvement of intracellular functional groups in removal of heavy metals fungi are beneficial microorganisms that exist widely in soil and water ecosystem the fungus trametes pubescens from the trametes genus is known to be abundant with laccase our study indicates that the fungal trametes pubescens is effective in the heavy metal removal from the water environment while their laccase production is not inhibited the approach developed in this work may be further extended into the waste

13913,photocatalytic polyethersulfone pes membranes with a high degree of hexavalent chromium cr vi removal hydrophilicity water permeability and antifouling properties were fabricated via layer by layer assembly lbl technology the novel pes ultrafiltration uf membranes were developed with different bilayers of chitosan chi alginate alg and nano zero valent iron tio2 nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the morphology chemical structure and wettability of synthesized nanoparticles and fabricated membranes were characterized by fesem afm edx xrd ftir and contact angle analyzer the pes uf membrane containing four chi layers and one layer of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles m5 has shown maximum efficiency for cr vi removal from permeate and retentate streams compared to the other membranes 100 98 1 and 95 5 cr vi removal in permeate and 76 4 46 7 and 34 4 cr vi removal in retentate were obtained for 5 15 and 30 ppm feed concentration respectively the modifications of the neat pes led to high hydrophilicity and desirable antifouling properties the water flux of neat pes m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 membrane were obtained 161 152 186 147 178 and 170 l m2 h respectively according to results the membranes containing nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles have shown high water flux moreover m5 membrane has exhibited 68 flux recovery whereas neat pes membrane has shown 43 for 5 ppm feed concentration the cr vi removal decreased from an about 100 to 71 2 48 2 and 42 1 with increasing ph from 3 to 5 7 and 10 respectively keywords multilayer membrane ultrafiltration layer by layer photocatalytic nzvi tio2 cr vi removal 1 introduction industrial wastewater must be treated to a standard level before discharging to the environment 1 hexavalent chromium cr vi is the one of prevalent contaminants of leather electroplating staining glass and metallurgy wastewater the presence of this ion in water sources causes irreparable risks including the risk of developing lung cancer asthma or damage to the nasal epithelia and skin for a human 2 4 various technologies have been used to remove chromium from wastewater such as adsorption precipitation ion exchange reduction and membrane filtration 5 6 recently membrane filtration is known as a suitable method for removal of cr vi ions from the aqueous solution because of single step process and low cost effective treatment 5 among different membrane processes nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are the promising techniques to bring the concentration of hexavalent chromium of water resources to an acceptable level yoon and et al studied the rejection of chromate by two nanofiltration membranes nf esna and mx07 and reverse osmosis ro lfc 1 one cr vi rejection was followed by the order of esna 30 90 mx07 25 95 lfc 1 90 at all ph range 7 barikbin et al investigated the cr vi removal from water in the presence of sulfate by polyamide nf membrane nf90 film tec corporation according to the results the nf membrane represented 96 rejection at the basic ph 8 however nf and ro are inefficient when they are used for wastewater treatment due to the high degree of fouling moreover these membranes only remove cr vi ions from permeate and cr vi concentration of concentrate stream increases over time this restriction and also the commitment to the cost effective method encouraged us to use the developed ultrafiltration membrane for the removal of chromium ions chromium exists in two stable oxidation forms in water source trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi low concentration of cr iii is essential for a mammalian system regarding the non toxicity and lower solubility of cr iii species the reduction of hexavalent chromium to trivalent state has attracted the researcher s attention as an economical method for removal of chromium from water source 9 the maximum allowable limits of cr vi and cr iii ions concentration in water sources were reported 0 05 and 5 ppm respectively 10 in particular the photocatalytic reactions are a highly promising technique for the cr vi removal from water and wastewater cheng et al investigated the cr vi removal using wo3 zno and natao3 metal oxides these photocatalysts represented an efficient removal of cr vi in alkaline and synthetic neutral water 2 yi and et al achieved to 81 2 of cr vi removal by the fe fe2o3 nanowires in oxic condition and 100 of cr vi removal in the anoxic condition 11 at the present work we have decided to merge both reduction of cr vi to cr iii and ultrafiltration in a one step as the simple and economical strategy to eliminate the cr vi ions along with lowering other macromolecular contaminants of plating wastewater for this purpose the pes ultrafiltration uf membrane was firstly modified by polyelectrolyte bilayers and then the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles were coated on the top layer of the modified pes uf membrane surface via layer by layer lbl technique to remove the chromium ions through reduction of cr vi ions to non toxic and insoluble cr iii ions instead of molecular sieving mechanism of nf actually the main advantage of fabricated membranes is the degradation of chromium content in the retentate stream during the ultrafiltration process to modify the pes uf membrane by lbl technique the pes pores were coated with polyelectrolyte bilayer of chitosan chi as a polycation and sodium alginate alg as a polyanion then the nano zero valent iron tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles nzvi tio2 were coated on the top layer of membrane to reduce the cr vi ions to cr iii under uv irradiation it is noteable that some recent studies have reported that the uv irradiation is not able to destroy the pes structure in long term expriments 12 13 petala and et al studied the removal of cr vi with nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles showed high efficiency for the removal of cr vi from water the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles have represented a significant reduction effect due to the synergistic contributions of tio2 and nzvi 14 as it was reported in some literature both nano zero valent iron and tio2 nanoparticles have separately shown the reduction ability for cr vi ions 15 17 it was proved that the tio2 nanoparticles can reduce the chromate ions by the catalytic oxidation of pollutants through formation of electron hole pairs under the illumination of near uv light however the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 is limited by the high degree of recombination of electrons and holes one of the promising technique to overcome this limitation is the addition of transition metal such as nano zero valent iron dopant to decline the recombination degree 18 19 it can generate doping energy and accelerate the transition of the excited electrons from tio2 to nano zero valent iron on the other words the presence of nano zero valent iron in nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles can intensify the photocatalytic reduction of the cr vi ions 20 a comprehensive investigation was accomplished on the cr vi removal efficiency and fouling properties of the various fabricated membranes since the number of the bilayer is a very important issue in lbl method 21 the effect of the number of chitosan layers on hydrophilicity membrane performance and fouling was studied 2 experimental 2 1 material n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 8 from merck was used as a solvent to prepare the casting solution polyethersulfone pes ultrason 6020 was used as the base polymer for preparation of the uf membrane polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp merck was added to casting solution as a pore former additive sodium alginate and chitosan medium molecular weight merck were used as anionic and cationic

sodium borohydride nabh4 as a reducing agent were obtained from merck 1 5 diphenyl carbazide dpc was purchased from merck and was used as a color complexion agent for colorimetric measurement of cr vi ions 2 2 synthesis of tio2 and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles for synthesis the tio2 nanoparticles titanium butoxide 20 ml were added into h2o etoh solution 16 5 ml 1 3 v v titanium butoxide 59 21 wt and then hydrochloric acid 0 28 ml 38 wt was added the mixture was stirred to form a gel finally the gel was dried in an oven at 80 c for 11 h and calcinated in a conventional muffle furnace at 400 c for 1 h the synthesis of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles was performed as follow ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o 0 2 g was dissolved in 7 ml ethanol 99 99 and then the tio2 nanoparticles 0 4 g were added ferric chloride 3 26 wt and tio2 nanoparticles 6 5 wt for evaporation of ethanol the mixture was heated at 70 c the reduction of trivalent iron to zero valent iron was conducted by adding the nabh4 as a reducing agent 0 4 g nabh4 in 7 ml distilled water 5 42 wt after 30 min stagnation the mixture was centrifuged to separate the solids the resulting product was washed 5 times with ethanol and was dried in vacuum oven 14 2 3 preparation of multilayer pes uf membrane the flat sheet pes uf membrane was fabricated through phase inversion according to our previous work 22 generally the pes membranes are negatively charged the isoelectric point for pes membrane is ph 4 5 23 for modification of the pes uf membrane by lbl assembly the neat pes membrane was cut into suitable size in accordance with cell dimension and was stuck on a glass plate the membrane was immersed in the chitosan solution 0 1 wt 1 g chitosan in 1 v v acetic acid distilled water with ph 5 5 5 for 30 min step 1 the ph of polyelectrolyte solution was adjusted by naoh and hcl solutions after 30 min the membrane was immersed in distilled water to remove excess chitosan 10 min step 2 then the impregnated membrane was immersed in sodium alginate solution with ph 7 and 1 g l 0 1 wt step 3 and after that the membrane was washed with distilled water to remove excess alginate for 10 min step 4 these four steps resulted in the membrane containing one chitosan alginate chi alg bilayer upon pes uf support this procedure was repeated m times to fabricate the modified membranes with m bilayer chi alg m at the final step the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticle was coated on the top layer as follow the multilayered membrane was placed on a rectangular frame so that only the top surface was exposed to the solution then a mixture of ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o absolute ethanol and tio2 nanoparticles was poured on the membrane surface when the solution containing ferric chloride absolute ethanol and tio2 nanoparticles is poured on the lbl membrane surface this solution tends to penetrate in the surface pores due to the capillary force after penetration and evaporation of ethanol the surface color altered to yellow these impregnated membranes were washed with ethanol several times and were put aside for a few minutes to become dry by pouring the reducing agent solution 0 2 g nabh4 in 7 ml distilled water on the impregnated membrane surface the fe3 is trapped into the porous anatase matrix as the fe nzvi particles 14 24 25 finally the modified membrane was washed with ethanol and was dried in oven at 85 for 5 min fig 1 shows the steps of nanoparticle coating on the membrane surface the various membranes were fabricated to investigate the effect of chitosan layers and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles in removal of cr vi ions from aqueous solution the m1 membrane with one chitosan layer was prepared to study the adsorption effect of chitosan the m1 membrane was modified by nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles to study the reduction effect of photocatalytic nanoparticles in cr vi removal m2 for investigation the influence of the number of chitosan layers m3 m4 and m5 were fabricated table 1 represented the different fabricated membranes 2 4 characterization atr ftir tensor 27 germany was used for identification of functional groups contact angle

x ray diffraction jcpds card no 21 1272 patterns of nanoparticles and membranes were obtained at 40 kv 100 ma in the range of 10 80 2 5 performance assay 2 5 1 batch removal the aim of batch removal test is the comparison of the removal ability of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles and modified membranes a batch experiment was performed to confirm the ability of prepared multilayer membranes in cr vi removal on the other word the adsorption effect of chitosan layers and also influence of the presence of photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface in cr vi removal were investigated through the batch removal test for this purpose the m0 m1 m2 m3 and m5 membranes were cut into small pieces 26 28 a certain weight of the membrane pieces and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles were put in 30 ml cr vi solution cr vi solution was prepared by solving the potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in distilled water after 360 min shaking under uv irradiation at room temperature the cr vi concentration of the solutions was measured and cr vi removal was calculated by the following equation 28 29 removal 1 cfinal cinitial 100 it should be noted that the removal ability of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles was evaluated with and without uv irradiation to study the effect of uv irradiation on the cr vi removal cr vi concentration was measured through the colorimetric method by uv spectrophotometer uv 2100 spectrophotometer at 540 nm 11 30 2 5 2 removal of cr vi using membrane filtration all multilayer membranes were evaluated in a cross flow system with a plexiglas acrylic cell with approximately 40 cm2 effective area which was placed in a uv chamber including three 8 w uv lamps hitachi japan the water flux and cr vi removal in the permeate and retentate streams were assessed under 1 5 bar pressure and ambient temperature fig 2 demonstrates a schematic of the used cross flow system the permeation flux was calculated as follow f v a t where v is the water volume l was collected in a time of t h and a is the active area of membranes m2 the cr vi removal was calculated as the following equation for permeate rp 1 consp consf and for retentate rr 1 consr consf where rp and rr refer to cr vi removal in permeate and retentate streams respectively consf consp and consr are the cr vi concentration in feed permeate and retentate streams respectively 31 2 5 3 antifouling properties of the membranes antifouling properties of the membranes were investigated using filtration test by100 ppm of sodium alginate solution as a foulant to start the fouling test the membranes were first tested by distilled water during 30 min jwi then the feed tank was replaced with a 100 ppm sodium alginate solution and the permeate flux was evaluated jp after 400 min filtration the membranes were rinsed with distilled water for 15 min and the flux of cleaned membranes was measured by distilled water for 60 min jwc to investigate the antifouling properties the flux recovery ratio frr was calculated by the following equation frr jwc jwi 100 the membranes antifouling properties were investigated by rt jwi jp jwi 100 where rt is the total flux decline due to total fouling reversible and irreversible fouling was evaluated by rr and rir 32 33 rr jwc jp jwi 100 rir jwi jwc jwi 100 rt rr rir 2 6 stability test 2 6 1 stability of the immobilized nzvi tio2 the stabilization of the immobilized nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles was investigated by detecting the iron leaching of pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 membrane in a cross flow system the leaching test was performed via filtration of the distilled water 5 0 l through m5 membrane for 120 min at 25 c 2 bars and 0 22 m s velocity about 200 ml of permeate was collected for analysis the concentrations of dissolved iron in permeate and feed solutions were measured by atomic absorption varian aa 240 australia the iron release from pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 membrane in static soaking was also measured the m5 membrane with a specified area 6 cm2 was immersed into 30 ml of distilled water at 25 c after 20 days under stirring the iron concentration of the solution was analyzed by atomic absorption 34 2 6 2 stability test of lbl layers the stability test was carried out by immersion of the membrane samples in water and sodium hypochlorite solution with 400 ppm chlorine concentration for 10 days water is usually utilized to wash the membranes before chemical cleaning sodium hypochlorite had been known as a most favorite chemical cleaning agent to eliminate the irreversible fouling 35 36 water flux and surface hydrophilicity were evaluated to study the variation of the membrane properties the stability experiments were performed by neat pes m0 and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes in the case of water flux study the permeate water flux was firstly evaluated before soaking and then the membranes were immersed in sodium hypochlorite naocl solution for a specified number of days finally the membranes were rinsed and the permeate water flux was again measured 37 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical properties of membranes atr ftir was used to analyze the surface functional groups of m0 m1 and m5 the atr ftir spectra are represented in fig 3 as seen the common peaks related to the pes polymer are observed in three membranes the bands at 1156 cm 1 and 1322 cm 1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of oso in pes sublayer respectively 38 the bands at 854 cm 1 and 872 cm 1 are attributed to the c h group of benzene rings out of plane mode furthermore the peaks at 1010 cm 1 and 1246 cm 1 are related to the characteristic band of aroar linkage in pes the band at 1152 cm 1 is related to a sulfone group in pes in vibrational stretching mode 39 the bands at 1106 cm 1 and 1486 cm 1 have corresponded to co and c s bands in pes respectively 40 41 the spectrum of the pes chi and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes demonstrates the characteristic absorption band at 1580 cm 1 and 1655 cm 1 which are the characteristic deformation of the amide ii and amide i respectively in addition the absorption band at 1068 cm 1 co stretching is the characteristic of the saccharide structure these three peaks are indicated the presence of the chitosan layer on the surface of the m1 and m5 membrane 42 43 the wide band at 3200 3700 cm 1 which was intensified in m1 and m5 can be due to the presence of hydroxyl groups 41 moreover the band at 600 cm 1 has corresponded to ti o band it is related to the presence of tio2 in surface of m5 membrane 43 the xrd spectra for nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles neat pes membrane and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane were shown in fig 4 in case of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ 26 7 38 45 1 54 2 55 1 63 and 70 5 which corresponds to their crystal planes 101 004 110 105 211 204 and 220 20 44 45 the characteristic peak at the 45 1 is related to the presence of nzvi in the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles according to curve b it can be found that the pes membrane is mainly amorphous and represents a prominent diffraction peak without any crystallinity at about 2θ 18 46 47 as seen the pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane clearly shows six crystalline characteristic peaks at about 2θ 27 37 3 45 4 54 4 55 3 62 8 and 70 1 which are similar to the characteristic diffraction peaks of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles moreover a peak is observed at 2θ 18 that is related to the amorphous neat pes 48 the presence of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer of pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane was investigated by edx spectrum fig 5 as can be seen three peaks around 0 5 6 5 and 7 kev are belonged to lα kα and kβ intensity of fe and two peaks around 0 5 and 5 kev are belonged to lα and kβ intensity of ti respectively 48 49 3 2 surface morphology fig 6 demonstrates the surface and cross sectional fesem images of neat pes m0 and developed membranes all membranes represented a typical asymmetric structure with a dense skin layer on top layer a porous middle layer and finger like macropores at the bottom see fig 6a d 49 based on fig 6 a c it can be visually seen that the m1 and m3 membranes have shown a relatively smooth surface compared to m0 this can indicate that the chitosan and sodium alginate layers covered the surface of pes membrane the fesem cross sectional images of multilayer membranes showed that a relatively thick skin layer has formed on the porous substrate after immersion of neat pes support in polyelectrolyte solutions 50 51 according to b c and d images the thickness of coated layer on the pes support is increased from 205 nm to 706 nm with increasing the number of bilayers fig 6 d demonstrates that the nanoparticles with an average size about 40 nm have covered the top layer of membrane surface also the partial aggregation of nanoparticles can be seen on the membrane surface this may be evidence of increasing the membrane surface roughness the size distribution of deposited nanoparticles on the surface of pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 membrane m5 was extracted from fesem image and image j software as estimated by image j software the average size of established nanoparticles was around 40 nm and the bar graph showed the narrow nanoparticles size distribution of deposited nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on m5 membrane surface see fig 7 the edx mapping analysis was also performed to investigate the dispersion quality of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles as seen in fig 8 a and b nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the membrane surface the afm images of the m0 m1 m2 m3 and m5 membranes surfaces are presented in fig 9 the roughness parameters are presented in terms of sa sq and sy in table 2 the neat pes membrane illustrated a relatively smooth surface with sa 18 75 nm when the pes membrane immersed in chitosan solution for a 30 min sa decreased to 15 63 nm so it can be concluded that a smooth layer covered the surface of pes support membrane 52 sa increased to 160 nm for m5 membrane the results indicated that the formation of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer of membrane increases the roughness of membrane surface as observed in fesem images this is attributed to the agglomeration of the nanoparticles on the membrane surface by comparing the afm results for m2 and m3 with m1 and m5 membranes can be found that the surface roughness has not significantly changed by increasing the bilayers numbers 3 3 surface wettability the surface wettability of the fabricated membranes was determined using the contact angle analyzer lower contact angle values mean the higher tendency of the membrane to wetting with water contact angle of pes substrate was obtained 62 5 1 it declined to 53 3 2 after the formation of the chitosan layer on its surface it can be attributed to the presence of amine and hydroxyl functional groups in the chitosan structure contact angle of membrane surface significantly dropped to about 0 0 by incorporation of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer it means that the membrane surface was almost completely wetted it can be attributed to the super hydrophilic nature of tio2 nanoparticles and the presence of nzvi in the structure of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles formation the iron oxy hydroxide with highly hydrophilicity on the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticle surface is another reason for high hydrophilicity of the membrane surface 53 on the other hand the oxygen atom and oh group of the hydroxides formed a hydrogen bond with oh group and the oxygen atom of water molecules which led to enhanced wettability of the membrane surface 54 56 according to the results it is predicted that the membrane containing nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles will represent higher water flux compared to the other membranes 3 4 batch removal test the batch experiment was performed to investigate the ability of synthesized nanoparticle and fabricated membranes for cr vi removal for evaluation the effect of uv irradiation on the cr vi removal the batch experiments were carried out using nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticle in the presence and absence of the uv irradiation fig 10 demonstrates that the cr vi removal was completed during about 150 min under uv irradiation whereas the cr vi removal dropped to about 78 in absence uv irradiation this indicated that the completion of the cr vi removal reaction was only achieved in the presence of uv irradiation this attributed to the inability of tio2 in absence of uv irradiation it should be noted that the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles exhibit enhanced remediation capability even without irradiation 14 the reaction between nzvi and cr vi can be promoted by more than one mechanism as follow the nzvi reduces cr vi to cr iii by reaction of route a it also immobilized the cr vi ions by precipitation as cr oh 3 or by incorporation into the iron hydr oxide shell forming alloy like cr iii fe iii hydroxides through route b some cr vi ions can also directly adsorb on the hydr oxide shell of nzvi see route c 57 59 route a 3 f e 0 c r 2 o 7 2 7 h 2 o 3 f e 2 2 c r o h 3 8 o h route b x cr3 1 x fe3 3 h2o crxfe 1 x oh 3 3 h x cr3 1 x fe3 2 h2o crxfe 1 x ooh 3h route c f e o h c r 2 o 7 2 f e c r 2 o 7 o h afterward the batch test was performed by fabricated membranes the neat pes m0 m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 membranes were cut into small pieces about 3 mm 3 mm and put in 30 ml cr vi solution with different concentrations 10 and 30 ppm based on the results table 3 m5 membrane containing four chitosan layers and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer has shown maximum removal compared to other fabricated membranes in this work the cr vi ions were removed by modified membranes based on two mechanisms i an electrostatic attraction between amine groups of chitosan layer and cr vi ions in feed solution the cr vi ions exist in different anion forms in aqueous solution i e cr o 4 2 cr2 o 7 2 and hcr o 4 ions 60 a comparison between m0 and m1 clearly shows the cr vi ions removal for a pes uf membrane increased from 3 2 1 to 14 7 2 after deposition of chitosan layer upon the pes membrane surface comparison between m1 and m3 with different chitosan layer shows that the more number of chitosan layers lead to increase the adsorption capacity of the membrane ii another removal factor is the presence of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles as seen the cr vi removal was significantly enhanced from 14 7 2 for pes uf chi to 68 5 1 for pes uf chi nzvi tio2 and from 20 2 for pes uf chi alg chi m3 to 76 1 for pes uf chi alg chi nzvi tio2 m4 this indicated that the cr vi reduction was controlled by the presence of nzvi photocatalytic property of tio2 and synergetic effect of both nanoparticles according to studies tio2 nanoparticles can form charge carriers such as positive holes h and electrons e under uv irradiation these reactive species is employed as red ox counterparts driving the cr vi removal reactions tio2 absorbs photons with hν 3 2 ev tio2 band gap 3 2 ev so it leads to the valence electrons jump to the conduction band e c b the eq 1 shows the process leaves positive holes in the valence band h v b 1 t i o 2 h v e c b h v b the positive holes could then react with surface bound water and surface hydroxyls the latter acts as the main hole acceptor in tio2 photocatalysis and produces radicals as shown by eqs 2 and 3 2 h v b h 2 o o h h or 3 h v b o h s u r f o h s u r f these charges can also interact directly with adsorbed cr vi ions in the next reactions when nano zero iron valent as electron scavengers was dispersed on the tio2 surface it seems that the tio2 and nzvi have synergetic effect in removal of chromate ions under uv irradiation in order to trap the photogenerated electrons as following reactions 14 4 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e c b 2 c r 3 7 h 2 o 5 2 h 2 o 4 h v b

removal of chromium ions 3 5 membrane performance the filtration test was carried out for m0 m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 in a cross flow system at room temperature under uv irradiation and 1 5 bar the experiments were accomplished with different feed concentrations 5 15 and 30 ppm retentate and permeate were collected periodically to calculate the cr vi removal in permeate and retentate streams 3 6 cr vi removal in permeates fig 11 demonstrates the percentage of cr vi removal by neat pes uf m0 pes chi m1 pes chi nzvi tio2 m2 pes chi alg chi m3 pes chi alg chi nzvi tio2 m4 and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes using different feed concentration as be seen the m5 membrane has shown maximum removal percentage compared to the other membranes 97 1 99 1 2 and 100 1 cr vi removal were obtained for 30 15 and 5 ppm feed concentration at ph 3 respectively whereas m4 m3 m2 m1 and m0 have shown 87 4 2 41 9 2 82 5 1 33 1 2 and 12 5 1 removal for 5 ppm feed concentration respectively the results indicated that the removal percentage was significantly increased by loading nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface m2 m4 and m5 as be seen in fig 12 the m5 membrane has shown high cr vi removal at low ph for 5 ppm feed concentration cr vi removal decreased from an about 100 to 71 2 48 2 and 42 1 with increasing ph from 3 to 5 7 and 10 respectively cr vi ions exist as an anion in aqueous solution anions adsorb on the chitosan layer by a ligand exchange reaction at low ph because the positive charge and site hydration are desirable at low ph as mentioned chromium ions exist as different forms such as hcr2 o 7 cr2 o 7 2 cr o 4 2 and hcr o 4 in aqueous solution with different ph 60 the adsorption of cr vi ions enhanced with a decline of the ph at low ph hcr o 4 is the dominant species of cr vi ions in the aqueous solution which is gradually replaced by the other species of cr vi such as cr o 4 2 as ph increases the adsorption free energy of hcr o 4 is less than cr o 4 2 this can be led to the higher adsorption of hcr o 4 rather than cr o 4 2 at the same concentration 61 the adsorption of hcr o 4 may be due to a electrostatic interaction between the positively charged chitosan layer and the negatively charged hcr o 4 ions because chitosan should be positively charged at low ph and since hcr o 4 is the dominant species in solution therefore the low ph can help to the adsorption of the anionic species of cr vi on the chitosan layer and finally lead to the higher cr vi removal from the aqueous solution on the other hand the electrostatic attraction between protonated amine groups which is induced at low ph and cr vi anions limits the passage of cr vi anions through membrane pores moreover the low ph of the solution leads to the enhancement of reaction rates of reduction of cr vi ions by nzvi nanoparticles when the ph of the cr vi solution becomes higher than 6 the neutral and negatively charged groups on the tio2 nanoparticles surface gradually increase this leads to an electrostatic repulsion of the chromium ions species i e cr2o7 2 hcro4 and cro4 2 and finally the reactivity reduces 62 in addition to the above the reduction oxidation reactions on the surface of nzvi nanoparticles carried out via accelerating the corrosion at lower ph 63 64 3 7 cr vi removal in retentate fig 13 demonstrates the cr vi removal percentage in the retentate stream the pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane has represented high removal percentage in retentate compared to the other membranes 76 4 46 7 and 32 4 cr vi removal after 30 min were obtained for 5 15 and 30 ppm feed concentration respectively very low removal of neat pes may be related to the trapping a bit cr vi ions in the membrane pores as observed all membranes containing nanoparticles have shown a relatively high removal due to the presence of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the nzvi reduces cr vi to cr iii and immobilized them through precipitation as cr oh 3 or by incorporation into the iron hydr oxide shell forming alloy like cr iii fe iii hydroxides some cr vi ions also directly adsorb on the hydr oxide shell of nzvi 58 60 m1 and m3 have shown about 13 and 18 removal for 30 ppm feed concentration these results indicate that the cr vi removal increases with increasing the chi alg bilayer number this is due to increasing the adsorption capacity of the membranes 3 8 water flux enhancement fig 14 demonstrates the permeate water flux for different membranes according to the results the membranes containing nanoparticles have shown high water flux rather than the neat pes membrane this can be attributed to the increase of the membrane roughness due to the enhancement of the available area for the water transport 49 65 high hydrophilicity of these membranes surface is another reason for flux enhancement the water flux significantly increased from about 152 l m2 h for m1 to about 186 l m2 h by coating the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the chitosan layer m2 as expected the water flux decreased by increasing the bilayers number this is due to the increment of membrane resistance directly and mass transfer zone indirectly as seen the water flux declined from about 161 l m2 h for neat to about 152 l m2 h for m1 with one chitosan layer and about 147 l m2 h for m3 with two chitosan layer 3 9 antifouling properties antifouling properties of the neat pes and m5 membranes were investigated by filtration of the sodium alginate solution with100 ppm concentration as observed in fig 15 the permeate water flux of the both neat m0 and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes declined quickly during the first 20 min of sodium alginate filtration the water flux decline of m5 membrane was very lower rather than the neat pes membrane it seems that the modification of the pes membrane by chitosan and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles improved the antifouling properties for analyzing the antifouling properties the flux recovery ratio reversible and irreversible resistance and total flux loss were calculated for neat pes and modified m5 membranes the results were given in table 4 it can be found that m5 has represented high flux recovery ratio and low total flux loss compared to m0 membrane m5 membrane has shown 68 and 40 flux recovery ratio and total flux loss respectively whereas these values are 43 and 57 for neat pes membrane it is noteworthy that m0 has shown high irreversible resistance compared to m5 irreversible resistance is 56 for m0 while this value is about 36 for m5 the antifouling properties enhancement of m5 is due to the appearance of hydrophilic chitosan layer and also nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface more hydrophilicity of the membrane surface is prevented the biofilm formation by foulants attachment furthermore by formation a hydrophilic layer the chance for foulant molecules to contact with membrane surface were dramatically decreased 66 3 10 stability test 3 10 1 stability of the immobilized nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the concentrations of iron in the feed and permeate solution were measured 3 5 1 and 2 8 1 μg l respectively these values are very low compared to the maximal permissible limit of iron in drinking water i e 300 μg l in the world health organization guideline who 54 fe nanoparticles stability in static soaking was also evaluated by measuring the release from the m5 m5 membrane was soaked in 30 ml of distilled water for 20 days and then the releasing amounts of fe into water were measured as 136 2 μg l at 25 c 3 10 2 stability test of lbl layers in this work the stability of the membrane was examined by immersion of the membrane samples in water and sodium hypochlorite solution because the cleaning cannot be ignored in practical application the surface hydrophilicity by contact angle and transport property by permeate water flux were utilized as indicators to examine the membrane stability the results represented that no notable change in contact angle was observed for the neat pes membrane after immersion in water while slight decline was observed after incubating in sodium hypochlorite naocl solution for m5 membrane immersion in the water did not change the contact angle of membrane while contact angle slightly increased after immersion in naocl solution indeed slight increasing in contact angle of m5 indicated that the stability of polyelectrolyte bilayers on the membrane surface was low influenced by incubating in naocl fig 16 a and b demonstrates the water flux stability of the neat pes and m5 membranes during incubating it is clearly observed that the flux did not change after immersion in water for both membranes by contrast a relatively considerable increase in water flux was observed for both membranes after incubating in naocl solution 4 conclusion the novel pes membranes with a different bilayer of chitosan alginate and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles were fabricated via lbl assembly technology for cr vi removal from aqueous solution for aqueous solution with 5 ppm feed concentration the pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane has shown 100 and 76 4 cr vi removal in permeate and retentate streams respectively the loading of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface resulted in significant enhancement in hydrophilicity and water flux of membranes water flux increased from 161 l m2 h for neat pes to 186 l m2 h for m2 containing nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the fabricated membranes have shown high cr vi removal at low ph m5 membrane showed about 100 71 48 and 42 cr vi removal for aqueous solution with 5 ppm feed concentration and ph 3 5 7 and10 the results indicated that the modification of pes with chitosan layer and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles led to high flux recovery ratio and low total flux loss the m5 represented 68 and 40 flux recovery ratio and total flux loss respectively while these values were 43 and 57 for m0 acknowledgment the authors acknowledge the funding support of babol noshirvani university of

13913,photocatalytic polyethersulfone pes membranes with a high degree of hexavalent chromium cr vi removal hydrophilicity water permeability and antifouling properties were fabricated via layer by layer assembly lbl technology the novel pes ultrafiltration uf membranes were developed with different bilayers of chitosan chi alginate alg and nano zero valent iron tio2 nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the morphology chemical structure and wettability of synthesized nanoparticles and fabricated membranes were characterized by fesem afm edx xrd ftir and contact angle analyzer the pes uf membrane containing four chi layers and one layer of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles m5 has shown maximum efficiency for cr vi removal from permeate and retentate streams compared to the other membranes 100 98 1 and 95 5 cr vi removal in permeate and 76 4 46 7 and 34 4 cr vi removal in retentate were obtained for 5 15 and 30 ppm feed concentration respectively the modifications of the neat pes led to high hydrophilicity and desirable antifouling properties the water flux of neat pes m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 membrane were obtained 161 152 186 147 178 and 170 l m2 h respectively according to results the membranes containing nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles have shown high water flux moreover m5 membrane has exhibited 68 flux recovery whereas neat pes membrane has shown 43 for 5 ppm feed concentration the cr vi removal decreased from an about 100 to 71 2 48 2 and 42 1 with increasing ph from 3 to 5 7 and 10 respectively keywords multilayer membrane ultrafiltration layer by layer photocatalytic nzvi tio2 cr vi removal 1 introduction industrial wastewater must be treated to a standard level before discharging to the environment 1 hexavalent chromium cr vi is the one of prevalent contaminants of leather electroplating staining glass and metallurgy wastewater the presence of this ion in water sources causes irreparable risks including the risk of developing lung cancer asthma or damage to the nasal epithelia and skin for a human 2 4 various technologies have been used to remove chromium from wastewater such as adsorption precipitation ion exchange reduction and membrane filtration 5 6 recently membrane filtration is known as a suitable method for removal of cr vi ions from the aqueous solution because of single step process and low cost effective treatment 5 among different membrane processes nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are the promising techniques to bring the concentration of hexavalent chromium of water resources to an acceptable level yoon and et al studied the rejection of chromate by two nanofiltration membranes nf esna and mx07 and reverse osmosis ro lfc 1 one cr vi rejection was followed by the order of esna 30 90 mx07 25 95 lfc 1 90 at all ph range 7 barikbin et al investigated the cr vi removal from water in the presence of sulfate by polyamide nf membrane nf90 film tec corporation according to the results the nf membrane represented 96 rejection at the basic ph 8 however nf and ro are inefficient when they are used for wastewater treatment due to the high degree of fouling moreover these membranes only remove cr vi ions from permeate and cr vi concentration of concentrate stream increases over time this restriction and also the commitment to the cost effective method encouraged us to use the developed ultrafiltration membrane for the removal of chromium ions chromium exists in two stable oxidation forms in water source trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi low concentration of cr iii is essential for a mammalian system regarding the non toxicity and lower solubility of cr iii species the reduction of hexavalent chromium to trivalent state has attracted the researcher s attention as an economical method for removal of chromium from water source 9 the maximum allowable limits of cr vi and cr iii ions concentration in water sources were reported 0 05 and 5 ppm respectively 10 in particular the photocatalytic reactions are a highly promising technique for the cr vi removal from water and wastewater cheng et al investigated the cr vi removal using wo3 zno and natao3 metal oxides these photocatalysts represented an efficient removal of cr vi in alkaline and synthetic neutral water 2 yi and et al achieved to 81 2 of cr vi removal by the fe fe2o3 nanowires in oxic condition and 100 of cr vi removal in the anoxic condition 11 at the present work we have decided to merge both reduction of cr vi to cr iii and ultrafiltration in a one step as the simple and economical strategy to eliminate the cr vi ions along with lowering other macromolecular contaminants of plating wastewater for this purpose the pes ultrafiltration uf membrane was firstly modified by polyelectrolyte bilayers and then the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles were coated on the top layer of the modified pes uf membrane surface via layer by layer lbl technique to remove the chromium ions through reduction of cr vi ions to non toxic and insoluble cr iii ions instead of molecular sieving mechanism of nf actually the main advantage of fabricated membranes is the degradation of chromium content in the retentate stream during the ultrafiltration process to modify the pes uf membrane by lbl technique the pes pores were coated with polyelectrolyte bilayer of chitosan chi as a polycation and sodium alginate alg as a polyanion then the nano zero valent iron tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles nzvi tio2 were coated on the top layer of membrane to reduce the cr vi ions to cr iii under uv irradiation it is noteable that some recent studies have reported that the uv irradiation is not able to destroy the pes structure in long term expriments 12 13 petala and et al studied the removal of cr vi with nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles showed high efficiency for the removal of cr vi from water the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles have represented a significant reduction effect due to the synergistic contributions of tio2 and nzvi 14 as it was reported in some literature both nano zero valent iron and tio2 nanoparticles have separately shown the reduction ability for cr vi ions 15 17 it was proved that the tio2 nanoparticles can reduce the chromate ions by the catalytic oxidation of pollutants through formation of electron hole pairs under the illumination of near uv light however the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 is limited by the high degree of recombination of electrons and holes one of the promising technique to overcome this limitation is the addition of transition metal such as nano zero valent iron dopant to decline the recombination degree 18 19 it can generate doping energy and accelerate the transition of the excited electrons from tio2 to nano zero valent iron on the other words the presence of nano zero valent iron in nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles can intensify the photocatalytic reduction of the cr vi ions 20 a comprehensive investigation was accomplished on the cr vi removal efficiency and fouling properties of the various fabricated membranes since the number of the bilayer is a very important issue in lbl method 21 the effect of the number of chitosan layers on hydrophilicity membrane performance and fouling was studied 2 experimental 2 1 material n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 8 from merck was used as a solvent to prepare the casting solution polyethersulfone pes ultrason 6020 was used as the base polymer for preparation of the uf

sodium borohydride nabh4 as a reducing agent were obtained from merck 1 5 diphenyl carbazide dpc was purchased from merck and was used as a color complexion agent for colorimetric measurement of cr vi ions 2 2 synthesis of tio2 and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles for synthesis the tio2 nanoparticles titanium butoxide 20 ml were added into h2o etoh solution 16 5 ml 1 3 v v titanium butoxide 59 21 wt and then hydrochloric acid 0 28 ml 38 wt was added the mixture was stirred to form a gel finally the gel was dried in an oven at 80 c for 11 h and calcinated in a conventional muffle furnace at 400 c for 1 h the synthesis of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles was performed as follow ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o 0 2 g was dissolved in 7 ml ethanol 99 99 and then the tio2 nanoparticles 0

adding the nabh4 as a reducing agent 0 4 g nabh4 in 7 ml distilled water 5 42 wt after 30 min stagnation the mixture was centrifuged to separate the solids the resulting product was washed 5 times with ethanol and was dried in vacuum oven 14 2 3 preparation of multilayer pes uf membrane the flat sheet pes uf membrane was fabricated through phase inversion according to our previous work 22 generally the pes membranes are negatively charged the isoelectric point for pes membrane is ph 4 5 23 for modification of the pes uf membrane by lbl assembly the neat pes membrane was cut into suitable size in accordance with cell dimension and was stuck on a glass plate the membrane was immersed in the chitosan solution 0 1 wt 1 g chitosan in 1 v v acetic acid distilled water with ph 5 5 5 for 30 min step 1 the ph of polyelectrolyte solution was adjusted by naoh and hcl solutions after 30 min the membrane was immersed in distilled water to remove excess chitosan 10 min step 2 then the impregnated membrane was immersed in sodium alginate solution with ph 7 and 1 g l 0 1 wt step 3 and after that the membrane was washed with distilled water to remove excess alginate for 10 min step 4 these four steps resulted in the membrane containing one chitosan alginate chi alg bilayer upon pes uf support this procedure was repeated m times to fabricate the modified membranes with m bilayer chi alg m at the final step the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticle was coated on the top layer as follow the multilayered membrane was placed on a rectangular frame so that only the top surface was exposed to the solution then a mixture of ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o absolute ethanol and tio2 nanoparticles was poured on the membrane surface when the solution containing ferric chloride absolute ethanol and tio2 nanoparticles is poured on the lbl membrane surface this solution tends to penetrate in the surface pores due to the capillary force after penetration and evaporation of ethanol the surface color altered to yellow these impregnated membranes were washed with ethanol several times and were put aside for a few minutes to become dry by pouring the reducing agent solution 0 2 g nabh4 in 7 ml distilled water on the impregnated membrane surface the fe3 is trapped into the porous anatase matrix as the fe nzvi particles 14 24 25 finally the modified membrane was washed with ethanol and was dried in oven at 85 for 5 min fig 1 shows the steps of nanoparticle coating on the membrane surface the various membranes were fabricated to investigate the effect of chitosan layers and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles in removal of cr vi ions from aqueous solution the m1 membrane with one chitosan layer was prepared to study the adsorption effect of chitosan the m1 membrane was modified by nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles to study the reduction effect of photocatalytic nanoparticles in cr vi removal m2 for investigation the influence of the number of chitosan layers m3

x ray diffraction jcpds card no 21 1272 patterns of nanoparticles and membranes were obtained at 40 kv 100 ma in the range of 10 80 2 5 performance assay 2 5 1 batch removal the aim of batch removal test is the comparison of the removal ability of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles and modified membranes a batch experiment was performed to confirm the ability of prepared multilayer membranes in cr vi removal on the other word the adsorption effect of chitosan layers and also influence of the presence of photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface in cr vi removal were investigated through the batch removal test for this purpose the m0 m1 m2 m3 and m5 membranes were cut into small pieces 26 28 a certain weight of the membrane pieces and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles were put in 30 ml cr vi solution cr vi solution was prepared by solving the potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in distilled water after 360 min shaking under uv irradiation at room temperature the cr vi concentration of the solutions was measured and cr vi removal was calculated by the following equation 28 29 removal 1 cfinal cinitial 100 it should be noted that the removal ability of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles was evaluated with and without uv irradiation to study the effect of uv irradiation on the cr vi removal cr vi concentration was measured through the colorimetric method by uv spectrophotometer uv 2100 spectrophotometer at 540 nm 11 30 2 5 2 removal of cr vi using membrane filtration all multilayer membranes were evaluated in a cross flow system with a plexiglas acrylic cell with approximately 40 cm2 effective area which was placed in a uv chamber including three 8 w uv lamps hitachi japan the water flux and cr vi removal in the permeate and retentate streams were assessed under 1 5 bar pressure and ambient temperature fig 2 demonstrates a schematic of the used cross flow system the permeation flux was calculated as follow f v a t where v is the water volume l was collected in a time of t h and a is the active area of membranes m2 the cr vi removal was calculated as the following equation for permeate rp 1 consp consf and for retentate rr 1 consr consf where rp and rr refer to cr vi removal in permeate and retentate streams respectively consf consp and consr are the cr vi concentration in feed permeate and retentate streams respectively 31 2 5 3 antifouling properties of the membranes antifouling properties of the membranes were investigated using filtration test by100 ppm of sodium alginate solution as a foulant to start the fouling test the membranes were first tested by distilled water during 30 min jwi then the feed tank was replaced with a 100 ppm sodium alginate solution and the permeate flux was evaluated jp after 400 min filtration the membranes were rinsed with distilled water for 15 min and the flux of cleaned membranes was measured by distilled water for 60 min jwc to investigate the antifouling properties the flux recovery ratio frr was calculated by the following equation frr jwc jwi 100 the membranes antifouling properties were investigated by rt jwi jp jwi 100 where rt is the total flux decline due to total fouling reversible and irreversible fouling was evaluated by rr and rir 32 33 rr jwc jp jwi 100 rir jwi jwc jwi 100 rt rr rir 2 6 stability test 2 6 1 stability of the immobilized nzvi tio2 the stabilization of the immobilized nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles was investigated by detecting the iron leaching of pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 membrane in a cross flow system the leaching test was performed via filtration of the distilled water 5 0 l through m5 membrane for 120 min at 25 c 2 bars and 0 22 m s velocity about 200 ml of permeate was collected for analysis the concentrations of dissolved iron in permeate and feed solutions were measured by atomic absorption varian aa 240 australia the iron release from pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 membrane in static soaking was also measured the m5 membrane with a specified area 6 cm2 was immersed into 30 ml of distilled water at 25 c after 20 days under stirring the iron concentration of the solution was analyzed by atomic absorption 34 2 6 2 stability test of lbl layers the stability test was carried out by immersion of the membrane samples in water and sodium hypochlorite solution with 400 ppm chlorine concentration for 10 days water is usually utilized to wash the membranes before chemical cleaning sodium hypochlorite had been known as a most favorite chemical cleaning agent to eliminate the irreversible fouling 35 36 water flux and surface hydrophilicity were evaluated to study the variation of the membrane properties the stability experiments were performed by neat pes m0 and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes in the case of water flux study the permeate water flux was firstly evaluated before soaking and then the membranes were immersed in sodium hypochlorite naocl solution for a specified number of days finally the membranes were rinsed and the permeate water flux was again measured 37 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical properties of membranes atr ftir was used to analyze the surface functional groups of m0 m1 and m5 the atr ftir spectra are represented in fig 3 as seen the common peaks related to the pes polymer are observed in three membranes the bands at 1156 cm 1 and 1322 cm 1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of oso in pes sublayer respectively 38 the bands at 854 cm 1 and 872 cm 1 are attributed to the c h group of benzene rings out of plane mode furthermore the peaks at 1010 cm 1 and 1246 cm 1 are related to the characteristic band of aroar linkage in pes the band at 1152 cm 1 is related to a sulfone group in pes in vibrational stretching mode 39 the bands at 1106 cm 1 and 1486 cm 1 have corresponded to co and c s bands in pes respectively 40 41 the spectrum of the pes chi and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes demonstrates the characteristic absorption band at 1580 cm 1 and 1655 cm 1 which are the characteristic deformation of the amide ii and amide i respectively in addition the absorption band at 1068 cm 1 co stretching is the characteristic of the saccharide structure these three peaks are indicated the presence of the chitosan layer on the surface of the m1 and m5 membrane 42 43 the wide band at 3200 3700 cm 1 which was intensified in m1 and m5 can be due to the presence of hydroxyl groups 41 moreover the band at 600 cm 1 has corresponded to ti o band it is related to the presence of tio2 in surface of m5 membrane 43 the xrd spectra for nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles neat pes membrane and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane were shown in fig 4 in case of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ 26 7 38 45 1 54 2 55 1 63 and 70 5 which corresponds to their crystal planes 101 004 110 105 211 204 and 220 20 44 45 the characteristic peak at the 45 1 is related to the presence of nzvi in the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles according to curve b it can be found that the pes membrane is mainly amorphous and represents a prominent diffraction peak without any crystallinity at about 2θ 18 46 47 as seen the pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane clearly shows six crystalline characteristic peaks at about 2θ 27 37 3 45 4 54 4 55 3 62 8 and 70 1 which are similar to the characteristic diffraction peaks of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles moreover a peak is observed at 2θ 18 that is related to the amorphous neat pes 48 the presence of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer of pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane was investigated by edx spectrum fig 5 as can be seen three peaks around 0 5 6 5 and 7 kev are belonged to lα kα and kβ intensity of fe and two peaks around 0 5 and 5 kev are belonged to lα and kβ intensity of ti respectively 48 49 3 2 surface morphology fig 6 demonstrates the surface and cross sectional fesem images of neat pes m0 and developed membranes all membranes represented a typical asymmetric structure with a dense skin layer on top layer a porous middle layer and finger like macropores at the bottom see fig 6a d 49 based on fig 6 a c it can be visually seen that the m1 and m3 membranes have shown a relatively smooth surface compared to m0 this can indicate that the chitosan and sodium alginate layers covered the surface of pes membrane the fesem cross sectional images of multilayer membranes showed that a relatively thick skin layer has formed on the porous substrate after immersion of neat pes support in polyelectrolyte solutions 50 51 according to b c and d images the thickness of coated layer on the pes support is increased from 205 nm to 706 nm with increasing the number of bilayers fig 6 d demonstrates that the nanoparticles with an average size about 40 nm have covered the top layer of membrane surface also the partial aggregation of nanoparticles can be seen on the membrane surface this may be evidence of increasing the membrane surface roughness the size distribution of deposited nanoparticles on the surface of pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 membrane m5 was extracted from fesem image and image j software as estimated by image j software the average size of established nanoparticles was around 40 nm and the bar graph showed the narrow nanoparticles size distribution of deposited nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on m5 membrane surface see fig 7 the edx mapping analysis was also performed to investigate the dispersion quality of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles as seen in fig 8 a and b nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the membrane surface the afm images of the m0 m1 m2 m3 and m5 membranes surfaces are presented in fig 9 the roughness parameters are presented in terms of sa sq and sy in table 2 the neat pes membrane illustrated a relatively smooth surface with sa 18 75 nm when the pes membrane immersed in chitosan solution for a 30 min sa decreased to 15 63 nm so it can be concluded that a smooth layer covered the surface of pes support membrane 52 sa increased to 160 nm for m5 membrane the results indicated that the formation of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer of membrane increases the roughness of membrane surface as observed in fesem images this is attributed to the agglomeration of the nanoparticles on the membrane surface by comparing the afm results for m2 and m3 with m1 and m5 membranes can be found that the surface roughness has not significantly changed by increasing the bilayers numbers 3 3 surface wettability the surface wettability of the fabricated membranes was determined using the contact angle analyzer lower contact angle values mean the higher tendency of the membrane to wetting with water contact angle of pes substrate was obtained 62 5 1 it declined to 53 3 2 after the formation of the chitosan layer on its surface it can be attributed to the presence of amine and hydroxyl functional groups in the chitosan structure contact angle of membrane surface significantly dropped to about 0 0 by incorporation of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer it means that the membrane surface was almost completely wetted it can be attributed to the super hydrophilic nature of tio2 nanoparticles and the presence of nzvi in the structure of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles formation the iron oxy hydroxide with highly hydrophilicity on the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticle surface is another reason for high hydrophilicity of the membrane surface 53 on the other hand the oxygen atom and oh group of the hydroxides formed a hydrogen bond with oh group and the oxygen atom of water molecules which led to enhanced wettability of the membrane surface 54 56 according to the results it is predicted that the membrane containing nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles will represent higher water flux compared to the other membranes 3 4 batch removal test the batch experiment was performed to investigate the ability of synthesized nanoparticle and fabricated membranes for cr vi removal for evaluation the effect of uv irradiation on the cr vi removal the batch experiments were carried out using nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticle in the presence and absence of the uv irradiation fig 10 demonstrates that the cr vi removal was completed during about 150 min under uv irradiation whereas the cr vi removal dropped to about 78 in absence uv irradiation this indicated that the completion of the cr vi removal reaction was only achieved in the presence of uv irradiation this attributed to the inability of tio2 in absence of uv irradiation it should be noted that the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles exhibit enhanced remediation capability even without irradiation 14 the reaction between nzvi and cr vi can be promoted by more than one mechanism as follow the nzvi reduces cr vi to cr iii by reaction of route a it also immobilized the cr vi ions by precipitation as cr oh 3 or by incorporation into the iron hydr oxide shell forming alloy like cr iii fe iii hydroxides through route b some cr vi ions can also directly adsorb on the hydr oxide shell of nzvi see route c 57 59 route a 3 f e 0 c r 2 o 7 2 7 h 2 o 3 f e 2

membranes the neat pes m0 m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 membranes were cut into small pieces about 3 mm 3 mm and put in 30 ml cr vi solution with different concentrations 10 and 30 ppm based on the results table 3 m5 membrane containing four chitosan layers and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the top layer has shown maximum removal compared to other fabricated membranes in this work the cr vi ions were removed by modified membranes based on two mechanisms i an electrostatic attraction between amine groups of chitosan layer and cr vi ions in feed solution the cr vi ions exist in different anion forms in aqueous solution i e cr o 4 2 cr2 o 7 2 and hcr o 4 ions 60 a comparison between m0 and m1 clearly shows the cr vi ions removal for a pes uf membrane increased from 3 2 1 to 14 7 2 after deposition of chitosan layer upon the pes membrane surface comparison between m1 and m3 with different chitosan layer shows that the more number of chitosan layers lead to increase the adsorption capacity of the membrane ii another removal factor is the presence of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles as seen the cr vi removal was significantly enhanced from 14 7 2 for pes uf chi to 68 5 1 for pes uf chi nzvi tio2 and from 20 2 for pes uf chi alg chi m3 to 76 1 for pes uf chi alg chi nzvi tio2 m4 this indicated that the cr vi reduction was controlled by the presence of nzvi photocatalytic property of tio2 and synergetic effect of both nanoparticles according to studies tio2 nanoparticles can form charge carriers such as positive holes h and electrons e under uv irradiation these reactive species is employed as red ox counterparts driving the cr vi removal reactions tio2 absorbs photons with hν 3 2 ev tio2 band gap 3 2 ev so it leads to the valence electrons jump to the conduction band e c b the eq 1 shows the process leaves positive holes in the valence band h v b 1 t i o 2 h v e c b h v b the positive holes could then react with surface bound water and surface hydroxyls the latter acts as the main hole acceptor in tio2 photocatalysis and produces radicals as shown by eqs 2 and 3 2 h v b h 2 o o h h or 3 h v b o h s u r f o h s u r f these charges can also interact directly with adsorbed cr vi ions in the next reactions when nano zero iron valent as electron scavengers was dispersed on the tio2 surface it seems that the tio2 and nzvi have synergetic effect in removal of chromate ions under uv irradiation in order to trap the photogenerated electrons as following reactions 14 4 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e c b 2 c r 3 7 h 2 o 5 2 h 2 o 4 h v b

removal of chromium ions 3 5 membrane performance the filtration test was carried out for m0 m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 in a cross flow system at room temperature under uv irradiation and 1 5 bar the experiments were accomplished with different feed concentrations 5 15 and 30 ppm retentate and permeate were collected periodically to calculate the cr vi removal in permeate and retentate streams 3 6 cr vi removal in permeates fig 11 demonstrates the percentage of cr vi removal by neat pes uf m0 pes chi m1 pes chi nzvi tio2 m2 pes chi alg chi m3 pes chi alg chi nzvi tio2 m4 and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes using different feed concentration as be seen the m5 membrane has shown maximum removal percentage compared to the other membranes 97 1 99 1 2 and 100 1 cr vi removal were obtained for 30 15 and 5 ppm feed concentration at ph 3 respectively whereas m4 m3 m2 m1 and m0 have shown 87 4 2 41 9 2 82 5 1 33 1 2 and 12 5 1 removal for 5 ppm feed concentration respectively the results indicated that the removal percentage was significantly increased by loading nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface m2 m4 and m5 as be seen in fig 12 the m5 membrane has shown high cr vi removal at low ph for 5 ppm feed concentration cr vi removal decreased from an about 100 to 71 2 48 2 and 42 1 with increasing ph from 3 to 5 7 and 10 respectively cr vi ions exist as an anion in aqueous solution anions adsorb on the chitosan layer by a ligand exchange reaction at low ph because the positive charge and site hydration are desirable at low ph as mentioned chromium ions exist as different forms such as hcr2 o 7 cr2 o 7 2 cr o 4 2 and hcr o 4 in aqueous solution with different ph 60 the adsorption of cr vi ions enhanced with a decline of the ph at low ph hcr o 4 is the dominant species of cr vi ions in the aqueous solution which is gradually replaced by the other species of cr vi such as cr o 4 2 as ph increases the adsorption free energy of hcr o 4 is less than cr o 4 2 this can be led to the higher adsorption of hcr o 4 rather than cr o 4 2 at the same concentration 61 the adsorption of hcr o 4 may be due to a electrostatic interaction between the positively charged chitosan layer and the negatively charged hcr o 4 ions because chitosan should be positively charged at low ph and since hcr o 4 is the dominant species in solution therefore the low ph can help to the adsorption of the anionic species of cr vi on the chitosan layer and finally lead to the higher cr vi removal from the aqueous solution on the other hand the electrostatic attraction between protonated amine groups which is induced at low ph and cr vi anions limits the passage of cr vi anions through membrane pores moreover the low ph of the solution leads to the enhancement of reaction rates of reduction of cr vi ions by nzvi nanoparticles when the ph of the cr vi solution becomes higher than 6 the neutral and negatively charged groups on the tio2 nanoparticles surface gradually increase this leads to an electrostatic repulsion of the chromium ions species i e cr2o7 2 hcro4 and cro4 2 and finally the reactivity reduces 62 in addition to the above the reduction oxidation reactions on the surface of nzvi nanoparticles carried out via accelerating the corrosion at lower ph 63 64 3 7 cr vi removal in retentate fig 13 demonstrates the cr vi removal percentage in the retentate stream the pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane has represented high removal percentage in retentate compared to the other membranes 76 4 46 7 and 32 4 cr vi removal after 30 min were obtained for 5 15 and 30 ppm feed concentration respectively very low removal of neat pes may be related to the trapping a bit cr vi ions in the membrane pores as observed all membranes containing nanoparticles have shown a relatively high removal due to the presence of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the nzvi reduces cr vi to cr iii and immobilized them through precipitation as cr oh 3 or by incorporation into the iron hydr oxide shell forming alloy like cr iii fe iii hydroxides some cr vi ions also directly adsorb on the hydr oxide shell of nzvi 58 60 m1 and m3 have shown about 13 and 18 removal for 30 ppm feed concentration these results indicate that the cr vi removal increases with increasing the chi alg bilayer number this is due to increasing the adsorption capacity of the membranes 3 8 water flux enhancement fig 14 demonstrates the permeate water flux for different membranes according to the results the membranes containing nanoparticles have shown high water flux rather than the neat pes membrane this can be attributed to the increase of the membrane roughness due to the enhancement of the available area for the water transport 49 65 high hydrophilicity of these membranes surface is another reason for flux enhancement the water flux significantly increased from about 152 l m2 h for m1 to about 186 l m2 h by coating the nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the chitosan layer m2 as expected the water flux decreased by increasing the bilayers number this is due to the increment of membrane resistance directly and mass transfer zone indirectly as seen the water flux declined from about 161 l m2 h for neat to about 152 l m2 h for m1 with one chitosan layer and about 147 l m2 h for m3 with two chitosan layer 3 9 antifouling properties antifouling properties of the neat pes and m5 membranes were investigated by filtration of the sodium alginate solution with100 ppm concentration as observed in fig 15 the permeate water flux of the both neat m0 and pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membranes declined quickly during the first 20 min of sodium alginate filtration the water flux decline of m5 membrane was very lower rather than the neat pes membrane it seems that the modification of the pes membrane by chitosan and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles improved the antifouling properties for analyzing the antifouling properties the flux recovery ratio reversible and irreversible resistance and total flux loss were calculated for neat pes and modified m5 membranes the results were given in table 4 it can be found that m5 has represented high flux recovery ratio and low total flux loss compared to m0 membrane m5 membrane has shown 68 and 40 flux recovery ratio and total flux loss respectively whereas these values are 43 and 57 for neat pes membrane it is noteworthy that m0 has shown high irreversible resistance compared to m5 irreversible resistance is 56 for m0 while this value is about 36 for m5 the antifouling properties enhancement of m5 is due to the appearance of hydrophilic chitosan layer and also nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface more hydrophilicity of the membrane surface is prevented the biofilm formation by foulants attachment furthermore by formation a hydrophilic layer the chance for foulant molecules to contact with membrane surface were dramatically decreased 66 3 10 stability test 3 10 1 stability of the immobilized nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the concentrations of iron in the feed and permeate solution were measured 3 5 1 and 2 8 1 μg l respectively these values are very low compared to the maximal permissible limit of iron in drinking water i e 300 μg l in the world health organization guideline who 54 fe nanoparticles stability in static soaking was also evaluated by measuring the release from the m5 m5 membrane was soaked in 30 ml of distilled water for 20 days and then the releasing amounts of fe into water were measured as 136 2 μg l at 25 c 3 10 2 stability test of lbl layers in this work the stability of the membrane was examined by immersion of the membrane samples in water and sodium hypochlorite solution because the cleaning cannot be ignored in practical application the surface hydrophilicity by contact angle and transport property by permeate water flux were utilized as indicators to examine the membrane stability the results represented that no notable change in contact angle was observed for the neat pes membrane after immersion in water while slight decline was observed after incubating in sodium hypochlorite naocl solution for m5 membrane immersion in the water did not change the contact angle of membrane while contact angle slightly increased after immersion in naocl solution indeed slight increasing in contact angle of m5 indicated that the stability of polyelectrolyte bilayers on the membrane surface was low influenced by incubating in naocl fig 16 a and b demonstrates the water flux stability of the neat pes and m5 membranes during incubating it is clearly observed that the flux did not change after immersion in water for both membranes by contrast a relatively considerable increase in water flux was observed for both membranes after incubating in naocl solution 4 conclusion the novel pes membranes with a different bilayer of chitosan alginate and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles were fabricated via lbl assembly technology for cr vi removal from aqueous solution for aqueous solution with 5 ppm feed concentration the pes chi alg 3 chi nzvi tio2 m5 membrane has shown 100 and 76 4 cr vi removal in permeate and retentate streams respectively the loading of nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles on the membrane surface resulted in significant enhancement in hydrophilicity and water flux of membranes water flux increased from 161 l m2 h for neat pes to 186 l m2 h for m2 containing nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles the fabricated membranes have shown high cr vi removal at low ph m5 membrane showed about 100 71 48 and 42 cr vi removal for aqueous solution with 5 ppm feed concentration and ph 3 5 7 and10 the results indicated that the modification of pes with chitosan layer and nzvi tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles led to high flux recovery ratio and low total flux loss the m5 represented 68 and 40 flux recovery ratio and total flux loss respectively while these values were 43 and 57 for m0 acknowledgment the authors acknowledge the funding support of babol noshirvani university of

13914,in full scale drinking water production plants in the netherlands central softening is widely used for reasons related to public health client comfort and economic and environmental benefits almost 500 million cubic meters of water is softened annually through seeded crystallisation in fluidised bed reactors the societal call for a circular economy has put pressure on this treatment process to become more sustainable by optimising relevant process conditions the consumption of chemicals can be reduced and raw materials reused optimal process conditions are feasible if the specific crystallisation surface area in the fluidised bed is large enough to support the performance of the seeded crystallisation process to determine the specific surface area crucial variables including voidage and particle size must be known numerous models can be found in the literature to estimate the voidage in liquid solid fluidisation processes many of these models are based on semi empirical porous media based drag relations like ergun or semi empirical terminal settling based models such as richardson zaki and fitted for monodisperse almost perfectly round particles in this study we present new voidage prediction models based on accurate data obtained from elaborate pilot plant experiments and non linear symbolic regression methods the models were compared with the most popular voidage prediction models using different statistical methods an explicit model for voidage estimation based on the dimensionless reynolds and froude numbers is presented here that can be used for a wide range of particle sizes fluid velocities and temperatures and that can therefore be directly used in water treatment processes such as drinking water pellet softening the advantage of this model is that there is no need for applying numerical solutions therefore it can be explicitly implemented the prediction errors for classical models from the literature lie between 2 7 and 11 4 with

magnesium and other metal cations from water 1 central softening of drinking water is currently frequently applied in several countries e g the netherlands belgium germany france and the usa while domestic softening is the most frequently applied way of softening in other countries 2 4 in full scale drinking water production plants in the netherlands central softening is widely used for reasons related to public health client comfort and economic and environmental benefits 5 7 specifically in areas with high water hardness centralised drinking water softening can reduce the consumption of soap detergents and other household chemicals and increase the service life and energy efficiency of household appliances such as coffee machines due to a reduction in calcium carbonate scaling 8 9 in the netherlands in 2020 almost 500 million cubic meters of water is being softened annually through seeded crystallisation in fluidised bed reactors a process known as pellet softening 10 primarily removing calcium cations from the water pellet softening was developed and introduced in the netherlands in the 1970s 11 in other fields crystallisation in fluidised bed reactors is also becoming increasingly popular examples include the removal of hardness from natural hard ground waters 12 the recovery of co2 in direct air capture processes 13 the improvement of pellet characteristics for reuse potentials 14 reduced sludge production 15 groundwater softening in circulating pellet fluidised bed reactors usage in thermal power plants 16 and organic micropollutant removal from groundwater 17 there is also a growing interest in fluidisation of biomass particles 18 fluidised bed reactors used in wastewater treatment 19 and other liquid solid fluidisation techniques with many applications in engineering 1 20 21 in pellet softening 22 drinking water is treated in an up flow fluidised cylindrical bed reactor with flow velocity of 60 120 m h the amsterdam reactor 23 is currently a widely applied fluidised bed reactor 60 90 m h a strong chemical base usually caustic soda or calcium hydroxide combined with a seeding material is dosed to obtain supersaturated conditions in the water phase and is subsequently well mixed in the reactor high ph leads to an alteration of the calcium carbonate equilibrium in which the solubility product is exceeded and caco3 precipitates on the surface of the seeding material thereby forming pellets seeds typically quartz sand 24 garnet sand 25 or limestone calcite are introduced in the reactor and fluidised under upward flow the calcium carbonate crystallisation on the seeds mainly occurs in the lower region of the reactor 11 23 due to the crystallisation the calcite pellets grow and migrate to the bottom of the reactor when a defined grain size threshold is exceeded a small part of the pellets is extracted from the bottom of the reactor 26 the calcite pellets that are produced as a by product in these plants can be reused as seeding material after grinding and sieving of the produced pellets 27 pellets are the main by product from the softening process and by identifying reuse applications they potentially represent a resource rather than a waste product thus promoting the establishment of a circular economy the main advantages of this reuse are an expected significant decrease of the ecological footprint of both calcite as raw material and the drinking water treatment plants using pellet softening and an increased valorisation of the pellets 28 process optimisation 26 and control 29 has been focussed primarily on pellets grown on garnet sand as seeding material the transition from garnet sand as a seeding material to reused crushed calcite took place at waternet from 2014 to 2016 1 2 sustainability goals there is a wide range of definitions of the concept of sustainability the world commission on environment and development 30 defines sustainability as the development that meets the needs of current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs and aspirations the importance of continuing the development of a worldwide clean and sustainable water supply is increasing 31 in general drinking water suppliers have become more and more focussed on appropriate sustainable treatment technologies 32 optimal process conditions of water treatment processes contribute to the sustainability goals of public water organisations since fewer chemicals less energy and fewer raw materials are needed 33 34 the city of amsterdam the netherlands has the ambition to develop itself as a competitive and sustainable european metropolis 35 the flows of energy water and resources within the urban environment offer a large potential to contribute to this ambition through a transition from the linear usage of resources and waste production towards the sustainable management of urban resources with circular flows of resources currently the detrimental contributions of pellet softening are in particular related to the consumption of chemicals like caustic soda and raw materials such as garnet sand mined in australia and shipped to the netherlands both of which contribute to the carbon footprint and the environmental burden presented by the dutch drinking water companies 8 a life cycle assessment study has shown that pellet softening can be improved in terms of eco efficiency 36 the role of more sustainable pellet softening is twofold it concerns the transition from garnet sand to reused calcite pellets 28 as well as the reduced consumption of caustic soda 8 in an optimal fluidised bed reactor both aspects imply the need for more accurate information of the fluidised bed conditions to be able to acquire the process state of the fluidised bed the most important process variable i e the effective specific surface area ssa for the purpose of crystallisation must be known therefore the effective voidage must be determined ssa is either based on the total reactor volume or on the water phase in the reactor to be discussed in section 3 2 an optimal operational configuration will lead to a sustainable operational approach for pellet softening by using as little chemicals and raw materials as possible and ultimately leading to a more environmentally sustainable drinking water supply 14 waternet the public water utility of amsterdam and surroundings is seeking a sustainable scenario for producing drinking water and offering services that fulfil the requirements of clients and regulations and at the same time maintaining a sound environmental performance while keeping costs as low as possible 37 to meet sustainability goals and to promote the development of a circular economy waternet has modified its pellet softening processes 28 in which garnet grains have been replaced by calcite seeding particles that are based on crushed dried sieved and reused calcium carbonate pellets the garnet core inside the pellets hinders their potential application in market segments such as the glass paper food cosmetics and feed industries the pellet market value and the sustainability of the softening process can be increased through the substitution of the sand grain by a calcite grain of 0 5 mm 100 calcium carbonate if the calcite pellets are crushed dried and sieved they can be reused as a seeding material 27 to reduce the required amount of chemicals bases like caustic soda a large crystallisation ssa for optimal crystallisation purposes is an essential condition smaller grains imply a larger ssa but grains that are too small have a potential risk to be flushed out of the fluidised bed reactor 1 3 reactor technology conditions and research objective the efficiency of the entire pellet softening process can be expressed in terms of the amount of supersaturated calcium in the effluent which can be determined by using the calcium carbonate crystallisation potential cccp the cccp determines the amount of chemicals used and the corresponding costs and co2 equivalent footprint of the pellet softening process chemical yield is defined as the amount of desired product produced relative to the amount that would have been formed if there were no by products and the main reaction went to completion for pellet softening a high yield implies the optimal capturing of calcium ions in calcite pellets with a minimum achievable cccp the overall chemical yield is strongly dependent on the specific crystallisation surface area in the reactor 38 for optimal process conditions a large ssa in the fluidised bed is required to be able to optimise pellet softening processes the ssa has to be determined which is possible in case the voidage and the particle dimensions in the whole fluidised bed are known 39 here hydraulic process variables including superficial fluid velocity and viscosity particle sizes and densities are crucial to obtain optimal process states of fluidised bed processes effective voidage prediction models can be used in process automation and intelligent control 40 41 due to particle exchange in the pellet reactor mainly caused by the extraction of calcite pellets and the dosage of seeding material a certain particle size profile occurs over the reactor height due to the crushing process of calcite pellets 28 the seeding material consists of irregularly shaped particles when they grow in size they become increasingly round if there is no difference in specific density larger particles will migrate to the lower region of the reactor bed and a stratified bed will evolve since pellet softening is a continuous process boundary conditions must be monitored on a regular basis as a consequence of the principle of seeded crystallisation the most decisive boundary condition is to maintain the fluidised state permanently therefore the risk of fixed bed state caused by calcite pellets that are too large or water flows that are too low must be avoided at all times for water suppliers using surface water the temperature also has consequences for process control strategies in addition flushing of the smallest grains out of the reactor mostly the smallest fractions of seeding material must be prevented due to its effect on subsequent treatment processes in full scale pellet softening installations the particle size mostly varies between 0 3 2 0 mm and particle density between 2 5 4 0 kg l the current pellet size set point in amsterdam reactors is 1 1 2 mm to retain fluidisation conditions it is important that the largest pellets usually those that are larger than the given set point are extracted from the reactor they can then be used as a by product in other processes or reused as seeding material in full scale reactors the fluid particle characteristics i e homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes 42 as well as many practical matters such as the fluid distribution through nozzles and the use of a bypass flow in operational state 43 determine the process state and quality of the fluidised bed in addition pellet softening can be seen as a combination of chemical and physical processes while the biological activity on the surface of the calcite pellets also affects the friction and the degree of bed expansion 44 the combination of a large ssa aim the level of particle profile distribution over the reactor height the degree of irregularity and size of the growing calcite pellets and finally environmental and process state conditions makes optimal control of a pellet softening process a complex matter since the bed voidage is a critical process variable the aim of this work is to develop a highly accurate voidage prediction model as a function of fluid and particle properties which can be applied in full scale pellet softening fluidised bed unit operations a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach for obtaining an effective voidage prediction model is not preferable 42 due to the above mentioned non ideal circumstances in combination with complex flow behaviour numerous particle interactions 45 and the large amount of particles in full scale industrial fluidised bed reactors as is the case for water pellet softening up to 10 000 000 000 particles this results in extremely high computational costs and a lower suitability for process optimisation and plant wide control to cope with constantly changing operational conditions in full scale installations more straightforward models are needed for optimal and robust process control in particular there is a need for an explicit and easily applicable voidage prediction model that effectively takes into account the local and global multiphase flow phenomena occurring in full scale installations the aim of the current study was to develop a straightforward model based on the well known dimensionless particle reynolds and densimetric froude numbers because they represent the inertial viscous and gravitational forces in the multiphase system the new model should be applicable for a wide range of particles sizes fluid velocities and temperatures and thus be of direct use in water treatment processes like drinking water pellet softening for process control purposes a direct relationship between particle size and voidage for a given water temperature and volumetric flowrate default operational and design is necessary 2 prediction models and performance indicators 2 1 voidage prediction models in a fluidised bed the voidage particle size and physical properties of the fluid and particles are inter related in the literature numerous multiphase models are given to predict the voidage in fluidised bed reactors mainly aimed at gas solid systems 46 51 but also for liquid solid systems 52 55 39 specifically for liquid solid systems the voidage can be predicted using classical models such as the richardson zaki 56 approach based on terminal settling velocity the other frequently applied method is based on the idea of a flow through an assumed collection of channels in a bed of particles 57 in the ergun approach 58 the voidage is determined by the balance between the pressure gradient over the fluidised bed due to the mass of the pellets and the drag force of the water exerting on the pellets the pressure gradient is accordingly given by the submerged weight of the pellets the carman kozeny model 59 is derived from a drag model where viscous and inertial forces are balanced using the modified particle reynolds number the impact of voidage is non linear for both kozeny carman and ergun models 60 and more pronounced at lower voidage since in water treatment the operational field lies in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation and in addition turbulent flow regimes are exceptional a very popular model adapted for the transitional flow regime is given by van dijk et al 22 foscolo 61 presented a similar tube flow approach albeit with several model improvements foscolo considered a tortuosity factor effective length of the fluid path and a forced interpolation to correct the limit of single particle interaction to be obtained for dilute systems another well known relationship proposed by wen and yu 62 63 is based on the dependency of the drag coefficient on the dimensionless reynolds number 64 and on the assumption of a common voidage function for the entire flow regime with this model the voidage can explicitly be calculated for given particle reynolds and archimedes numbers di felice 52 investigated the voidage function and the dependency of the particle reynolds number and proposed an improved wen yu overall voidage relation according to akgiray 65 who provided an extended evaluation of expansion equations for fluidised solid liquid systems there is no general agreement regarding which equation is the most accurate akgiray proposed a voidage prediction model based on an improved drag relation kramer et al 42 proposed an improved drag relation taking into consideration the fluidisation stability to cope with heterogeneity phenomena in liquid solid fluidised beds and increasing the overall voidage prediction accuracy the traditional drag relation based on the particle reynolds number was extended with the particle froude number one of the most popular and frequently used models for describing homogeneous liquid solid fluidised suspensions is the model developed by richardson and zaki 56 the superficial fluid velocity and terminal settling velocity together with an empirical index enables determination of the fluid voidage in a straightforward way khan and richardson 66 proposed the same form of equation but only used the archimedes number instead of the reynolds terminal number the reference point here for the richardson zaki model is the terminal settling velocity the model proposed by van schagen 40 67 26 was also based on the richardson zaki principle and a fitted schiller nauman equation 68 to determine the terminal settling velocities for calcite pellets to be able to predict voidage in the proximity of minimum fluidisation conditions either the minimum fluidisation velocity must be known or the richardson zaki index must be very accurate therefore the richardson zaki model was extended 41 with proven hydraulics based models the minimum fluidisation velocity is acquired with the carman kozeny model 59 where the terminal settling velocity is acquired using the brown lawler model 69 an improved version of the well known model developed by schiller and naumann 68 in the literature many velocity voidage prediction models can be found the most popular of which are given in table 1 2 2 reactor performance indicators the particle size and voidage over the reactor height must be known to be able to estimate the ssa the following reactor performance indicators are defined specific surface area based on the reactor volume and the specific surface area based on the water phase as well as the specific space velocity ssv the most frequently presented definition of ssa in the literature 1 20 39 52 of granular beds given as the total surface area of the particle material divided by the bed volume a s r represents the available area per m3 reactor volume for crystallisation for monodisperse spherical particles the ssa based on the reactor volume a s r is given by 12 a s r 6 1 ε d p the ssa based on the water phase a s w provides more adequate information for crystallisation of caco3 on the available total particle surface this performance indicator a s w resembles the proper interaction area between water and reactive surface and is defined as 13 a s w a s r ε mercer et al 15 demonstrated that calcite seed crystals improved the removal of dissolved calcium during precipitative softening and that the optimal seed dose depended on the surface area available for crystal growth van schagen et al 29 showed that the pellet size and consequently the ssa had a significant influence on performance with respect to the water quality parameter to keep the super saturation in the pellet softening reactor at acceptable levels the ssa must be known to determine the crystallisation rate over the height of the reactor here the voidage particle size and temperature are important 43 also according to van der veen et al 23 the ssa is strongly dependent on the water temperature time also plays an important role in the mixing zone of the reactor where the majority of the crystallisation reaction takes place the caustic soda the water and seeding material must all be mixed in a minimum period of time in order to prevent undesirable carry over of caco3 precipitation consequently the water that passes along the available specific surface area per unit of time must be at a maximum level the following performance indicator specific space velocity is derived from space velocity as used in the field of chemical reactor engineering 70 space velocity for homogeneous reactions i e uniform fluids is defined as the number of reactor volumes of feed at specific conditions which can be treated per unit of time regarding multiphase systems the reactor volume is partly occupied by grains in that case the effective water volume must be used similar to the empty bed contact time ebct defined as the volume of the empty bed divided by the flowrate 1 20 considering that crystallisation occurs in multiphase systems space velocity can be translated into the rate in which the water passes the ssa or how often the water is renewed at the water layer above the particle surface due to the presence of grains and the effective residence time the superficial fluid velocity must be corrected with respect to the voidage the specific space velocity a c is accordingly defined as the contact area per second per m2 of transfer surface area 14 a c a s w v s ε please note that a c is an effective time scale with units s 1 while their counterparts a s r and a s w both are length scales with units m 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 empirical data driven voidage prediction models the fluidised bed voidage depends primarily on the fluid and particle properties in general one uses the mean particle size assuming perfect spheres d p average particle density ρ p kinematic viscosity ν t and superficial fluid velocity v s for the sake of simplicity wall effect corrections the influence of the fluid distributor fluid circulations and the irregular distribution of the particles and other non ideal phenomena are ignored voidage prediction models are only valid for a fluidised state for this reason it is important to determine the incipient fluidisation and maximum flushing point to check the prevailing state detailed elucidation and model derivations are presented in the supplementary material chapter 10 11 and 12 3 1 1 voidage prediction polynomials vpp a straightforward way to model the voidage for individual grain types is to use sets of polynomials as a function of velocity viscosity and particle size respectively while considering the particle density to be constant either indirectly or directly related to particle size there are two ways to apply these polynomials both methods are based on an experimentally obtained dataset containing a wide range of data in fluid velocity covering the whole temperature regime and various particle diameters as well as a given particle density a floating polynomial model is given in the supplementary material chapter 11 however to keep the fitting procedure feasible for processing a second approach using a one fit polynomial equation is proposed by means of eq 15 15 ε v s ν t d p i l i 0 j m j 0 k n k 0 c i j k v s i ν t j d p k the advantage of this approach lies in the simplicity of having one single model for which fitting parameters can be obtained using non linear regression software the disadvantage however lies in the considerable computational time required for finding an acceptable prediction accuracy and the number of fitting parameters n l m n the computational time increases substantially with the size of the experimental dataset using fit polynomials works well although it demands strictly respecting the given boundary conditions to avoid overshoot and physically unrealistic voidage predictions 3 1 2 dimensionless numbers application dna the effective voidage can also be predicted using dimensionless reynolds and froude numbers based on an implicit drag relationship proposed by kramer 42 the reynolds number deals with the relationship between viscous and inertial forces and determines the degree of laminar or turbulent flow regime 71 the particle reynolds number r e p is defined as 16 r e p ρ f v s d p η the froude number is defined as the ratio of inertial to gravity forces and is a proxy for the fluidisation quality from smooth homogeneous particulate fluidisation to heterogeneous or aggregative bubbling fluidisation 72 the densimetric particle froude number f r p is given by 73 17 f r p v s ρ p ρ f 1 g d p to find the voidage from these dimensionless parameters a numerical method is needed 3 1 2 1 single reynolds froude model rep1frp to avoid numerical solutions the following simple explicit eq 18 is proposed in which the powers determine the dependence of the voidage on the ratio and magnitude of both dimensionless numbers with an added pre factor 18 ε c 0 r e p c 1 f r p c 2 this equation can be rewritten as a straightforward function of velocity viscosity particle size and density more information is presented in the supplementary material chapter 18 and 19 3 1 2 2 double reynolds froude model rep2frp eq 18 is a rather straightforward approach which can be improved based on previous research in the field of chemical engineering 74 the general reynolds number re determines whether the flow is dominated by inertial or viscous forces i e whether the flow is laminar or turbulent whitaker 75 proposed a heat transfer based equation for the nusselt number nu as a function of the reynolds number re and prandtl number p r for flow in pipes around spheres and through packed beds as follows 19 n u 0 5 r e 1 2 0 2 r e 2 3 p r 1 3 note that nusselt numbers n u between 1 and 10 are characteristic of laminar flow while turbulent flow typically corresponds to n u in the range 100 1000 76 therefore it can be understood qualitatively that whitaker s expression for nusselt increases with increasing reynolds number and captures the influence of flow regimes on heat transfer 75 this understanding is supported by bedingfield and drew 77 39 who showed a theoretical analogy between heat and mass transfer similarly for liquid solid fluidisation we will formulate an expression for the voidage based on the sum of two terms that capture the influence of the flow regimes here we use the froude number instead of the prandtl number the reason for implementing the densimetric froude number comes from the hypothesis 42 that voidage is based on laminar turbulent flow regimes as well as heterogeneity phenomena in liquid solid fluidised beds the voidage can accordingly be predicted using eq 20 20 ε c 0 r e p c 1 c 2 r e p c 3 f r p c 4 3 1 3 symbolic regression model srm based on high quality datasets highly accurate prediction models can be obtained using symbolic regression techniques as applied in genetic programming genetic programming is a random based technique 78 for automatically learning computer programmes based on artificial evolution it has been successfully used in many applications 79 80 the advantage of genetic programming is that there is no need to define the structure of a model a priori the technique randomly generates a population of several mathematical operators symbolic regression is the process of determining the symbolic function which describes a dataset and effectively develops an empirical model 81 these types of models have two main features complexity and accuracy generally given a certain dataset the process starts with the determination of very simple but inaccurate models with time more accurate but also more complex models are obtained to prevent adverse modelling of measurement errors data noise or deviation a model should be taken as a compromise between complexity and accuracy voidage is a function of fluid velocity viscosity and particle size and density given in a general form according to eq 21 21 ε ε v s ν t d p ρ p 3 2 experimental setup to calibrate and to validate the prediction models liquid solid expansion experiments were needed to obtain reliable datasets containing fluid viscosity and superficial velocity as well as particle size and density advanced laboratory and pilot plant apparatus were therefore especially designed for this purpose in addition drinking water related grains were carefully prepared and selected detailed information about experimental expansion columns can be found in the supplementary material chapter 5 particle selection chapter 3 particle and fluid characterisation chapter 8 and fluidisation expansion experiments chapter 9 4 results 4 1 particle selection properties experimental setup and fluidisation experiments liquid solid expansion experiments were carried out at three locations in waternet s weesperkarspel drinking water pilot plant located in amsterdam the netherlands at the university of applied sciences utrecht the netherlands and at queen mary university of london united kingdom in this study we examined two kinds of particles calcite pellets 100 caco3 and crushed calcite seeding material grains 28 both applied in drinking water softening 11 polydisperse calcite pellets were sieved and separated in order to acquire more uniformly dispersed samples the morphological particle properties obtained with a camsizer 82 show that crushed calcite and the smallest fractionised calcite pellets have irregular shapes the larger the grains become the more spherically shaped they appear to be photographs of these particles can be seen in the supplementary material chapter 2 and 4 the acquired experimental dataset consisted of a matrix with varying temperatures grain sizes and flowrates as was required for a comparison of the theoretical fluidisation models in total 61 liquid solid fluidisation experiments were carried out for a wide range of calcite pellets 0 425 d p mm 2 8 and a total of 42 experiments were carried out for crushed calcite 0 4 d p mm 1 12 summarised in table 2 additionally in total 89 additional independent liquid solid fluidisation experiments were carried out for a wide range of calcite pellets 0 71 d p mm 2 36 2 t c 36 v m f v s m h 570 for validation purposes additional liquid solid fluidisation experiments for a wide range of different particles in fluid water systems were conducted at the three given locations detailed information regarding particle and fluid characterisation standard operating procedure of the fluidisation expansion experiments photos of grains and data tabulation can be found in 41 and in the supplementary material 4 2 voidage prediction based on the expansion column experimental datasets from our experiments several empirical data driven models were derived using symbolic regression model parameters were found through non linear curve fitting for implicit models the voidage prediction accuracy was found with a straightforward bolzano s numerical intermediate value theorem all equations regression coefficients fitting parameters and plots are given in the supplementary material the experiments cover a large range of variables as given in table 2 which is assumed to represent the boundary conditions for the presented models 4 2 1 voidage prediction polynomials vpp two different polynomials were tested the first one is a triple quadratic polynomial 222 for which the voidage can be explicitly estimated based on velocity viscosity and particle size with a constant assumed particle density the second one is a 4th 2nd and 3rd order polynomial 423 versus velocity viscosity and particle size also with a constant particle density these polynomial expressions are relatively accurate for the voidage prediction in case the given boundary conditions are respected however when these boundary conditions are exceeded these vpp models are unpredictable and rather inaccurate another disadvantage is the high computational effort required for the non linear curve fitting process with the aim to find all the fitting parameters 4 2 2 dimensionless numbers application dna 4 2 2 1 single reynolds froude model rep1frp the fitting parameters for eq 18 describing a combination of laminar versus turbulent flow regimes and homogeneous versus heterogeneous flow characteristics are given in table 3 4 2 2 2 double reynolds froude model rep2frp the fitting parameters for the improved reynolds froude based eq 20 are given in table 4 model adjustments for process automation purposes without verifying boundary conditions are described in the supplementary material 4 2 3 symbolic regression model srm based on the experimental expanded bed dataset numerous solutions i e multiple equations were found when the software package eureqa 83 was used we present two examples of equations one for calcite pellets in eq 22 and one for crushed calcite in eq 23 fitting parameters can be found in table 5 the expressions are accurate within the given boundary conditions however as is the case with the polynomials they are unpredictable and therefore inaccurate when the boundary conditions are violated 4 2 3 1 calcite pellets 22 ε c 0 ρ p ρ f ln d p c 1 ρ p ρ f c 3 c 5 υ t c 6 ln v s c 2 c 4 v s ln v s 4 2 3 2

respectively the richardson zaki equation 8 as one of the most used and well known models and the new reynolds froude rep2frp eq 20 proposed in this study graphical results for all voidage prediction models are plotted and shown in the supplementary material the voidage prediction models table 6 given in the literature n 11 as well as the models proposed in the current work n 5 were compared with the experimentally obtained data using five statistical methods mean average error average relative error normalized root mean square error logarithmic root mean squared error and pearson s correlation coefficient 4 3 reactor performance indicators the ssa is a relevant performance indicator concerning pellet softening and can be estimated in case the voidage and particle size are known the superficial fluid velocity determines for a great deal to what extent the bed expands based on eq 12 describing the best known ssa for the reactor volume a 3d plot can be created fig 3 represents the ssa a s r against the pellet size d p and the linear flowrate v s for a given water temperature however the operation window for full scale pellet softening reactors is smaller 60 v s m h 120 this is plotted in fig 4 a surface plot using rep2frp model eq 20 is accordingly plotted in fig 5 in addition the voidage ε is plotted against the pellet size d p and the linear flowrate v s in fig 6 another less familiar reactor performance indicator is the contact surface area per unit of time eq 14 which is plotted fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 voidage prediction models 5 1 1 graphical exploration the prediction models presented in this work i e voidage prediction polynomials dimensionless number applications and symbolic regression models were compared with the most popular and familiar models known from the literature table 1 all voidage velocity plots are included in the supplementary material before assessing the models in terms of statistical fit quality we applied graphical exploration as proposed by anscombe 84 to test the goodness of fit and to determine whether the model describes the experimental data adequately fig 2 for instance shows both dots experimental data and lines prediction model that provide a visual image of the degree to which the dots and lines coincide where the discrepancies appear whether or not the dots are over dispersed and whether the boundary conditions are violated and thus lead to unrealistic values based on graphical explorations figs 1 2 and remaining figures in the supplementary material the ergun model 58 shows overprediction in particular for higher velocities and larger grains the carman kozeny model 59 shows overprediction for smaller grains at low and intermediate velocities van dijk s model 22 is originally fitted for a small operation window 43 26 40 85 and therefore outliers can be found in and outside this specific region the prediction quality of foscolo s model 61 is relatively good at lower velocities but underpredicts in case the velocities are increased akgiray s model 65 on the other hand works increasingly better for higher velocities the wen yu model 62 shows a good fit at low velocities and small grains but works less well for higher velocities and larger grains the model modification proposed by di felice 52 did not improve the fit quality the rio 2 model 42 appears to work well in terms of fit quality not including the smallest grains at maximum velocity the richardson zaki model 56 in general underestimates the experimental data considerably fig 1 and to a lesser extent so does the van schagen model 26 the other rz based model proposed by kramer et al 41 starts to show discrepancies for higher velocities and larger grains regarding the models presented in this study the polynomial curves coincide with the dots except for the smallest grains and show unrealistic curvature caused by the fitting towards the maximum velocities the empirical symbolic regression model shows appropriate slopes albeit with a larger offset for increased velocities the single reynolds froude based model is not accurate for small grains at low velocities while the double reynolds froude model shows good agreement with the experimental data 5 1 2 statistical exploration numerical voidage prediction accuracies are given in table 6 for five statistical metrics mae are nrmse lrmse and r2 in general the calculated errors of all examined models based on experimental calcite pellets data is a 12 or lower the prediction errors of 11 of our 16 models are lower than 4 and 5 out of 11 are lower than 2 the following models have the lowest prediction error eureqa rep2frp and the rio 2 model with the exception of r2 based on an independent dataset given in the supplementary material the prediction errors are slightly higher 1 and show the same top three ranking the differences in accuracy are mainly based on the use of older and less accurate versions of the experimental setup and measurements devices based on pearson s correlation coefficient r2 it is impossible to make a well argued choice for a preferable model or to determine which model is the most accurate almost all r2 values are higher than 0 99 and in most cases they are 0 999 the mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions regardless of their direction and where all individual differences have equal weight the nrmse gives a relatively high weight to large errors and therefore the rmse is more useful when large errors are particularly undesirable in case of lrmse the outliers are drastically scaled down thus nullifying their effect since we are looking for a very accurate voidage prediction model there is a slight preference for nrmse as it penalises undesirably large errors 5 1 3 richardson zaki based models the richardson zaki model which is still very popular in the literature shows the highest prediction error an explanation can be addressed to the terminal settling velocity at an assumed voidage ε 1 whether the observed voidage at maximum or entrainment state was lower approximately ε 0 95 the rz model uses terminal settling as a starting point and combined with an empirical index which is also a function of terminal settling the voidage can be predicted when a voidage lies in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation as is the case in pellet softening processes a relatively small inaccuracy in both the starting point and the index n in equation 8 leads to a high prediction error when log log scales are used these effects are clearly visible fig 1 van schagen solved this terminal settling issue through finding better fitting parameters for the schiller naumann 68 equation he extrapolated expansion data for calcite pellets to terminal settling conditions with this adjustment the error was reduced by a factor of almost two kramer et al 41 introduced a second physical point besides the point of terminal settling an extra point of minimum fluidisation was added from which the voidage can be interpolated the prediction error using these model improvements also reduced with almost a factor of three but still shows some overprediction 5 1 4 porous media based drag relations based on statistical metrics only it is not evident that the ergun model is less accurate for the higher flow regime the model has however shown a reasonable fit score at low flow which is confirmed by marshall 86 based on statistics the carman kozeny model has a slightly higher fit score but here too it remains unclear whether this model is actually more suitable in the transitional flow regime the ck model overpredicts at low flow regimes the models introduced by van dijk foscolo wen yu and di felice have acceptable fit scores but this is mainly at low flow regimes for pellet softening voidage is overestimated by van dijk but underestimated by foscolo and di felice akgiray wen yu and rio 2 show conformity with the data 5 1 5 data driven and numerical numbers based models the polynomial functions underpredict the voidage for the pellet softening operational range whereas the empirical symbolic regression model is less accurate at the borders which is also the case for the single reynolds froude based model the double reynolds froude based model has a high fit quality and is more reliable since the model is based on dimensionless numbers with a hydraulic physical significance this implies that in case the boundary conditions were to be violated the risk of run away is smaller compared to purely empirical data driven models 5 1 6 modelling aspects several factors determine to different levels and certain degrees the fit prediction quality these include non ideal aspects such as particle polydispersity morphological properties density differences and particle interactions non ideal circumstances such as fluid characteristics heterogeneous flow phenomena and the influence of chemicals also play a role other determining factors include non ideal matters related to the piece of apparatus used like flow distributor column alignment sensor inaccuracies and wall effects the effort to incorporate all these aspects into a model is significant but it also makes the model more complex in full scale fully automated unit operations a reliable explicit and programmable model is preferred despite the penalty it might bring in case the fit quality is slightly lower the models can be fitted accurately when high quality experimental data are used based on calcite pellets extracted from the full scale reactors 5 1 7 bed state control to reach high performance levels in full scale pellet softening reactors an optimal crystallisation process is important but this is strongly dependent on the governing hydraulic state in fluidised beds pellet softening in drinking water production processes is a continuous process discharging calcite pellets from reactors and subsequent dosing fresh seeding material are likewise continuous repetitive processes these particle changes imply that the ssa also varies and will drift away from its ideal setpoint at the bottom of the reactor the voidage is kept relatively low to obtain the highest crystallisation ssa but nevertheless fixed bed situations must be avoided the degree of voidage is dependent on the physical properties of the grains and the water viscosity de facto voidage or fluid bed height is kept constant through controlling the water flow in the reactor and depending on water temperature through particle bed management in pellet softening reactors voidage is approximately ε 0 55 at the bottom of the reactor and ε 0 8 at the top full scale pellet softening reactors are always installed in groups and hard water containing a high concentration of calcium ions is often partly bypassed 43 moreover the total water production changes in volume periodically in a full scale operational pellet softening reactor the process state is subject to changes in water flow temperature depending on the season of the year and ongoing variations in particle sizes shaping the particle profile over the height of the reactor bed to cope with these changes constant process state monitoring is crucial to control the required pellet sizes as a standard conventional procedure particle samples are regularly taken from the reactor bed manually and accordingly analysed in a laboratory in that case based on water flow for a given temperature together with the particle size the voidage can be estimated this is demonstrated in fig 8 engineers can check the quality of the ssa but also monitor the risk of a fixed bed state or flushing in industry soft sensors are also implemented 40 with gauges at the bottom of the reactor in which the voidage and particle size is derived from flow differential pressure and temperature this is done by using models the advantage of this method is the availability of on line data results however a disadvantage is the vulnerability and consequently sensitivity of the gauges due to the exposure to high lime scaling conditions in the lower zone of the reactor resulting in less accurate predictions 5 2 reactor performance indicators the ssa plotted in fig 3 clearly shows that the a s r decreases when the linear flowrate increases or particles become larger this is similar for pellet softening conditions figs 4 and 5 this indicates why smaller particles like seeding material increase the ssa still these crushed calcite grains however migrate to the higher zones of the fluidised bed due to stratification and in case the flow is too high the risk of flushing out of the reactor emerges at the same time due to caco3 crystallisation particles grow and migrate to the lower zone of the reactor where the chemical driving force is large and decisive these larger grains cause the ssa to decrease fast and in addition they enlarge the risk of a fixed bed state which can be seen in fig 6 as indicated by the dark blue zone to maintain a maximum ssa large calcite pellets should continuously be withdrawn and replaced by smaller crushed calcite seeds which results in higher operational costs mainly caused by transportation and also adversely affects the sustainability goals therefore an optimum fluid velocity must be chosen very precisely this substantiates the relevance of a very accurate voidage prediction model in fig 7 a maximum specific space velocity a c is reached for calcite pellets with an average size slightly larger than 1 mm with eqs 12 and 14 an optimal linear flowrate range 75 v s m h 85 can be derived for an average water temperature with a corresponding ssa a s r 2500 m2 m3 this is partly in agreement with the current operational window of the amsterdam reactors at waternet 38 17 43 87 88 another complexity arises when the ratio of calcite pellet size to crushed calcite size is lower than would approximately be the case in a process state where the voidage is also in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation in case the voidage is too low caused by either lower flowrate or higher water temperature dosed crushed calcite remains trapped between the calcite pellets leading to a non stratified particle bed in full scale installations with plant wide control complex models and the continuous challenge for finding optimal numerical solutions are less desirable another disadvantage is that many models are semi empirical and derived for monodispersed perfectly spherical particles in de facto all full scale multiphase flow processes applied in water treatment processes the particles are irregularly shaped and often highly polydisperse due to the complex flow behaviour and large amount of particles n 1010 explicit particulate modelling of full scale industrial fluidised bed system using computation fluid dynamics is also challenging and as yet unachievable therefore there is a need for an explicit effective model to be able to accurately predict the overall voidage in fluidised beds that effectively takes into account the global multiphase flow phenomena and many other non ideal matters occurring in full scale installations based on these criteria and findings an average optimal linear flowrate can be determined v s 85 5 m h due to the above mentioned non ideal circumstances full scale operational challenges and continuous changes in particle profile further research is needed to find a more precise optimal process state that also takes into account hydraulic chemical and biological phenomena 6 conclusions the accurate calculation of voidage and specific surface area is of major importance in drinking water treatment processes like pellet softening because it determines the process conditions and treatment results to maintain or provide optimal process conditions in pellet softening reactors it is important to accurately determine the fluidised bed voidage voidage is a crucial variable for determining the specific surface area the minimum fluidisation and flushing conditions as well as the water and particle residence time the voidage prediction accuracy of 11 models from the literature was compared with five types of data driven and dimensionless numbers based models accurate experimental datasets were used to validate the predictive power porous media based drag relations models rio 2 and akgiray s and the data driven polynomial model 423 in general have a reasonable prediction quality error 3 the model based on symbolic regression and the double reynolds froude based model has the best fit error 2 for all examined statistical metrics a majority of prediction models available from the literature such as foscolo akgiray van dijk van schagen richardson zaki rio 2 di felice ergun and carman kozeny have the disadvantage that the voidage must be numerically solved the polynomials wen yu and the reynolds froude based models provide explicit solutions for the voidage as mentioned above in full scale installations with plant wide control complex models and the continuous challenge for finding optimal numerical solutions are less desirable therefore there is a need for an explicit effective model to be able to accurately predict the overall voidage in fluidised beds that effectively takes into account the global multiphase flow phenomena and many other non ideal matters occurring in full scale installations as a consequence and based on statistical metrics as well as graphical exploration a preferable prediction model for a pellet softening operational range 60 v s m h 120 is the rep2frp model the model is accurate has a physical basis and is easy to use for process automation programmes and therefore suitable for application in full scale operational

13914,in full scale drinking water production plants in the netherlands central softening is widely used for reasons related to public health client comfort and economic and environmental benefits almost 500 million cubic meters of water is softened annually through seeded crystallisation in fluidised bed reactors the societal call for a circular economy has put pressure on this treatment process to become more sustainable by optimising relevant process conditions the consumption of chemicals can be reduced and raw materials reused optimal process conditions are feasible if the specific crystallisation surface area in the fluidised bed is large enough to support the performance of the seeded crystallisation process to determine the specific surface area crucial variables including voidage and particle size must be known numerous models can be found in the literature to estimate the voidage in liquid solid fluidisation processes many of these models are based on semi empirical porous media based drag relations like ergun or semi empirical terminal settling based models such as richardson zaki and fitted for monodisperse almost perfectly round particles in this study we present new voidage prediction models based on accurate data obtained from elaborate pilot plant experiments and non linear symbolic regression methods the models were compared with the most popular voidage prediction models using different statistical methods an explicit model for voidage estimation based on the dimensionless reynolds and froude numbers is presented here that can be used for a wide range of particle sizes fluid velocities and temperatures and that can therefore be directly used in water treatment processes such as drinking water pellet softening the advantage of this model is that there is no need for applying numerical solutions therefore it can be explicitly implemented the prediction errors for classical models from the literature lie between 2 7 and 11 4 with our new model the voidage prediction error is reduced to 1 9 keywords drinking water treatment full scale water softening fluidised bed reactors voidage prediction data driven modelling symbolic

magnesium and other metal cations from water 1 central softening of drinking water is currently frequently applied in several countries e g the netherlands belgium germany france and the usa while domestic softening is the most frequently applied way of softening in other countries 2 4 in full scale drinking water production plants in the netherlands central softening is widely used for reasons related to public health client comfort and economic and environmental benefits 5 7 specifically in areas with high water hardness centralised drinking water softening can reduce the consumption of soap detergents and other household chemicals and increase the service life and energy efficiency of household appliances such as coffee machines due to a reduction in calcium carbonate scaling 8 9 in the netherlands in 2020 almost 500 million cubic meters of water is being softened annually through seeded crystallisation in fluidised bed reactors a process known as pellet softening 10 primarily removing calcium cations from the water pellet softening was developed and introduced in the netherlands in the 1970s 11 in other fields crystallisation in fluidised bed reactors is also becoming increasingly popular examples include the removal of hardness from natural hard ground waters 12 the recovery of co2 in direct air capture processes 13 the improvement of pellet characteristics for reuse potentials 14 reduced sludge production 15 groundwater softening in circulating pellet fluidised bed reactors usage in thermal power plants 16 and organic micropollutant removal from groundwater 17 there is also a growing interest in fluidisation of biomass particles 18 fluidised bed reactors used in wastewater treatment 19 and other liquid solid fluidisation techniques with many applications in engineering 1 20 21 in pellet softening 22 drinking water is treated in an up flow fluidised cylindrical bed reactor with flow velocity of 60 120 m h the amsterdam reactor 23 is currently a widely applied fluidised bed reactor 60 90 m h a strong chemical base usually caustic soda or calcium hydroxide combined with a seeding material is dosed to obtain supersaturated conditions in the water phase and is subsequently well mixed in the reactor high ph leads to an alteration of the calcium carbonate equilibrium in which the solubility product is exceeded and caco3 precipitates on the surface of the seeding material thereby forming pellets seeds typically quartz sand 24 garnet sand 25 or limestone calcite are introduced in the reactor and fluidised under upward flow the calcium carbonate crystallisation on the seeds mainly occurs in the lower region of the reactor 11 23 due to the crystallisation the calcite pellets grow and migrate to the bottom of the reactor when a defined grain size threshold is exceeded a small part of the pellets is extracted from the bottom of the reactor 26 the calcite pellets that are produced as a by product in these plants can be reused as seeding material after grinding and sieving of the produced pellets 27 pellets are the main by product from the softening process and by identifying reuse applications they potentially represent a resource rather than a waste product thus promoting the establishment of a circular economy the main advantages of this reuse are an expected significant decrease of the ecological footprint of both calcite as raw material and the drinking water treatment plants using pellet softening and an increased valorisation of the pellets 28 process optimisation 26 and control 29 has been focussed primarily on pellets grown on garnet sand as seeding material the transition from garnet sand as a seeding material to reused crushed calcite took place at waternet from 2014 to 2016 1 2 sustainability goals there is a wide range of definitions of the concept of sustainability the world commission on environment and development 30 defines sustainability as the development that meets the needs of current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs and aspirations the importance of continuing the development of a worldwide clean and sustainable water supply is increasing 31 in general drinking water suppliers have become more and more focussed on appropriate sustainable treatment technologies 32 optimal process conditions of water treatment processes contribute to the sustainability goals of public water organisations since fewer chemicals less energy and fewer raw materials are needed 33 34 the city of amsterdam the netherlands has the ambition to develop itself as a competitive and sustainable european metropolis 35 the flows of energy water and resources within the urban environment offer a large potential to contribute to this ambition through a transition from the linear usage of resources and waste production towards the sustainable management of urban resources with circular flows of resources currently the detrimental contributions of pellet softening are in particular related to the consumption of chemicals like caustic soda and raw materials such as garnet sand mined in australia and shipped to the netherlands both of which contribute to the carbon footprint and the environmental burden presented by the dutch drinking water companies 8 a life cycle assessment study has shown that pellet softening can be improved in terms of eco efficiency 36 the role of more sustainable pellet softening is twofold it concerns the transition from garnet sand to reused calcite pellets 28 as well as the reduced consumption of caustic soda 8 in an optimal fluidised bed reactor both aspects imply the need for more accurate information of the fluidised bed conditions to be able to acquire the process state of the fluidised bed the most important process variable i e the effective specific surface area ssa for the purpose of crystallisation must be known therefore the effective voidage must be determined ssa is either based on the total reactor volume or on the water phase in the reactor to be discussed in section 3 2 an optimal operational configuration will lead to a sustainable operational approach for pellet softening by using as little chemicals and raw materials as possible and ultimately leading to a more environmentally sustainable drinking water supply 14 waternet the public water utility of amsterdam and surroundings is seeking a sustainable scenario for producing drinking water and offering services that fulfil the requirements of clients and regulations and at the same time maintaining a sound environmental performance while keeping costs as low as possible 37 to meet sustainability goals and to promote the development of a circular economy waternet has modified its pellet softening processes 28 in which garnet grains have been replaced by calcite seeding particles that are based on crushed dried sieved and reused calcium carbonate pellets the garnet core inside the pellets hinders their potential application in market segments such as the glass paper food cosmetics and feed industries the pellet market value and the sustainability of the softening process can be increased through the substitution of the sand grain by a calcite grain of 0 5 mm 100 calcium carbonate if the calcite pellets are crushed dried and sieved they can be reused as a seeding material 27 to reduce the required amount of chemicals bases like caustic soda a large crystallisation ssa for optimal crystallisation purposes is an essential condition smaller grains imply a larger ssa but grains that are too small have a potential risk to be flushed out of the fluidised bed reactor 1 3 reactor technology conditions and research objective the efficiency of the entire pellet softening process can be expressed in terms of the amount of supersaturated calcium in the effluent which can be determined by using the calcium carbonate crystallisation potential cccp the cccp determines the amount of chemicals used and the corresponding costs and co2 equivalent footprint of the pellet softening process chemical yield is defined as the amount of desired product produced relative to the amount that would have been formed if there were no by products and the main reaction went to completion for pellet softening a high yield implies the optimal capturing of calcium ions in calcite pellets with a minimum achievable cccp the overall chemical yield is strongly dependent on the specific crystallisation surface area in the reactor 38 for optimal process conditions a large ssa in the fluidised bed is required to be able to optimise pellet softening processes the ssa has to be determined which is possible in case the voidage and the particle dimensions in the whole fluidised bed are known 39 here hydraulic process variables including superficial fluid velocity and viscosity particle sizes and densities are crucial to obtain optimal process states of fluidised bed processes effective voidage prediction models can be used in process automation and intelligent control 40 41 due to particle exchange in the pellet reactor mainly caused by the extraction of calcite pellets and the dosage of seeding material a certain particle size profile occurs over the reactor height due to the crushing process of calcite pellets 28 the seeding material consists of irregularly shaped particles when they grow in size they become increasingly round if there is no difference in specific density larger particles will migrate to the lower region of the reactor bed and a stratified bed will evolve since pellet softening is a continuous process boundary conditions must be monitored on a regular basis as a consequence of the principle of seeded crystallisation the most decisive boundary condition is to maintain the fluidised state permanently therefore the risk of fixed bed state caused by calcite pellets that are too large or water flows that are too low must be avoided at all times for water suppliers using surface water the temperature also has consequences for process control strategies in addition flushing of the smallest grains out of the reactor mostly the smallest fractions of seeding material must be prevented due to its effect on subsequent treatment processes in full scale pellet softening installations the particle size mostly varies between 0 3 2 0 mm and particle density between 2 5 4 0 kg l the current pellet size set point in amsterdam reactors is 1 1 2 mm to retain fluidisation conditions it is important that the largest pellets usually those that are larger than the given set point are extracted from the reactor they can then be used as a by product in other processes or reused as seeding material in full scale reactors the fluid particle characteristics i e homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes 42 as well as many practical matters such as the fluid distribution through nozzles and the use of a bypass flow in operational state 43 determine the process state and quality of the fluidised bed in addition pellet softening can be seen as a combination of chemical and physical processes while the biological activity on the surface of the calcite pellets also affects the friction and the degree of bed expansion 44 the combination of a large ssa aim the level of particle profile distribution over the reactor height the degree of irregularity and size of the growing calcite pellets and finally environmental and process state conditions makes optimal control of a pellet softening process a complex matter since the bed voidage is a critical process variable the aim of this work is to develop a highly accurate voidage prediction model as a function of fluid and particle properties which can be applied in full scale pellet softening fluidised bed unit operations a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach for obtaining an effective voidage prediction model is not preferable 42 due to the above mentioned non ideal circumstances in combination with complex flow behaviour numerous particle interactions 45 and the large amount of particles in full scale industrial fluidised bed reactors as is the case for water pellet softening up to 10 000 000 000 particles this results in extremely high computational costs and a lower suitability for process optimisation and plant wide control to cope with constantly changing operational conditions in full scale installations more straightforward models are needed for optimal and robust process control in particular there is a need for an explicit and easily applicable voidage prediction model that effectively takes into account the local and global multiphase flow phenomena occurring in full scale installations the aim of the current study was to develop a straightforward model based on the well known dimensionless particle reynolds and densimetric froude numbers because they represent the inertial viscous and gravitational forces in the multiphase system the new model should be applicable for a wide range of particles sizes fluid velocities and temperatures and thus be of direct use in water treatment processes like drinking water pellet softening for process control purposes a direct relationship between particle size and voidage for a given water temperature and volumetric flowrate default operational and design is necessary 2 prediction models and performance indicators 2 1 voidage prediction models in a fluidised bed the voidage particle size and physical properties of the fluid and particles are inter related in the literature numerous multiphase models are given to predict the voidage in fluidised bed reactors mainly aimed at gas solid systems 46 51 but also for liquid solid systems 52 55 39 specifically for liquid solid systems the voidage can be predicted using classical models such as the richardson zaki 56 approach based on terminal settling velocity the other frequently applied method is based on the idea of a flow through an assumed collection of channels in a bed of particles 57 in the ergun approach 58 the voidage is determined by the balance between the pressure gradient over the fluidised bed due to the mass of the pellets and the drag force of the water exerting on the pellets the pressure gradient is accordingly given by the submerged weight of the pellets the carman kozeny model 59 is derived from a drag model where viscous and inertial forces are balanced using the modified particle reynolds number the impact of voidage is non linear for both kozeny carman and ergun models 60 and more pronounced at lower voidage since in water treatment the operational field lies in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation and in addition turbulent flow regimes are exceptional a very popular model adapted for the transitional flow regime is given by van dijk et al 22 foscolo 61 presented a similar tube flow approach albeit with several model improvements foscolo considered a tortuosity factor effective length of the fluid path and a forced interpolation to correct the limit of single particle interaction to be obtained for dilute systems another well known relationship proposed by wen and yu 62 63 is based on the dependency of the drag coefficient on the dimensionless reynolds number 64 and on the assumption of a common voidage function for the entire flow regime with this model the voidage can explicitly be calculated for given particle reynolds and archimedes numbers di felice 52 investigated the voidage function and the dependency of the particle reynolds number and proposed an improved wen yu overall voidage relation according to akgiray 65 who provided an extended evaluation of expansion equations for fluidised solid liquid systems there is no general agreement regarding which equation is the most accurate akgiray proposed a voidage prediction model based on an improved drag relation kramer et al 42 proposed an improved drag relation taking into consideration the fluidisation stability to cope with heterogeneity phenomena in liquid solid fluidised beds and increasing the overall voidage prediction accuracy the traditional drag relation based on the particle reynolds number was extended with the particle froude number one of the most popular and frequently used models for describing homogeneous liquid solid fluidised suspensions is the model developed by richardson and zaki 56 the superficial fluid velocity and terminal settling velocity together with an empirical index enables determination of the fluid voidage in a straightforward way khan and richardson 66 proposed the same form of equation but only used the archimedes number instead of the reynolds terminal number the reference point here for the richardson zaki model is the terminal settling velocity the model proposed by van schagen 40 67 26 was also based on the richardson zaki principle and a fitted schiller nauman equation 68 to determine the terminal settling velocities for calcite pellets to be able to predict voidage in the proximity of minimum fluidisation conditions either the minimum fluidisation velocity must be known or the richardson zaki index must be very accurate therefore the richardson zaki model was extended 41 with proven hydraulics based models the minimum fluidisation velocity is acquired with the carman kozeny model 59 where the terminal settling velocity is acquired using the brown lawler model 69 an improved version of the well known model developed by schiller and naumann 68 in the literature many velocity voidage prediction models can be found the most popular of which are given in table 1 2 2 reactor performance indicators the particle size and voidage over the reactor height must be known to be able to estimate the ssa the following reactor performance indicators are defined specific surface area based on the reactor volume and the specific surface area based on the water phase as well as the specific space velocity ssv the most frequently presented definition of ssa in the literature 1 20 39 52 of granular beds given as the total surface area of the particle material divided by the bed volume a s r represents the available area per m3 reactor volume for crystallisation for monodisperse spherical particles the ssa based on the reactor volume a s r is given by 12 a s r 6 1 ε d p the ssa based on the water phase a s w provides more adequate information for crystallisation of caco3 on the available total particle surface this performance indicator a s w resembles the proper interaction area between water and reactive surface and is defined as 13 a s w a s r ε mercer et al 15 demonstrated that calcite seed crystals improved the removal of dissolved calcium during precipitative softening and that the optimal seed dose depended on the surface area available for crystal growth van schagen et al 29 showed that the pellet size and consequently the ssa had a significant influence on performance with respect to the water quality parameter to keep the super saturation in the pellet softening reactor at acceptable levels the ssa must be known to determine the crystallisation rate over the height of the reactor here the voidage particle size and temperature are important 43 also according to van der veen et al 23 the ssa is strongly dependent on the water temperature time also plays an important role in the mixing zone of the reactor where the majority of the crystallisation reaction takes place the caustic soda the water and seeding material must all be mixed in a minimum period of time in order to prevent undesirable carry over of caco3 precipitation consequently the water that passes along the available specific surface area per unit of time must be at a maximum level the following performance indicator specific space velocity is derived from space velocity as used in the field of chemical reactor engineering 70 space velocity for homogeneous reactions i e uniform fluids is defined as the number of reactor volumes of feed at specific conditions which can be treated per unit of time regarding multiphase systems the reactor volume is partly occupied by grains in that case the effective water volume must be used similar to the empty bed contact time ebct defined as the volume of the empty bed divided by the flowrate 1 20 considering that crystallisation occurs in multiphase systems space velocity can be translated into the rate in which the water passes the ssa or how often the water is renewed at the water layer above the particle surface due to the presence of grains and the effective residence time the superficial fluid velocity must be corrected with respect to the voidage the specific space velocity a c is accordingly defined as the contact area per second per m2 of transfer surface area 14 a c a s w v s ε please note that a c is an effective time scale with units s 1 while their counterparts a s r and a s w both are length scales with units m 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 empirical data driven voidage prediction models the fluidised bed voidage depends primarily on the fluid and particle properties in general one uses the mean particle size assuming perfect spheres d p average particle density ρ p kinematic viscosity ν t and superficial fluid velocity v s for the sake of simplicity wall effect corrections the influence of the fluid distributor fluid circulations and the irregular distribution of the particles and other non ideal phenomena are ignored voidage prediction models are only valid for a fluidised state for this reason it is important to determine the incipient fluidisation and maximum flushing point to check the prevailing state detailed elucidation and model derivations are presented in the supplementary material chapter 10 11 and 12 3 1 1 voidage prediction polynomials vpp a straightforward way to model the voidage for individual grain types is to use sets of polynomials as a function of velocity viscosity and particle size respectively while considering the particle density to be constant either indirectly or directly related to particle size there are two ways to apply these polynomials both methods are based on an experimentally obtained dataset containing a wide range of data in fluid velocity covering the whole temperature regime and various particle diameters as well as a given particle density a floating polynomial model is given in the supplementary material chapter 11 however to keep the fitting procedure feasible for processing a second approach using a one fit polynomial equation is proposed by means of eq 15 15 ε v s ν t d p i l i 0 j m j 0 k n k 0 c i j k v s i ν t j d p k the advantage of this approach lies in the simplicity of having one single model for which fitting parameters can be obtained using non linear regression software the disadvantage however lies in the considerable computational time required for finding an acceptable prediction accuracy and the number of fitting parameters n l m n the computational time increases substantially with the size of the experimental dataset using fit polynomials works well although it demands strictly respecting the given boundary conditions to avoid overshoot and physically unrealistic voidage predictions 3 1 2 dimensionless numbers application dna the effective voidage can also be predicted using dimensionless reynolds and froude numbers based on an implicit drag relationship proposed by kramer 42 the reynolds number deals with the relationship between viscous and inertial forces and determines the degree of laminar or turbulent flow regime 71 the particle reynolds number r e p is defined as 16 r e p ρ f v s d p η the froude number is defined as the ratio of inertial to gravity forces and is a proxy for the fluidisation quality from smooth homogeneous particulate fluidisation to heterogeneous or aggregative bubbling fluidisation 72 the densimetric particle froude number f r p is given by 73 17 f r p v s ρ p ρ f 1 g d p to find the voidage from these dimensionless parameters a numerical method is needed 3 1 2 1 single reynolds froude model rep1frp to avoid numerical solutions the following simple explicit eq 18 is proposed in which the powers determine the dependence of the voidage on the ratio and magnitude of both dimensionless numbers with an added pre factor 18 ε c 0 r e p c 1 f r p c 2 this equation can be rewritten as a straightforward function of velocity viscosity particle size and density more information is presented in the supplementary material chapter 18 and 19 3 1 2 2 double reynolds froude model rep2frp eq 18 is a rather straightforward approach which can be improved based on previous research in the field of chemical engineering 74 the general reynolds number re determines whether the flow is dominated by inertial or viscous forces i e whether the flow is laminar or turbulent whitaker 75 proposed a heat transfer based equation for the nusselt number nu as a function of the reynolds number re and prandtl number p r for flow in pipes around spheres and through packed beds as follows 19 n u 0 5 r e 1 2 0 2 r e 2 3 p r 1 3 note that nusselt numbers n u between 1 and 10 are characteristic of laminar flow while turbulent flow typically corresponds to n u in the range 100 1000 76 therefore it can be understood qualitatively that whitaker s expression for nusselt increases with increasing reynolds number and captures the influence of flow regimes on heat transfer 75 this understanding is supported by bedingfield and drew 77 39 who showed a theoretical analogy between heat and mass transfer similarly for liquid solid fluidisation we will formulate an expression for the voidage based on the sum of two terms that capture the influence of the flow regimes here we use the froude number instead of the prandtl number the reason for implementing the densimetric froude number comes from the hypothesis 42 that voidage is based on laminar turbulent flow regimes as well as heterogeneity phenomena in liquid solid fluidised beds the voidage can accordingly be predicted using eq 20 20 ε c 0 r e p c 1 c 2 r e p c 3 f r p c 4 3 1 3 symbolic regression model srm based on high quality datasets highly accurate prediction models can be obtained using symbolic regression techniques as applied in genetic programming genetic programming is a random based technique 78 for automatically learning computer programmes based on artificial evolution it has been successfully used in many applications 79 80 the advantage of genetic programming is that there is no need to define the structure of a model a priori the technique randomly generates a population of several mathematical operators symbolic regression is the process of determining the symbolic function which describes a dataset and effectively develops an empirical model 81 these types of models have two main features complexity and accuracy generally given a certain dataset the process starts with the determination of very simple but inaccurate models with time more accurate but also more complex models are obtained to prevent adverse modelling of measurement errors data noise or deviation a model should be taken as a compromise between complexity and accuracy voidage is a function of fluid velocity viscosity and particle size and density given in a general form according to eq 21 21 ε ε v s ν t d p ρ p 3 2 experimental setup to calibrate and to validate the prediction models liquid solid expansion experiments were needed to obtain reliable datasets containing fluid viscosity and superficial velocity as well as particle size and density advanced laboratory and pilot plant apparatus were therefore especially designed for this purpose in addition drinking water related grains were carefully prepared and selected detailed information about experimental expansion columns can be found in the supplementary material chapter 5 particle selection chapter 3 particle and fluid characterisation chapter 8 and fluidisation expansion experiments chapter 9 4 results 4 1 particle selection properties experimental setup and fluidisation experiments liquid solid expansion experiments were carried out at three locations in waternet s weesperkarspel drinking water pilot plant located in amsterdam the netherlands at the university of applied sciences utrecht the netherlands and at queen mary university of london united kingdom in this study we examined two kinds of particles calcite pellets 100 caco3 and crushed calcite seeding material grains 28 both applied in drinking water softening 11 polydisperse calcite pellets were sieved and separated in order to acquire more uniformly dispersed samples the morphological particle properties obtained with a camsizer 82 show that crushed calcite and the smallest fractionised calcite pellets have irregular shapes the larger the grains become the more spherically shaped they appear to be photographs of these particles can be seen in the supplementary material chapter 2 and 4 the acquired experimental dataset consisted of a matrix with varying temperatures grain sizes and flowrates as was required for a comparison of the theoretical fluidisation models in total 61 liquid solid fluidisation experiments were carried out for a wide range of calcite pellets 0 425 d p mm 2 8 and a total of 42 experiments were carried out for crushed calcite 0 4 d p mm 1 12 summarised in table 2 additionally in total 89 additional independent liquid solid fluidisation experiments were carried out for a wide range of calcite pellets 0 71 d p mm 2 36 2 t c 36 v m f v s m h 570 for validation purposes additional liquid solid fluidisation experiments for a wide range of different particles in fluid water systems were conducted at the three given locations detailed information regarding particle and fluid characterisation standard operating procedure of the fluidisation expansion experiments photos of grains and data tabulation can be found in 41 and in the supplementary material 4 2 voidage prediction based on the expansion column experimental datasets from our experiments several empirical data driven models were derived using symbolic regression model parameters were found through non linear curve fitting for implicit models the voidage prediction accuracy was found with a straightforward bolzano s numerical intermediate value theorem all equations regression coefficients fitting parameters and plots are given in the supplementary material the experiments cover a large range of variables as given in table 2 which is assumed to represent the boundary conditions for the presented models 4 2 1 voidage prediction polynomials vpp two different polynomials were tested the first one is a triple quadratic polynomial 222 for which the voidage can be explicitly estimated based on velocity viscosity and particle size with a constant assumed particle density the second one is a 4th 2nd and 3rd order polynomial 423 versus velocity viscosity and particle size also with a constant particle density these polynomial expressions are relatively accurate for the voidage prediction in case the given boundary conditions are respected however when these boundary conditions are exceeded these vpp models are unpredictable and rather inaccurate another disadvantage is the high computational effort required for the non linear curve fitting process with the aim to find all the fitting parameters 4 2 2 dimensionless numbers application dna 4 2 2 1 single reynolds froude model rep1frp the fitting parameters for eq 18 describing a combination of laminar versus turbulent flow regimes and homogeneous versus heterogeneous flow characteristics are given in table 3 4 2 2 2 double reynolds froude model rep2frp the fitting parameters for the improved reynolds froude based eq 20 are given in table 4 model adjustments for process automation purposes without verifying boundary conditions are described in the supplementary material 4 2 3 symbolic regression model srm based on the experimental expanded bed dataset numerous solutions i e multiple equations were found when the software package eureqa 83 was used we present two examples of equations one for calcite pellets in eq 22 and one for crushed calcite in eq 23 fitting parameters can be found in table 5 the expressions are accurate within the given boundary conditions however as is the case with the polynomials they are unpredictable and therefore inaccurate when the boundary conditions are violated 4 2 3 1 calcite pellets 22 ε c 0 ρ p ρ f ln d p c 1 ρ p ρ f c 3 c 5 υ t c 6 ln v s c 2 c 4 v s ln v s 4 2 3 2

respectively the richardson zaki equation 8 as one of the most used and well known models and the new reynolds froude rep2frp eq 20 proposed in this study graphical results for all voidage prediction models are plotted and shown in the supplementary material the voidage prediction models table 6 given in the literature n 11 as well as the models proposed in the current work n 5 were compared with the experimentally obtained data using five statistical methods mean average error average relative error normalized root mean square error logarithmic root mean squared error and pearson s correlation coefficient 4 3 reactor performance indicators the ssa is a relevant performance indicator concerning pellet softening and can be estimated in case the voidage and particle size are known the superficial fluid velocity determines for a great deal to what extent the bed expands based on eq 12 describing the best known ssa for the reactor volume a 3d plot can be created fig 3 represents the ssa a s r against the pellet size d p and the linear flowrate v s for a given water temperature however the operation window for full scale pellet softening reactors is smaller 60 v s m h 120 this is plotted in fig 4 a surface plot using rep2frp model eq 20 is accordingly plotted in fig 5 in addition the voidage ε is plotted against the pellet size d p and the linear flowrate v s in fig 6 another less familiar reactor performance indicator is the contact surface area per unit of time eq 14 which is plotted fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 voidage prediction models 5 1 1 graphical exploration the prediction models presented in this work i e voidage prediction polynomials dimensionless number applications and symbolic regression models were compared with the most popular and familiar models known from the literature table 1 all voidage velocity plots are included in the supplementary material before assessing the models in terms of statistical fit quality we applied graphical exploration as proposed by anscombe 84 to test the goodness of fit and to determine whether the model describes the experimental data adequately fig 2 for instance shows both dots experimental data and lines prediction model that provide a visual image of the degree to which the dots and lines coincide where the discrepancies appear whether or not the dots are over dispersed and whether the boundary conditions are violated and thus lead to unrealistic values based on graphical explorations figs 1 2 and remaining figures in the supplementary material the ergun model 58 shows overprediction in particular for higher velocities and larger grains the carman kozeny model 59 shows overprediction for smaller grains at low and intermediate velocities van dijk s model 22 is originally fitted for a small operation window 43 26 40 85 and therefore outliers can be found in and outside this specific region the prediction quality of foscolo s model 61 is relatively good at lower velocities but underpredicts in case the velocities are increased akgiray s model 65 on the other hand works increasingly better for higher velocities the wen yu model 62 shows a good fit at low velocities and small grains but works less well for higher velocities and larger grains the model modification proposed by di felice 52 did not improve the fit quality the rio 2 model 42 appears to work well in terms of fit quality not including the smallest grains at maximum velocity the richardson zaki model 56 in general underestimates the experimental data considerably fig 1 and to a lesser extent so does the van schagen model 26 the other rz based model proposed by kramer et al 41 starts to show discrepancies for higher velocities and larger grains regarding the models presented in this study the polynomial curves coincide with the dots except for the smallest grains and show unrealistic curvature caused by the fitting towards the maximum velocities the empirical symbolic regression model shows appropriate slopes albeit with a larger offset for increased velocities the single reynolds froude based model is not accurate for small grains at low velocities while the double reynolds froude model shows good agreement with the experimental data 5 1 2 statistical exploration numerical voidage prediction accuracies are given in table 6 for five statistical metrics mae are nrmse lrmse and r2 in general the calculated errors of all examined models based on experimental calcite pellets data is a 12 or lower the prediction errors of 11 of our 16 models are lower than 4 and 5 out of 11 are lower than 2 the following models have the lowest prediction error eureqa rep2frp and the rio 2 model with the exception of r2 based on an independent dataset given in the supplementary material the prediction errors are slightly higher 1 and show the same top three ranking the differences in accuracy are mainly based on the use of older and less accurate versions of the experimental setup and measurements devices based on pearson s correlation coefficient r2 it is impossible to make a well argued choice for a preferable model or to determine which model is the most accurate almost all r2 values are higher than 0 99 and in most cases they are 0 999 the mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions regardless of their direction and where all individual differences have equal weight the nrmse gives a relatively high weight to large errors and therefore the rmse is more useful when large errors are particularly undesirable in case of lrmse the outliers are drastically scaled down thus nullifying their effect since we are looking for a very accurate voidage prediction model there is a slight preference for nrmse as it penalises undesirably large errors 5 1 3 richardson zaki based models the richardson zaki model which is still very popular in the literature shows the highest prediction error an explanation can be addressed to the terminal settling velocity at an assumed voidage ε 1 whether the observed voidage at maximum or entrainment state was lower approximately ε 0 95 the rz model uses terminal settling as a starting point and combined with an empirical index which is also a function of terminal settling the voidage can be predicted when a voidage lies in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation as is the case in pellet softening processes a relatively small inaccuracy in both the starting point and the index n in equation 8 leads to a high prediction error when log log scales are used these effects are clearly visible fig 1 van schagen solved this terminal settling issue through finding better fitting parameters for the schiller naumann 68 equation he extrapolated expansion data for calcite pellets to terminal settling conditions with this adjustment the error was reduced by a factor of almost two kramer et al 41 introduced a second physical point besides the point of terminal settling an extra point of minimum fluidisation was added from which the voidage can be interpolated the prediction error using these model improvements also reduced with almost a factor of three but still shows some overprediction 5 1 4 porous media based drag relations based on statistical metrics only it is not evident that the ergun model is less accurate for the higher flow regime the model has however shown a reasonable fit score at low flow which is confirmed by marshall 86 based on statistics the carman kozeny model has a slightly higher fit score but here too it remains unclear whether this model is actually more suitable in the transitional flow regime the ck model overpredicts at low flow regimes the models introduced by van dijk foscolo wen yu and di felice have acceptable fit scores but this is mainly at low flow regimes for pellet softening voidage is overestimated by van dijk but underestimated by foscolo and di felice akgiray wen yu and rio 2 show conformity with the data 5 1 5 data driven and numerical numbers based models the polynomial functions underpredict the voidage for the pellet softening operational range whereas the empirical symbolic regression model is less accurate at the borders which is also the case for the single reynolds froude based model the double reynolds froude based model has a high fit quality and is more reliable since the model is based on dimensionless numbers with a hydraulic physical significance this implies that in case the boundary conditions were to be violated the risk of run away is smaller compared to purely empirical data driven models 5 1 6 modelling aspects several factors determine to different levels and certain degrees the fit prediction quality these include non ideal aspects such as particle polydispersity morphological properties density differences and particle interactions non ideal circumstances such as fluid characteristics heterogeneous flow phenomena and the influence of chemicals also play a role other determining factors include non ideal matters related to the piece of apparatus used like flow distributor column alignment sensor inaccuracies and wall effects the effort to incorporate all these aspects into a model is significant but it also makes the model more complex in full scale fully automated unit operations a reliable explicit and programmable model is preferred despite the penalty it might bring in case the fit quality is slightly lower the models can be fitted accurately when high quality experimental data are used based on calcite pellets extracted from the full scale reactors 5 1 7 bed state control to reach high performance levels in full scale pellet softening reactors an optimal crystallisation process is important but this is strongly dependent on the governing hydraulic state in fluidised beds pellet softening in drinking water production processes is a continuous process discharging calcite pellets from reactors and subsequent dosing fresh seeding material are likewise continuous repetitive processes these particle changes imply that the ssa also varies and will drift away from its ideal setpoint at the bottom of the reactor the voidage is kept relatively low to obtain the highest crystallisation ssa but nevertheless fixed bed situations must be avoided the degree of voidage is dependent on the physical properties of the grains and the water viscosity de facto voidage or fluid bed height is kept constant through controlling the water flow in the reactor and depending on water temperature through particle bed management in pellet softening reactors voidage is approximately ε 0 55 at the bottom of the reactor and ε 0 8 at the top full scale pellet softening reactors are always installed in groups and hard water containing a high concentration of calcium ions is often partly bypassed 43 moreover the total water production changes in volume periodically in a full scale operational pellet softening reactor the process state is subject to changes in water flow temperature depending on the season of the year and ongoing variations in particle sizes shaping the particle profile over the height of the reactor bed to cope with these changes constant process state monitoring is crucial to control the required pellet sizes as a standard conventional procedure particle samples are regularly taken from the reactor bed manually and accordingly analysed in a laboratory in that case based on water flow for a given temperature together with the particle size the voidage can be estimated this is demonstrated in fig 8 engineers can check the quality of the ssa but also monitor the risk of a fixed bed state or flushing in industry soft sensors are also implemented 40 with gauges at the bottom of the reactor in which the voidage and particle size is derived from flow differential pressure and temperature this is done by using models the advantage of this method is the availability of on line data results however a disadvantage is the vulnerability and consequently sensitivity of the gauges due to the exposure to high lime scaling conditions in the lower zone of the reactor resulting in less accurate predictions 5 2 reactor performance indicators the ssa plotted in fig 3 clearly shows that the a s r decreases when the linear flowrate increases or particles become larger this is similar for pellet softening conditions figs 4 and 5 this indicates why smaller particles like seeding material increase the ssa still these crushed calcite grains however migrate to the higher zones of the fluidised bed due to stratification and in case the flow is too high the risk of flushing out of the reactor emerges at the same time due to caco3 crystallisation particles grow and migrate to the lower zone of the reactor where the chemical driving force is large and decisive these larger grains cause the ssa to decrease fast and in addition they enlarge the risk of a fixed bed state which can be seen in fig 6 as indicated by the dark blue zone to maintain a maximum ssa large calcite pellets should continuously be withdrawn and replaced by smaller crushed calcite seeds which results in higher operational costs mainly caused by transportation and also adversely affects the sustainability goals therefore an optimum fluid velocity must be chosen very precisely this substantiates the relevance of a very accurate voidage prediction model in fig 7 a maximum specific space velocity a c is reached for calcite pellets with an average size slightly larger than 1 mm with eqs 12 and 14 an optimal linear flowrate range 75 v s m h 85 can be derived for an average water temperature with a corresponding ssa a s r 2500 m2 m3 this is partly in agreement with the current operational window of the amsterdam reactors at waternet 38 17 43 87 88 another complexity arises when the ratio of calcite pellet size to crushed calcite size is lower than would approximately be the case in a process state where the voidage is also in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation in case the voidage is too low caused by either lower flowrate or higher water temperature dosed crushed calcite remains trapped between the calcite pellets leading to a non stratified particle bed in full scale installations with plant wide control complex models and the continuous challenge for finding optimal numerical solutions are less desirable another disadvantage is that many models are semi empirical and derived for monodispersed perfectly spherical particles in de facto all full scale multiphase flow processes applied in water treatment processes the particles are irregularly shaped and often highly polydisperse due to the complex flow behaviour and large amount of particles n 1010 explicit particulate modelling of full scale industrial fluidised bed system using computation fluid dynamics is also challenging and as yet unachievable therefore there is a need for an explicit effective model to be able to accurately predict the overall voidage in fluidised beds that effectively takes into account the global multiphase flow phenomena and many other non ideal matters occurring in full scale installations based on these criteria and findings an average optimal linear flowrate can be determined v s 85 5 m h due to the above mentioned non ideal circumstances full scale operational challenges and continuous changes in particle profile further research is needed to find a more precise optimal process state that also takes into account hydraulic chemical and biological phenomena 6 conclusions the accurate calculation of voidage and specific surface area is of major importance in drinking water treatment processes like pellet softening because it determines the process conditions and treatment results to maintain or provide optimal process conditions in pellet softening reactors it is important to accurately determine the fluidised bed voidage voidage is a crucial variable for determining the specific surface area the minimum fluidisation and flushing conditions as well as the water and particle residence time the voidage prediction accuracy of 11 models from the literature was compared with five types of data driven and dimensionless numbers based models accurate experimental datasets were used to validate the predictive power porous media based drag relations models rio 2 and akgiray s and the data driven polynomial model 423 in general have a reasonable prediction quality error 3 the model based on symbolic regression and the double reynolds froude based model has the best fit error 2 for all examined statistical metrics a majority of prediction models available from the literature such as foscolo akgiray van dijk van schagen richardson zaki rio 2 di felice ergun and carman kozeny have the disadvantage that the voidage must be numerically solved the polynomials wen yu and the reynolds froude based models provide explicit solutions for the voidage as mentioned above in full scale installations with plant wide control complex models and the continuous challenge for finding optimal numerical solutions are less desirable therefore there is a need for an explicit effective model to be able to accurately predict the overall voidage in fluidised beds that effectively takes into account the global multiphase flow phenomena and many other non ideal matters occurring in full scale installations as a consequence and based on statistical metrics as well as graphical exploration a preferable prediction model for a pellet softening operational range 60 v s m h 120 is the rep2frp model the model is accurate has a physical basis and is easy to use for process automation programmes and therefore suitable for application in full scale operational
