cbimmt extractive spectrophotometric determination pharmaceutical samples water samples 1 introduction there is elevated need of reliable procedures and techniques for the determination of trace metals in food and water samples due to their adverse effects on living biota and also these metals reduces the fertility of soil belabad and soltani 2018 dutta et al 2018 bismuth has been considered to be of great strategic and industrial importance due to its green nature which has made it a better substitute for metals which deemed less favorable environmentally and it is used in numerous technological fields it has two main oxidation states as bi iii and bi v didi et al 2011 out of these pentavalent state of bismuth is thermodynamically unstable while trivalent state of bismuth is stable egorysheva et al 2015 bismuth has many applications in variety of fields including pharmaceuticals such as antacids antiseptic antibacterial anti ulcer anti hiv and radio therapeutic agents and ulcer sivasekar et al 2014 it is widely used in cosmetics such as hair dyes and topical dermatological creams koper and grabarczyk 2011 sung and huang 2003 as a reagent for purification of sugar fathirad et al 2013 as an additive in metallurgical operations in alloys of some semiconductors and in the preparation and recycling of uranium nuclear fuels yamini et al 2002 in recent days bi2te3 is widely used as a cooling substance for low temperature thermoelectrical power generation bismuth containing pharmaceuticals has been used for the healing of some microbial infections gastro intestinal track disorder as indigestion nausea and heartburn bismuth in the form of its sub carbonates and sub galletes is also useful for the cure of diarrhea dysentery gadhari et al 2010 li et al 2013 in addition to these useful applications a number of toxic effects are also observed due to bismuth and its compounds like neurotoxic nephrotoxic osteoarthrapathy kindey damage symptoms nephropth and hepatitis thus nowadays enormous attention has been focused towards the quantitative determination of bismuth species in various matrices such as ground water samples pharmaceuticals ores and soils madrakian et al 2003 mierzwa et al 2013 dhanvate et al 2015 for the purpose of determination of trace analytes it is necessary to use techniques like atomic absorption spectrophotometer mesli and belkhouche 2018 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer behbahani et al 2014 etc having high sensitivity for the separation and determination of traces of analytes like proteins nath et al 2013 and metal ions such as bi iii new solvent extraction technique are developed like dispersive liquid liquid micro extraction dllme niazi et al 2013 cloud point extraction cpe salatin 2018 khudhair and saeed 2016 and solidified floating organic drop microextraction sfodme tekin and durukan 2016 however these methods also suffer from several demerits the dllme microextraction method is more complex time consuming and requires multi step for preconcentration of analytes which further leads to errors in the analysis the sfodme method requires many operations including ultra sonication of samples in cpe method the extracted analyte cannot be injected directly as the surfactant rich phase has more viscosity these techniques involve high priced instrumentation it will not be available in routine laboratories in the developing countries like india due to having these demerits santana et al 2011 better approach is to use the classical lle methods in combining with uv visible spectrophotometry literature survey revealed that there are several analytical reagents which have been synthesized for the spectrophotometric determination of bi iii on the basis of complexation reaction however these reagents have been criticized some demerits like few showed maximum absorbance in uv region some require heating for complexation some require use of surfactants more equilibration time prolonged standing time to develop a maximum absorptivity of the species low sensitivity and also lack of selectivity table 1 patil et al 2002 gaikwad et al 2005 lopez et al 1988 agrwal and bhatt 1984 padmanabha and rao 2011 puri and gupta 1985 portal et al 1985 1986 dhanvate et al 2015 considering the aforementioned discussion here we introduce a chromogenic reagent 4 4 chlorobenzylideneimino 3 methyl 5 mercapto 1 2 4 triazole cbimmt for simple rapid selective sensitive and reproducible extractive spectrophotometric determination of bi iii from environmental and real samples synthetic mixtures and separation and determination of bi iii from associated metal ions the chromogenic reagent cbimmt in dichloromethane along with 3 potassium iodide instantaneously forms orange colored complex with bi iii from hcl kcl buffer having ph 2 0 colowick and kaplan 1955 as a medium this method does not require heating of aqueous phase use of surfactant and synergent for complexation reaction of bi iii and cbimmt the use of this reagent is also found to be beneficial as it can be synthesized at low cost with high yield and of best purity an extracted ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in dichloromethane showed maximum absorbance in the visible region at λ max 409 and 490 nm the proposed method has been effectively applied with good recovery and precision 2 experimental 2 1

and determination of the bi iii the binary and ternary synthetic mixtures containing 100 μg of bi iii with known amounts of another metal ions were prepared and bi iii was determined by the recommended procedure 3 2 determination of bi iii from various water samples the three main basic concerns of current and future water resources are shortage of water due to high requirement its poor quality due to industrial effluents and its related debacles including dyes and toxic metal ions das et al 2016 dasgupta et al 2015 2016 haouti et al 2018 sumisha et al 2015 othmani et al 2017 ground water has a vital role as it has wide applications in various fields and serves as a drinking water source kumar et al 2017 but it can act as a medium for doorway of a number of metal ions in our body when it is contaminated wastewater may contain numerous ligands to facilitate bonding towards these inorganic metal ions such as bi iii which can stimulate metal toxicity in our body when taken the present method was effectively applied for the determination of bi iii ions in water samples these water samples were collected from different locations near barshi city ms india in polythene bottles such as municipal water ground water water from nearby ganesh dam barshi city ms india and distilled water from our research laboratory all water samples were filtered through whatman filter paper no 40 as a filtering medium then 1000 ml of each filtered water sample was taken and evaporated just to dryness on the hot plate with a mixture of 2 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid after dryness it was then cooled and 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid was added and heated up to dense white fumes continued or until the solution became colorless the resultant solution was cooled and ammonium hydroxide was added for neutralization of acid in presence of 1 ml 0 01 tartarate solution then solution was filtered and transferred to 100 ml in calibrated volumetric flask and made up to the mark with distilled water the bi iii was determined by recommended procedure 3 3 determination of bi iii in pharmaceutical samples at the present time pharmaceuticals are also considered as promising pollutants as they include numerous organic and inorganic compounds including a variety of metal salts having complex chemical structure fatta kassinos et al 2011 gogoi et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2017 many pharmaceutical drugs contain bismuth compounds as an active pharmaceutical ingredient so for the present method was also applied for determination of bi iii from pharmaceutical allopathic samples like peptobismol chuable tablets trymo tablest denol tablets which were collected from local market the samples 3 4 tablets were heated in small amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid followed by addition of small amount of nitric acid the organic matter was destroyed by addition small amount of perchloric acid the resultant solution was slowly evaporated up to moist dryness the residue was dissolved in hot dilute hydrochloric acid and made up to the mark with water and amount of bi iii was determined by the recommended procedure 3 4 determination of bi iii in alloy samples the present method was applied for the analysis of alloy samples for bi iii content as the real samples were unavailable at this working place hence this forced us to prepare synthetic mixtures corresponding to the composition of alloys gaikwad et al 2005 mane and anuse 2008 bi iii was extracted and determined from by the present method 3 5 separation and determination of bi iii from associated metal ions the difference in the extraction conditions of each of the associated metal ions was fully subjugated to ensure whole separation of these metals from bi iii in various mixtures bi iii was separated from se iv cu ii te iv au iii and co ii by its extraction with 10 ml of 0 045 mol l 1 in dichloromethane from hcl kcl buffer medium under these conditions cu ii te iv se iv au iii and co ii metal ions remained quantitatively in aqueous phase the aqueous phase was evaporated to moist dryness by treating with 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid the residue was dissolved in water and diluted to appropriate volume the metal ions were determined by reported standard methods barache et al 2017 2018 2019 kamble et al 2010 2011 4 extraction and determination procedure for bi iii an aliquot of the solution containing 100 μg of bi iii was taken to this 1 ml of 3 potassium iodide solution was added and made up to the mark with hcl kcl buffer having ph 2 0 in 25 ml volumetric flask this solution was then transferred into 125 ml separatory funnel followed by addition of 10 ml of cbimmt solution having concentration of 0 045 mol l 1 in dichloromethane the resultant mixture was thoroughly shaken for 1 min the reagent cbimmt formed orange colored ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex which was collected over anhydrous sodium sulphate to remove the traces of water present if any then this organic extract was transferred in a 10 ml volumetric flask further diluted up to the mark with dichloromethane the absorbance of the orange extracted complex was measured at λ max 409 and 490 nm against reagent blank prepared in the similar manner without bi iii in it the concentration of bi iii was calculated from the calibration plot the percentage extraction e and metal distribution ratio d were calculated according to equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 e bi iii org bi iii aq init 100 2 d bi iii org bi iii aq where bi iii aq init represents the initial init concentration of bi iii ions in the aqueous aq phase bi iii aq and bi iii org are the total concentrations of bi iii ions in the aqueous aq and organic org phases after equilibrium respectively 5 results and discussions 5 1 absorption spectra of the reagent and its bi iii complex preliminary investigation on the interaction of the title reagent cbimmt in dichloromethane with bi iii ions in the presence of potassium iodide from hcl kcl buffer of ph 2 0 media and 1 min shaking has revealed the formation of an orange colored ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex the absorption spectra of the reagent and its bi iii complex are shown in fig 3 the spectrum of the reagent versus dichloromethane showed one well defined peak at λ max 391 nm while the spectrum of its bi iii complex against the reagent itself as a blank showed well defined absorption peaks at λ max 409 and 490 nm these results suggest the possible application of the extractive spectrophotometric technique for the determination of bi iii to take the full advantage of the procedure all the extraction conditions were optimized various experimental parameters were studied in order to obtain optimum conditions table 2 these parameters were optimized by setting all parameters to be constant and optimizing one at each time these optimum conditions were established by studying influence of different parameters such as effect of ph cbimmt concentration ki concentration choice of organic diluent shaking time and interference due to diverse ions the proposed method when compared with other spectrophotometric methods offers so many advantages such as instant colour development lower level of interference selectivity rapidity and accuracy 5 2 influence of ph in the extraction of metal ions the extraction efficiencies of metal complex are closely related to the value of ph of the system therefore we have investigated the effect ph on the formation of colored bi iii cbimmt iodide complex of by varying the ph of bi iii solution ranging from 1 to 6 5 before an addition of the organic phase initially the ph of bi iii solution was adjusted by 0 1 mol l 1 hcl and 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solutions the effect of ph on the absorbance values of extracted ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex were measured at λ max 409 nm against reagent blank prepared in similar manner without taking bi iii the effect of ph on the formation of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was also investigated by using series of various buffer solutions it was observed that the absorbance of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex obtained with hcl kcl buffer solution is in accordance with that one obtained with ph which is adjusted by hcl and naoh solutions fig 4 shows the maximum absorbance of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was observed in the ph range of 1 8 2 4 therefore hcl kcl buffer of ph 2 0 was selected conveniently for all the further studies 5 3 influence of organic diluents the choice of suitable organic diluent is very vital for liquid liquid extraction technique generally organic diluents are preferred on the basis of lower solubility in aqueous phase and higher extraction efficiency keeping all the parameters constant bi iii was quantitatively extracted by using 0 045 m cbimmt in a variety of organic diluents solutions of cbimmt 0 045 mol l 1 were prepared in these organic diluents and the effect of diluents on the absorbance value of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex at λ max 409 nm and 490 nm was examined it was observed that the absorbance values at λ max 409 nm and 490 nm increased in the order isoamyl alcohol benzene ethyl acetate chloroform carbon tetrachloride 1 2 dichloroethane methyl isobutyl ketone dichloromethane fig 5 dichloromethane was chosen for further experiments as it gave better phase separation and the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex showed maximum absorbance as compared to other diluents 5 4 influence of cbimmt concentration the effect of cbimmt concentration was checked by keeping the concentration of metal ion solution constant and the cbimmt solution was applied at levels of different concentrations ranging from 0 001 to 0 07 mol l 1 it was oberseved that 10 ml of 0 03 mol l 1 of cbimmt in dichloromethane was enough for the extraction and determination of bi iii further it was also found that there was no adverse effect of excess of cbimmt concentration on the absorption values of the complex at λ max 409 and 490 fig 6 in order to achieve the full complexation of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex cbimmt having concentration of 0 045 mol l 1 was selected for further all experiments 5 5 influence of ki concentration the effect of ki concentration was studied by taking 1 0 ml of 0 5 10 of it to obtain maximum and constant colour development it was observed that colour of the bi iii complex increased with the ki concentration up to 3 0 beyond this ki concentration the colour intensity of complex decreased therefore 1 0 ml of 3 ki was used for further extraction fig 7 at higher concentration of ki at ph 2 0 it is possible to form another species which may have different composition which leads to decrease in the absorbance 5 6 stability of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex the absorbance value of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was measured at different time intervals at λ max 409 and 490 nm to ascertain the time stability of the colour of the complex at room temperature it was observed that the colour of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was remained almost constant for more than 72 h 5 7 influence of equilibration time the equilibration time is also one of the important parameter in the extraction studies it is the time for which the aqueous phase is got in touch with the organic phase until the effective extraction of analyte was achieved in the organic phase an aliquot of 25 ml solution containing 100 μg of bi iii from hcl kcl buffer of having ph 2 0 was extracted with the cbimmt having concentration of 0 045 mol l 1 in dichloromethane for a period between 30 s to 15 min in the presence of 3 potassium iodide the extraction of bi iii was found to be quantitative within the range of 0 5 min 15 min fig 8 further increase in the equilibrium time there was no effect on the absorbance values of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in dichloromethane in present work 1 min of equilibration time was selected to ensure the complete extraction of bi iii 5 8 method validation other important parameters like linearity limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq accuracy precision specificity sensitivity robustness and ruggedness were also evaluated to validate the analytical performance of the present method 5 8 1 linearity range limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq the performance of the current method was evaluated for the quantitative determination of bi iii under optimum conditions a calibration graph was plotted for standard solutions which showed that the method obeyed beer s law from 4 0 to 21 5 and 5 3 22 5 μg ml 1 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively fig 9 further optimum concentration range was 5 25 14 5 μg ml 1 at 409 nm and 5 30 12 5 μg ml 1 at 490 nm which was evaluated by ringbom s plot for bi iii cbimmt iodide complex the curve was observed having sigmoid shape fig 10 the linearity of the method was based on the coefficients of determination r2 of the matrix matched calibration curves so the regression equation could be expressed as y 0 042x 0 000 and y 0 032x 0 003 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively with the determination coefficient r2 0 999 at both wavelengths the values of lod and loq were found to be 0 26 and 0 79 μg ml 1 respectively 5 8 2 intra day and inter day precision the repeatability intra day and reproducibility inter day were obtained by carrying out five replicate extractions and determinations of bi iii at a concentration level of 10 μg ml 1 during a day intra day and five replicates in three subsequent days inter day intra and inter day precisions were satisfactory with relative standard deviations rsd of 0 52 and 1 36 respectively 5 8 3 accuracy recovery the determination of accuracy is also significant in validation of analytical method for this samples like municipal water and distilled water were spiked where bi iii was not detected a result from various applications of the present method lies within the range of 99 00 100 0 which ensures the accuracy of the method as well as non interference with the other ions 5 8 4 specificity selectivity in the presence of foreign ions because the present method is destined for the analysis of environmenal water samples the matrix of such samples was taken into account the main components of environmenal water samples which can interfere during determination are foreign ions such as typical industrial pollutants in the proposed method the influence of these interferents was specifically studied it is also an imperative step in the characterization of the applicability of method is the selectivity towards bi iii in comparison with interfering cations and anions the tolerances limit to foreign ions may be defined as the highest concentration to which it does not interfere with the determination of the analyte the relative error of 2 it was observed that the present method was free from interference of large number of transition as well as non transition metal ions and anions as summarized in table 3 some of the metal ions which caused interference for the bi iii extraction such as sb iii hg ii pb ii pd ii and ag i was overcome by addition of suitable masking agents however the masking agent did not affect the sensitivity of the method these result extended the possible use of the method for the micro level determination of bi iii from various matrices 5 8 5 molar absorption coefficient sandell s sensitivity and enrichment factor the values of molar absorptivity of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in dichloromethane as calculated from beer s law over the range studied were 8 860 103 l mol 1cm 1 and 6 875 103 l mol 1cm 1 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively the values of sandell s sensitivities were 0 02358 μg cm 2 and 0 03039 μg cm 2 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively the values of molar absorptivity indicated that the present method is sensitive sandell 1959 the enrichment factor e f of the present method is 2 499 with maximum recovery the results also indicated that the developed method has good level of precision and hence is found suitable for the analysis of bi iii from various environmental and real samples and synthetic mixtures 5 8 6 robustness and ruggedness the robustness of the methods was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at different wavelengths whereas the method ruggedness was performed by two different researchers and also using two different cuvettes by a single analyst the results were in the acceptable range 5 9 nature of extracted species the stoichiometry of the extracted bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in presence of potassium iodide solution was determined from the experimental studies using log log method log log method the composition of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was ascertained by applying log log plot method and composition of extracted bi iii cbimmt iodide species was confirmed to be 1 1 1 m l iodide 6 analytical applications to evaluate the applicability and viability of the current method bismuth species were determined from various water samples from different locations around barshi city ms india synthetic mixtures and pharmaceutical samples the reliability of the method was checked by the spiking experiments with satisfactory recoveries the results obtained from analysis of synthetic mixture are given in table 4 from which it is evident that the present method works satisfactorily for the large number of synthetic mixtures the results which are mentioned in table 5 belongs to the water analysis which showed that there is no presence of bi iii species in the any of water samples except ground water the results obtained after analysis of alloy samples table 6 were also in fine agreement with those obtained with that of aas the method also shows that results obtained are agreed well with the certified values of bi iii from pharmaceutical preparations table 7 along with aas results to the end the suitability of the this method was also checked by applying it for the separation and the determination of the bi iii from a variety of binary mixtures it is found that the recovery of bi iii and of added metal ions was quantitative as shown in table 8 7 conclusion the present work demonstrates a very effective method for rapid micro level single step extraction and spectrophotometric determination of bi iii by using cbimmt as a metallochromic ligand and it has been proved to be a selective spectrophotometric reagent in conclusion the present method offers a

standing time to develop a maximum absorptivity of the species low sensitivity and also lack of selectivity table 1 patil et al 2002 gaikwad et al 2005 lopez et al 1988 agrwal and bhatt 1984 padmanabha and rao 2011 puri and gupta 1985 portal et al 1985 1986 dhanvate et al 2015 considering the aforementioned discussion here we introduce a chromogenic reagent 4 4 chlorobenzylideneimino 3 methyl 5 mercapto 1 2 4 triazole cbimmt for simple rapid selective sensitive and reproducible extractive spectrophotometric determination of bi iii from environmental and real samples synthetic mixtures and separation and determination of bi iii from associated metal ions the chromogenic reagent cbimmt in dichloromethane along with 3 potassium iodide instantaneously forms orange colored complex with bi iii from hcl kcl buffer having ph 2 0 colowick and kaplan 1955 as a medium this method does not require heating of aqueous phase use of surfactant and synergent for complexation reaction of bi iii and cbimmt the use of this reagent is also found to be beneficial as it can be synthesized at low cost with high yield and of best purity an extracted ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in dichloromethane showed maximum absorbance in the visible region at λ max 409 and 490 nm the proposed method has been effectively applied with good recovery and precision 2 experimental 2 1

water was used throughout the study other standard solutions of various metals used to check the specificity of the method were prepared by dissolving calculated quantities of corresponding salts in either distilled water or dilute hydrochloric acid different synthetic mixtures containing bi iii were prepared by combination with different metal ions in fixed composition 2 3 synthesis and characterization of cbimmt the chromogenic complexing reagent cbimmt was synthesized in the laboratory by simple condensation reaction of 3 methyl 5 mercapto 1 2 4 triazole with 4 chlorobenzaldehyde

iii in various ternary synthetic mixtures the analysis of synthetic mixtures containing bi iii and varying amounts of other metal ions assessed the validity of the present method for the separation and determination of the bi iii the binary and ternary synthetic mixtures containing 100 μg of bi iii with known amounts of another metal ions were prepared and bi iii was determined by the recommended procedure 3 2 determination of bi iii from various water samples the three main basic concerns of current and future water resources are shortage of water due to high requirement its poor quality due to industrial effluents and its related debacles including dyes and toxic metal ions das et al 2016 dasgupta et al 2015 2016 haouti et al 2018 sumisha et al 2015 othmani et al 2017 ground water has a vital role as it has wide applications in various fields and serves as a drinking water source kumar et al 2017 but it can act as a medium for doorway of a number of metal ions in our body when it is contaminated wastewater may contain numerous ligands to facilitate bonding towards these inorganic metal ions such as bi iii which can stimulate metal toxicity in our body when taken the present method was effectively applied for the determination of bi iii ions in water samples these water samples were collected from different locations near barshi city ms india in polythene bottles such as municipal water ground water water from nearby ganesh dam barshi city ms india and distilled water from our research laboratory all water samples were filtered through whatman filter paper no 40 as a filtering medium then 1000 ml of each filtered water sample was taken and evaporated just to dryness on the hot plate with a mixture of 2 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid after dryness it was then cooled and 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid was added and heated up to dense white fumes continued or until the solution became colorless the resultant solution was cooled and ammonium hydroxide was added for neutralization of acid in presence of 1 ml 0 01 tartarate solution then solution was filtered and transferred to 100 ml in calibrated volumetric flask and made up to the mark with distilled water the bi iii was determined by recommended procedure 3 3 determination of bi iii in pharmaceutical samples at the present time pharmaceuticals are also considered as promising pollutants as they include numerous organic and inorganic compounds including a variety of metal salts having complex chemical structure fatta kassinos et al 2011 gogoi et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2017 many pharmaceutical drugs contain bismuth compounds as an active pharmaceutical ingredient so for the present method was also applied for determination of bi iii from pharmaceutical allopathic samples like peptobismol chuable tablets trymo tablest denol tablets which were collected from local market the samples 3 4 tablets were heated in small amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid followed by addition of small amount of nitric acid the organic matter was destroyed by addition small amount of perchloric acid the resultant solution was slowly evaporated up to moist dryness the residue was dissolved in hot dilute hydrochloric acid and made up to the mark with water and amount of bi iii was determined by the recommended procedure 3 4 determination of bi iii in alloy samples the present method was applied for the analysis of alloy samples for bi iii content as the real samples were unavailable at this working place hence this forced us to prepare synthetic mixtures corresponding to the composition of alloys gaikwad et al 2005 mane and anuse 2008 bi iii was extracted and determined from by the present method 3 5 separation and determination of bi iii from associated metal ions the difference in the extraction conditions of each of the associated metal ions was fully subjugated to ensure whole separation of these metals from bi iii in various mixtures bi iii was separated from se iv cu ii te iv au iii and co ii by its extraction with 10 ml of 0 045 mol l 1 in dichloromethane from hcl kcl buffer medium under these conditions cu ii te iv se iv au iii and co ii metal ions remained quantitatively in aqueous phase the aqueous phase was evaporated to moist dryness by treating with 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid the residue was dissolved in water and diluted to appropriate volume the metal ions were determined by reported standard methods barache et al 2017 2018 2019 kamble et al 2010 2011 4 extraction and determination procedure for bi iii an aliquot of the solution containing 100 μg of bi iii was taken to this 1 ml of 3 potassium iodide solution was added and made up to the mark with hcl kcl buffer having ph 2 0 in 25 ml volumetric flask this solution was then transferred into 125 ml separatory funnel followed by addition of 10 ml of cbimmt solution having concentration of 0 045 mol l 1 in dichloromethane the resultant mixture was thoroughly shaken for 1 min the reagent cbimmt formed orange colored ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex which was collected over anhydrous sodium sulphate to remove the traces of water present if any then this organic extract was transferred in a 10 ml volumetric flask further diluted up to the mark with dichloromethane the absorbance of the orange extracted complex was measured at λ max 409 and 490 nm against reagent blank prepared in the similar manner without bi iii in it the concentration of bi iii was calculated from the calibration plot the percentage extraction e and metal distribution ratio d were calculated according to equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 e bi iii org bi iii aq init 100 2 d bi iii org bi iii aq where bi iii aq init represents the initial init concentration of bi iii ions in the aqueous aq phase bi iii aq and bi iii org are the total concentrations of bi iii ions in the aqueous aq and organic org phases after equilibrium respectively 5 results and discussions 5 1 absorption spectra of the reagent and its bi iii complex preliminary investigation on the interaction of the title reagent cbimmt in dichloromethane with bi iii ions in the presence of potassium iodide from hcl kcl buffer of ph 2 0 media and 1 min shaking has revealed the formation of an orange colored ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex the absorption spectra of the reagent and its bi iii complex are shown in fig 3 the spectrum of the reagent versus dichloromethane showed one well defined peak at λ max 391 nm while the spectrum of its bi iii complex against the reagent itself as a blank showed well defined absorption peaks at λ max 409 and 490 nm these results suggest the possible application of the extractive spectrophotometric technique for the determination of bi iii to take the full advantage of the procedure all the extraction conditions were optimized various experimental parameters were studied in order to obtain optimum conditions table 2 these parameters were optimized by setting all parameters to be constant and optimizing one at each time these optimum conditions were established by studying influence of different parameters such as effect of ph cbimmt concentration ki concentration choice of organic diluent shaking time and interference due to diverse ions the proposed method when compared with other spectrophotometric methods offers so many advantages such as instant colour development lower level of interference selectivity rapidity and accuracy 5 2 influence of ph in the extraction of metal ions the extraction efficiencies of metal complex are closely related to the value of ph of the system therefore we have investigated the effect ph on the formation of colored bi iii cbimmt iodide complex of by varying the ph of bi iii solution ranging from 1 to 6 5 before an addition of the organic phase initially the ph of bi iii solution was adjusted by 0 1 mol l 1 hcl and 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solutions the effect of ph on the absorbance values of extracted ternary bi iii cbimmt iodide complex were measured at λ max 409 nm against reagent blank prepared in similar manner without taking bi iii the effect of ph on the formation of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was also investigated by using series of various buffer solutions it was observed that the absorbance of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex obtained with hcl kcl buffer solution is in accordance with that one obtained with ph which is adjusted by hcl and naoh solutions fig 4 shows the maximum absorbance of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was observed in the ph range of 1 8 2 4 therefore hcl kcl buffer of ph 2 0 was selected conveniently for all the further studies 5 3 influence of organic diluents the choice of suitable organic diluent is very vital for liquid liquid extraction technique generally organic diluents are preferred on the basis of lower solubility in aqueous phase and higher extraction efficiency keeping all the parameters constant bi iii was quantitatively extracted by using 0 045 m cbimmt in a variety of organic diluents solutions of cbimmt 0 045 mol l 1 were prepared in these organic diluents and the effect of diluents on the absorbance value of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex at λ max 409 nm and 490 nm was examined it was observed that the absorbance values at λ max 409 nm and 490 nm increased in the order isoamyl alcohol benzene ethyl acetate chloroform carbon tetrachloride 1 2 dichloroethane methyl isobutyl ketone dichloromethane fig 5 dichloromethane was chosen for further experiments as it gave better phase separation and the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex showed maximum absorbance as compared to other diluents 5 4 influence of cbimmt concentration the effect of cbimmt concentration was checked by keeping the concentration of metal ion solution constant and the cbimmt solution was applied at levels of different concentrations ranging from 0 001 to 0 07 mol l 1 it was oberseved that 10 ml of 0 03 mol l 1 of cbimmt in dichloromethane was enough for the extraction and determination of bi iii further it was also found that there was no adverse effect of excess of cbimmt concentration on the absorption values of the complex at λ max 409 and 490 fig 6 in order to achieve the full complexation of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex cbimmt having concentration of 0 045 mol l 1 was selected for further all experiments 5 5 influence of ki concentration the effect of ki concentration was studied by taking 1 0 ml of 0 5 10 of it to obtain maximum and constant colour development it was observed that colour of the bi iii complex increased with the ki concentration up to 3 0 beyond this ki concentration the colour intensity of complex decreased therefore 1 0 ml of 3 ki was used for further extraction fig 7 at higher concentration of ki at ph 2 0 it is possible to form another species which may have different composition which leads to decrease in the absorbance 5 6 stability of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex the absorbance value of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was measured at different time intervals at λ max 409 and 490 nm to ascertain the time stability of the colour of the complex at room temperature it was observed that the colour of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was remained almost constant for more than 72 h 5 7 influence of equilibration time the equilibration time is also one of the important parameter in the extraction studies it is the time for which the aqueous phase is got in touch with the organic phase until the effective extraction of analyte was achieved in the organic phase an aliquot of 25 ml solution containing 100 μg of bi iii from hcl kcl buffer of having ph 2 0 was extracted with the cbimmt having concentration of 0 045 mol l 1 in dichloromethane for a period between 30 s to 15 min in the presence of 3 potassium iodide the extraction of bi iii was found to be quantitative within the range of 0 5 min 15 min fig 8 further increase in the equilibrium time there was no effect on the absorbance values of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in dichloromethane in present work 1 min of equilibration time was selected to ensure the complete extraction of bi iii 5 8 method validation other important parameters like linearity limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq accuracy precision specificity sensitivity robustness and ruggedness were also evaluated to validate the analytical performance of the present method 5 8 1 linearity range limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq the performance of the current method was evaluated for the quantitative determination of bi iii under optimum conditions a calibration graph was plotted for standard solutions which showed that the method obeyed beer s law from 4 0 to 21 5 and 5 3 22 5 μg ml 1 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively fig 9 further optimum concentration range was 5 25 14 5 μg ml 1 at 409 nm and 5 30 12 5 μg ml 1 at 490 nm which was evaluated by ringbom s plot for bi iii cbimmt iodide complex the curve was observed having sigmoid shape fig 10 the linearity of the method was based on the coefficients of determination r2 of the matrix matched calibration curves so the regression equation could be expressed as y 0 042x 0 000 and y 0 032x 0 003 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively with the determination coefficient r2 0 999 at both wavelengths the values of lod and loq were found to be 0 26 and 0 79 μg ml 1 respectively 5 8 2 intra day and inter day precision the repeatability intra day and reproducibility inter day were obtained by carrying out five replicate extractions and determinations of bi iii at a concentration level of 10 μg ml 1 during a day intra day and five replicates in three subsequent days inter day intra and inter day precisions were satisfactory with relative standard deviations rsd of 0 52 and 1 36 respectively 5 8 3 accuracy recovery the determination of accuracy is also significant in validation of analytical method for this samples like municipal water and distilled water were spiked where bi iii was not detected a result from various applications of the present method lies within the range of 99 00 100 0 which ensures the accuracy of the method as well as non interference with the other ions 5 8 4 specificity selectivity in the presence of foreign ions because the present method is destined for the analysis of environmenal water samples the matrix of such samples was taken into account the main components of environmenal water samples which can interfere during determination are foreign ions such as typical industrial pollutants in the proposed method the influence of these interferents was specifically studied it is also an imperative step in the characterization of the applicability of method is the selectivity towards bi iii in comparison with interfering cations and anions the tolerances limit to foreign ions may be defined as the highest concentration to which it does not interfere with the determination of the analyte the relative error of 2 it was observed that the present method was free from interference of large number of transition as well as non transition metal ions and anions as summarized in table 3 some of the metal ions which caused interference for the bi iii extraction such as sb iii hg ii pb ii pd ii and ag i was overcome by addition of suitable masking agents however the masking agent did not affect the sensitivity of the method these result extended the possible use of the method for the micro level determination of bi iii from various matrices 5 8 5 molar absorption coefficient sandell s sensitivity and enrichment factor the values of molar absorptivity of bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in dichloromethane as calculated from beer s law over the range studied were 8 860 103 l mol 1cm 1 and 6 875 103 l mol 1cm 1 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively the values of sandell s sensitivities were 0 02358 μg cm 2 and 0 03039 μg cm 2 at 409 nm and 490 nm respectively the values of molar absorptivity indicated that the present method is sensitive sandell 1959 the enrichment factor e f of the present method is 2 499 with maximum recovery the results also indicated that the developed method has good level of precision and hence is found suitable for the analysis of bi iii from various environmental and real samples and synthetic mixtures 5 8 6 robustness and ruggedness the robustness of the methods was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at different wavelengths whereas the method ruggedness was performed by two different researchers and also using two different cuvettes by a single analyst the results were in the acceptable range 5 9 nature of extracted species the stoichiometry of the extracted bi iii cbimmt iodide complex in presence of potassium iodide solution was determined from the experimental studies using log log method log log method the composition of the bi iii cbimmt iodide complex was ascertained by applying log log plot method and composition of extracted bi iii cbimmt iodide species was confirmed to be 1 1 1 m l iodide 6 analytical applications to evaluate the applicability and viability of the current method bismuth species were determined from various water samples from different locations around barshi city ms india synthetic mixtures and pharmaceutical samples the reliability of the method was checked by the spiking experiments with satisfactory recoveries the results obtained from analysis of synthetic mixture are given in table 4 from which it is evident that the present method works satisfactorily for the large number of synthetic mixtures the results which are mentioned in table 5 belongs to the water analysis which showed that there is no presence of bi iii species in the any of water samples except ground water the results obtained after analysis of alloy samples table 6 were also in fine agreement with those obtained with that of aas the method also shows that results obtained are agreed well with the certified values of bi iii from pharmaceutical preparations table 7 along with aas results to the end the suitability of the this method was also checked by applying it for the separation and the determination of the bi iii from a variety of binary mixtures it is found that the recovery of bi iii and of added metal ions was quantitative as shown in table 8 7 conclusion the present work demonstrates a very effective method for rapid micro level single step extraction and spectrophotometric determination of bi iii by using cbimmt as a metallochromic ligand and it has been proved to be a selective spectrophotometric reagent in conclusion the present method offers a practical potential for groundwater analysis monitoring of water quality especially with the advantages of high selectivity simplicity speed and low cost due to the following important features the method can be used as an alternative to flameless aas and icp ms for determination of bi iii from the environmental samples i the recommended procedure requires single step extraction the yellow

1 novelty in the present work bi iii was extracted and spectrophotometrically determined from buffer medium by using cbimmt as a promising complexing agent in presence of iodide the complex bi iii cbimmt iodide shows maximum absorption at wavelength 409 and 490 nm which lies in visible region of light the rate of extraction was rapid and allowed large tolerance limit for the number of transition and non transition foreign metal ions this realizes that present method can be successfully useful for the determination of bi iii in environmental matrices and synthetic mixtures without surfactant 7 2 safety aspects of the analysis of the pharmaceutical preparations boiling hclo4 to dryness with possibility of metals can result in serious explosion so during the decomposition of the pharmaceutical samples the use of hclo4 is avoided or care should be taken acknowledgement authors are highly thankful to dr prosun bhattacharya professor kth royal institute of technology stockholm

12211,saltwater intrusion is a common problem associated with every coastal region all over the globe and lagos state is not an exception this study was carried out in the coastal belt of lagos southwestern nigeria with the main objective of assessing the risk of shallow groundwater and its susceptibility to contamination in this research geophysical and geochemical techniques coupled with the concepts of dar zarrouk d z parameters were employed resistivity measurements were taken at twelve vertical electrical sounding ves stations and eight 2 d resistivity profiles using the schlumberger dipole dipole and pole dipole arrays were analyzed and interpreted respectively the d z parameters such as longitudinal conductance sl transverse resistance tr longitudinal resistivity l and transverse resistivity t data were computed from the qualitative interpretation of ves data to reveal the aquifer hydraulic characteristics the 2 d sections display the lateral invasion of saline water within the aquifer systems and variations in resistivity of the subsurface being the geo electric property that differentiates lithologies the geo electric model interpretation supported with available geologic information revealed four five geo electric layers namely top sandy layer clayey sand sandy clay clay and sand two aquifers upper and lower were delineated within the depth of investigation hosted mainly by sand and sandy clay clayey sand furthermore the longitudinal conductance data was used to predict the protective capacity of the coastal aquifer generally the water table aquifer falls within the poor weak protective capacity while the lower semi confined to confined aquifer is within the zone of good to excellent protective capacity the lower aquifer is essentially impacted with saline intrusion while the phreatic aquifer contaminations are both from saline and anthropogenic sources these assertions corroborate the geochemical results and previous findings in the study area hence geophysical method with the use of d z parameters proved to be useful tool in the pollution assessment of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater pollution dar zarrouk parameters protective capacity 1 introduction in lagos state of nigeria especially in the coastal terrain salt water intrusion is a common occurrence the southwestern nigeria where lagos is situated is characterized by two principal climatic seasons the dry and wet seasons the dry season usually extends from november to march while the wet season starts from april to october with a brief break in august the aquifer is adequately recharged with high annual rainfall mean of over 2000 mm while the depth to groundwater table are generally below 5 0 m in the coastal area offodile 1992 most rivers from south western nigeria drain into the lagos lagoon the occurrence of brackish saline water is a major feature that characterizes the alluvium and underlying coastal plain sands aquifer contrary to what is obtainable in areas in the mainland of lagos state the city can be accessed through road rail air and sea ports like every other coastal belt it experiences various degrees of saline incursion especially along the coastline as a result of its sole reliance on the groundwater as the major source of potable water for domestic and industrial purposes so as to compensate for inadequate supply of piped water adeoti et al 2010 groundwater availability however is unevenly distributed while the resource that is available has been polluted quality of groundwater drops when anthropogenic chemicals that threaten human health enter a water body through run off weathering or when concentration of natural elements fall short of required standard anudu et al 2011 the sources of groundwater contaminants in the area under study may be classified into two surface contaminants which migrate as leachates into groundwater and subsurface pollutants in the form of saline water intrusion increasing human population and industrial activities in the lagos metropolis have led to continuous contamination of the available water resources as a result of large volumes of waste being generated in the city in its quarterly report lagos state waste management authority reported that a total of 469 202 50 tons of municipal solid wastes msw were disposed of in 2007 alone longe and balogun 2010 the state is however characterized with inadequate waste disposal sites this practice does not only adversely affect the quality of the accessible shallow groundwater but also poses serious health challenges to the inhabitants the negative effect of human activities have been studied and reviewed by many authors urish and frohlich 1990 singh et al 2004 morgen et al 2011 the study area in parts of lagos coastal belt lies approximately between longitude 3 14 30 e and 3 53 15 e and between latitude 6020 n to 6030 n fig 1 the area relies solely on groundwater resource for its sustenance this induces saline intrusion which deteriorates the quality of the fresh groundwater the pollution status of the area is further exacerbated by increase in human activities for commercial purposes these include but not limited to constructions such as various housing estates schemes dangote refinery atlantic city et cetera all of which require extraction of considerable volume of water for operation the consequence of this uncontrolled exploitation of water poses serious threat to the groundwater and subsequently induced saline upcoming saltwater intrusion a prevalent scenario in the study area has resulted in several boreholes being decommissioned and abandoned this occurrence poses a great concern to the inhabitants of the region who mainly depend on groundwater for their domestic industrial and agricultural activities however the demand for water resource of appropriate quality and quantity is of prime importance to the occupants and thus assessment exploration and delineation of water bodies aquifers in the coastal arena becomes a primary objective in view of the scenario geophysical methods are known to play an important role in assessing and deducing the groundwater aquifer characteristics and a great deal of research has been undertaken using these techniques globally the change in the earth s resistivity is dependent on some important geologic parameters such as soils and rock types porosity and degree of saturation keller and frischnecht 1996 the electrical resistivity of coastal aquifers that are prone to saline water intrusion are recognized by relatively low resistivity values parasmis 1956 which range between 3 and 6 ωm keller and frischnecht 1996 bhattacharya and patra 1968 the electrical resistivity techniques have been widely adopted in the exploration for groundwater studies of the coastal aquifers in many parts of the world such as in the netherlands by van dam and meulenkamp 1967 in belgium by de breauk and de moor 1969 in israel by yechieli et al 2001 in jordan by batayneh 2006 batayneh et al 2010 batayneh 2013 and abu heen and muhsen 2017 in palestine it is also an effective tool routinely used under various geological settings and field conditions in hydrogeology geotechnical engineering and environmental geology for deducing the subsurface geologic framework of an area mc neil 1990 application of the geoelectric method has led researchers to develop surface resistivity techniques for quantitative evaluation of water transmitting properties of aquifers griffiths 1976 louis et al 2004 the geoelectric column and cross sections obtained from the vertical electrical sounding ves can also serve as an effective tool to image the subsurface vertical and lateral variations hydro lithology with the minimum need of observatory wells furthermore also employed for this research was the secondary geophysical indices dar zarrouk parameters which was first introduced into literature on electrical prospecting by maillet 1947 and it describes the relationship between the longitudinal unit conductance sl and the transverse unit resistance tr the dar zarrouk parameters have since been used by several authors in the estimation study aquifer protection capacity among whom is okonkwo and ugwu 2015 also okonkwo and ezeh 2013 used the concept in estimating aquifer s hydraulics and delineation of groundwater quality zones at oduma in enugu state nigeria similarly ekwe et al 2010 adopted the same concept in a low permeability formation for aquifer hydraulics characteristics okonkwo et al 2014 used the concept to deduce the extent of the subsurface lithology hence the main objectives of this paper were to assess pollution risk of shallow aquifer using geophysical and physico chemical techniques and the concepts of dar zarrouk parameter to predict the aquifer protective capacity in parts of lagos coastal area southwestern nigeria 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the dahomey basin of western nigeria coastal zone fig 2 the dahomey basin extends from southeastern ghana in the west through southern togo and southern benin republic to the southwest nigeria the lagos coast is made up of creeks and lagoons developed by barrier beaches associated with sand deposition in the geologic past the subsurface geology reveals two basic lithologies clay and sand deposits olowofela et al 2012 these deposits may be intercalated in places with sandy clay or clayey sand and sometimes with vegetable remains and peat ayolabi and peters 2005 the geology is made up of sedimentary rock mostly of alluvial deposits these are mainly composed of loose and light grey sand mixed differently with varying proportion of vegetation matter on the lowland while the reddish and brown loamy soil exists in the upland olowofela et al 2012 the geology is underlain by inter bedded sands gravely sands silts and clays akoteyon et al 2011 the sub surface is essentially composed of alternating sequence of sand and clay akoteyon et al 2011 the basin is bounded to the west by faults its eastern limit is marked by the benin hinge line a major fault structure marking the western limit of the niger delta basin the dahomey basin was initiated during the mesozoic in response to the separation of the african south american land masses gondwanaland and the subsequent opening of the atlantic ocean deposition was initiated in fault controlled depressions developed in the crystalline basement complex as a result of the rift generated basement subsidence during the early cretaceous neocomian the subsidence gave rise to the deposition of a very thick sequence of continental grits and pebbly sands over the entire basin lehner and ruiter 1977 over 1400 m of these sediments are preserved in coastal areas in nigeria and offshore in benin republic billman 1976 omatsola and adegoke 1981 during the late cretaceous santonian the basement rocks as well as the sediments in the basin were tilted and block faulted forming a series of horsts and grabens during the maastrichtian the basin became quiescent and has experienced only gentle subsidence since omatsola and adegoke 1981 hydrogeologically the basin consists of the aquifers made of abeokuta group ewekoro formation and coastal plain sands cps and recent sediments jones and hockey 1964 on a regional scale aquifer thickness decreases from the north towards the coast in the south varying in percentage composition of sand from north to south longe et al 1987 the aquifer types vary from unconfined semi confined to confined occurrences the lagos coastal aquifer is categorized into four types viz the first aquifer comprises recent sediments usually less than 2 m whiles the second and third are the upper 30 m and lower coastal plain 200 250 m sand aquifer respectively the cps is highly productive and as such is the most exploited aquifer in lagos state the fourth is the abeokuta formation longe 2011 which is represented by siltstone ill sorted ferruginous grit siltstone and mudstone with shale clay layer the last aquifer only occurred on inland in the northern part of ikeja where it was intercepted at the depth of about 750 m this aquifer is regarded as the most prolific and highly protected groundwater while most boreholes usually penetrated only the first and second aquifers only few boreholes have been able to tap into the fourth aquifer due to cost implication 3 materials and methods data acquisition in this study involves combination of geophysical survey and physico chemical measurements to assess the risk of pollution with respect to the shallow aquifer around the study area the geophysical data used were gathered from various sources field acquisition parts of the ves and res 2d data were provided by the ministry of energy and mineral resources lagos state fig 3 while the borehole logs were supplied by private company and lagos state water corporation furthermore some selected parameters from the groundwater samples collected around the area under study during the field sampling in september 2016 were also included 3 1 geochemical data a total of 43 phreatic water samples were collected out which 17 groundwater sampling points related to the present study were selected to represent the conditions of shallow groundwater during the hydro geochemical sampling the waters were thoroughly mixed for the first sample to be taken four sets of samples were collected at each sampling points for multi elements analyses a 1000 ml sample for the anion and 150 ml for the cation all the samples were stored in pre cleaned polythene bottles it was stored under 40 c and taken for laboratory analysis within 6 h of collection nitric acid was added to the samples for cation analysis in order to obtain a ph value of less than 2 the temperature and ph was measured in situ using digital meter tlc meter solinst model 107 and wtw ph meter model ph 91 the analysis of trace elements and cation in water were analyzed with atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas while un acidified water samples were analyzed for anions using uv spectrophotometry techniques the samples were analyzed for 25 constituents and physical properties to check the accuracy two internal standards were employed by the activation laboratory each run twice and errors were consistently minimal all the analyses were carried out at lagos state environmental protection agency lasepa laboratory lagos nigeria the results were compared with recommended standards to deduce the quality of the groundwater and the extent of pollution 3 2 geophysical data 3 2 1 electrical resistivity tomography ert and vertical electrical sounding ves 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert traverses were conducted using agi super sting r8 ip8 earth resistivity meter an 8 channel memory resistivity and ip meter with inbuilt processor for 64 and 84 multielectrodes system while vertical electrical sounding ves was carried out with the aid of a multi electrode abem terrameter sas 1000 three types of electrode array were deployed for the investigation for better horizontal and vertical resolution pole dipole dipole dipole and schlumberger in all resistivity measurement were taken along eight 8 2 d ert and twelve 12 ves profiles covering parts of the study region for the 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert traverses there were variations in the minimum electrode spacing a used from 1 6 to 8 0 m owing to constraint in space since the entire study area is built up notwithstanding reasonable depth were probed in the traverses with expansion factor n 30 the choice of arrays was informed by our desire to have high sensitivity to vertical and horizontal changes in the subsurface resistivity at both shallow and deeper depths at the same time we probed into the deeper depth to have good vertical and horizontal data coverage we employed dipole dipole which is the most preferred array in mapping vertical structures and well known for better horizontal data coverage than the werner loke 2004 however pole dipole has a relatively good horizontal coverage and higher signal strength compared with dipole dipole array pole dipole gave the highest depths of 219 m and 141 m at elegushi and oniru respectively figs 7a and 8 c the earth imager software was used to invert the apparent resistivity profiles to obtain a 2 d image of the subsurface resistivity distributions the ert profiles were inverted using an iterative smoothness constrained least squares inversion algorithm otherwise known as occam inversion after degroot hedlin and constable 1990 and loke and barker 1996 these inversion routines involve a cell based inversion technique otherwise known as finite element method it subdivides the subsurface into a number of rectangular cells in which resitivities are varied to obtain the best fit with the observed data loke 2004 ayolabi et al 2013 in order to achieve an acceptable agreement the differences between the observed and calculated data were minimized loke and barker 1996 this difference is given by the root mean square error rms however large and unrealistic variations in the output models are disallowed by smoothness constrained models the vertical electrical sounding ves was carried out using the schlumberger array with half current electrode spacing ab 2 varying from 1 to 200 m the vertical electrical resistivity field data were interpreted with software known as ipi2win schlumberger array for 1 d ves was chosen because of its good sensitivity to vertical variations in the subsurface resistivity at the initial opening of the data file it displayed a graph without resistivity cross section the best fitting two layered model was chosen based on recommendation of ipi2win software a best fitting model for the initial interpretation for the input data will be automatically suggested by the software editing of the model includes altering the layers quantity by means of joining and splitting to remove or add layer respectively and changing the layers properties the degree of uncertainty of the computed model parameters and the accuracy of fit in the curve fitting algorithm are expressed in terms of fitting error error 3 62 to 5 61 the resistivity of various layers and the corresponding thickness are generated by a number of inversions until the model parameters of all the ves curves were totally resolved with the fitting error the geoelectrical resistivity of sediments being most variable physical properties especially in a complex sedimentological environment may give rise to ambiguity in interpretation thus the vertical electrical sounding ves data are calibrated with the available borehole data near the study area in addition resistivity ranges for various formations are close and sometimes intermixed for example ranges of clay with freshwater and clayey layer with sand is interfering while close values exist between ranges for sandstone with freshwater and sandstones with clay and clay with freshwater and clay with salt water this ranges intermixing produces an ambiguity in ves results interpretation and makes it difficult to distinguish depth limits between two types of subsurface lithologies due to the effect of equivalence and suppression therefore the addition of dar zarrouk parameters d z is to improve the analysis of resistivity data in resolving some ambiguities encountered in stratigraphic layers 3 2 2 dar zarrouk parameters d z the d z was calculated from the vertical electrical sounding values obtained on the field from where longitudinal conductance s transverse resistance t and coefficient of anisotropy are derived using the following formula considering a multilayer resistivity interpreted model consisting of layer apparent resistivities thickness and depth other derivatives are convolved to generate different geoelectric parameters these identify electric boundaries separating layers of different resistivities zohdy et al 1990 geoelectric layers may be described based on two fundamental parameters namely apparent resistivity ρ and thickness h the dar zarrouk parameters are derived based on the apparent resistivity and thickness these parameters are the longitudinal conductance s ms layer thickness resistivity and transverse resistance t ωm2 layer thickness x resistivity the parameters t and s were termed the dar zarrouk parameters by maillet 1947 consider a section consisting of n layers with thickness h1 h2 h3 hn and a resistivity ρ1 ρ2 ρ3 ρn for block unit area and thickness h 1 h i 1 n h i the longitudinal conductance s is given by 2 s h ρ a the total longitudinal unit conductance it is the geoelectric parameter used to study variations in thickness of low resistivity material variation in s from one place to the other has been used in qualitative sense to document changes in the total thickness of low resistivity materials henriet 1976 zhody 1989 3 s l i 1 n h i ρ i h 1 ρ 1 h 2 ρ 2 h 3 ρ 3 h n ρ n while transverse resistance t is given by 4 t h ρ a the total transverse resistance unit is used to study variations in the thickness of highly resistive materials as well as their transverse resistance zhody 1989 batayneh 2013 increasing tr values are indicative of an increase in the thickness of the high resistivity materials and have direct relation with transmissivity 5 t l i 1 n h i ρ i h 1 ρ 1 h 2 ρ 2 h 3 ρ 3 h n ρ n the average longitudinal resistivity 6 ρ l h s h i h i ρ i where h hi hi is the thickness of each layer i the average transverse resistivity is 7 ρ t t h h i ρ i h i and the anisotropy anisotropy ʎ is derived from two parameters namely transverse resistivity ρt and longitudinal resistivity ρl where block of layers act as one unit behave like an anisotropic medium characterized by the longitudinal and transverse resistivities maillet 1947 the coefficient of anisotropy is generally 1 and rarely exceeds 2 in most geological conditions zhody 1974 an area with ʎ 1 and up to 1 5 is considered to be a potential zone for groundwater 8 a ρ t ρ l according to henriet 1976 he showed that the combination of layer resistivity and thickness in the d z parameters longitudinal conductance s and transverse resistance t may be of direct use in aquifer protection studies to signify the percolation of contaminants into the aquifer and for the evaluation of hydrologic properties of aquifer the protective capacity is considered to be proportional to the longitudinal unit conductance s thus the overburden protective capacity was estimated using the total longitudinal unit conductance s values the interpreted longitudinal conductance s and measured water level wl data were contoured in order to observe the protective capacity and ground water flow direction the surfer 13 software was used in producing the maps 4 results and discussion the qualitative interpretation of resistivity sounding data from the computer modeled curves is characterized by typical hkh qh h hk kh khk and k hybrid model curves fig 4 shows typical curve types resistivity values and layer thicknesses obtained from ves 1 ves4 the inversion results show interpretation of 50 soundings curves as 4 layers mode while the other 50 are 5 layers mode these distinct geoelectric layers represent alternation of sand and clay shale table 1 summarized the quantitative interpretation of all ves in the study area from the geoelectrical and computer iteration software ipi2win the first layer has resistivity and thickness values ranging from 2 29 1915 ωm and 0 46 4 55 m respectively this is diagnostic of the top admixture sandy soil the resistivity values of the second layer range from 3 52 to 132 ωm with thickness varying between 1 85 and 22 1 m this layer is relatively dominated by clayey soil of approximately 60 identified by low resistivity s values and thus expected to form the confining and protective layer for the underlying sandy aquifer while the other 40 entails ves 4 as clayey sand and ves 8 and 10 12 are sandy unit recognized with high values of resistivity constituting series of confined and unconfined aquifer the third layer delineated is mostly sandy with intercalated clayey sand 75 this constitutes the main parts of the first aquifer with clayey sand sandy clay in some localities the aquifer is confined where the overlying second geologic unit is clay and unconfined where it is sand the apparent resistivity of this layer varies from 1 61 ωm to 165 ωm also the thickness of this layer varies from 4 48 m to 43 1 m the fourth layer has resistivity values varying from 2 72 ωm to 265 ωm with thickness values ranging from 17 9 m to 45 3 m this layer is also known to form a confining unit to the underlying aquifer due to the dominance of clay occurrence laterally the basal fifth layer which marks the peak penetration of electric current is mostly sandy for all the sounding surveys and occurs as confined aquifers with resistivity values ranging between 3 61 and 2421 ωm however the thickness of the layer cannot be ascertained as the depth of investigation terminated within this unit the estimation from geoelectric model for this study revealed that depth to aquifers varied between 0 46 m 11 64 m and 19 7 m 65 6 m for the first and second aquifers respectively 4 1 analysis of dar zarrouk parameters 4 1 1 longitudinal conductance s the dar zarrouk d z parameters has been calculated for each of the geoelectric unit and presented in tables 3 and 4 the aquifer protective capacity was also modeled with the use of computer software sufer 13 contouring toolkits using longitudinal conductance values for both aquifers as in figs 5 and 6 the radial basis function rbf using multiquadric basis kernel type was adopted for interpolating the values of longitudinal conductance compared with the rest of interpolations methods rbf gave the best cross validation results and root mean square rms errors the radial basis function is commonly used for interpolating small surface and has been found to be appropriate for interpolating electrical conductivity values robinson and metternicht 2006 for each point a rbf is defined which depends on the euclean distance between the prediction location and each sample location the action of forming a polynomial function through the data points reduces the roughnesses of the surface due to the small amount of data the produced maps have significant errors of 0 804 and 1 8 for the first and second aquifer respectively more data will lead to better refinement of the mapped parameters the maps show clear picture of the regions in terms of the protective capacity evaluation the dominant blue region of approximately 95 observed with the first aquifer protective map of 0 7 value represents high pollution prone area and vice versa with the second aquifer the longitudinal conductance values for the first delineated aquifer vary between 0 01 and 2 49 ms while the second underlying aquifer have values ranging from 0 52 to 26 77 ms the first aquifer longitudinal conductance values are generally 1 exception being ves 1 with 2 49 ms the values for the second aquifer are generally 1 with the exception of ves 6 having 0 52 ms the longitudinal values obtained from twelve resistivity sounding interpretation extending from apapa to lagos island were used to determine the thickness and protective capacity of the overburden shielding the underlying shallow aquifers in the study area this is because the earth subsurface acts as a natural filter to infiltrating fluid okonkwo and ugwu 2015 hence its tendency to retard and filter percolating ground surface contaminating fluid is a measure of its protective capacity olorunfemi et al 1999 estimation based on unit layer of longitudinal conductance puts sand at the least protective capacity unit with value as low as 0 0006 ω 1and hence high pollution risk while clay offers the highest protective capacity to the aquifer with value as high as 26 77 ms and thus high protective capacity this is because the highly impervious clayed overburden which is identified by relatively high longitudinal conductance offers protection to the underlying layer abiola et al 2009 similarly evaluation of the overburden thickness on a regional scale considered the first aquifer to be prone to contamination relative to the underlying aquifer according to oteri 1981 the increase in longitudinal conductance s may correspond to an average increase in the clay content and consequent decrease in the transmissivity and vice versa it is also a common knowledge that decrease in resistivity or increase in conductivity values is considered an indication of either high clay content or salinity or both both factors led to poor water quality oteri 1981 the longitudinal conductance values enabled the protective capacity rating to be zoned according to table 2 into excellent good moderate weak and poor oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 according to this classification in table 3 of the first aquifer suggests that about 50 of the area falls within poor weak protective capacity while about 36 constitutes moderate protective capacity rating about 8 exhibits good protective capacity and remaining 8 is having very good protective capacity rating this implies that the entire study area with respect to the first aquifer which is characterized by relatively poor to moderate longitudinal conductance indicates poor to moderate protective capacity the low value of protective capacity observed connotes absence of significant clay content as an overburden impermeable material in the surface unconfined aquifer and thus enhance infiltration of contaminants whereas in the second semi confined aquifer table 4 16 in the area falls under excellent protective capacity rating 8 has very good protective rating capacity about 68 constitutes the good protective capacity zone while the remaining 8 falls in the category of moderate protective capacity the relatively high longitudinal conductance of overburden estimation with respect to the second aquifer in the study area envisaged excellent to good aquifer protective capacity rating and therefore minimizing or inhibiting the infiltration of pollutants from the surface these protective regions are geology dependent and formations are known to be extensive hence the protective layer is expected to behave linearly however this research was constrained to work with the limited available data and thus the result could be better validated with availability of more data 4 1 2 transverse resistance t the t values vary from a minimum of 1 05 2671 04 ωm2 and 347 36 3576 08 ωm2 for the first and second aquifer respectively increases in t values are associated with regions of high transmissivity and hence highly permeable to fluid movement the first aquifer are characterized by low t values relative to the second aquifer thus the second aquifer should be accorded priority in terms of target for potential groundwater resources 4 1 3 coefficient of anisotropy ʎ the anisotropy of the resistivity in rocks is caused by several factors including orientation of elongated grains or layering with different resistivity values it may also occur due to metamorphism rock fracturing and disseminated ore grains in the rocks habbeijam 1972 watson and barker 1999 the coefficient of anisotropy is usually 1 0 but seldom exceeds 2 0 the first and second aquifer have essentially values within the recommended range exception being ves1 2 52 and ves 5 2 72 for the first aquifer and ves2 3 41 and ves4 4 34 for second aquifer respectively the observed elevated coefficient of anisotropy values above 2 0 for the shallow aquifer first and second aquifers indicates increase in hardness and compaction of rocks keller and frischnecht 1996 and or may suggests presence of extraneous or intrusive body with resistivity higher than the host rocks resulting to an anomaly coefficient of anisotropy value isife and obasi 2012 the anormaly is expected of the studied area being an essentially reclaimed sandfilled terrain characterized by various foreign body s 4 2 2 d electrical resistivity tomography ert the obtained data were along three grouped 2 d ert profiles which cover only the south eastern parts of the study area elegushi beach oniru beach and adeniji adele ilubinrin the data were processed using res2d and the results were presented as in figs 7 9 the arrays employed are dipole dipole and pole dipole for better horizontal and higher depth probing the 2 d ert sections revealed variations in the subsurface resistivity the geo electric property that delineates different lithologies as well as its fluid content the interpretation from the electrical resistivity tomography ert revealed that the subsurface lithologic units are comprised of different layers with varying resistivity values these layers correspond to top soil clay sandy clay clayey sand and sand additional information from the available borehole logs shows that the sandy clay clayey sand and sand layers play host to the aquifer units with varying degree of aquifer yield resulting from the differences in porosity and permeability of the aquifer materials parts of the aquifer units were found to have been impacted by saline water due to an incursion by saline water from nearby lagoon where occurs it is characterized by very low resistivity value other sources of contamination observed from our study include infiltration of saltwater from the creeks accumulation and percolation of waste water through unlined drainages and canals and infiltration from polluted streams the intrusion experienced in the coastal domain is suspected to be as a result of increase in groundwater abstraction or withdrawal for both domestic and industrial use leading to a drop in freshwater table and consequently inducing incursion of denser saltwater to flow further inland oteri and atolagbe 2003 adepelumi et al 2008 adeoti et al 2010 harikrishna et al 2012 in a similar study ayolabi et al 2013 also deduced that excessive groundwater exploitation is responsible for incursion of saline water into the coastal aquifer this problem is particularly imminent within the study area that many prolific boreholes which were initially producing fresh water after drilling suddenly become salty a few months later and therefore abandoned the observed patterns of the saline water incursion from the geoelectrical resistivity results in most cases are lateral and generally identified with resistivity value 10 ωm figs 7 9 this further confirms interaction between the groundwater and the brackish surface water at elegushi res1 fig 7 three traverses were undertaken a c in this domain traverse a was carried out parallel probing a higher vertical depth using pole dipole while b and c separated 500 m apart were surveyed perpendicular to the ocean and the lagoon to reveal the progressive seawater incursion into the neighboring coastal aquifers employing dipole dipole array the vertical depth of penetration are 219 m 174 m and 122 m for traverse s a b and c respectively the parallel a traverse was 200 m from the ocean and the subsurface is essentially characterized by low resistivity reflective of saline incursion into the aquifer as revealed from the 2d ert model it is obvious that the aquifer between the lateral distances 117 m 152 m 200 m 250 m has been impacted by the sea water intrusion to a depth of 30 m 90 m beneath the surface with resistivity value less than 10 ωm this indicates that the second aquifer has been polluted by saline water similarly traverses b and c were probed from 300 m distance to over a kilometer away from the ocean to ascertain the progressive saltwater incursion inland traverse b revealed pollution into the subsurface aquifer to a depth between 15 45 m this is an indication of saline incursion deducible from its exhibited low resistivity value this definitely reflects an influence from the brackish water due to contaminant se flow direction the observed low resistivity at c traverse at the depth ranging between 30 m and 90 m is a clear indication of change in lithology and fluid content this portion has been highly impacted by saltwater and has greatly affected the second aquifer the contaminant spread which becomes imminent at lateral distance 320 m further confirms the presence of saline intrusion at oniru res2 fig 8 resistivity survey was carried out along three traverses a c traverses a and b were taken parallel to the lagoon using dipole dipole while traverse c was carried out perpendicular at distance s 650 m 400 m and 800 m away from the lagoon adopting pole dipole array the area of investigation for traverses a b and c are 118 m and 480 m 122 m and 567 m and 141 m and 405 m for both depth and lateral distance respectively at traverse a the resistivity distributions of extreme low value are restricted to the near surface aquifer within the depth ranging from 0 10 m as revealed by the ert inverted model this is connected with the combination of saline invasion on the one hand and infiltration of waste water or leachate generated from both domestic and industrial into the subsurface from the surface and via unlined drainage and waste water channel on the other whereas at traverse b the low resistivity value diagnostic of contaminants plume was observed between the depth of 30 60 m and at lateral distances of 224 m and 286 m this apparently indicates salt water intrusion however the traverse c was conducted to monitor the gradual encroachment into inland by the lagoon this shows dominantly low resistivity values within the depth of 20 m 50 m and also exhibits lateral occurrence this may be lateral invasion of the fresh aquifer by saline water there is also gradual decrease in the degree of intrusion with distance further inland evident from wider contaminant plume spread at lateral distance between 0 240 m and this may be as a result of high pressure near the source of intrusion which decreases with distance and thus leading to volume reduction of salt water being transgressed and or presence of competent underlying bed serving as seal retarding its percolation it can therefore be deduced that though both first and second aquifer were impacted by saline intrusion the second aquifer was greatly affected adeniji adele otherwise known as ilubunrin res 3 fig 9 is a land filled reclaimed portion on the lagoon two dipole dipole traverses were taken parallel to the lagoon at 100 m and 200 m away from the lagoon for both a and b respectively the 2d model reveals the status of the probed subsurface within the vertical depth of 138 m and 139 m for traverse a and b the traverses were characterized predominantly by low resistivity depicting that the entire traverses have been polluted by saline water up to a depth of 20 m in traverse a and up to70 m in traverse b below the surface the invasion from the surface in places may be due to proximity to the lagoon it can be deduced that both the shallow and deep aquifers are definitely polluted with respect to saline water intrusion where the plume exhibits its spread to the south confirming the general n s groundwater flow direction also it has been reported by several drilling companies in the coastal city of lagos that the groundwater from the confined aquifer in the study area is corrosive and it is associated with the severe environmental pollution resulting from marine transgression into the fresh aquifer system in the area oyeyemi et al 2015 oyeyemi et al 2015 recorded very high values of ec ranging between 2005 and 3013 μs cm and chloride content of 432 724 mg l within the water samples in parts of the coastal area with highest values recorded in hand dug wells this attests to the gradual salinization of the groundwater resulting from saline water intrusion through the lagos lagoon as delineated from electrical resistivity tomography it is therefore highly imperative that adequate measures be put in place to mitigate the phenomenon of seawater intrusion into the shallow coastal fresh aquifer and also prevent it from being extended to the underlying third and fourth aquifers 4 3 groundwater level map the measurement of the water table depth in the unconfined aquifer taken during the dry season allowed the plan of the groundwater level map fig 10 this map establishes the pattern of the underground flow of water contrary to the conventional n s regional flow of groundwater characterizing the coastal city of lagos the flow of groundwater within the study area exhibits a complex local pattern of flow resulting from different surface waters that encircle the terrain the main drainage systems are the ocean lagoon and creeks while others are canals rivers and streams generally the groundwater direction is principally influenced by the surface water with dominant influence draining a particular area the notable zones of influence could be divided essentially into two viz a lagoon creeks and canals and b ocean where the influence of lagoon creeks and canals predominates from west to east includes apapa to lagos island 3 21 00 e to 3 26 00 e lekki phase ii 3 33 00 e lekki and badore 3 39 00 e to 3 45 00 e the groundwater flows in all directions essentially in a nw ne and sw se directions this invariably confirms interaction between the surface water and the groundwater this body s of water receives from and transmits water to the neighboring aquifers towards the eastern end of the study area at awoyaya and lakowe 3 46 00 e to 3 54 00 e the groundwater flows towards the river adjoining the lagoon in a s n direction however at the zone of influence dominated by the ocean in victoria island 3 27 00 e to 3 30 00 e there is a prominent nw ne underground flow of water locally variations as to these main flows can be observed the variations are due to the directional changes of groundwater flow associated with the occurrence of alternating clay layers 4 4 physicochemical analysis seventeen 17 shallow water samples were analyzed and interpreted to complement and corroborate geophysical findings table 5 statistical variation of some selected parameters in the groundwater sampled during the wet season based on the who 2006 recommended standard show that the ph values ranging from 6 8 to 8 6 with average value of 7 6 suggesting fresh to alkaline water the total dissolved solids tds with value range of 70 2030 mg l with mean value of 562 mg l is above the maximum permissible levels proposed by who 2006 this suggests high concentration level of dissolved solids and thus increases salinity similarly the obtained values for electrical conductivity ec and chloride cl show higher concentration range between 112 and 3387 mg l 36 720 mg l having 1132 mg l and 155 5 mg l as the average values respectively these values are essentially far above the threshold of 250 mg l who 2006 and eu 1998 recommended standard this further attests to their salinities and confirms saline water intrusion from nearby lagoon as delineated by the electrical resistivity tomography ert geochemical study of the shallow aquifer in the same area by balogun and akoteyan 2012 classified 95 5 of the sampled wells as fresh water and the remaining 4 5 as brackish based on tds this study however on the basis of chloride content classified 82 2 of the samples analyzed as fresh water while the remaining 17 6 are identified as brackish water fig 11 this implies that within the short period of 6 years there has been about 13 1 invasion of the fresh water aquifer zone by saline incursion the gradual intrusion of saline water into the groundwater in the study area may be attributed to its relative closeness to the saline source as well as low elevation relative to the sea level however with respect to no3 it was revealed that over 60 of the analyzed groundwater possessed concentration 1 4 73 6 mg l higher than maximum permissible levels of 50 mg l proposed by who 2006 fig 12 this may probably originates from waste water infiltration leaching from waste disposal or septic tank the presence of no3 in higher abundance suggests that the first aquifer is essentially affected by anthropogenic inputs from the surface and this also corroborates and confirms the characteristic high rate of infiltration into the unconfined water table aquifer through poor to weak overburden protective capacity as predicted by aquifer protective rating 5 conclusion and recommendation combined geophysical and geochemical investigations have been undertaken to study the risk of shallow groundwater to pollution in the study area based on this study the following conclusions were made the combination of interpreted resistivity values from vertical electrical sounding ves 2 d electrical resistivity tomography ert reveals that the subsurface lithologic units comprised the topsoil with varying materials of low to high resistivity value clay sandy clay clayey sand and sand the aquifers are constituted by the sand sandy clay and clayey sand the longitudinal conductance generally shows that the areas along the coastal belt are prone variably to pollution the sandy aquifer confined by clay is the most protected in the study area in other words overburden of the first unconfined aquifer characterized by poor weak protective capacity rating is the least protected especially with respect to percolating or leaching materials from the surface while the second semi confined aquifer is relatively more protected with good excellent protective capacity the 2d ert revealed that the second aquifer was highly impacted by saline intrusion relative to the surficial aquifer essentially fresh aquifer deducible from low resistivity and that saline water incursion progresses further inland with increased pressure on groundwater the groundwater flow net revealed interactions between the surface waters and groundwater the physico chemical parameters analysis of the water samples taken from the first aquifer reveal that pollution affecting the water table aquifer are both anthropogenic contributory evident from the elevated nitrate concentration and marine invasion this is in agreement with the geophysical findings for this study and it can be concluded that source of saline water into the shallow groundwater in the coastal strip of lagos is essentially from the brackish surface waters it is recommended that the government formulate policy s to regulate control and enforce not only the excessive exploitation of groundwater but also the disposal of waste generated both domestically and industrially furthermore a periodic scientific survey of this kind is of prime importance to monitor prevent and remediate contaminants threats this study has proved geophysical methods to be veritable means of assessing the pollution status of groundwater acknowledgement the researchers appreciate the efforts of the lagos state ministry of energy and

12211,saltwater intrusion is a common problem associated with every coastal region all over the globe and lagos state is not an exception this study was carried out in the coastal belt of lagos southwestern nigeria with the main objective of assessing the risk of shallow groundwater and its susceptibility to contamination in this research geophysical and geochemical techniques coupled with the concepts of dar zarrouk d z parameters were employed resistivity measurements were taken at twelve vertical electrical sounding ves stations and eight 2 d resistivity profiles using the schlumberger dipole dipole and pole dipole arrays were analyzed and interpreted respectively the d z parameters such as longitudinal conductance sl transverse resistance tr longitudinal resistivity l and transverse resistivity t data were computed from the qualitative interpretation of ves data to reveal the aquifer hydraulic characteristics the 2 d sections display the lateral invasion of saline water within the aquifer systems and variations in resistivity of the subsurface being the geo electric property that differentiates lithologies the geo electric model interpretation supported with available geologic information revealed four five geo electric layers namely top sandy layer clayey sand sandy clay clay and sand two aquifers upper and lower were delineated within the depth of investigation hosted mainly by sand and sandy clay clayey sand furthermore the longitudinal conductance data was used to predict the protective capacity of the coastal aquifer generally the water table aquifer falls within the poor weak protective capacity while the lower semi confined to confined aquifer is within the zone of good to excellent protective capacity the lower aquifer is essentially impacted with saline intrusion while the phreatic aquifer contaminations are both from saline and anthropogenic sources these assertions corroborate the geochemical results and previous findings in the study area hence geophysical method with the use of d z parameters proved to be useful tool in the pollution assessment of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater pollution dar zarrouk parameters protective capacity 1 introduction in lagos state of nigeria especially in the coastal terrain salt water intrusion is a common occurrence the southwestern nigeria where lagos is situated is characterized by two principal climatic seasons the dry and wet seasons the dry season usually extends from november to march while the wet season starts from april to october with a brief break in august the aquifer is adequately recharged with high annual rainfall mean of over 2000 mm while the depth to groundwater table are generally below 5 0 m in the coastal area offodile 1992 most rivers from south western nigeria drain into the lagos lagoon the occurrence of brackish saline water is a major feature that characterizes the alluvium and underlying coastal plain sands aquifer contrary to what is obtainable in areas in the mainland of lagos state the city can be accessed through road rail air and sea ports like every other coastal belt it experiences various degrees of saline incursion especially along the coastline as a result of its sole reliance on the groundwater as the major source of potable water for domestic and industrial purposes so as to compensate for inadequate supply of piped water adeoti et al 2010 groundwater availability however is unevenly distributed while the resource that is available has been polluted quality of groundwater drops when anthropogenic chemicals that threaten human health enter a water body through run off weathering or when concentration of natural elements fall short of required standard anudu et al 2011 the sources of groundwater contaminants in the area under study may be classified into two surface contaminants which migrate as leachates into groundwater and subsurface pollutants in the form of saline water intrusion increasing human population and industrial activities in the lagos metropolis have led to continuous contamination of the available water resources as a result of large volumes of waste being generated in the city in its quarterly report lagos state waste management authority reported that a total of 469 202 50 tons of municipal solid wastes msw were disposed of in 2007 alone longe and balogun 2010 the state is however characterized with inadequate waste disposal sites this practice does not only adversely affect the quality of the accessible shallow groundwater but also poses serious health challenges to the inhabitants the negative effect of human activities have been studied and reviewed by many authors urish and frohlich 1990 singh et al 2004 morgen et al 2011 the study area in parts of lagos coastal belt lies approximately between longitude 3 14 30 e and 3 53 15 e and between latitude 6020 n to 6030 n fig 1 the area relies solely on groundwater resource for its sustenance this induces saline intrusion which deteriorates the quality of the fresh groundwater the pollution status of the area is further exacerbated by increase in human activities for commercial purposes these include but not limited to constructions such as various housing estates schemes dangote refinery atlantic city et cetera all of which require extraction of considerable volume of water for operation the consequence of this uncontrolled exploitation of water poses serious threat to the groundwater and subsequently induced saline upcoming saltwater intrusion a prevalent scenario in the study area has resulted in several boreholes being decommissioned and abandoned this occurrence poses a great concern to the inhabitants of the region who mainly depend on groundwater for their domestic industrial and agricultural activities however the demand for water resource of appropriate quality and quantity is of prime importance to the occupants and thus assessment exploration and delineation of water bodies aquifers in the coastal arena becomes a primary objective in view of the scenario geophysical methods are known to play an important role in assessing and deducing the groundwater aquifer characteristics and a great deal of research has been undertaken using these techniques globally the change in the earth s resistivity is dependent on some important geologic parameters such as soils and rock types porosity and degree of saturation keller and frischnecht 1996 the electrical resistivity of coastal aquifers that are prone to saline water intrusion are recognized by relatively low resistivity values parasmis 1956 which range between 3 and 6 ωm keller and frischnecht 1996 bhattacharya and patra 1968 the electrical resistivity techniques have been widely adopted in the exploration for groundwater studies of the coastal aquifers in many parts of the world such as in the netherlands by van dam and meulenkamp 1967 in belgium by de breauk and de moor 1969 in israel by yechieli et al 2001 in jordan by batayneh 2006 batayneh et al 2010 batayneh 2013 and abu heen and muhsen 2017 in palestine it is also an effective tool routinely used under various geological settings and field conditions in hydrogeology geotechnical engineering and environmental geology for deducing the subsurface geologic framework of an area mc neil 1990 application of the geoelectric method has led researchers to develop surface resistivity techniques for quantitative evaluation of water transmitting properties of aquifers griffiths 1976 louis et al 2004 the geoelectric column and cross sections obtained from the vertical electrical sounding ves can also serve as an effective tool to image the subsurface vertical and lateral variations hydro lithology with the minimum need of observatory wells furthermore also employed for this research was the secondary geophysical indices dar zarrouk parameters which was first introduced into literature on electrical prospecting by maillet 1947 and it describes the relationship between the longitudinal unit conductance sl and the transverse unit resistance tr the dar zarrouk parameters have since been used by several authors in the estimation study aquifer protection capacity among whom is okonkwo and ugwu 2015 also okonkwo and ezeh 2013 used the concept in estimating aquifer s hydraulics and delineation of groundwater quality zones at oduma in enugu state nigeria similarly ekwe et al 2010 adopted the same concept in a low permeability formation for aquifer hydraulics characteristics okonkwo et al 2014 used the concept to deduce the extent of the subsurface lithology hence the main objectives of this paper were to assess pollution risk of shallow aquifer using geophysical and physico chemical techniques and the concepts of dar zarrouk parameter to predict the aquifer protective capacity in parts of lagos coastal area southwestern nigeria 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the dahomey basin of western nigeria coastal zone fig 2 the dahomey basin extends from southeastern ghana in the west through southern togo and southern benin republic to the southwest nigeria the lagos coast is made up of creeks and lagoons developed by barrier beaches associated with sand deposition in the geologic past the subsurface geology reveals two basic lithologies clay and sand deposits olowofela et al 2012 these deposits may be intercalated in places with sandy clay or clayey sand and sometimes with vegetable remains and peat ayolabi and peters 2005 the geology is made up of sedimentary rock mostly of alluvial deposits these are mainly composed of loose and light grey sand mixed differently with varying proportion of vegetation matter on the lowland while the reddish and brown loamy soil exists in the upland olowofela et al 2012 the geology is underlain by inter bedded sands gravely sands silts and clays akoteyon et al 2011 the sub surface is essentially composed of alternating sequence of sand and clay akoteyon et al 2011 the basin is bounded to the west by faults its eastern limit is marked by the benin hinge line a major fault structure marking the western limit of the niger delta basin the dahomey basin was initiated during the mesozoic in response to the separation of the african south american land masses gondwanaland and the subsequent opening of the atlantic ocean deposition was initiated in fault controlled depressions developed in the crystalline basement complex as a result of the rift generated basement subsidence during the early cretaceous neocomian the subsidence gave rise to the deposition of a very thick sequence of continental grits and pebbly sands over the entire basin lehner and ruiter 1977 over 1400 m of these sediments are preserved in coastal areas in nigeria and offshore in benin republic billman 1976 omatsola and adegoke 1981 during the late cretaceous santonian the basement rocks as well as the sediments in the basin were tilted and block faulted forming a series of horsts and grabens during the maastrichtian the basin became quiescent and has experienced only gentle subsidence since omatsola and adegoke 1981 hydrogeologically the basin consists of the aquifers made of abeokuta group ewekoro formation and coastal plain sands cps and recent sediments jones and hockey 1964 on a regional scale aquifer thickness decreases from the north towards the coast in the south varying in percentage composition of sand from north to south longe et al 1987 the aquifer types vary from unconfined semi confined to confined occurrences the lagos coastal aquifer is categorized into four types viz the first aquifer comprises recent sediments usually less than 2 m whiles the second and third are the upper 30 m and lower coastal plain 200 250 m sand aquifer respectively the cps is highly productive and as such is the most exploited aquifer in lagos state the fourth is the abeokuta formation longe 2011 which is represented by siltstone ill sorted ferruginous grit siltstone and mudstone with shale clay layer the last aquifer only occurred on inland in the northern part of ikeja where it was intercepted at the depth of about 750 m this aquifer is regarded as the most prolific and highly protected groundwater while most boreholes usually penetrated only the first and second aquifers only few boreholes have been able to tap into the fourth aquifer due to cost implication 3 materials and methods data acquisition in this study involves combination of geophysical survey and physico chemical measurements to assess the risk of pollution with respect to the shallow aquifer around the study area the geophysical data used were gathered from various sources field acquisition parts of the ves and res 2d data were provided by the ministry of energy and mineral resources lagos state fig 3 while the borehole logs were supplied by private company and lagos state water corporation furthermore some selected parameters from the groundwater samples collected around the area under study during the field sampling in september 2016 were also included 3 1 geochemical data a total of 43 phreatic water samples were collected out which 17 groundwater sampling points related to the present study were selected to represent the conditions of shallow groundwater during the hydro geochemical sampling the waters were thoroughly mixed for the first sample to be taken four sets of samples were collected at each sampling points for multi elements analyses a 1000 ml sample for the anion and 150 ml for the cation all the samples were stored in pre cleaned polythene bottles it was stored under 40 c and taken for laboratory analysis within 6 h of collection nitric acid was added to the samples for cation analysis in order to obtain a ph value of less than 2 the temperature and ph was measured in situ using digital meter tlc meter solinst model 107 and wtw ph meter model ph 91 the analysis of trace elements and cation in water were analyzed with atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas while un acidified water samples were analyzed for anions using uv spectrophotometry techniques the samples were analyzed for 25 constituents and physical properties to check the accuracy two internal standards were employed by the activation laboratory each run twice and errors were consistently minimal all the analyses were carried out at lagos state environmental protection agency lasepa laboratory lagos nigeria the results were compared with recommended standards to deduce the quality of the groundwater and the extent of pollution 3 2 geophysical data 3 2 1 electrical resistivity tomography ert and vertical electrical sounding ves 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert traverses were conducted using agi super sting r8 ip8 earth resistivity meter an 8 channel memory resistivity and ip meter with inbuilt processor for 64 and 84 multielectrodes system while vertical electrical sounding ves was carried out with the aid of a multi electrode abem terrameter sas 1000 three types of electrode array were deployed for the investigation for better horizontal and vertical resolution pole dipole dipole dipole and schlumberger in all resistivity measurement were taken along eight 8 2 d ert and twelve 12 ves profiles covering parts of the study region for the 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert traverses there were variations in the minimum electrode spacing a used from 1 6 to 8 0 m owing to constraint in space since the entire study area is built up notwithstanding reasonable depth were probed in the traverses with expansion factor n 30 the choice of arrays was informed by our desire to have high sensitivity to vertical and horizontal changes in the subsurface resistivity at both shallow and deeper depths at the same time we probed into the deeper depth to have good vertical and horizontal data coverage we employed dipole dipole which is the most preferred array in mapping vertical structures and well known for better horizontal data coverage than the werner loke 2004 however pole dipole has a relatively good horizontal coverage and higher signal strength compared with dipole dipole array pole dipole gave the highest depths of 219 m and 141 m at elegushi and oniru respectively figs 7a and 8 c the earth imager software was used to invert the apparent resistivity profiles to obtain a 2 d image of the subsurface resistivity distributions the ert profiles were inverted using an iterative smoothness constrained least squares inversion algorithm otherwise known as occam inversion after degroot hedlin and constable 1990 and loke and barker 1996 these inversion routines involve a cell based inversion technique otherwise known as finite element method it subdivides the subsurface into a number of rectangular cells in which resitivities are varied to obtain the best fit with the observed data loke 2004 ayolabi et al 2013 in order to achieve an acceptable agreement the differences between the observed and calculated data were minimized loke and barker 1996 this difference is given by the root mean square error rms however large and unrealistic variations in the output models are disallowed by smoothness constrained models the vertical electrical sounding ves was carried out using the schlumberger array with half current electrode spacing ab 2 varying from 1 to 200 m the vertical electrical resistivity field data were interpreted with software known as ipi2win schlumberger array for 1 d ves was chosen because of its good sensitivity to vertical variations in the subsurface resistivity at the initial opening of the data file it displayed a graph without resistivity cross section the best fitting two layered model was chosen based on recommendation of ipi2win software a best fitting model for the initial interpretation for the input data will be automatically suggested by the software editing of the model includes altering the layers quantity by means of joining and splitting to remove or add layer respectively and changing the layers properties the degree of uncertainty of the computed model parameters and the accuracy of fit in the curve fitting algorithm are expressed in terms of fitting error error 3 62 to 5 61 the resistivity of various layers and the corresponding thickness are generated by a number of inversions until the model parameters of all the ves curves were totally resolved with the fitting error the geoelectrical resistivity of sediments being most variable physical properties especially in a complex sedimentological environment may give rise to ambiguity in interpretation thus the vertical electrical sounding ves data are calibrated with the available borehole data near the study area in addition resistivity ranges for various formations are close and sometimes intermixed for example ranges of clay with freshwater and clayey layer with sand is interfering while close values exist between ranges for sandstone with freshwater and sandstones with clay and clay with freshwater and clay with salt water this ranges intermixing produces an ambiguity in ves results interpretation and makes it difficult to distinguish depth limits between two types of subsurface lithologies due to the effect of equivalence and suppression therefore the addition of dar zarrouk parameters d z is to improve the analysis of resistivity data in resolving some ambiguities encountered in stratigraphic layers 3 2 2 dar zarrouk parameters d z the d z was calculated from the vertical electrical sounding values obtained on the field from where longitudinal conductance s transverse resistance t and coefficient of anisotropy are derived using the following formula considering a multilayer resistivity interpreted model consisting of layer apparent resistivities thickness and depth other derivatives are convolved to generate different geoelectric parameters these identify electric boundaries separating layers of different resistivities zohdy et al 1990 geoelectric layers may be described based on two fundamental parameters namely apparent resistivity ρ and thickness h the dar zarrouk parameters are derived based on the apparent resistivity and thickness these parameters are the longitudinal conductance s ms layer thickness resistivity and transverse resistance t ωm2 layer thickness x resistivity the parameters t and s were termed the dar zarrouk parameters by maillet 1947 consider a section consisting of n layers with thickness h1 h2 h3 hn and a resistivity ρ1 ρ2 ρ3 ρn for block unit area and thickness h 1 h i 1 n h i the longitudinal conductance s is given by 2 s h ρ a the total longitudinal unit conductance it is the geoelectric parameter used to study variations in thickness of low resistivity material variation in s from one place to the other has been used in qualitative sense to document changes in the total thickness of low resistivity materials henriet 1976 zhody 1989 3 s l i 1 n h i ρ i h 1 ρ 1 h 2 ρ 2 h 3 ρ 3 h n ρ n while transverse resistance t is given by 4 t h ρ a the total transverse resistance unit is used to study variations in the thickness of highly resistive materials as well as their transverse resistance zhody 1989 batayneh 2013 increasing tr values are indicative of an increase in the thickness of the high resistivity materials and have direct relation with transmissivity 5 t l i 1 n h i ρ i h 1 ρ 1 h 2 ρ 2 h 3 ρ 3 h n ρ n the average longitudinal resistivity 6 ρ l h s h i h i ρ i where h hi hi is the thickness of each layer i the average transverse resistivity is 7 ρ t t h h i ρ i h i and the anisotropy anisotropy ʎ is derived from two parameters namely transverse resistivity ρt and longitudinal resistivity ρl where block of layers act as one unit behave like an anisotropic medium characterized by the longitudinal and transverse resistivities maillet 1947 the coefficient of anisotropy is generally 1 and rarely exceeds 2 in most geological conditions zhody 1974 an area with ʎ 1 and up to 1 5 is considered to be a potential zone for groundwater 8 a ρ t ρ l according to henriet 1976 he showed that the combination of layer resistivity and thickness in the d z parameters longitudinal conductance s and transverse resistance t may be of direct use in aquifer protection studies to signify the percolation of contaminants into the aquifer and for the evaluation of hydrologic properties of aquifer the protective capacity is considered to be proportional to the longitudinal unit conductance s thus the overburden protective capacity was estimated using the total longitudinal unit conductance s values the interpreted longitudinal conductance s and measured water level wl data were contoured in order to observe the protective capacity and ground water flow direction the surfer 13 software was used in producing the maps 4 results and discussion the qualitative interpretation of resistivity sounding data from the computer modeled curves is characterized by typical hkh qh h hk kh khk and k hybrid model curves fig 4 shows typical curve types resistivity values and layer thicknesses obtained from ves 1 ves4 the inversion results show interpretation of 50 soundings curves as 4 layers mode while the other 50 are 5 layers mode these distinct geoelectric layers represent alternation of sand and clay shale table 1 summarized the quantitative interpretation of all ves in the study area from the geoelectrical and computer iteration software ipi2win the first layer has resistivity and thickness values ranging from 2 29 1915 ωm and 0 46 4 55 m respectively this is diagnostic of the top admixture sandy soil the resistivity values of the second layer range from 3 52 to 132 ωm with thickness varying between 1 85 and 22 1 m this layer is relatively dominated by clayey soil of approximately 60 identified by low resistivity s values and thus expected to form the confining and protective layer for the underlying sandy aquifer while the other 40 entails ves 4 as clayey sand and ves 8 and 10 12 are sandy unit recognized with high values of resistivity constituting series of confined and unconfined aquifer the third layer delineated is mostly sandy with intercalated clayey sand 75 this constitutes the main parts of the first aquifer with clayey sand sandy clay in some localities the aquifer is confined where the overlying second geologic unit is clay and unconfined where it is sand the apparent resistivity of this layer varies from 1 61 ωm to 165 ωm also the thickness of this layer varies from 4 48 m to 43 1 m the fourth layer has resistivity values varying from 2 72 ωm to 265 ωm with thickness values ranging from 17 9 m to 45 3 m this layer is also known to form a confining unit to the underlying aquifer due to the dominance of clay occurrence laterally the basal fifth layer which marks the peak penetration of electric current is mostly sandy for all the sounding surveys and occurs as confined aquifers with resistivity values ranging between 3 61 and 2421 ωm however the thickness of the layer cannot be ascertained as the depth of investigation terminated within this unit the estimation from geoelectric model for this study revealed that depth to aquifers varied between 0 46 m 11 64 m and 19 7 m 65 6 m for the first and second aquifers respectively 4 1 analysis of dar zarrouk parameters 4 1 1 longitudinal conductance s the dar zarrouk d z parameters has been calculated for each of the geoelectric unit and presented in tables 3 and 4 the aquifer protective capacity was also modeled with the use of computer software sufer 13 contouring toolkits using longitudinal conductance values for both aquifers as in figs 5 and 6 the radial basis function rbf using multiquadric basis kernel type was adopted for interpolating the values of longitudinal conductance compared with the rest of interpolations methods rbf gave the best cross validation results and root mean square rms errors the radial basis function is commonly used for interpolating small surface and has been found to be appropriate for interpolating electrical conductivity values robinson and metternicht 2006 for each point a rbf is defined which depends on the euclean distance between the prediction location and each sample location the action of forming a polynomial function through the data points reduces the roughnesses of the surface due to the small amount of data the produced maps have significant errors of 0 804 and 1 8 for the first and second aquifer respectively more data will lead to better refinement of the mapped parameters the maps show clear picture of the regions in terms of the protective capacity evaluation the dominant blue region of approximately 95 observed with the first aquifer protective map of 0 7 value represents high pollution prone area and vice versa with the second aquifer the longitudinal conductance values for the first delineated aquifer vary between 0 01 and 2 49 ms while the second underlying aquifer have values ranging from 0 52 to 26 77 ms the first aquifer longitudinal conductance values are generally 1 exception being ves 1 with 2 49 ms the values for the second aquifer are generally 1 with the exception of ves 6 having 0 52 ms the longitudinal values obtained from twelve resistivity sounding interpretation extending from apapa to lagos island were used to determine the thickness and protective capacity of the overburden shielding the underlying shallow aquifers in the study area this is because the earth subsurface acts as a natural filter to infiltrating fluid okonkwo and ugwu 2015 hence its tendency to retard and filter percolating ground surface contaminating fluid is a measure of its protective capacity olorunfemi et al 1999 estimation based on unit layer of longitudinal conductance puts sand at the least protective capacity unit with value as low as 0 0006 ω 1and hence high pollution risk while clay offers the highest protective capacity to the aquifer with value as high as 26 77 ms and thus high protective capacity this is because the highly impervious clayed overburden which is identified by relatively high longitudinal conductance offers protection to the underlying layer abiola et al 2009 similarly evaluation of the overburden thickness on a regional scale considered the first aquifer to be prone to contamination relative to the underlying aquifer according to oteri 1981 the increase in longitudinal conductance s may correspond to an average increase in the clay content and consequent decrease in the transmissivity and vice versa it is also a common knowledge that decrease in resistivity or increase in conductivity values is considered an indication of either high clay content or salinity or both both factors led to poor water quality oteri 1981 the longitudinal conductance values enabled the protective capacity rating to be zoned according to table 2 into excellent good moderate weak and poor oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 according to this classification in table 3 of the first aquifer suggests that about 50 of the area falls within poor weak protective capacity while about 36 constitutes moderate protective capacity rating about 8 exhibits good protective capacity and remaining 8 is having very good protective capacity rating this implies that the entire study area with respect to the first aquifer which is characterized by relatively poor to moderate longitudinal conductance indicates poor to moderate protective capacity the low value of protective capacity observed connotes absence of significant clay content as an overburden impermeable material in the surface unconfined aquifer and thus enhance infiltration of contaminants whereas in the second semi confined aquifer table 4 16 in the area falls under excellent protective capacity rating 8 has very good protective rating capacity about 68 constitutes the good protective capacity zone while the remaining 8 falls in the category of moderate protective capacity the relatively high longitudinal conductance of overburden estimation with respect to the second aquifer in the study area envisaged excellent to good aquifer protective capacity rating and therefore minimizing or inhibiting the infiltration of pollutants from the surface these protective regions are geology dependent and formations are known to be extensive hence the protective layer is expected to behave linearly however this research was constrained to work with the limited available data and thus the result could be better validated with availability of more data 4 1 2 transverse resistance t the t values vary from a minimum of 1 05 2671 04 ωm2 and 347 36 3576 08 ωm2 for the first and second aquifer respectively increases in t values are associated with regions of high transmissivity and hence highly permeable to fluid movement the first aquifer are characterized by low t values relative to the second aquifer thus the second aquifer should be accorded priority in terms of target for potential groundwater resources 4 1 3 coefficient of anisotropy ʎ the anisotropy of the resistivity in rocks is caused by several factors including orientation of elongated grains or layering with different resistivity values it may also occur due to metamorphism rock fracturing and disseminated ore grains in the rocks habbeijam 1972 watson and barker 1999 the coefficient of anisotropy is usually 1 0 but seldom exceeds 2 0 the first and second aquifer have essentially values within the recommended range exception being ves1 2 52 and ves 5 2 72 for the first aquifer and ves2 3 41 and ves4 4 34 for second aquifer respectively the observed elevated coefficient of anisotropy values above 2 0 for the shallow aquifer first and second aquifers indicates increase in hardness and compaction of rocks keller and frischnecht 1996 and or may suggests presence of extraneous or intrusive body with resistivity higher than the host rocks resulting to an anomaly coefficient of anisotropy value isife and obasi 2012 the anormaly is expected of the studied area being an essentially reclaimed sandfilled terrain characterized by various foreign body s 4 2 2 d electrical resistivity tomography ert the obtained data were along three grouped 2 d ert profiles which cover only the south eastern parts of the study area elegushi beach oniru beach and adeniji adele ilubinrin the data were processed using res2d and the results were presented as in figs 7 9 the arrays employed are dipole dipole and pole dipole for better horizontal and higher depth probing the 2 d ert sections revealed variations in the subsurface resistivity the geo electric property that delineates different lithologies as well as its fluid content the interpretation from the electrical resistivity tomography ert revealed that the subsurface lithologic units are comprised of different layers with varying resistivity values these layers correspond to top soil clay sandy clay clayey sand and sand additional information from the available borehole logs shows that the sandy clay clayey sand and sand layers play host to the aquifer units with varying degree of aquifer yield resulting from the differences in porosity and permeability of the aquifer materials parts of the aquifer units were found to have been impacted by saline water due to an incursion by saline water from nearby lagoon where occurs it is characterized by very low resistivity value other sources of contamination observed from our study include infiltration of saltwater from the creeks accumulation and percolation of waste water through unlined drainages and canals and infiltration from polluted streams the intrusion experienced in the coastal domain is suspected to be as a result of increase in groundwater abstraction or withdrawal for both domestic and industrial use leading to a drop in freshwater table and consequently inducing incursion of denser saltwater to flow further inland oteri and atolagbe 2003 adepelumi et al 2008 adeoti et al 2010 harikrishna et al 2012 in a similar study ayolabi et al 2013 also deduced that excessive groundwater exploitation is responsible for incursion of saline water into the coastal aquifer this problem is particularly imminent within the study area that many prolific boreholes which were initially producing fresh water after drilling suddenly become salty a few months later and therefore abandoned the observed patterns of the saline water incursion from the geoelectrical resistivity results in most cases are lateral and generally identified with resistivity value 10 ωm figs 7 9 this further confirms interaction between the groundwater and the brackish surface water at elegushi res1 fig 7 three traverses were undertaken a c in this domain traverse a was carried out parallel probing a higher vertical depth using pole dipole while b and c separated 500 m apart were surveyed perpendicular to the ocean and the lagoon to reveal the progressive seawater incursion into the neighboring coastal aquifers employing dipole dipole array the vertical depth of penetration are 219 m 174 m and 122 m for traverse s a b and c respectively the parallel a traverse was 200 m from the ocean and the subsurface is essentially characterized by low resistivity reflective of saline incursion into the aquifer as revealed from the 2d ert model it is obvious that the aquifer between the lateral distances 117 m 152 m 200 m 250 m has been impacted by the sea water intrusion to a depth of 30 m 90 m beneath the surface with resistivity value less than 10 ωm this indicates that the second aquifer has been polluted by saline water similarly traverses b and c were probed from 300 m distance to over a kilometer away from the ocean to ascertain the progressive saltwater incursion inland traverse b revealed pollution into the subsurface aquifer to a depth between 15 45 m this is an indication of saline incursion deducible from its exhibited low resistivity value this definitely reflects an influence from the brackish water due to contaminant se flow direction the observed low resistivity at c traverse at the depth ranging between 30 m and 90 m is a clear indication of change in lithology and fluid content this portion has been highly impacted by saltwater and has greatly affected the second aquifer the contaminant spread which becomes imminent at lateral distance 320 m further confirms the presence of saline intrusion at oniru res2 fig 8 resistivity survey was carried out along three traverses a c traverses a and b were taken parallel to the lagoon using dipole dipole while traverse c was carried out perpendicular at distance s 650 m 400 m and 800 m away from the lagoon adopting pole dipole array the area of investigation for traverses a b and c are 118 m and 480 m 122 m and 567 m and 141 m and 405 m for both depth and lateral distance respectively at traverse a the resistivity distributions of extreme low value are restricted to the near surface aquifer within the depth ranging from 0 10 m as revealed by the ert inverted model this is connected with the combination of saline invasion on the one hand and infiltration of waste water or leachate generated from both domestic and industrial into the subsurface from the surface and via unlined drainage and waste water channel on the other whereas at traverse b the low resistivity value diagnostic of contaminants plume was observed between the depth of 30 60 m and at lateral distances of 224 m and 286 m this apparently indicates salt water intrusion however the traverse c was conducted to monitor the gradual encroachment into inland by the lagoon this shows dominantly low resistivity values within the depth of 20 m 50 m and also exhibits lateral occurrence this may be lateral invasion of the fresh aquifer by saline water there is also gradual decrease in the degree of intrusion with distance further inland evident from wider contaminant plume spread at lateral distance between 0 240 m and this may be as a result of high pressure near the source of intrusion which decreases with distance and thus leading to volume reduction of salt water being transgressed and or presence of competent underlying bed serving as seal retarding its percolation it can therefore be deduced that though both first and second aquifer were impacted by saline intrusion the second aquifer was greatly affected adeniji adele otherwise known as ilubunrin res 3 fig 9 is a land filled reclaimed portion on the lagoon two dipole dipole traverses were taken parallel to the lagoon at 100 m and 200 m away from the lagoon for both a and b respectively the 2d model reveals the status of the probed subsurface within the vertical depth of 138 m and 139 m for traverse a and b the traverses were characterized predominantly by low resistivity depicting that the entire traverses have been polluted by saline water up to a depth of 20 m in traverse a and up to70 m in traverse b below the surface the invasion from the surface in places may be due to proximity to the lagoon it can be deduced that both the shallow and deep aquifers are definitely polluted with respect to saline water intrusion where the plume exhibits its spread to the south confirming the general n s groundwater flow direction also it has been reported by several drilling companies in the coastal city of lagos that the groundwater from the confined aquifer in the study area is corrosive and it is associated with the severe environmental pollution resulting from marine transgression into the fresh aquifer system in the area oyeyemi et al 2015 oyeyemi et al 2015 recorded very high values of ec ranging between 2005 and 3013 μs cm and chloride content of 432 724 mg l within the water samples in parts of the coastal area with highest values recorded in hand dug wells this attests to the gradual salinization of the groundwater resulting from saline water intrusion through the lagos lagoon as delineated from electrical resistivity tomography it is therefore highly imperative that adequate measures be put in place to mitigate the phenomenon of seawater intrusion into the shallow coastal fresh aquifer and also prevent it from being extended to the underlying third and fourth aquifers 4 3 groundwater level map the measurement of the water table depth in the unconfined aquifer taken during the dry season allowed the plan of the groundwater level map fig 10 this map establishes the pattern of the underground flow of water contrary to the conventional n s regional flow of groundwater characterizing the coastal city of lagos the flow of groundwater within the study area exhibits a complex local pattern of flow resulting from different surface waters that encircle the terrain the main drainage systems are the ocean lagoon and creeks while others are canals rivers and streams generally the groundwater direction is principally influenced by the surface water with dominant influence draining a particular area the notable zones of influence could be divided essentially into two viz a lagoon creeks and canals and b ocean where the influence of lagoon creeks and canals predominates from west to east includes apapa to lagos island 3 21 00 e to 3 26 00 e lekki phase ii 3 33 00 e lekki and badore 3 39 00 e to 3 45 00 e the groundwater flows in all directions essentially in a nw ne and sw se directions this invariably confirms interaction between the surface water and the groundwater this body s of water receives from and transmits water to the neighboring aquifers towards the eastern end of the study area at awoyaya and lakowe 3 46 00 e to 3 54 00 e the groundwater flows towards the river adjoining the lagoon in a s n direction however at the zone of influence dominated by the ocean in victoria island 3 27 00 e to 3 30 00 e there is a prominent nw ne underground flow of water locally variations as to these main flows can be observed the variations are due to the directional changes of groundwater flow associated with the occurrence of alternating clay layers 4 4 physicochemical analysis seventeen 17 shallow water samples were analyzed and interpreted to complement and corroborate geophysical findings table 5 statistical variation of some selected parameters in the groundwater sampled during the wet season based on the who 2006 recommended standard show that the ph values ranging from 6 8 to 8 6 with average value of 7 6 suggesting fresh to alkaline water the total dissolved solids tds with value range of 70 2030 mg l with mean value of 562 mg l is above the maximum permissible levels proposed by who 2006 this suggests high concentration level of dissolved solids and thus increases salinity similarly the obtained values for electrical conductivity ec and chloride cl show higher concentration range between 112 and 3387 mg l 36 720 mg l having 1132 mg l and 155 5 mg l as the average values respectively these values are essentially far above the threshold of 250 mg l who 2006 and eu 1998 recommended standard this further attests to their salinities and confirms saline water intrusion from nearby lagoon as delineated by the electrical resistivity tomography ert geochemical study of the shallow aquifer in the same area by balogun and akoteyan 2012 classified 95 5 of the sampled wells as fresh water and the remaining 4 5 as brackish based on tds this study however on the basis of chloride content classified 82 2 of the samples analyzed as fresh water while the remaining 17 6 are identified as brackish water fig 11 this implies that within the short period of 6 years there has been about 13 1 invasion of the fresh water aquifer zone by saline incursion the gradual intrusion of saline water into the groundwater in the study area may be attributed to its relative closeness to the saline source as well as low elevation relative to the sea level however with respect to no3 it was revealed that over 60 of the analyzed groundwater possessed concentration 1 4 73 6 mg l higher than maximum permissible levels of 50 mg l proposed by who 2006 fig 12 this may probably originates from waste water infiltration leaching from waste disposal or septic tank the presence of no3 in higher abundance suggests that the first aquifer is essentially affected by anthropogenic inputs from the surface and this also corroborates and confirms the characteristic high rate of infiltration into the unconfined water table aquifer through poor to weak overburden protective capacity as predicted by aquifer protective rating 5 conclusion and recommendation combined geophysical and geochemical investigations have been undertaken to study the risk of shallow groundwater to pollution in the study area based on this study the following conclusions were made the combination of interpreted resistivity values from vertical electrical sounding ves 2 d electrical resistivity tomography ert reveals that the subsurface lithologic units comprised the topsoil with varying materials of low to high resistivity value clay sandy clay clayey sand and sand the aquifers are constituted by the sand sandy clay and clayey sand the longitudinal conductance generally shows that the areas along the coastal belt are prone variably to pollution the sandy aquifer confined by clay is the most protected in the study area in other words overburden of the first unconfined aquifer characterized by poor weak protective capacity rating is the least protected especially with respect to percolating or leaching materials from the surface while the second semi confined aquifer is relatively more protected with good excellent protective capacity the 2d ert revealed that the second aquifer was highly impacted by saline intrusion relative to the surficial aquifer essentially fresh aquifer deducible from low resistivity and that saline water incursion progresses further inland with increased pressure on groundwater the groundwater flow net revealed interactions between the surface waters and groundwater the physico chemical parameters analysis of the water samples taken from the first aquifer reveal that pollution affecting the water table aquifer are both anthropogenic contributory evident from the elevated nitrate concentration and marine invasion this is in agreement with the geophysical findings for this study and it can be concluded that source of saline water into the shallow groundwater in the coastal strip of lagos is essentially from the brackish surface waters it is recommended that the government formulate policy s to regulate control and enforce not only the excessive exploitation of groundwater but also the disposal of waste generated both domestically and industrially furthermore a periodic scientific survey of this kind is of prime importance to monitor prevent and remediate contaminants threats this study has proved geophysical methods to be veritable means of assessing the pollution status of groundwater acknowledgement the researchers appreciate the efforts of the lagos state ministry of energy and

expected to generate baseline data for future groundwater management in the region and help to evaluate the environmental changes that will be expected due to trans basin diversion 1 1 geological and hydrological background malala oya river that flows through the southern dry area of sri lanka is one of the important river basins in the region the basin extends approximately 405 km2 with 17 sub watersheds fig 1 the study area is mostly flat and undulating at an altitude of about 50 m asl to the sea level the area receives heavy precipitations from november to february from the northeast monsoon the ambient temperature of the region varies from 27 to 32 c the mean annual precipitation of the basin is 1096 mm with average annual surface runoff of 192 mcm annual groundwater recharge of the basin is estimated as 41 mcm from the total precipitation annual extraction of groundwater is 0 13 mcm which is 3 42 of the total demand imbulana et al 2002 the entire river flows in a high grade metamorphic basement complex that mainly comprises granitic gneisses biotite hornblende gneisses and scattered bands of charnockitic gneisses therefore the groundwater in the region occurs mainly in fractures and other weak zones in crystalline basement rocks while shallow groundwater is generally extracted from the weathered overburden due to the scarcity of water lowering of the groundwater table during the dry spells and subsequent changes of water quality have been made profound impact on the consumers in the region imbulana et al 2002 jayatillake 2002 in addition increased salinity of the water is also found to affect the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation in some parts of the basin iges 2006 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater sampling a total of thirty 30 samples of water from shallow 10 m dug wells constructed in the saprolite n 7 and deep tube wells 20 m that drilled to fractures and other weak zones in crystalline rocks n 15 and from water

determined by laser based liquid water isotope analyser lwia model lgr dlt 100 available at the isotope hydrology laboratory of atomic energy board sri lanka the international atomic energy agency iaea standard operating procedures were adapted for the preparation and quality controlling of the measurement the tritium 3h activity of groundwater samples was measured on a liquid scintillation counter packard 3170 tr sl minimum detection limit 0 3 tu after the electrolysis enrichment process the isotope compositions were expressed in delta per mill 0 00 δ notation with respect to the vienna

and wilcox plot were used to assess the hydrogeochemical characters of groundwater the molar ratios of major anions and cations were used to evaluate the contribution of cation exchange processes during the weathering of rocks the percentage pollution of groundwater was calculated to determine the anthropogenic impacts to the groundwater the irrigation suitability of groundwater was examined based on sodium absorption ratio sar and percentage sodium na as calculated by the formulas 1 and 2 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 2 n a n a k 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k 3 results and discussion the maximum and minimum values of analyzed water quality parameters for 22 groundwater samples and 8 surface water samples are shown in table 1 the ph of groundwater samples varied from 6 5 to 8 1 with an average of 7 2 while it varied from 6 4 to 8 1 with an average of 7 5 in surface water samples the alkalinity of groundwater ranged from 85 4 to 879 mg l with an average value of 572 mg l alkalinity of surface water samples ranged from 61 to 842 mg l almost all groundwater samples except two exceeded the recommended alkalinity level for drinking purposes this may possibly due to dissolution of carbonates and phosphates minerals in groundwater anthropogenic activities such as cleaning and washing could also contribute to high alkalinity in surface water the electrical conductivity ec in groundwater samples varied from 6 7 to 11110 μs cm an exceptionally high ec value was recorded in a deep well sample mo 20 over 60 of studied wells exceeded the permissible levels of ec for drinking purposes recommended by the sri lanka standard institute slsi the total hardness of groundwater varied from 48 to 1980 mg l while significantly higher values 1300 mg l were recorded in a deep well and also in a shallow well 1980 mg l in the study area over 90 of groundwater samples exceeded the recommended maximum permissible level for total hardness for drinking purposes collected water samples were classified into different categories based on the total hardness fig 2 accordingly most groundwater samples collected from the study basin could be categorized under very hard category 300 mg l the total hardness of surface water samples varied from 44 to 248 mg l drinking hard water with high fluoride contents is suspected be a causative factor for high incidences of chronic kidney disease with uncertain etiology in the dry zone of sri lanka wickramarathna et al 2017 the cl and so4 2 content in groundwater samples varied between 18 to 432 mg l and 25 690 mg l respectively nearly 50 of groundwater samples exceeded the permissible level of cl for drinking purposes however only three groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible level for so4 2 leachates from fertilizers from paddy fields would add so4 2 into both surface and groundwater the nitrate n of groundwater in the study area varied from 0 4 to 13 mg l from which one shallow well showed significantly high nitrate n level 13 mg l the nitrite concentrations of groundwater samples varied from 0 003 to 0 030 mg l the sources of nitrite and nitrate inputs to groundwater are n fertilizers improper sewage discharges or leachates from pit latrines that are usually located in the overburden the phosphate content of groundwater varied between 0 18 0 84 mg l only one deep well mo24 showed a significantly higher phosphate level 1 97 mg l the fluoride content of groundwater in the region varied from 0 12 to 3 42 mg l about 80 of groundwater samples in the malala oya basin exceeded 0 5 mg l level that considered as the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water for sri lanka chandrajith et al 2012 the source of fluoride in groundwater is mainly due to leaching from metamorphic aquifer materials that are rich with fluoride bearing minerals such as micas and amphiboles dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 dental fluorosis is one of the common health problems among communities in the dry zone of sri lanka due to drinking of water with high fluoride content chandrajith et al 2012 ranasinghe et al 2019 metals in groundwater are received greater attention in recent years due to their higher toxicity and tendency of bioaccumulation weathering of rocks sewage discharge and leaching from other waste materials are the major sources of trace metals in water jain et al 2010 among studied metals the iron fe content in all groundwater samples of the basin was within the standard permissible level of 300 μg l who 2008 the mn level in the basin varied from 2 48 μg l to 2242 μg l with a mean of 268 μg l twenty three percent 23 of groundwater samples in the basin exceeded the permissible level of mn that is recommended for drinking water mn usually exists at low concentration in groundwater due to its geochemical control jain et al 2010 adverse effects on water supply structures and offensive taste in drinking water are possible impacts of high mn levels in groundwater the speciation of fe and mn is influenced by the redox characteristics of groundwater biswas et al 2012 hasan et al 2007 iron content in groundwater may induced by reduction of mn in the aqueous system leading to precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides appelo and postma 2005 dissolved organic matter doc in groundwater would also further facilitate the reductive dissolution processes that affect the content of dissolved fe in groundwater system bhattacharya et al 2002 the al content in groundwater samples in the basin varied from 7 68 μg l to 625 μg l with a mean value of 114 μg l the presence of high al levels in drinking water can induce a neurotoxic effect rajasooriyar et al 2013 the sr content of groundwater samples varied from 93 μg l to 2315 μg l with a median of 811 μg l while ba contents varied from 18 5 μg l to 673 μg l with a median value of 139 μg l lead pb content in the basin varied from 0 12 μg l to 12 1 μg l with a mean value of 1 39 μg l only one deep well showed a slightly higher pb content 12 1 μg l than the who recommended value of 10 μg l the arsenic as and cadmium cd contents in groundwater of the basin varied from 0 074 μg l to 0 65 μg l and from 0 055 μg l to 0 92 μg l respectively both as and cd contents in groundwater of the study area were several fold lower than the permissible levels the contents of other elements such as ni zn cu cr and hg in both groundwater and surface water from the malala oya basin were lower than the who recommended limits mercury is another important toxic element that has mainly of anthropogenic origin chandrajith et al 1995 matsunaga et al 1999 however in the malala oya basin hg levels recorded is very low and that varied from 0 001 to 0 056 μg l 3 1 geochemical evolution of groundwater the piper trilinear diagram is one of the widely used tools for identifying hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater based on major cations and anions ray and mukherjee 2008 accordingly water are classified into 6 major types as na cl type ca hco3 type ca na hco3 type ca mg cl type na hco3 type and ca cl type kumar 2013 based on the results obtained in this study the prominent water facies in the basin was ca mg cl type fig 3 majority 53 of deep well samples showed ca mg cl type while some wells were associated with ca hco3 and ca na hco3 types 86 shallow wells belonged to either na cl or ca na hco3 facies the results suggest a significant contribution of weathering of mica amphibole and pyroxenes in the high grade metamorphic rocks in the evolution of groundwater types in the basin as shown below dissolution of pyroxenes camg si2o6 4co2 6h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3 2si oh 4 dissolution of amphiboles ca2mg5si8o22 oh 2 14co2 22h2o 2ca2 5mg2 14hco3 8si oh 4 the relationships between major ions are generally used to identify the evolution of groundwater and their mixing mechanisms thilakerathne et al 2015 the molar ratio of na cl is widely used to evaluate silicate weathering seawater intrusion halite dissolution and ion exchange processes rubasinghe et al 2015 the na cl ratio of samples collected from the malala oya basin indicated that samples were scattered alone the 1 1 line fig 4 a the na cl molar ratio which is greater than 1 represents na is released to the groundwater by silicate weathering rubasinghe et al 2015 the ca mg molar ratio of all groundwater samples in the basin scattered very close to or below the 1 1 line fig 4b usually the ca mg ratio between 1 and 2 indicates calcite dissolution process while the molar ratio 2 indicates the silicate mineral dissolution processes thilakerathne et al 2015 the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 cl so4 2 showed a linear relationship fig 4c samples from the study area were scattered between 1 1 and 2 1 lines in the plot of hco3 vs ca2 mg2 fig 4d the groundwater samples that plotted above the 1 1 line indicate the weathering of silicate minerals abeywickarama et al 2016 these results suggest that weathering of silicate minerals are the major contributors of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of groundwater in the basin since there is no evidences for saline water intrusion and also absence of geothermal activities in the area silicate weathering is primarily responsible for major ions in the study groundwater 3 2 suitability of groundwater for irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is an important consideration in dry climatic regions of sri lanka since it is the main source of irrigation water higher levels of dissolved ions in irrigated water leads to physical and chemical damages of crops and soil ravikumar et al 2011 a plot of sodium hazard vs salinity hazard was used widely to evaluate the irrigation suitability of groundwater fig 5 in the study region most groundwater samples were scattered in the lower sodium and high salinity hazard zone groundwater belonging to these groups can be used for irrigation activities with proper salinity control anudu et al 2011 similar results were also obtained from the wilcox diagram that plot na against ec fig 6 accordingly groundwater from the study area plotted in good to permissible and also in doubtful to unsuitable regions nearly 36 of groundwater samples in the study area fall in good to permissible regions while 23 of samples were in doubt for unsuitable regions 3 3 isotope composition of groundwater environmental isotopes of δ18o and δ2h in ground and surface water are important traces that can be used to evaluate hydrological processes such as infiltration evaporation surface water groundwater interactions and rock weathering clark and fritz 2013 the δ18o and δ2h of groundwater in the malala oya river basin varied from 8 37 to 1 64 and from 54 70 to 9 93 respectively the surface water samples showed δ18o and δ2h values of 5 35 to 3 01 and 34 28 to 17 08 respectively table 3 fig 7 groundwater isotopes in the region were plotted on the regression line gwl denoted by δ2h 6 97δ18o 5 53 r2 0 915 the local meteoric water line lmwl for the southern dry zone was estimated using the data available at the international atomic energy agency http isohis iaea org for hambantota meteorological station that located close to the malala oya basin fig 1 the lmwl for the study basin is represented by δ2h 8 01δ18o 12 r2 0 848 the isotope composition of surface water from the basin represent the evaporation line el of δ2h 6 48δ18o 0 09 deep wells sample in the study region were plotted along the lmwl indicating a direct recharge from the monsoon rain however the deviation of shallow wells from the lmwl indicates the intensive evaporation under prevailing dry conditions in the basin the confluence point of gwl and lmwl represents the rainfall index of the northeast monsoon the average isotopic composition of the northeast monsoon rain is 6 01 for δ18o and 36 7 for δ2h edirisinghe et al 2017 these evidences suggest that the main source of groundwater in the basin is the monsoon rain however it is evident that isotope composition is modified due to high rate of evaporation particularly in the shallow regolith aquifers the enriched isotope composition of shallow groundwater could have been attributed to mixing with surface water two groundwater samples mo03 and mo24 showed the most depleted isotope value with high ec 5224 μs cm value the most depleted isotope compositions can be expected from higher elevation recharge poage and chamberlain 2001 thus deep groundwater would have recharged from rains in the highland regions located adjacent to the study area the high ec values in these deep groundwater samples would be due to the dissolution of minerals in its flow path to evaluate approximate resident time of groundwater tritium 3h with 12 32 years of half life was adapted in this study three deep wells were selected to measure the tritium contents the observed 3h values were below the detection limit of the counter 0 3 tu the mean 3h value in rainwater in colombo is approximately 1 tu during 2009 2011 period chandrajith et al 2014 the observed tritium values of deep groundwater samples indicate a prolonged retention time with very low recharge in comparison to tritium values of the rain water 4 conclusions in this study geochemical and environmental isotope evidences were used to characterize water resources in the malala oya river basin higher ec and hardness were the main characteristics of the malala oya river basin over 90 of groundwater samples exceeded the recommended levels of alkalinity 200 mg l while nearly 50 groundwater samples exceeding recommended cl level of drinking water nitrate n and phosphate concentrations were within the acceptable limits in majority of samples however the fluoride concentrations of groundwater were significantly higher and probably causing adverse health effects the dominant water types in the basin were in the order of ca mg cl ca hco3 ca na hco3 na cl the results of this study indicate that silicate weathering is the leading process that controls the groundwater geochemistry while significant contributions are also made from ion exchange processes and carbonate dissolution irrigation suitability calculations of groundwater indicated a low sodium hazard condition in the malala basin isotope of oxygen and hydrogen of surface water indicated effects of intensive evaporation while most shallow and deep water is directly recharged from local rainfall however some of the deep groundwater is being recharged by meteoric water that seep through hard rock fracture systems possibly from nearby highland region

monsoon the ambient temperature of the region varies from 27 to 32 c the mean annual precipitation of the basin is 1096 mm with average annual surface runoff of 192 mcm annual groundwater recharge of the basin is estimated as 41 mcm from the total precipitation annual extraction of groundwater is 0 13 mcm which is 3 42 of the total demand imbulana et al 2002 the entire river flows in a high grade metamorphic basement complex that mainly comprises granitic gneisses biotite hornblende gneisses and scattered bands of charnockitic gneisses therefore the groundwater in the region occurs mainly in fractures and other weak zones in crystalline basement rocks while shallow groundwater is generally extracted from the weathered overburden due to the scarcity of water lowering of the groundwater table during the dry spells and subsequent changes of water quality have been made profound impact on the consumers in the region imbulana et al 2002 jayatillake 2002 in addition increased salinity of the water is also found to affect the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation in some parts of the basin iges 2006 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater sampling a total of thirty 30 samples of water from shallow 10 m dug wells constructed in the saprolite n 7 and deep tube wells 20 m that drilled to fractures and other weak zones in crystalline rocks n 15 and from water reservoirs n 8 were collected covering the entire malala oya basin fig 1 when collecting groundwater samples pumping was carried out for 10 min by a submersible pump while shallow well samples were collected from the deepest layer using a depth sampler 2 2 field investigations on site measurements of ph total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec and salinity were performed using orion star 329 multi parameter kit water samples were collected into pre cleaned high density polyethylene bottles samples were filtered using 0 45 μm disposable nylon syringe filters and potions of samples were acidified with conc hno3 for cation analyses water samples were collected into 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and sealed with parafilm for isotope analyses unfiltered water samples were collected for tritium 3h analysis all samples were kept at 4 c till the analyses were performed 2 3 laboratory analyses major anions and cations and metal elements in water samples were determined following the american public health association procedures apha 2012 alkalinity total hardness and chloride contents were measured using titrimetric methods while sulphates phosphates nitrite nitrate and fluoride were measured using hach dr 2700 spectrophotometer major cations na k ca and mg were measured by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas varian 240fs while other elements li be al co ni cu cr mn fe zn as hg sr cd ba pb were measured using thermo icapq inductivity coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the internal drift of the instrument was corrected using 103rh and 186re as internal standards the accuracy of the analysis was performed using the certified standards tm 25 4 environment canada that measured to assure the quality of the analytical procedures the recoveries were less than 1 0 for cr mn co ni cu as and pb within 1 0 3 0 for zn sr cd and hg within 3 0 5 0 for be ba and al and within 5 0 8 0 for li and fe stable isotopes 18o and 2h in samples were determined by laser based liquid water isotope analyser lwia model lgr dlt 100 available at the isotope hydrology laboratory of atomic energy board sri lanka the international atomic energy agency iaea standard operating procedures were adapted for the preparation and quality controlling of the measurement the tritium 3h activity of groundwater samples was measured on a liquid scintillation counter packard 3170 tr sl minimum detection limit 0 3 tu after the electrolysis enrichment process the isotope compositions were expressed in delta per mill 0 00 δ notation with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow where δ18o or δ2h rsample rstandard rstandard 1000 where r denotes the ratio of 2h 1h or 18o 16o 2 4 data analyses piper trilinear diagram us salinity hazard diagram and wilcox plot were used to assess the hydrogeochemical characters of groundwater the molar ratios of major anions and cations were used to evaluate the contribution of cation exchange processes during the weathering of rocks the percentage pollution of groundwater was calculated to determine the anthropogenic impacts to the groundwater the irrigation suitability of groundwater was examined based on sodium absorption ratio sar and percentage sodium na as calculated by the formulas 1 and 2 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 2 n a n a k 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k 3 results and discussion the maximum and minimum values of analyzed water quality parameters for 22 groundwater samples and 8 surface water samples are shown in table 1 the ph of groundwater samples varied from 6 5 to 8 1 with an average of 7 2 while it varied from 6 4 to 8 1 with an average of 7 5 in surface water samples the alkalinity of groundwater ranged from 85 4 to 879 mg l with an average value of 572 mg l alkalinity of surface water samples ranged from 61 to 842 mg l almost all groundwater samples except two exceeded the recommended alkalinity level for drinking purposes this may possibly due to dissolution of carbonates and phosphates minerals in groundwater anthropogenic activities such as cleaning and washing could also contribute to high alkalinity in surface water the electrical conductivity ec in groundwater samples varied from 6 7 to 11110 μs cm an exceptionally high ec value was recorded in a deep well sample mo 20 over 60 of studied wells exceeded the permissible levels of ec for drinking purposes recommended by the sri lanka standard institute slsi the total hardness of groundwater varied from 48 to 1980 mg l while significantly higher values 1300 mg l were recorded in a deep well and also in a shallow well 1980 mg l in the study area over 90 of groundwater samples exceeded the recommended maximum permissible level for total hardness for drinking purposes collected water samples were classified into different categories based on the total hardness fig 2 accordingly most groundwater samples collected from the study basin could be categorized under very hard category 300 mg l the total hardness of surface water samples varied from 44 to 248 mg l drinking hard water with high fluoride contents is suspected be a causative factor for high incidences of chronic kidney disease with uncertain etiology in the dry zone of sri lanka wickramarathna et al 2017 the cl and so4 2 content in groundwater samples varied between 18 to 432 mg l and 25 690 mg l respectively nearly 50 of groundwater samples exceeded the permissible level of cl for drinking purposes however only three groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible level for so4 2 leachates from fertilizers from paddy fields would add so4 2 into both surface and groundwater the nitrate n of groundwater in the study area varied from 0 4 to 13 mg l from which one shallow well showed significantly high nitrate n level 13 mg l the nitrite concentrations of groundwater samples varied from 0 003 to 0 030 mg l the sources of nitrite and nitrate inputs to groundwater are n fertilizers improper sewage discharges or leachates from pit latrines that are usually located in the overburden the phosphate content of groundwater varied between 0 18 0 84 mg l only one deep well mo24 showed a significantly higher phosphate level 1 97 mg l the fluoride content of groundwater in the region varied from 0 12 to 3 42 mg l about 80 of groundwater samples in the malala oya basin exceeded 0 5 mg l level that considered as the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water for sri lanka chandrajith et al 2012 the source of fluoride in groundwater is mainly due to leaching from metamorphic aquifer materials that are rich with fluoride bearing minerals such as micas and amphiboles dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 dental fluorosis is one of the common health problems among communities in the dry zone of sri lanka due to drinking of water with high fluoride content chandrajith et al 2012 ranasinghe et al 2019 metals in groundwater are received greater attention in recent years due to their higher toxicity and tendency of bioaccumulation weathering of rocks sewage discharge and leaching from other waste materials are the major sources of trace metals in water jain et al 2010 among studied metals the iron fe content in all groundwater samples of the basin was within the standard permissible level of 300 μg l who 2008 the mn level in the basin varied from 2 48 μg l to 2242 μg l with a mean of 268 μg l twenty three percent 23 of groundwater samples in the basin exceeded the permissible level of mn that is recommended for drinking water mn usually exists at low concentration in groundwater due to its geochemical control jain et al 2010 adverse effects on water supply structures and offensive taste in drinking water are possible impacts of high mn levels in groundwater the speciation of fe and mn is influenced by the redox characteristics of groundwater biswas et al 2012 hasan et al 2007 iron content in groundwater may induced by reduction of mn in the aqueous system leading to precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides appelo and postma 2005 dissolved organic matter doc in groundwater would also further facilitate the reductive dissolution processes that affect the content of dissolved fe in groundwater system bhattacharya et al 2002 the al content in groundwater samples in the basin varied from 7 68 μg l to 625 μg l with a mean value of 114 μg l the presence of high al levels in drinking water can induce a neurotoxic effect rajasooriyar et al 2013 the sr content of groundwater samples varied from 93 μg l to 2315 μg l with a median of 811 μg l while ba contents varied from 18 5 μg l to 673 μg l with a median value of 139 μg l lead pb content in the basin varied from 0 12 μg l to 12 1 μg l with a mean value of 1 39 μg l only one deep well showed a slightly higher pb content 12 1 μg l than the who recommended value of 10 μg l the arsenic as and cadmium cd contents in groundwater of the basin varied from 0 074 μg l to 0 65 μg l and from 0 055 μg l to 0 92 μg l respectively both as and cd contents in groundwater of the study area were several fold lower than the permissible levels the contents of other elements such as ni zn cu cr and hg in both groundwater and surface water from the malala oya basin were lower than the who recommended limits mercury is another important toxic element that has mainly of anthropogenic origin chandrajith et al 1995 matsunaga et al 1999 however in the malala oya basin hg levels recorded is very low and that varied from 0 001 to 0 056 μg l 3 1 geochemical evolution of groundwater the piper trilinear diagram is one of the widely used tools for identifying hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater based on major cations and anions ray and mukherjee 2008 accordingly water are classified into 6 major types as na cl type ca hco3 type ca na hco3 type ca mg cl type na hco3 type and ca cl type kumar 2013 based on the results obtained in this study the prominent water facies in the basin was ca mg cl type fig 3 majority 53 of deep well samples showed ca mg cl type while some wells were associated with ca hco3 and ca na hco3 types 86 shallow wells belonged to either na cl or ca na hco3 facies the results suggest a significant contribution of weathering of mica amphibole and pyroxenes in the high grade metamorphic rocks in the evolution of groundwater types in the basin as shown below dissolution of pyroxenes camg si2o6 4co2 6h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3 2si oh 4 dissolution of amphiboles ca2mg5si8o22 oh 2 14co2 22h2o 2ca2 5mg2 14hco3 8si oh 4 the relationships between major ions are generally used to identify the evolution of groundwater and their mixing mechanisms thilakerathne et al 2015 the molar ratio of na cl is widely used to evaluate silicate weathering seawater intrusion halite dissolution and ion exchange processes rubasinghe et al 2015 the na cl ratio of samples collected from the malala oya basin indicated that samples were scattered alone the 1 1 line fig 4 a the na cl molar ratio which is greater than 1 represents na is released to the groundwater by silicate weathering rubasinghe et al 2015 the ca mg molar ratio of all groundwater samples in the basin scattered very close to or below the 1 1 line fig 4b usually the ca mg ratio between 1 and 2 indicates calcite dissolution process while the molar ratio 2 indicates the silicate mineral dissolution processes thilakerathne et al 2015 the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 cl so4 2 showed a linear relationship fig 4c samples from the study area were scattered between 1 1 and 2 1 lines in the plot of hco3 vs ca2 mg2 fig 4d the groundwater samples that plotted above the 1 1 line indicate the weathering of silicate minerals abeywickarama et al 2016 these results suggest that weathering of silicate minerals are the major contributors of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of groundwater in the basin since there is no evidences for saline water intrusion and also absence of geothermal activities in the area silicate weathering is primarily responsible for major ions in the study groundwater 3 2 suitability of groundwater for irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is an important consideration in dry climatic regions of sri lanka since it is the main source of irrigation water higher levels of dissolved ions in irrigated water leads to physical and chemical damages of crops and soil ravikumar et al 2011 a plot of sodium hazard vs salinity hazard was used widely to evaluate the irrigation suitability of groundwater fig 5 in the study region most groundwater samples were scattered in the lower sodium and high salinity hazard zone groundwater belonging to these groups can be used for irrigation activities with proper salinity control anudu et al 2011 similar results were also obtained from the wilcox diagram that plot na against ec fig 6 accordingly groundwater from the study area plotted in good to permissible and also in doubtful to unsuitable regions nearly 36 of groundwater samples in the study area fall in good to permissible regions while 23 of samples were in doubt for unsuitable regions 3 3 isotope composition of groundwater environmental isotopes of δ18o and δ2h in ground and surface water are important traces that can be used to evaluate hydrological processes such as infiltration evaporation surface water groundwater interactions and rock weathering clark and fritz 2013 the δ18o and δ2h of groundwater in the malala oya river basin varied from 8 37 to 1 64 and from 54 70 to 9 93 respectively the surface water samples showed δ18o and δ2h values of 5 35 to 3 01 and 34 28 to 17 08 respectively table 3 fig 7 groundwater isotopes in the region were plotted on the regression line gwl denoted by δ2h 6 97δ18o 5 53 r2 0 915 the local meteoric water line lmwl for the southern dry zone was estimated using the data available at the international atomic energy agency http isohis iaea org for hambantota meteorological station that located close to the malala oya basin fig 1 the lmwl for the study basin is represented by δ2h 8 01δ18o 12 r2 0 848 the isotope composition of surface water from the basin represent the evaporation line el of δ2h 6 48δ18o 0 09 deep wells sample in the study region were plotted along the lmwl indicating a direct recharge from the monsoon rain however the deviation of shallow wells from the lmwl indicates the intensive evaporation under prevailing dry conditions in the basin the confluence point of gwl and lmwl represents the rainfall index of the northeast monsoon the average isotopic composition of the northeast monsoon rain is 6 01 for δ18o and 36 7 for δ2h edirisinghe et al 2017 these evidences suggest that the main source of groundwater in the basin is the monsoon rain however it is evident that isotope composition is modified due to high rate of evaporation particularly in the shallow regolith aquifers the enriched isotope composition of shallow groundwater could have been attributed to mixing with surface water two groundwater samples mo03 and mo24 showed the most depleted isotope value with high ec 5224 μs cm value the most depleted isotope compositions can be expected from higher elevation recharge poage and chamberlain 2001 thus deep groundwater would have recharged from rains in the highland regions located adjacent to the study area the high ec values in these deep groundwater samples would be due to the dissolution of minerals in its flow path to evaluate approximate resident time of groundwater tritium 3h with 12 32 years of half life was adapted in this study three deep wells were selected to measure the tritium contents the observed 3h values were below the detection limit of the counter 0 3 tu the mean 3h value in rainwater in colombo is approximately 1 tu during 2009 2011 period chandrajith et al 2014 the observed tritium values of deep groundwater samples indicate a prolonged retention time with very low recharge in comparison to tritium values of the rain water 4 conclusions in this study geochemical and environmental isotope evidences were used to characterize water resources in the malala oya river basin higher ec and hardness were the main characteristics of the malala oya river basin over 90 of groundwater samples exceeded the recommended levels of alkalinity 200 mg l while nearly 50 groundwater samples exceeding recommended cl level of drinking water nitrate n and phosphate concentrations were within the acceptable limits in majority of samples however the fluoride concentrations of groundwater were significantly higher and probably causing adverse health effects the dominant water types in the basin were in the order of ca mg cl ca hco3 ca na hco3 na cl the results of this study indicate that silicate weathering is the leading process that controls the groundwater geochemistry while significant contributions are also made from ion exchange processes and carbonate dissolution irrigation suitability calculations of groundwater indicated a low sodium hazard condition in the malala basin isotope of oxygen and hydrogen of surface water indicated effects of intensive evaporation while most shallow and deep water is directly recharged from local rainfall however some of the deep groundwater is being recharged by meteoric water that seep through hard rock fracture systems possibly from nearby highland region

12213,it is a well known fact that the indian groundwater is polluted by fluoride however for the first time in india non carcinogenic risk assessments and meta analysis of fluoride exposure to humans were carried out due to consumption of groundwater in this context we collected fluoride concentration data in groundwater across india by systematic searches conducted in various international search engines databases here we demonstrated a detailed meta analysis and meta regression of fluoride and evaluated health risk assessment for this purpose meta analysis of 63 studies on fluoride in groundwater in india comprising 57381 samples are included we found that 1 the pooled concentration of fluoride in india is around 2 37 mg l with 95 confident interval 1 46 3 28 mg l which is higher than who and national standards limit of 1 5 mg l 2 the meta analysis of data suggests that in rural parts of the country fluoride concentration is 1 85 times higher than urban areas 3 the concentration of fluoride in groundwater decreased significantly p 0 05 with increase in rainfall and longitude the risk assessment via oral and dermal route exposure reveals that the consumers in majority of the regions are at considerable non carcinogenic risk and children are at higher risk than adults total hazard quotient 1 the findings are helpful in identifying the affected areas of india and we recommend that the safer options of drinking water should be adopted graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride contamination meta analysis risk assessment non carcinogenic fluorosis india 1 introduction nearly 85 population of india relies on the groundwater for drinking world bank report 2012 and therefore groundwater quality becomes an important issue to be tackled separately groundwater in india was assumed to be generally safe and widely used for drinking without proper risk assessment this perception is contrary to many researches that highlighted pollution of groundwater through various geo genic and anthropogenic means shekhar and sarkar 2013 sarkar et al 2016 saha et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 fluoride contamination in groundwater is one of the major rising concerns that have shown its adverse effects in every continent across the globe many studies have highlighted the fluoride related health problems such as dental and skeletal fluorosis in humans which in turn have serious socio economic implications ali et al 2016 the fluoride level in groundwater above who 2011 standard limits were observed throughout the globe though the higher concentrations are mainly confined to arid and semi arid regions ali et al 2016 the who s maximum permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water meets the national standard limit and is confined to 1 5 mg l in drinking water concentration of fluoride beyond 1 5 mg l by either geogenic or anthropogenic means has been classified as fluoride pollution of groundwater shekhar 2017 fluorine f belongs to the halogen group and is characterized as the lightest and most electronegative element in the periodic table saxena and ahmed 2001 ali et al 2016 fluoride concentration is abundant in the earth s crust i e approx 625 mg kg and occurs as a negatively charged fluoride ion f in water ali et al 2016 f enrichment in groundwater is mainly attributed to the presence of various fluorine bearing minerals namely fluorite cryolite topaz apatite amphiboles micas sellaite villiamite and certain clays daneshpooy et al 2018 yousefi et al 2018a the f bearing minerals such as fluorite biotite and amphiboles are some of the geo genic sources while industrial wastes use of extensive fertilizers and brick kilns are examples of the anthropogenic sources ali et al 2016 moreover f level in groundwater varies considerably due to various factors such as lithology residence time dilution local pollution and seasons dhadge et al 2018 f enrichment in groundwater is mainly controlled by groundwater circulation hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer various geochemical processes li et al 2014 and f bearing minerals saxena and ahmed 2001 jacks et al 2005 ali et al 2016 yousefi et al 2018b although the f level below 1 mg l is required for making teeth enamels but ingestion of higher levels will cause dental fluorosis and in the long term can lead to skeletal fluorosis ali et al 2016 2018 sezgin et al 2018 the possibility of exposure to dental and skeletal fluorosis is very high in india as huge population in india ingests f polluted groundwater dehbandi et al 2018 recently observed that the nature of soils played a greater role in releasing f into the groundwater than the country rocks the authors also insisted on the proper study of f using mineralogical and geochemical analyses to determine the mobilization of f in the geochemical cycle detailed analysis of f in groundwater have been widely studied amini et al 2008 battaleb looie et al 2012 li et al 2014 saha et al 2016 ali et al 2016 2018 dehbandi et al 2018 podgorski et al 2018 and various defluoridation methods have also been discussed elaborately mohapatra et al 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a and 2015b the objective of this study was to evaluate health risk assessment due to f pollution of groundwater by performing meta analysis and meta regression approaches in context of india thus we conducted meta analysis of data to understand the problem deeply and evaluated non carcinogenic health risk assessment due to ingestion of f contaminated groundwater in india 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design a systematic review was conducted in accordance with the cochrane protocols higgins and green 2011 keramati et al 2018 and the search was performed based on the guidelines of prisma fig 1 liberati et al 2009 from overall 792 papers collected 496 papers were excluded in the first identification step because of repetition observed in endnote software in the screening step according to titles and abstracts 296 papers were further selected as probably suitable finally after evaluating for eligibility criteria 63 papers comprising about 57381 samples were taken into consideration for the mata analysis and meta regression fig 1 the studies were performed on the rural urban and semi urban rural and urban regions the aquifers in india are widely variable and the paper included for this work were conducted on diverse aquifers 2 2 collection of data a systematic search was conducted to obtain maximum research papers on f concentration in groundwater of india the search was conducted in three main international databases such as embase scopus and pubmed various keywords were used while searching the relevant papers such as 1 fluoride 2 fluoride in india 3 drinking water 4 tap water 5 groundwater 6 halogens etc to obtain the missing papers references lists of collected papers were again reviewed in detail the search was performed across databases from 1 january 1983 to 15 july 2018 233 papers were excluded because 1 paper was not in english language 2 are reviewed articles workshop theses books animal studies clinical trial study case reports and experimental study 3 were not cross sectional descriptive study and or 4 studied and analysed other water resources 2 3 inclusion and exclusion criteria inclusion criteria for selections of research papers as applied were a full text articles in english language b study conducted on concentration of f in groundwater c descriptive studies d must contain information like reported mean and or range concentration of f other materials such as reviewed articles thesis clinical studies case reports animal studies f concentration in surface water and other water resources experimental studies were excluded from this study for analysis 2 4 selection of studies and data extraction for this work descriptive studies on the concentration of f in groundwater from various localities in india were selected for performing meta analyses meta regression and health risk assessment data were extracted from the studies and characterized into various subgroups such as published year sampling start and end time sample size average concentration standard deviation fluoride range location state name longitude and latitude type of location ph of groundwater and average annual rainfall table 1 2 5 health risk assessment the estimation of the pooled concentration of f in groundwater was performed using mean and standard error se quan and zhang 2003 higgins et al 2008 precision of studies depends on se borenstein et al 2011a and was calculated by using following equation se sd n where sd is standard deviation and n is sample size it was observed that the statistical weight of the studies decreases with increased se hedges et al 1999 hence weight of study wi was calculated by following equation wi 1 se2 further the relative weight rw was calculated by equation given by hedges et al in year 1999 rw wi w x 100 where w is summation of wi chi square i2 test was conducted to detect heterogeneity i2 the ratio of true heterogeneity to total observed variation index is the extent of variance dividing difference q a measure of weighted squared deviations value among studies in the present study i2 index was higher than 50 therefore heterogeneity is considerable higgins and thompson 2002 thus random effect model rem was used for meta analysis according to defined subgroups kuroki et al 2017 for meta regression concentration of f in groundwater latitude and longitude study year and average annual rainfall were conducted using the method of moment for both linear and non linear model borenstein et al 2011b the calculated statistical difference was significant p 0 05 2 6 risk assessment estimation of daily intake edi due to exposure of f rich groundwater from oral edioral and dermal edidermal routes were calculated using following equations nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 edioral c x ir x ef x ed bw x at edidermal c x sa x kp x f x ets x ef x ed x 10 3 bw x at where c is the weighted average f concentration in groundwater mg l and all other parameters used are presented in table 2 hazard quotient hq was calculated through nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 and epa 2011 hqoral edioral rfdoral hqdermal edidermal rfddermal where rfdoral is oral reference dose dermal reference dose was calculated by nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 and epa 2011 rfddermal rfdoral x absgi where rfddermal is reference dose of dermal exposure absgi is gastrointestinal absorption factor total hazard quotient thq was calculated by using following equation nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 epa 2011 thq hqoral hqdermal if thq 1 exposed population are not at adverse health risk but thq 1 indicates significant adverse health risk in our study 95 percentile of thq for both adults and children were taken up as criterion for health risk assessment 3 results and discussion 3 1 meta analysis of data the mean concentration of f in groundwater from various regions in india are presented in fig 2 it was found that the states such as madhya pradesh 5 98 mg l punjab 4 67 mg l chattisgarh 3 80 mg l rajasthan 3 30 mg l karnataka 2 56 mg l andhra pradesh 2 03 mg l maharashtra 1 70 mg l haryana 1 65 mg l telangana 1 64 mg l uttar pradesh 1 63 mg l and bihar 1 54 mg l have f concentration higher than the maximum permissible limits prescribed by bis and who i e 1 5 mg l all these high values are directly linked to the geology of the aquifers and are linked to arid and semi arid regions the calculated pooled concentration of f in india was 2 37 mg l 95 ci 1 46 3 28 mg l which is higher than the national and who standard limit table 3 the concentration of f in groundwater based on the average annual rainfall in india is presented in table 4 the low and high concentration of f were observed in localities having average annual rainfall more than 1000 and less than 500 mm y respectively table 4 this may be attributed to the dilution due to recharge of aquifers through rainfall the meta analysis concentration of f in groundwater based on region is shown in table 5 it was found that the concentration of f in the urban regions 1 29 mg l 95 ci 1 1 52 mg l are lower than rural localities 2 33 mg l 95 ci 1 91 2 89 mg l significantly p 0 05 although in this study the weight of urban region is only 18 76 3 2 meta regression 3 2 1 with longitude meta regression concentration of f in groundwater with longitude in linear mode using moment s method is presented in fig 3 meta regression shows that with increase in longitude concentration of f decreased significantly c 0 22 p 0 005 fig 3 it is clear from fig 4 that a significant positive correlation was observed on a plot of average rain and longitude fig 4 hence lower f concentration may be due to low f content in the geological formations fawell et al 2006 and or higher rain in the eastern regions simpkins 2017 but a strong conclusion cannot be drawn because of the fact that little is known about the eastern part and thus more studies are required 3 2 2 with latitude meta regression concentration of f in groundwater with latitude in linear mode using moments method is presented in fig 5 meta regression shows the concentration of f with latitude of regions does not show significant regression in the both linear and non linear models p 0 05 fig 5 3 2 3 with average rainfall meta regression of data on f concentration in groundwater with average rain is presented in fig 6 meta regression exhibits that concentration of f in groundwater decreased with increase in average rainfall significantly c 0 002 p 0 01 fig 6 one of the interesting result we observed was positive correlation between rainfall and longitude and indicates that with increased longitude average rain increased c 72 53 p 0 001 fig 4 further we observed negative correlation of f concentration in groundwater with rainfall thus we can infer that concentration of f decreases with increased longitude 3 3 risk assessment non carcinogenic risk assessment in the adults and children consumers due to oral and dermal exposure is shown in fig 7 thq in both adults and children in the states of madhya pradesh punjab chhattisgarh rajasthan karnataka and andhra pradesh was higher than 1 therefore consumers are at considerable risk fig 7 whereas children were at considerable risk thq 1 in bihar maharashtra haryana telangana uttar pradesh odisha and tamil nadu but adults are in safe range thq 1 thq values from the available data in both adults and children in other states were lower than 1 therefore consumers are in the health safe range it was found that the thq in the children is 1 97 times higher than adults consumers which is due to lower body weight nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 epa 2011 however it must be kept in mind that this assessment is based on the data used for this study and is likely to change with new discovery of f polluted aquifers which might not have been rigorously researched it is required especially with respect to delhi which has arid to semi arid climate and the aquifers are vulnerable to f pollution 4 conclusions in the present study meta analysis and meta regression were performed on the f concentration in groundwater of india and non carcinogenic risk in the adults and children were estimated the calculated pooled concentration of f in groundwater of india was higher than the national and who standard limit this study revealed that the concentration of f in groundwater in rural areas is 1 85 times higher than urban region it was observed that with increase in rainfall and longitude concentration of f in groundwater decreased significantly p 0 05 the results of the risk assessment indicate that both adults and children consumers in the majority of states of india are at considerable non carcinogenic risk but children are more exposed to fluorosis due to low body weight hence it is strongly recommended that f concentration reduction programs especially in low rainfall regions should be implemented options of drinking water with f concentration below

12213,it is a well known fact that the indian groundwater is polluted by fluoride however for the first time in india non carcinogenic risk assessments and meta analysis of fluoride exposure to humans were carried out due to consumption of groundwater in this context we collected fluoride concentration data in groundwater across india by systematic searches conducted in various international search engines databases here we demonstrated a detailed meta analysis and meta regression of fluoride and evaluated health risk assessment for this purpose meta analysis of 63 studies on fluoride in groundwater in india comprising 57381 samples are included we found that 1 the pooled concentration of fluoride in india is around 2 37 mg l with 95 confident interval 1 46 3 28 mg l which is higher than who and national standards limit of 1 5 mg l 2 the meta analysis of data suggests that in rural parts of the country fluoride concentration is 1 85 times higher than urban areas 3 the concentration of fluoride in groundwater decreased significantly p 0 05 with increase in rainfall and longitude the risk assessment via oral and dermal route exposure reveals that the consumers in majority of the regions are at considerable non carcinogenic risk and children are at higher risk than adults total hazard quotient 1 the findings are helpful in identifying the affected areas of india and we recommend that the safer options of drinking water should be adopted graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride contamination meta analysis risk assessment non carcinogenic fluorosis india 1 introduction nearly 85 population of india relies on the groundwater for drinking world bank report 2012 and therefore groundwater quality becomes an important issue to be tackled separately groundwater in india was assumed to be generally safe and widely used for drinking without proper risk assessment this perception is contrary to many researches that highlighted pollution of groundwater through various geo genic and anthropogenic means shekhar and sarkar 2013 sarkar et al 2016 saha et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 fluoride contamination in groundwater is one of the major rising concerns that have shown its adverse effects in every continent across the globe many studies have highlighted the fluoride related health problems such as dental and skeletal fluorosis in humans which in turn have serious socio economic implications ali et al 2016 the fluoride level in groundwater above who 2011 standard limits were observed throughout the globe though the higher concentrations are mainly confined to arid and semi arid regions ali et al 2016 the who s maximum permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water meets the national standard limit and is confined to 1 5 mg l in drinking water concentration of fluoride beyond 1 5 mg l by either geogenic or anthropogenic means has been classified as fluoride pollution of groundwater shekhar 2017 fluorine f belongs to the halogen group and is characterized as the lightest and most electronegative element in the periodic table saxena and ahmed 2001 ali et al 2016 fluoride concentration is abundant in the earth s crust i e approx 625 mg kg and occurs as a negatively charged fluoride ion f in water ali et al 2016 f enrichment in groundwater is mainly attributed to the presence of various fluorine bearing minerals namely fluorite cryolite topaz apatite amphiboles micas sellaite villiamite and certain clays daneshpooy et al 2018 yousefi et al 2018a the f bearing minerals such as fluorite biotite and amphiboles are some of the geo genic sources while industrial wastes use of extensive fertilizers and brick kilns are examples of the anthropogenic sources ali et al 2016 moreover f level in groundwater varies considerably due to various factors such as lithology residence time dilution local pollution and seasons dhadge et al 2018 f enrichment in groundwater is mainly controlled by groundwater circulation hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer various geochemical processes li et al 2014 and f bearing minerals saxena and ahmed 2001 jacks et al 2005 ali et al 2016 yousefi et al 2018b although the f level below 1 mg l is required for making teeth enamels but ingestion of higher levels will cause dental fluorosis and in the long term can lead to skeletal fluorosis ali et al 2016 2018 sezgin et al 2018 the possibility of exposure to dental and skeletal fluorosis is very high in india as huge population in india ingests f polluted groundwater dehbandi et al 2018 recently observed that the nature of soils played a greater role in releasing f into the groundwater than the country rocks the authors also insisted on the proper study of f using mineralogical and geochemical analyses to determine the mobilization of f in the geochemical cycle detailed analysis of f in groundwater have been widely studied amini et al 2008 battaleb looie et al 2012 li et al 2014 saha et al 2016 ali et al 2016 2018 dehbandi et al 2018 podgorski et al 2018 and various defluoridation methods have also been discussed elaborately mohapatra et al 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a and 2015b the objective of this study was to evaluate health risk assessment due to f pollution of groundwater by performing meta analysis and meta regression approaches in context of india thus we conducted meta analysis of data to understand the problem deeply and evaluated non carcinogenic health risk assessment due to ingestion of f contaminated groundwater in india 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design a systematic review was conducted in accordance with the cochrane protocols higgins and green 2011 keramati et al 2018 and the search was performed based on the guidelines of prisma fig 1 liberati et al 2009 from overall 792 papers collected 496 papers were excluded in the first identification step because of repetition observed in endnote software in the screening step according to titles and abstracts 296 papers were further selected as probably suitable finally after evaluating for eligibility criteria 63 papers comprising about 57381 samples were taken into consideration for the mata analysis and meta regression fig 1 the studies were performed on the rural urban and semi urban rural and urban regions the aquifers in india are widely variable and the paper included for this work were conducted on diverse aquifers 2 2 collection of data a systematic search was conducted to obtain maximum research papers on f concentration in groundwater of india the search was conducted in three main international databases such as embase scopus and pubmed various keywords were used while searching the relevant papers such as 1 fluoride 2 fluoride in india 3 drinking water 4 tap water 5 groundwater 6 halogens etc to obtain the missing papers references lists of collected papers were again reviewed in detail the search was performed across databases from 1 january 1983 to 15 july 2018 233 papers were excluded because 1 paper was not in english language 2 are reviewed articles workshop theses books animal studies clinical trial study case reports and experimental study 3 were not cross sectional descriptive study and or 4 studied and analysed other water resources 2 3 inclusion and exclusion criteria inclusion criteria for selections of research papers as applied were a full text articles in english language b study conducted on concentration of f in groundwater c descriptive studies d must contain information like reported mean and or range concentration of f other materials such as reviewed articles thesis clinical studies case reports animal studies f concentration in surface water and other water resources experimental studies were excluded from this study for analysis 2 4 selection of studies and data extraction for this work descriptive studies on the concentration of f in groundwater from various localities in india were selected for performing meta analyses meta regression and health risk assessment data were extracted from the studies and characterized into various subgroups such as published year sampling start and end time sample size average concentration standard deviation fluoride range location state name longitude and latitude type of location ph of groundwater and average annual rainfall table 1 2 5 health risk assessment the estimation of the pooled concentration of f in groundwater was performed using mean and standard error se quan and zhang 2003 higgins et al 2008 precision of studies depends on se borenstein et al 2011a and was calculated by using following equation se sd n where sd is standard deviation and n is sample size it was observed that the statistical weight of the studies decreases with increased se hedges et al 1999 hence weight of study wi was calculated by following equation wi 1 se2 further the relative weight rw was calculated by equation given by hedges et al in year 1999 rw wi w x 100 where w is summation of wi chi square i2 test was conducted to detect heterogeneity i2 the ratio of true heterogeneity to total observed variation index is the extent of variance dividing difference q a measure of weighted squared deviations value among studies in the present study i2 index was higher than 50 therefore heterogeneity is considerable higgins and thompson 2002 thus random effect model rem was used for meta analysis according to defined subgroups kuroki et al 2017 for meta regression concentration of f in groundwater latitude and longitude study year and average annual rainfall were conducted using the method of moment for both linear and non linear model borenstein et al 2011b the calculated statistical difference was significant p 0 05 2 6 risk assessment estimation of daily intake edi due to exposure of f rich groundwater from oral edioral and dermal edidermal routes were calculated using following equations nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 edioral c x ir x ef x ed bw x at edidermal c x sa x kp x f x ets x ef x ed x 10 3 bw x at where c is the weighted average f concentration in groundwater mg l and all other parameters used are presented in table 2 hazard quotient hq was calculated through nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 and epa 2011 hqoral edioral rfdoral hqdermal edidermal rfddermal where rfdoral is oral reference dose dermal reference dose was calculated by nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 and epa 2011 rfddermal rfdoral x absgi where rfddermal is reference dose of dermal exposure absgi is gastrointestinal absorption factor total hazard quotient thq was calculated by using following equation nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 epa 2011 thq hqoral hqdermal if thq 1 exposed population are not at adverse health risk but thq 1 indicates significant adverse health risk in our study 95 percentile of thq for both adults and children were taken up as criterion for health risk assessment 3 results and discussion 3 1 meta analysis of data the mean concentration of f in groundwater from various regions in india are presented in fig 2 it was found that the states such as madhya pradesh 5 98 mg l punjab 4 67 mg l chattisgarh 3 80 mg l rajasthan 3 30 mg l karnataka 2 56 mg l andhra pradesh 2 03 mg l maharashtra 1 70 mg l haryana 1 65 mg l telangana 1 64 mg l uttar pradesh 1 63 mg l and bihar 1 54 mg l have f concentration higher than the maximum permissible limits prescribed by bis and who i e 1 5 mg l all these high values are directly linked to the geology of the aquifers and are linked to arid and semi arid regions the calculated pooled concentration of f in india was 2 37 mg l 95 ci 1 46 3 28 mg l which is higher than the national and who standard limit table 3 the concentration of f in groundwater based on the average annual rainfall in india is presented in table 4 the low and high concentration of f were observed in localities having average annual rainfall more than 1000 and less than 500 mm y respectively table 4 this may be attributed to the dilution due to recharge of aquifers through rainfall the meta analysis concentration of f in groundwater based on region is shown in table 5 it was found that the concentration of f in the urban regions 1 29 mg l 95 ci 1 1 52 mg l are lower than rural localities 2 33 mg l 95 ci 1 91 2 89 mg l significantly p 0 05 although in this study the weight of urban region is only 18 76 3 2 meta regression 3 2 1 with longitude meta regression concentration of f in groundwater with longitude in linear mode using moment s method is presented in fig 3 meta regression shows that with increase in longitude concentration of f decreased significantly c 0 22 p 0 005 fig 3 it is clear from fig 4 that a significant positive correlation was observed on a plot of average rain and longitude fig 4 hence lower f concentration may be due to low f content in the geological formations fawell et al 2006 and or higher rain in the eastern regions simpkins 2017 but a strong conclusion cannot be drawn because of the fact that little is known about the eastern part and thus more studies are required 3 2 2 with latitude meta regression concentration of f in groundwater with latitude in linear mode using moments method is presented in fig 5 meta regression shows the concentration of f with latitude of regions does not show significant regression in the both linear and non linear models p 0 05 fig 5 3 2 3 with average rainfall meta regression of data on f concentration in groundwater with average rain is presented in fig 6 meta regression exhibits that concentration of f in groundwater decreased with increase in average rainfall significantly c 0 002 p 0 01 fig 6 one of the interesting result we observed was positive correlation between rainfall and longitude and indicates that with increased longitude average rain increased c 72 53 p 0 001 fig 4 further we observed negative correlation of f concentration in groundwater with rainfall thus we can infer that concentration of f decreases with increased longitude 3 3 risk assessment non carcinogenic risk assessment in the adults and children consumers due to oral and dermal exposure is shown in fig 7 thq in both adults and children in the states of madhya pradesh punjab chhattisgarh rajasthan karnataka and andhra pradesh was higher than 1 therefore consumers are at considerable risk fig 7 whereas children were at considerable risk thq 1 in bihar maharashtra haryana telangana uttar pradesh odisha and tamil nadu but adults are in safe range thq 1 thq values from the available data in both adults and children in other states were lower than 1 therefore consumers are in the health safe range it was found that the thq in the children is 1 97 times higher than adults consumers which is due to lower body weight nazaroff and alvarez cohen 2001 epa 2011 however it must be kept in mind that this assessment is based on the data used for this study and is likely to change with new discovery of f polluted aquifers which might not have been rigorously researched it is required especially with respect to delhi which has arid to semi arid climate and the aquifers are vulnerable to f pollution 4 conclusions in the present study meta analysis and meta regression were performed on the f concentration in groundwater of india and non carcinogenic risk in the adults and children were estimated the calculated pooled concentration of f in groundwater of india was higher than the national and who standard limit this study revealed that the concentration of f in groundwater in rural areas is 1 85 times higher than urban region it was observed that with increase in rainfall and longitude concentration of f in groundwater decreased significantly p 0 05 the results of the risk assessment indicate that both adults and children consumers in the majority of states of india are at considerable non carcinogenic risk but children are more exposed to fluorosis due to low body weight hence it is strongly recommended that f concentration reduction programs especially in low rainfall regions should be implemented options of drinking water with f concentration below permissible limit must be provided to specific regions of the highly affected states acknowledgments it is duly acknowledged that the present work is a part of ph d of first author sa sa thanks

12214,several approaches for ion exchange process iep evaluation and water type identification have widely been developed during the last several decades however a lack of clear methodology to characterise iep and water type remains a problem in this paper a novel hybrid approach is proposed to understand this deficiency determine iep accurately identify hydrogeochemical facies precisely that characterise each hydrogeochemical signature of aquifer salinization and freshening discriminate between humid and arid areas and investigate ca2 mg2 enrichment processes which may be accompanied with iep and would have not explained using other conventional methods this new method termed iep sf ha wt combines three techniques hierarchical cluster analysis hca new hydrochemical analysis and correlation analysis it is applied on ten physicochemical variables for 214 municipal wells belonging to gaza coastal aquifer system gaza strip palestine to test its reliability and imputation ability the results demonstrate that the new hybrid method performs well in discrimination between areas of reverse and direct iep it shows the dominance of iep and the wide impact of reverse iep as a result of the wide ranging influence of seawater intrusion saltwater up coning and sewage inputs similarly it illuminates the impact of direct iep and carbonate dissolution on the groundwater of the northern area it reveals the predominance of na cl 65 4 ca mg hco3 no3 15 9 na hco3 8 4 ca mg cl 8 and the existence of a unique ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 in the northern area as a result of the influence of fertilizer inputs in this area moreover it elucidates the humidity of the northern area due to rainfall recharge irrigation return flow and partially treated sewage infiltration therefore the implication of this multi beneficial approach can be widely used for precise and detailed hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater in the gaza coastal aquifer system as well as for other similar aquifer systems elsewhere around the world graphical abstract image 1 keywords hierarchical cluster analysis correlation analysis hybrid hydrogeochemical approach iep sf ha wt plot 1 introduction groundwater is the main key element for the sustainable development of the communities keesari et al 2016 mukate et al 2017 especially in arid to semi arid mediterranean countries argamasilla et al 2017 mountadar et al 2018 soumaia et al 2018 where fresh surface water resources are limited and population over growth is increasing rapidly it is considered as a sustainable and reliable resource for residential farming and industrial uses abu alnaeem et al 2018 flem et al 2018 sheikhy et al 2018 due to its natural quality and quantity consistent temperature and huge storage amount mukate et al 2017 commonly in coastal aquifers the original chemical composition of groundwater may be exposed to high modifications as a result of the joint effects of anthropogenic and geogenic factors flem et al 2018 jia et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 these modifications can happen through rock water interactions processes such as ion exchange process iep and soluble mineral dissolution precipitation processes monjerezi 2012 puig et al 2017 pulido leboeuf 2004 iep is considered as one of the major natural providers of the groundwater chemical components and may control groundwater chemistry of aquifer systems argamasilla et al 2017 chidambaram et al 2013 zaidi et al 2015 iep usually occurs during water flow through clay or clay rich sediments these sediments are widespread in soils and aquifer systems and are characterized by high ability in exchanging their cations with cations present in water reddy 2013 walter et al 2017 iep commonly happens in aquifer systems which are exposed to salinization and or freshening processes abu alnaeem et al 2018 slama and bouhlila 2017 it is commonly used as an indicator for salinization and freshening processes the dynamics of seawater intrusion and the evolution of groundwater chemistry abu alnaeem et al 2018 reddy 2013 in spite of the fact many approaches for iep evaluation have been used a lack of clear methodology to characterise iep remains a problem this research provides a reasonable discussion of the deficiency in iep characterization in aquifers it highlights the need for further methods to characterise this hydrogeochemical process beyond the typical indices which are based on ionic ratios this new interated approach nia of multivariate statistical hydrogeochemical and correlation analyses is developed to characterise the iep beyond the typical indices to evaluate the type and degree of iep to identify 32 water types delineate 8 degrees of salinization freshening processes to distinguish between humid and arid areas and to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes of ca2 mg2 enrichment which may accompany iep this approach is applied on the gaza coastal aquifer which is characterized by a high and complex salinity and located in an over populated and extremely water starved coastal area that is influenced by the diversity of anthropogenic and natural factors and processes abu alnaeem et al 2018 natural factors include mineral dissolution seawater intrusion salt water up coning and impact of adjacent aquifers while anthropogenic factors comprise improper sewage disposal intensive farming activities and unplanned urban expansion jia et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 this widespread presence of activities may cause high chemical modifications in groundwater quality in gaza strip applying this nia can be a beneficial tool for an effective groundwater chemistry management of gaza coastal aquifer system and other similar aquifer systems 2 area of study 2 1 geographical and climatic settings the investigated area is a narrow elongated land that is located in the south western part of the mediterranean coastal plain of palestine encompassing an area of 365 km2 fig 1 its population is among the most rapidly growing in the world around 5500 capita km2 pcbs 2015 the surface freshwater is scarce and the only water resource for residential and agricultural purposes is groundwater gaza strip is characterized by semi arid temperate mediterranean sea climate with mild winter and dry hot summer the temperature is generally moderate ranging from 22 c to 33 c in august and from 6 c to 15 c in january the rainfall season extends from october until april with the highest precipitation in january around 105 mm the annual rainfall is limited and ranges from 200 mm year in the south to 400 mm year in the north with an average of 327 mm year the rainfall is considered as the main source of groundwater recharge the yearly potential average of evaporation is uneven and ranges from 2 1 mm d in december to 6 3 mm d in july the study area is generally characterized by frequent droughts and lack of rainfall in addition the high rate of evaporation reduces the chance of recharge with rainfall 2 2 geological and hydrological settings the geology of the gaza strip consists of pleistocene and holocene age deposits called kurkar group it is composed of sand quartz rich calcareous sandstone and silt kurkar formation that is interlayered with pleistocene marine clays and red clay loam hamra formation issar 1968 the kurkar group overlies chalks of eocene age at the eastern side of the study area and thick layers of marls marine shales and clays about 400 to 1000 m of miocene pliocene age called saqiya group to the middle and western side of the study area the geological map of gaza strip as modified by sneh et al 1998 is presented in fig 1 this map shows the geological formations of the gaza coastal region these sedimentary rocks and deposits consist of calcareous sandstone sand dunes silt clay and gravel the general slope of these formations is toward the mediterranean sea fig 2 the gaza coastal aquifer which is a shallow unconfined aquifer is recharged by the limited rainfall through the areas of sand dunes calcareous sandstone and sandy loam in the central and western parts of the aquifer in the eastern part of the aquifer rainfall percolation is restricted by the occurrence of thick deposits of loess soils up to 20 m depth with low hydraulic conductivity in this area weinthal et al 2005 the surface water system in the study area is represented by three wadis which are almost dried out unfortunately these wadis have become places for sewage discharge and solid waste dumping from surrounding residential areas the coastal aquifer is located along the mediterranean coast from the north of the sinai peninsula in egypt to the foothill of mount carmel at the southward of gaza strip zilberbrand et al 2001 it varies in width from 7 km in the north to 20 km in the south the gaza strip and its aquifer are located in the southern part of the coastal aquifer next to the present coastline the kurkar group sequence reaches an average thickness of 100 120 m in the south and 180 200 m in the north wedging gradually out to the east towards the foothills of the judea and samaria mountains to a few meters vengosh et al 2005 zilberbrand et al 2001 a 3 d conceptual model for the hydrogeological situation of the gaza coastal aquifer and the surrounding region modified after melloul and azmon 1997 mercado 1980 and weinberger et al 1994 is depicted in fig 2 hydro stratigraphically the presence of clay layers splits the aquifer vertically into four sub aquifers a b1 b2 and c yakirevich et al 1998 the hydraulic connection between them with the sea is not well understood this subdivision continues along the coastal strip but disperses 4 6 km to the east of the coastline vengosh et al 2005 weinthal et al 2005 along the eastern side the third ridge of the kurkar group sequence is dissected randomly by impervious to semi impervious layers and lenses as a whole gaza coastal aquifer can be considered as one hydrogeological unit generally most of the water is abstracted from the upper 30 40 m of the shallow area of the aquifer in the study area groundwater wells are highly dense mostly with high rates of production and often located near the sea especially in the northern part of the region abu alnaeem et al 2018 historically natural groundwater flow is toward the sea the groundwater over pumping causes a big shortage in water balance pwa 2014 thus the water table showed two huge regional cones of depression in the northern 5 m and southern 19 m areas relative to mean sea level that trigger seawater intrusion causing a serious aquifer salinization pwa 2014 based on a previous study it is found that the highest salinity as tds areas are recorded along the coastline up to 19000 mg l and the inland areas as scattered plumes up to 6000 7000 mg l abu alnaeem et al 2018 fig 3 this distribution is attributed to the high influence of seawater intrusion and or saltwater up coning on the study area results from the impact of heavy pumping these hydraulic conditions accelerate the lateral movement of eocene brackish water from the eastern side moreover the impact of intensive human activities such as sewage infiltration and farming inputs contribute to the deterioration of groundwater quality and increase the salinity in the study area on the other hand the lowest values of tds less than 1000 mg l are recorded inland in the northern and southern parts within a very limited area 45 km2 12 3 in the gaza strip evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall consequently the soluble salts of caco3 accumulate in soils shomar et al 2005 the higher rate of precipitation in the northern area is enough to leach soluble salts from soil moreover loess soils containing calcite gypsum and halite could be a source of salinization vengosh et al 2005 3 methodology the existing ten physicochemical variables tds ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and ph for 219 wells have been collected from the palestinian water authority pwa and are analyzed statistically using stata se 12 software and hydrogeochemically using aquachem 4 2 software 3 1 data preparation clustering process may be adversely affected by data outliers brink et al 2007 so it is better to identify and separate outliers as a precondition for multivariate statistical analysis five outliers were excluded and the number of wells reduced to 214 wells the concentrations of various chemical data are changed from mg l to meq l to be checked for charge balance only those water samples whose difference of anion cation balance is within 5 are used in this study to combine the various ions in a chemically meaningful method nwankwoala and udom 2011 log transformation is performed on skewed data to generate a normal distribution of it this step is the prerequisite of multivariate statistical analysis for better confidence in the outputs and interpretations davis and sampson 1986 güler et al 2002 wang et al 2015 data standardization is applied to assemble the dataset as unit less for avoiding the effects of value dimensions güler et al 2002 machiwal and jha 2015 and for variables with equal weight in the multivariate statistical analysis davis and sampson 1986 güler et al 2002 3 2 statistical analysis the statistical analysis can be used to simplify complex systems and rearrange large datasets thus it could be helpful in providing significant information for groundwater chemistry assessment cloutier et al 2008 hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a common multivariate cluster analysis that can be used effectively for splitting the samples into similar clusters cloutier et al 2008 the process of dividing a dataset into clusters is based on the similarity in chemical signature within a cluster and dissimilarity between different clusters huang et al 2013 thus the chemical components of each water sample of the cluster are more similar to its associated water samples than any other water sample from the other clusters belkhiri et al 2010 güler et al 2002 the linking process begins with as many groups of water samples as individuals then the clusters are linked according to their similarity until only one remains templ et al 2008 the result of hca can be observed as a dendrogram tree diagram davis and sampson 1986 the roots of the dendrogram are all the water samples the chemical characters of the clusters can be distinguished using descriptive statistics and graphical representation the number of branches clusters of the dendrogram tree diagram can be increased or decreased by moving the line of cutting the tree phenon line down or up on the dendrogram the higher the phenon value the lower the number of branches choosing the optimal number of clusters is a challenging subjective task and relies on measuring similarities and variables used for partitioning the simple and common solution is subjective and is based on getting the lowest number of clusters that clarify most satisfactory results of the difference in hydrogeochemical characters of the water samples cloutier et al 2008 monjerezi 2012 drawing a map for the spatial distribution of the selected clusters using surfer 16 golden software can be helpful in confirming the optimal number of clusters and the location and general chemical signature of the wells of each cluster consequently we can correlate their chemistry with the types of human activities and or natural actions that are predominant in that location therefore each cluster or a set of clusters can be impacted hydrogeochemically by the particular activity or action in this research q mode is applied for clustering dataset to reveal the interactions among the studied samples davis and sampson 1986 an application of this mode is based on euclidian distance together with ward s method for linkage and generating the most distinct hydrogeochemical signature clusters for water samples after some trials of clustering to get the lowest number of clusters where each cluster represents a distinct hydrogeochemical signature we get the most representative number of clusters for the hydrogeochemical situation of the study area 3 3 applying conventional approaches the various graphical representations such as chloro alkaline indices cai chadha plot piper plot na cl ratio ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 plot and na cl versus ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 which are widely used in iep evaluation are applied in this research on the clustered data moreover chadha plot and piper plot are commonly used in determining hydrogeochemical water types identifying the origin of salinity and understanding the hydrogeochemical processes that influence the chemistry of groundwater the typical indices that are used to characterise iep are based on ionic ratios the most common method for iep evaluation is cai indices which are proposed by scholler 1967 and calculated using the following formula cai 1 cl na k cl cai 2 cl na k hco3 co3 so4 no3 negative values of cai are indicators for freshening softening process i e ca2 and mg2 fixation from the groundwater and na and k liberation from the aquifer material this process is known as direct base iep giménez forcada et al 2015 in contrast positive values are indicators for salinization hardening process i e na and k fixation on the aquifer material and ca2 and mg2 liberation to the groundwater argamasilla et al 2017 zaidi et al 2015 this process is known as reverse iep giménez forcada et al 2015 zero cai values assume insignificant weak ion exchange reactions while the higher positive and negative cai values reveal a higher level of this process scatter plot of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 versus na cl in mmol l is widely used by scholars in assessing the influence of iep on the chemistry of groundwater ma et al 2014 wang et al 2015 data were converted to percentage concentrations mmol l the graph should be a straight line with a slope of 1 to confirm iep occurrence mclean et al 2000 the water samples that equal zero indicate that ion exchange process is weak in these areas meanwhile the na cl ratio in meq l is important for identifying the salinization sources and evaluating the iep in groundwater if the source is halite dissolution the na cl ratio should be close to one while the values above or below from 1 1 line may suggest other salinizations or freshening sources different graphical representations such as piper and chadha plots are widely used to identify the dominant hydrochemical facies water facies identification is useful for exploring the mechanisms of groundwater chemistry evolution the factors and processes that influence the groundwater chemistry groundwater flow and quality trends piper diagram was plotted using aquachem 4 2 software while stata se 12 software was used to create the chadha plot piper plot consists of two lower triangular fields and a central diamond shaped field gopal et al 2018 the proportions of the major ions in piper diagram are expressed in meq l in chadha plot the data were converted to percentage concentrations meq l and expressed as the difference between alkaline earth ca mg and alkali metals na k for cations and the difference between weak acidic anions hco3 co3 and strong acidic anions cl so4 the hydrochemical processes suggested by chadha are recharging process ca hco3 type freshening process na hco3 type salinization process ca mg cl type and end member waters seawater na cl type gopal et al 2018 3 4 applying nia 3 4 1 step 1 data plotting on iep sf ha wt diagram the clustered data of different hydrogeochemical signatures are plotted on a new hydrochemical plot called ion exchange process salinization freshening humid arid water type iep sf ha wt plot it is a multi triangle diagram which is a useful tool in evaluation of iep identification of the water type determination of the salinity degree discrimination between humid areas and arid areas investigation of the ca2 mg2 enrichment process which may accompany iep and interpretation of the dynamics of salinization and freshening processes this plot can be drawn simply on microsoft excel it involves the ratios of the five significant ions ca2 mg2 na k and cl and their relationships it shows the relationship between ionic ratios of na k cl cl on the x axis and ca2 mg2 cl on the y axis where cl ions indicate the saline water while so4 2 and or hco3 ions which are not expressly represented indicate the fresh groundwater based on ionic ratio values iep sf ha wt plot is divided into two fields and eight triangles zones the right field where na k cl cl 2 represents the field of direct iep and the left one where na k cl cl 2 represents the field of reverse iep while each triangle represents major water type fig 4 moreover iep sf ha wt plot divides diagonally into four fields the right diagonal line divided the plot into two fields where field 9 represents alkaline earths exceeding alkali metals and field 10 represents alkali metals exceeding alkaline earths based on the ca2 cl ratio and na cl ratio iep sf ha wt plot is divided by left diagonal line into two fields field 11 represents mostly humid areas or recharge period and field 12 represents mostly arid to semi arid areas or discharge period 3 4 2 step 2 dynamics of salinization and freshening processes and hydrochemical evolution the iep sf ha wt diagram contains four arrows showing the dynamics of salinization and freshening processes the freshening and freshwater arrows point from the most salinized water of zones 4 and 5 mainly the na cl facies towards the freshening zones 6 and 7 mainly the na hco3 facies and towards the freshwater zones 8 and 1 mainly the ca hco3 facies respectively as shown in fig 4 the salinization and saline water arrows point from the most freshwater zones 8 and 1 mainly the ca hco3 facies towards the salinization zones 2 and 3 mainly the ca cl facies and towards the saline water zones 4 and 5 mainly the na cl facies respectively as shown in fig 4 the right field which includes zones 5 6 7 and 8 indicates mixing processes and direct iep the left field which includes zones 1 2 3 and 4 represents mixing processes between seawater and freshwater and reverse iep based on the position of each sample on the iep sf ha wt plot the hydrochemical evolution of the water samples can be recognized 3 4 3 step 3 water type identification hydrogeochemical facies are commonly identified using different graphical representations such as piper and chadha plots the six major ions na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 which comprise the majority of the total dissolved constituents of natural groundwater are commonly used in water type identification globally nitrate pollution has become a common problem in groundwater due to progressive increase of human activities when such minor ion concentration is high enough to significantly modify the groundwater chemical balance it should be incorporated with water type identification in this research a new approach is proposed to determine the water type in detail including nitrate ions as the following 1 plot the clustered data on the iep sf ha wt plot to identify the main water types of the different clusters within 8 water types 2 plot the clustered data on the bicarbonate sulphate nitrate ratios plot bsn log log plot fig 5 to identify which of the anions hco3 so4 2 and no3 are prevailing within the 8 major water types thus each water type of the 8 main types could be subdivided into 4 types after using bsn plot consequently 32 water types can be distinguished easily using the other extended excel bsn plot 3 to get more detailed water type identification related to the cations ca2 and mg2 ca2 mg2 ratio can be calculated to determine which of them is the dominant in each cluster 3 4 4 step 4 iep evaluation and ca2 mg2 enrichment process investigation data trend should be identified visually from iep sf ha wt plot and confirmed by correlation analysis to evaluate iep and the ca2 mg2 enrichment process which may accompany iep a visual identification visually the negative trend of the plotted clustered data means the dominance of iep process and ca2 mg2 enrichment process can be neglected in this case iep type can be recognized directly from the location of the clustered data on the diagram if the data trend is positive it means that both na and ca2 mg2 increase together in this situation there are two possible interpretations based on the location of the clustered dataset on iep sf ha wt plot right field plotting suggests that both direct iep and ca2 mg2 enrichment as a result of carbonate dissolution may influence this area left field plotting suggests a scenario of three hydrogeochemical processes influence this area initially a reverse iep may occurr in the soil zone initial salinization process followed by ca2 mg2 enrichment via carbonate dissolution and na enrichment as direct iep during water flow through the aquifer material b correlation analysis correlation analysis is a bivariate statistical analysis that is commonly used to measure the strength and direction of linear association between water quality variables to highlight deduce and recognize hydrochemical processes responsible for groundwater quality changes zghibi et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 in this research the linear relationship between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios for the clustered data is calculated using stata se 12 software this step is helpful in determining the comparative degree of influence of the iep and other hydrogeochemical processes of ca2 mg2 enrichment on the yielded clusters correlation coefficient between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios is estimated using the following equations s x y i 1 n x i x y i y n 1 sxy covariance between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios x bar and y bar are the means of na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios respectively n number of observations r x y s x y s x s y rxy correlation coefficient between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios ranges between 1 and 1 sxy covariance between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios sx sy standard deviation of na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios respectively a proposed scale for measuring this relation to deduce the comparative degree of influence of the iep and ca2 mg2 enrichment hydrogeochemical process is shown in table 1 and will be discussed later in the discussion section 3 5 flowchart summary of data processing steps a summary for all the methods steps which are applied in data preparation applying the conventional hydrogeochemical methods and nia is shown in the flowchart fig 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 multivariate cluster analysis the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis can be observed in the dendrogram tree diagram whose roots are all the 214 water samples fig 7 after some trials of clustering to get the lowest number of clusters where each cluster represents a distinct hydrogeochemical signature we got nine representative clusters for the study area the choice of nine branches clusters of the dendrogram best reflects the effect of a hydrogeochemical process or a combination of hydrogeochemical processes on the samples of each cluster the dendrogram shows a wide variation in the linkage distance between the nine clusters the highest level of similarity was observed between c7 c8 and c9 while the largest dissimilarity was between these three clusters and the remaining six clusters the big differences in dissimilarity measures among some clusters suggest high diversity in the hydrogeochemical processes in the gaza coastal aquifer the spatial distribution of the nine clusters is shown on the map fig 8 the hydrochemical characters of these clusters are included in the discussion and interpretation with the natural and or anthropogenic factors and processes controlling the hydrochemistry of the nine clusters consequently each cluster or a set of clusters can be a result of a particular hydrogeochemical process 4 2 factors controlling the hydrochemistry of clusters it is observed that the highest diversity of clusters and the big tds differences among the nine clusters are located in the northern part of the study area this result reflects wide variations in the salinity sources and hydrochemical processes in the study area the main factors controlling the hydrochemistry of the nine clusters are discussed here 4 2 1 seawater intrusion in gaza coastal aquifer systems groundwater over exploitation has reversed the natural flow of groundwater towards the mediterranean sea causing seawater intrusion abu alnaeem et al 2018 the impact of seawater intrusion on the wells of cluster c6 is confirmed by the location of this cluster next to the shoreline fig 8 and by several hydrogeochemical indicators such as high salinity in areas of heavy pumping abu alnaeem et al 2018 and ionic ratios of some major ions cluster c6 is distinguished by the highest tds 5434 18 848 mg l av 10 813 mg l with the dominance of chloride and sodium table 2 this cluster displays a significant decrease in the na cl ratio from 0 87 to 0 63 and increase in the ca2 cl ratio from 0 06 to 0 11 relative to those in the seawater this result indicates the occurrence of reverse iep during seawater intrusion the lower hco3 cl ratio 0 01 0 05 with av 0 02 compared to the higher ca2 cl ratio 0 06 0 11 with av 0 08 confirms that the source of high ca2 is influenced by seawater intrusion in this area the ca2 hco3 molar ratio diagram fig 9 emphasizes the high surplus of ca2 in cluster c6 due to reverse iep during seawater intrusion moreover k cl ratio which ranges from 0 001 to 0 05 with an average of 0 011 table 2 is low compared with the ratio in seawater k cl 0 019 this decrease in k cl ratio is a result of the adsorption of some k ions on the clay minerals of the aquifer material during the intrusion 4 2 2 saltwater up coning cluster c4 which is located inland as scattered plumes under areas of intense pumping is distinct by its high salinity tds values range from 2220 to 5561 mg l av 3907 mg l and na and cl ions are dominant table 2 na cl ratio values range from 0 47 to 1 05 with an average of 0 81 while ca2 cl ratios range from 0 06 to 0 20 with an average of 0 12 k cl ratio values are very low and range from 0 002 to 0 012 with an average of 0 005 while hco3 cl ratio ranges from 0 04 to 0 18 with an average of 0 09 the surplus of ca2 ions may be attributed to the influence of two hydrochemical processes reverse iep and carbonate dissolution process zaidi et al 2015 the relatively low hco3 cl ratio compared to the higher ca2 cl ratio confirms that the source of high ca2 is the combination of reverse iep and carbonate dissolution process in this area the high deficiency in k ions which ranges from 6 to 20 mg l with an average of 9 mg l table 2 may be attributed to the adsorption of k ions on the clay minerals of the aquifer material during the saltwater up coning this distinct hydrochemical signature of higher ca2 content and lower k content relative to seawater signature confirms the influence of saltwater up coning as shown previously in this area abu alnaeem et al 2018 4 2 3 anthropogenic activities groundwater pollution from human activities is recorded by the high nitrate concentration all over the study area it ranges from 18 to 496 mg l with an average of 123 mg l table 2 the highest level of no3 pollution is recorded in clusters c5 127 496 mg l with av 223 mg l c1 68 323 mg l with av 171 mg l and c7 77 225 mg l with av 135 mg l which are located in densely populated urban areas in contrast the lowest level of no3 is recorded in clusters c9 28 198 mg l with av 81 mg l and c2 18 78 mg l with av 44 mg l which are characterized by low population areas of impermeable to semi permeable surface soil cover the high concentration of ca2 in clusters c5 and c7 in conjunction with the highest nitrate pollution may reflect the impact of acidic wastewater on the dissolution of carbonate and release of ca2 in groundwater hamilton and dennis 1995 discussed that ca mg no3 water facies which is a unique water type can be found under fertilized fields abu alnaeem et al 2018 showed that the influence of farming inputs is limited in gaza coastal aquifer and is recorded only in the northern area which is characterized by permeable sand dune soils with intensive farming practices the results of abu alnaeem et al 2018 are confirmed after applying nia where a limited existence of ca mg no3 water type is recorded in the northern area as will be discussed later in this research 4 2 4 eocene invasion the presence of an adjacent hydraulically connected brackish aquifer can influence groundwater chemistry in the study area the eocene chalk and limestone aquifer is located on the eastern side of the gaza coastal aquifer the flow of water from eocene chalk and limestone aquifer from the eastern boundary toward the gaza aquifer affected its groundwater chemistry ghabayen et al 2006 qahman and larabi 2006 the characteristic chemical signature of the eocene water is ca2 rich water type with medium tds up to 5000 mg l and na cl 0 86 vengosh et al 2005 consequently the high na cl ratio in the eastern clusters c1 and c3 and some wells in c2 table 2 with a deficiency in ca2 reveal that the eastern side is impacted by eocene brackish invasion abu alnaeem et al 2018 with the dominance of direct iep 4 2 5 rainfall recharge rainfall recharge process could be higher in the northern area where the rainfall amount is double that in the south and the areas of sand dunes and calcareous sandstone are wider in coastal areas rainfall components are similar to that of seawater with na cl water type and na cl ratio 0 86 but with very low tds clusters c7 and c8 which are located in the northern rainy area are characterized by the lowest salinity in this area most of the wells of cluster c7 and all of c8 are freshwater where their tds values range from 617 to 1418 mg l av 922 mg l and 370 819 mg l av 640 mg l respectively table 2 4 2 6 water rock interaction processes in coastal aquifers the chemical composition of groundwater may be modified by a diversity of rock water interaction processes such as ion exchange and mineral dissolution monjerezi 2012 4 2 6 1 carbonate dissolution ca2 hco3 molar ratio versus tds mg l fig 9 shows that most of the wells of clusters c7 c8 c9 and c5 are located between the calcite dissolution ratio 1 2 and the dolomite dissolution ratio 1 4 i e within zone 0 25 0 5 this could happen as a result of rainfall recharge and or the acidity of the sewage infiltration and farming inputs in nitrate polluted areas the diagram displays a high surplus of ca2 in clusters c6 and c4 which may be attributed to reverse iep during seawater intrusion c6 and saltwater up coning c4 on the other hand clusters of c3 and c1 show a high deficiency in ca2 ions this deficiency may suggest the fixation of calcium ion during the continuous invasion of eocene water from the eastern areas 4 2 6 2 ion exchange process ion exchange process iep is one of the most important hydrogeochemical processes which is commonly determined using the classical methods such as cai and other ionic ratios it is commonly expected that freshwater recharge is dominated by ca hco3 but in coastal regions rainfall contents resemble seawater i e na cl water type with na c1 ratio of 0 86 rosenthal et al 2009 consequently the rainfall recharge process freshening process in coastal areas can change the na cl ratio of groundwater to appear as a fallacious salinization process the scatter plots of ionic ratios cai ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 and na cl fig 10 a b c show an upnormal location of the highest salinity clusters of c6 and c4 and the lowest salinity clusters of c7 and c8 they are located in the plots within the field of salinization as a result of the influence of reverse iep on these areas iep could also be evaluated by the scatter plot of na cl versus ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 fig 10d which is widely used by researchers carol et al 2013 huang et al 2013 it is found that the slope of the nine clusters is near 1 where c1 0 95 c2 0 97 c3 0 55 c4 0 98 c5 0 83 c6 0 92 c7 0 82 c8 0 87 and c9 0 83 are estimated thus these results indicate that ion exchange process is likely to be one of the major contributors to higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations in some clusters and higher na and k concentrations in other clusters these confusing results in interpretation provide a reasonable discussion of iep in aquifers and highlight the need for further methods to characterise these processes beyond the typical indices that are used based on ionic ratios 4 2 6 3 piper and chadha plots these plots show that most of the clustered data are plotted within the na cl water type field around 71 6 indicating that the saline water is dominant in groundwater chemistry of the gaza coastal aquifer fig 11 a and b the remaining clusters of c7 and c8 are located in zone 2 revealing that the dominance of ca mg cl in salinization area is as a result of reverse iep around 25 a few wells are scattered in na hco3 and ca hco3 water types so the freshwater and freshening areas are very limited and could be neglected this result is similar to the previous plots it is noticed also that the freshwater clusters c7 and c8 are located in the field of ca cl water type indicating salinization areas due to reverse iep 4 2 6 4 the novel integrated approach for this complex coastal aquifer system which is influenced by a diversity of natural and anthropogenic factors initially the dataset is split into nine clusters of different hydrogeochemical signatures using hca the clustered data is plotted on the iep sf ha wt plot fig 12 then on bsn plot fig 13 they elucidate the dominance of na cl 65 4 fig 12 with na cl so4 type in c6 c4 c1 and c2 and na cl hco3 type in c3 c5 and c9 fig 13 the prevailing water types in c7 and c8 are ca mg hco3 no3 type 15 9 and ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 ca mg cl is 8 of samples and na hco3 is 8 4 of samples figs 12 and 13 the presence of ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 which is a unique water type in c8 6 wells c5 1 well and c5 3 wells suggests the influence of fertilizers input in these areas actually the northern area is the only location which is influenced by the mixied inputs from sewage infiltration and farming activities while other areas are dominated by sewage inputs abu alnaeem et al 2018 these water types cannot be recorded by using the traditional plots as chadha and piper plots for visual iep identification and ca2 mg2 enrichment process investigation all the clustered data shows a negative trend except clusters c7 and c8 fig 12 this negative trend for the most of the clusters reveals that iep can be the dominant process in this area and ca2 mg2 enrichment process is limited within c7 and c8 the negative trend clusters in the right field are direct iep while those in the left field are reverse iep on the other hand the positive data trend cluster c7 and nearly horizontal trend c8 fig 12 reflect the increase of concentrations in both of na and ca2 mg2 in these areas c8 wells are divided into two groups based on their location on the iep sf ha wt plot a small one in the right field of the plot c8r and a large one in the left field c8l fig 12 the left position wells of clusters c7 and c8l may suggest a scenario of three hydrogeochemical processes which can happen in these areas while the right position wells of clusters c8r may suggest a scenario of two hydrogeochemical processes as will be discussed later 4 2 7 correlation analysis the linear association between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios for the nine clusters is mathematically estimated using correlation analysis a scale for measuring this relation to deduce the comparative degree of influence of the iep and ca2 mg2 enrichment is proposed in table 1 after applying the mathematical analysis on the nine clusters it is found that all the clusters show negative correlations except clusters c7 and c8 as shown in table 3 the highest negative values are recorded in c1 0 86 c2 0 87 and c4 0 81 while the positive and near zero values are recorded in clusters c7 and c8 these results confirm the previous visual outputs and indicate that iep can be the dominant process especially in the southern areas where the abundance of clay sediments favors iep mathematically reverse iep type is the dominant process in this area it can be mainly attributed to the wide effect of seawater intrusion saltwater up coning and sewage invasion on this area on the other hand ca2 mg2 enrichment process is more effective in the northern clusters c7 and c8 this result confirms the fact that dissolution of carbonate rocks is more likely in humid areas soumya et al 2013 this enrichment process is identified from the location of the clusters c7 and c8 within the diagonal field 11 on the iep sf ha wt plot fig 12 the sources of humidity in this northern area are related to higher rate of rainfall the existence of infiltration basins of the north gaza wastewater treatment plant ngwwtp beit lahia lake of improperly treated waste water on sand dunes beit lahia wadi crossing the northern area moreover the abundance of thick calcareous sandstone with a wide distribution of sand dunes in this northern area facilitates the recharging process in this way this approach helps in the differentiation between the more humid areas and more arid areas in this area a comparison between the nine clusters with the hydrochemical interpretation for each cluster is shown in table 3 4 2 8 the hydrochemical scenario of clusters c7 and c8 a hydrogeochemical schematic representation for this area fig 14 shows the suggested scenario for the sequence of hydrogeochemical processes which are influenced by these clusters c7 and c8l this northern rainy area is characterized by mixing recharge of treated wastewater irrigation return and rainfall recharge initially reverse iep may occur in the soil zone and unsaturated zone initial salinization process so na cl ratio is decreased from 1 2 in treated wastewater and 0 86 in coastal rainfall to 0 40 fig 14 then the flow of this acidic nitrate polluted water average no3 100 mg l could accelerate the dissolution of carbonates in the aquifer matrix and liberate ca2 and hco3 ions in this area the high no3 concentration in this area is derived from the mixed inputs of sewage infiltration and farming activities abu alnaeem et al 2018 finally the surplus of ca2 and mg2 ions in water may cause desorption of the na ions from the clay minerals in the aquifer matrix this direct iep could increase again the na cl ratios thus the na and ca2 mg2 concentrations are increased together along the groundwater flow paths however increasing ca2 mg2 content is more obvious than the increasing of na content in cluster c7 as shown from the minimum and maximum values of ca2 cl and na cl table 1 in cluster c8 there is nearly equal increase of ca2 and na contents as discussed in the correlation analysis and confirmed here by ca2 cl and na cl ratios table 1 this hydrogeochemical signature of ca hco3 type with low tds in c7 and c8l suggests the occurrence of freshening process in these areas but with high no3 content thus all of the wells in the northern rainy area belonging to clusters c7 and most of c8 show dilution chemistry due to continuous mixing input of rainfall recharge irrigation return flow and partially treated sewage infiltration on the other hand most of the southern clusters wells do not always receive the entire rainfall in terms of magnitude and actual adequate recharge does not take place for an effective influence on the chemistry of groundwater in the southern area this sequence of hydrogeochemical processes cannot be deduced and interpreted without applying nia 5 conclusion in this research nia which combines three techniques hca new hydrochemical analysis and correlation analysis is applied on ten physiochemical water chemistry parameters for 214 municipal wells belong to gaza coastal aquifer system gaza strip palestine in contrast to conventional approaches this approach enables accurate determination of iep precise identification of hydrogeochemical facies to characterise signatures of aquifer salinization and freshening discrimination between humid and arid areas and investigation of ca2 mg2 enrichment that may accompany iep and would not be explained using conventional methods hca yields nine distinct hydrogeochemical signature clusters iep is evaluated for the nine clusters using six conventional hydrogeochemical methods they show a confusing plot for the highly saline clusters c6 and c4 with the freshwater clusters c7 and c8 iep sf ha wt approach solved this puzzle by defining iep of the nine clusters based on their location and their trend on iep sf ha wt diagram it shows the dominance of iep and the wide impact of reverse iep as a result of the wide ranging influence of seawater intrusion saltwater up coning and sewage inputs similarly it illuminates the impact of direct iep and carbonate dissolution on the groundwater of the northern area also two hydrogeochemical processes accompanied with reverse iep have been deduced for the northern clusters c7 and c8 that would have not explained using other conventional methods moreover it reveals the predominance of na cl type 65 4 ca mg hco3 no3 15 9 na hco3 8 4 ca mg cl 8 and the existence of a unique ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 in the northern area as a new indication for the influence of fertilizers inputs in this area additionally it elucidates the humidity conditions of the northern area due to rainfall recharge irrigation return flow and partially treated sewage infiltration therefore the implication of this multi beneficial approach is essential to effectively manage the groundwater resources in water stressed regions such as the gaza coastal aquifer system and other similar aquifers systems elsewhere

12214,several approaches for ion exchange process iep evaluation and water type identification have widely been developed during the last several decades however a lack of clear methodology to characterise iep and water type remains a problem in this paper a novel hybrid approach is proposed to understand this deficiency determine iep accurately identify hydrogeochemical facies precisely that characterise each hydrogeochemical signature of aquifer salinization and freshening discriminate between humid and arid areas and investigate ca2 mg2 enrichment processes which may be accompanied with iep and would have not explained using other conventional methods this new method termed iep sf ha wt combines three techniques hierarchical cluster analysis hca new hydrochemical analysis and correlation analysis it is applied on ten physicochemical variables for 214 municipal wells belonging to gaza coastal aquifer system gaza strip palestine to test its reliability and imputation ability the results demonstrate that the new hybrid method performs well in discrimination between areas of reverse and direct iep it shows the dominance of iep and the wide impact of reverse iep as a result of the wide ranging influence of seawater intrusion saltwater up coning and sewage inputs similarly it illuminates the impact of direct iep and carbonate dissolution on the groundwater of the northern area it reveals the predominance of na cl 65 4 ca mg hco3 no3 15 9 na hco3 8 4 ca mg cl 8 and the existence of a unique ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 in the northern area as a result of the influence of fertilizer inputs in this area moreover it elucidates the humidity of the northern area due to rainfall recharge irrigation return flow and partially treated sewage infiltration therefore the implication of this multi beneficial approach can be widely used for precise and detailed hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater in the gaza coastal aquifer system as well as for other similar aquifer systems elsewhere around the world graphical abstract image 1 keywords hierarchical cluster analysis correlation analysis hybrid hydrogeochemical approach iep sf ha wt plot 1 introduction groundwater is the main key element for the sustainable development of the communities keesari et al 2016 mukate et al 2017 especially in arid to semi arid mediterranean countries argamasilla et al 2017 mountadar et al 2018 soumaia et al 2018 where fresh surface water resources are limited and population over growth is increasing rapidly it is considered as a sustainable and reliable resource for residential farming and industrial uses abu alnaeem et al 2018 flem et al 2018 sheikhy et al 2018 due to its natural quality and quantity consistent temperature and huge storage amount mukate et al 2017 commonly in coastal aquifers the original chemical composition of groundwater may be exposed to high modifications as a result of the joint effects of anthropogenic and geogenic factors flem et al 2018 jia et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 these modifications can happen through rock water interactions processes such as ion exchange process iep and soluble mineral dissolution precipitation processes monjerezi 2012 puig et al 2017 pulido leboeuf 2004 iep is considered as one of the major natural providers of the groundwater chemical components and may control groundwater chemistry of aquifer systems argamasilla et al 2017 chidambaram et al 2013 zaidi et al 2015 iep usually occurs during water flow through clay or clay rich sediments these sediments are widespread in soils and aquifer systems and are characterized by high ability in exchanging their cations with cations present in water reddy 2013 walter et al 2017 iep commonly happens in aquifer systems which are exposed to salinization and or freshening processes abu alnaeem et al 2018 slama and bouhlila 2017 it is commonly used as an indicator for salinization and freshening processes the dynamics of seawater intrusion and the evolution of groundwater chemistry abu alnaeem et al 2018 reddy 2013 in spite of the fact many approaches for iep evaluation have been used a lack of clear methodology to characterise iep remains a problem this research provides a reasonable discussion of the deficiency in iep characterization in aquifers it highlights the need for further methods to characterise this hydrogeochemical process beyond the typical indices which are based on ionic ratios this new interated approach nia of multivariate statistical hydrogeochemical and correlation analyses is developed to characterise the iep beyond the typical indices to evaluate the type and degree of iep to identify 32 water types delineate 8 degrees of salinization freshening processes to distinguish between humid and arid areas and to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes of ca2 mg2 enrichment which may accompany iep this approach is applied on the gaza coastal aquifer which is characterized by a high and complex salinity and located in an over populated and extremely water starved coastal area that is influenced by the diversity of anthropogenic and natural factors and processes abu alnaeem et al 2018 natural factors include mineral dissolution seawater intrusion salt water up coning and impact of adjacent aquifers while anthropogenic factors comprise improper sewage disposal intensive farming activities and unplanned urban expansion jia et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 this widespread presence of activities may cause high chemical modifications in groundwater quality in gaza strip applying this nia can be a beneficial tool for an effective groundwater chemistry management of gaza coastal aquifer system and other similar aquifer systems 2 area of study 2 1 geographical and climatic settings the investigated area is a narrow elongated land that is located in the south western part of the mediterranean coastal plain of palestine encompassing an area of 365 km2 fig 1 its population is among the most rapidly growing in the world around 5500 capita km2 pcbs 2015 the surface freshwater is scarce and the only water resource for residential and agricultural purposes is groundwater gaza strip is characterized by semi arid temperate mediterranean sea climate with mild winter and dry hot summer the temperature is generally moderate ranging from 22 c to 33 c in august and from 6 c to 15 c in january the rainfall season extends from october until april with the highest precipitation in january around 105 mm the annual rainfall is limited and ranges from 200 mm year in the south to 400 mm year in the north with an average of 327 mm year the rainfall is considered as the main source of groundwater recharge the yearly potential average of evaporation is uneven and ranges from 2 1 mm d in december to 6 3 mm d in july the study area is generally characterized by frequent droughts and lack of rainfall in addition the high rate of evaporation reduces the chance of recharge with rainfall 2 2 geological and hydrological settings the geology of the gaza strip consists of pleistocene and holocene age deposits called kurkar group it is composed of sand quartz rich calcareous sandstone and silt kurkar formation that is interlayered with pleistocene marine clays and red clay loam hamra formation issar 1968 the kurkar group overlies chalks of eocene age at the eastern side of the study area and thick layers of marls marine shales and clays about 400 to 1000 m of miocene pliocene age called saqiya group to the middle and western side of the study area the geological map of gaza strip as modified by sneh et al 1998 is presented in fig 1 this map shows the geological formations of the gaza coastal region these sedimentary rocks and deposits consist of calcareous sandstone sand dunes silt clay and gravel the general slope of these formations is toward the mediterranean sea fig 2 the gaza coastal aquifer which is a shallow unconfined aquifer is recharged by the limited rainfall through the areas of sand dunes calcareous sandstone and sandy loam in the central and western parts of the aquifer in the eastern part of the aquifer rainfall percolation is restricted by the occurrence of thick deposits of loess soils up to 20 m depth with low hydraulic conductivity in this area weinthal et al 2005 the surface water system in the study area is represented by three wadis which are almost dried out unfortunately these wadis have become places for sewage discharge and solid waste dumping from surrounding residential areas the coastal aquifer is located along the mediterranean coast from the north of the sinai peninsula in egypt to the foothill of mount carmel at the southward of gaza strip zilberbrand et al 2001 it varies in width from 7 km in the north to 20 km in the south the gaza strip and its aquifer are located in the southern part of the coastal aquifer next to the present coastline the kurkar group sequence reaches an average thickness of 100 120 m in the south and 180 200 m in the north wedging gradually out to the east towards the foothills of the judea and samaria mountains to a few meters vengosh et al 2005 zilberbrand et al 2001 a 3 d conceptual model for the hydrogeological situation of the gaza coastal aquifer and the surrounding region modified after melloul and azmon 1997 mercado 1980 and weinberger et al 1994 is depicted in fig 2 hydro stratigraphically the presence of clay layers splits the aquifer vertically into four sub aquifers a b1 b2 and c yakirevich et al 1998 the hydraulic connection between them with the sea is not well understood this subdivision continues along the coastal strip but disperses 4 6 km to the east of the coastline vengosh et al 2005 weinthal et al 2005 along the eastern side the third ridge of the kurkar group sequence is dissected randomly by impervious to semi impervious layers and lenses as a whole gaza coastal aquifer can be considered as one hydrogeological unit generally most of the water is abstracted from the upper 30 40 m of the shallow area of the aquifer in the study area groundwater wells are highly dense mostly with high rates of production and often located near the sea especially in the northern part of the region abu alnaeem et al 2018 historically natural groundwater flow is toward the sea the groundwater over pumping causes a big shortage in water balance pwa 2014 thus the water table showed two huge regional cones of depression in the northern 5 m and southern 19 m areas relative to mean sea level that trigger seawater intrusion causing a serious aquifer salinization pwa 2014 based on a previous study it is found that the highest salinity as tds areas are recorded along the coastline up to 19000 mg l and the inland areas as scattered plumes up to 6000 7000 mg l abu alnaeem et al 2018 fig 3 this distribution is attributed to the high influence of seawater intrusion and or saltwater up coning on the study area results from the impact of heavy pumping these hydraulic conditions accelerate the lateral movement of eocene brackish water from the eastern side moreover the impact of intensive human activities such as sewage infiltration and farming inputs contribute to the deterioration of groundwater quality and increase the salinity in the study area on the other hand the lowest values of tds less than 1000 mg l are recorded inland in the northern and southern parts within a very limited area 45 km2 12 3 in the gaza strip evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall consequently the soluble salts of caco3 accumulate in soils shomar et al 2005 the higher rate of precipitation in the northern area is enough to leach soluble salts from soil moreover loess soils containing calcite gypsum and halite could be a source of salinization vengosh et al 2005 3 methodology the existing ten physicochemical variables tds ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and ph for 219 wells have been collected from the palestinian water authority pwa and are analyzed statistically using stata se 12 software and hydrogeochemically using aquachem 4 2 software 3 1 data preparation clustering process may be adversely affected by data outliers brink et al 2007 so it is better to identify and separate outliers as a precondition for multivariate statistical analysis five outliers were excluded and the number of wells reduced to 214 wells the concentrations of various chemical data are changed from mg l to meq l to be checked for charge balance only those water samples whose difference of anion cation balance is within 5 are used in this study to combine the various ions in a chemically meaningful method nwankwoala and udom 2011 log transformation is performed on skewed data to generate a normal distribution of it this step is the prerequisite of multivariate statistical analysis for better confidence in the outputs and interpretations davis and sampson 1986 güler et al 2002 wang et al 2015 data standardization is applied to assemble the dataset as unit less for avoiding the effects of value dimensions güler et al 2002 machiwal and jha 2015 and for variables with equal weight in the multivariate statistical analysis davis and sampson 1986 güler et al 2002 3 2 statistical analysis the statistical analysis can be used to simplify complex systems and rearrange large datasets thus it could be helpful in providing significant information for groundwater chemistry assessment cloutier et al 2008 hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a common multivariate cluster analysis that can be used effectively for splitting the samples into similar clusters cloutier et al 2008 the process of dividing a dataset into clusters is based on the similarity in chemical signature within a cluster and dissimilarity between different clusters huang et al 2013 thus the chemical components of each water sample of the cluster are more similar to its associated water samples than any other water sample from the other clusters belkhiri et al 2010 güler et al 2002 the linking process begins with as many groups of water samples as individuals then the clusters are linked according to their similarity until only one remains templ et al 2008 the result of hca can be observed as a dendrogram tree diagram davis and sampson 1986 the roots of the dendrogram are all the water samples the chemical characters of the clusters can be distinguished using descriptive statistics and graphical representation the number of branches clusters of the dendrogram tree diagram can be increased or decreased by moving the line of cutting the tree phenon line down or up on the dendrogram the higher the phenon value the lower the number of branches choosing the optimal number of clusters is a challenging subjective task and relies on measuring similarities and variables used for partitioning the simple and common solution is subjective and is based on getting the lowest number of clusters that clarify most satisfactory results of the difference in hydrogeochemical characters of the water samples cloutier et al 2008 monjerezi 2012 drawing a map for the spatial distribution of the selected clusters using surfer 16 golden software can be helpful in confirming the optimal number of clusters and the location and general chemical signature of the wells of each cluster consequently we can correlate their chemistry with the types of human activities and or natural actions that are predominant in that location therefore each cluster or a set of clusters can be impacted hydrogeochemically by the particular activity or action in this research q mode is applied for clustering dataset to reveal the interactions among the studied samples davis and sampson 1986 an application of this mode is based on euclidian distance together with ward s method for linkage and generating the most distinct hydrogeochemical signature clusters for water samples after some trials of clustering to get the lowest number of clusters where each cluster represents a distinct hydrogeochemical signature we get the most representative number of clusters for the hydrogeochemical situation of the study area 3 3 applying conventional approaches the various graphical representations such as chloro alkaline indices cai chadha plot piper plot na cl ratio ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 plot and na cl versus ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 which are widely used in iep evaluation are applied in this research on the clustered data moreover chadha plot and piper plot are commonly used in determining hydrogeochemical water types identifying the origin of salinity and understanding the hydrogeochemical processes that influence the chemistry of groundwater the typical indices that are used to characterise iep are based on ionic ratios the most common method for iep evaluation is cai indices which are proposed by scholler 1967 and calculated using the following formula cai 1 cl na k cl cai 2 cl na k hco3 co3 so4 no3 negative values of cai are indicators for freshening softening process i e ca2 and mg2 fixation from the groundwater and na and k liberation from the aquifer material this process is known as direct base iep giménez forcada et al 2015 in contrast positive values are indicators for salinization hardening process i e na and k fixation on the aquifer material and ca2 and mg2 liberation to the groundwater argamasilla et al 2017 zaidi et al 2015 this process is known as reverse iep giménez forcada et al 2015 zero cai values assume insignificant weak ion exchange reactions while the higher positive and negative cai values reveal a higher level of this process scatter plot of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 versus na cl in mmol l is widely used by scholars in assessing the influence of iep on the chemistry of groundwater ma et al 2014 wang et al 2015 data were converted to percentage concentrations mmol l the graph should be a straight line with a slope of 1 to confirm iep occurrence mclean et al 2000 the water samples that equal zero indicate that ion exchange process is weak in these areas meanwhile the na cl ratio in meq l is important for identifying the salinization sources and evaluating the iep in groundwater if the source is halite dissolution the na cl ratio should be close to one while the values above or below from 1 1 line may suggest other salinizations or freshening sources different graphical representations such as piper and chadha plots are widely used to identify the dominant hydrochemical facies water facies identification is useful for exploring the mechanisms of groundwater chemistry evolution the factors and processes that influence the groundwater chemistry groundwater flow and quality trends piper diagram was plotted using aquachem 4 2 software while stata se 12 software was used to create the chadha plot piper plot consists of two lower triangular fields and a central diamond shaped field gopal et al 2018 the proportions of the major ions in piper diagram are expressed in meq l in chadha plot the data were converted to percentage concentrations meq l and expressed as the difference between alkaline earth ca mg and alkali metals na k for cations and the difference between weak acidic anions hco3 co3 and strong acidic anions cl so4 the hydrochemical processes suggested by chadha are recharging process ca hco3 type freshening process na hco3 type salinization process ca mg cl type and end member waters seawater na cl type gopal et al 2018 3 4 applying nia 3 4 1 step 1 data plotting on iep sf ha wt diagram the clustered data of different hydrogeochemical signatures are plotted on a new hydrochemical plot called ion exchange process salinization freshening humid arid water type iep sf ha wt plot it is a multi triangle diagram which is a useful tool in evaluation of iep identification of the water type determination of the salinity degree discrimination between humid areas and arid areas investigation of the ca2 mg2 enrichment process which may accompany iep and interpretation of the dynamics of salinization and freshening processes this plot can be drawn simply on microsoft excel it involves the ratios of the five significant ions ca2 mg2 na k and cl and their relationships it shows the relationship between ionic ratios of na k cl cl on the x axis and ca2 mg2 cl on the y axis where cl ions indicate the saline water while so4 2 and or hco3 ions which are not expressly represented indicate the fresh groundwater based on ionic ratio values iep sf ha wt plot is divided into two fields and eight triangles zones the right field where na k cl cl 2 represents the field of direct iep and the left one where na k cl cl 2 represents the field of reverse iep while each triangle represents major water type fig 4 moreover iep sf ha wt plot divides diagonally into four fields the right diagonal line divided the plot into two fields where field 9 represents alkaline earths exceeding alkali metals and field 10 represents alkali metals exceeding alkaline earths based on the ca2 cl ratio and na cl ratio iep sf ha wt plot is divided by left diagonal line into two fields field 11 represents mostly humid areas or recharge period and field 12 represents mostly arid to semi arid areas or discharge period 3 4 2 step 2 dynamics of salinization and freshening processes and hydrochemical evolution the iep sf ha wt diagram contains four arrows showing the dynamics of salinization and freshening processes the freshening and freshwater arrows point from the most salinized water of zones 4 and 5 mainly the na cl facies towards the freshening zones 6 and 7 mainly the na hco3 facies and towards the freshwater zones 8 and 1 mainly the ca hco3 facies respectively as shown in fig 4 the salinization and saline water arrows point from the most freshwater zones 8 and 1 mainly the ca hco3 facies towards the salinization zones 2 and 3 mainly the ca cl facies and towards the saline water zones 4 and 5 mainly the na cl facies respectively as shown in fig 4 the right field which includes zones 5 6 7 and 8 indicates mixing processes and direct iep the left field which includes zones 1 2 3 and 4 represents mixing processes between seawater and freshwater and reverse iep based on the position of each sample on the iep sf ha wt plot the hydrochemical evolution of the water samples can be recognized 3 4 3 step 3 water type identification hydrogeochemical facies are commonly identified using different graphical representations such as piper and chadha plots the six major ions na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 which comprise the majority of the total dissolved constituents of natural groundwater are commonly used in water type identification globally nitrate pollution has become a common problem in groundwater due to progressive increase of human activities when such minor ion concentration is high enough to significantly modify the groundwater chemical balance it should be incorporated with water type identification in this research a new approach is proposed to determine the water type in detail including nitrate ions as the following 1 plot the clustered data on the iep sf ha wt plot to identify the main water types of the different clusters within 8 water types 2 plot the clustered data on the bicarbonate sulphate nitrate ratios plot bsn log log plot fig 5 to identify which of the anions hco3 so4 2 and no3 are prevailing within the 8 major water types thus each water type of the 8 main types could be subdivided into 4 types after using bsn plot consequently 32 water types can be distinguished easily using the other extended excel bsn plot 3 to get more detailed water type identification related to the cations ca2 and mg2 ca2 mg2 ratio can be calculated to determine which of them is the dominant in each cluster 3 4 4 step 4 iep evaluation and ca2 mg2 enrichment process investigation data trend should be identified visually from iep sf ha wt plot and confirmed by correlation analysis to evaluate iep and the ca2 mg2 enrichment process which may accompany iep a visual identification visually the negative trend of the plotted clustered data means the dominance of iep process and ca2 mg2 enrichment process can be neglected in this case iep type can be recognized directly from the location of the clustered data on the diagram if the data trend is positive it means that both na and ca2 mg2 increase together in this situation there are two possible interpretations based on the location of the clustered dataset on iep sf ha wt plot right field plotting suggests that both direct iep and ca2 mg2 enrichment as a result of carbonate dissolution may influence this area left field plotting suggests a scenario of three hydrogeochemical processes influence this area initially a reverse iep may occurr in the soil zone initial salinization process followed by ca2 mg2 enrichment via carbonate dissolution and na enrichment as direct iep during water flow through the aquifer material b correlation analysis correlation analysis is a bivariate statistical analysis that is commonly used to measure the strength and direction of linear association between water quality variables to highlight deduce and recognize hydrochemical processes responsible for groundwater quality changes zghibi et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 in this research the linear relationship between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios for the clustered data is calculated using stata se 12 software this step is helpful in determining the comparative degree of influence of the iep and other hydrogeochemical processes of ca2 mg2 enrichment on the yielded clusters correlation coefficient between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios is estimated using the following equations s x y i 1 n x i x y i y n 1 sxy covariance between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios x bar and y bar are the means of na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios respectively n number of observations r x y s x y s x s y rxy correlation coefficient between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios ranges between 1 and 1 sxy covariance between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios sx sy standard deviation of na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios respectively a proposed scale for measuring this relation to deduce the comparative degree of influence of the iep and ca2 mg2 enrichment hydrogeochemical process is shown in table 1 and will be discussed later in the discussion section 3 5 flowchart summary of data processing steps a summary for all the methods steps which are applied in data preparation applying the conventional hydrogeochemical methods and nia is shown in the flowchart fig 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 multivariate cluster analysis the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis can be observed in the dendrogram tree diagram whose roots are all the 214 water samples fig 7 after some trials of clustering to get the lowest number of clusters where each cluster represents a distinct hydrogeochemical signature we got nine representative clusters for the study area the choice of nine branches clusters of the dendrogram best reflects the effect of a hydrogeochemical process or a combination of hydrogeochemical processes on the samples of each cluster the dendrogram shows a wide variation in the linkage distance between the nine clusters the highest level of similarity was observed between c7 c8 and c9 while the largest dissimilarity was between these three clusters and the remaining six clusters the big differences in dissimilarity measures among some clusters suggest high diversity in the hydrogeochemical processes in the gaza coastal aquifer the spatial distribution of the nine clusters is shown on the map fig 8 the hydrochemical characters of these clusters are included in the discussion and interpretation with the natural and or anthropogenic factors and processes controlling the hydrochemistry of the nine clusters consequently each cluster or a set of clusters can be a result of a particular hydrogeochemical process 4 2 factors controlling the hydrochemistry of clusters it is observed that the highest diversity of clusters and the big tds differences among the nine clusters are located in the northern part of the study area this result reflects wide variations in the salinity sources and hydrochemical processes in the study area the main factors controlling the hydrochemistry of the nine clusters are discussed here 4 2 1 seawater intrusion in gaza coastal aquifer systems groundwater over exploitation has reversed the natural flow of groundwater towards the mediterranean sea causing seawater intrusion abu alnaeem et al 2018 the impact of seawater intrusion on the wells of cluster c6 is confirmed by the location of this cluster next to the shoreline fig 8 and by several hydrogeochemical indicators such as high salinity in areas of heavy pumping abu alnaeem et al 2018 and ionic ratios of some major ions cluster c6 is distinguished by the highest tds 5434 18 848 mg l av 10 813 mg l with the dominance of chloride and sodium table 2 this cluster displays a significant decrease in the na cl ratio from 0 87 to 0 63 and increase in the ca2 cl ratio from 0 06 to 0 11 relative to those in the seawater this result indicates the occurrence of reverse iep during seawater intrusion the lower hco3 cl ratio 0 01 0 05 with av 0 02 compared to the higher ca2 cl ratio 0 06 0 11 with av 0 08 confirms that the source of high ca2 is influenced by seawater intrusion in this area the ca2 hco3 molar ratio diagram fig 9 emphasizes the high surplus of ca2 in cluster c6 due to reverse iep during seawater intrusion moreover k cl ratio which ranges from 0 001 to 0 05 with an average of 0 011 table 2 is low compared with the ratio in seawater k cl 0 019 this decrease in k cl ratio is a result of the adsorption of some k ions on the clay minerals of the aquifer material during the intrusion 4 2 2 saltwater up coning cluster c4 which is located inland as scattered plumes under areas of intense pumping is distinct by its high salinity tds values range from 2220 to 5561 mg l av 3907 mg l and na and cl ions are dominant table 2 na cl ratio values range from 0 47 to 1 05 with an average of 0 81 while ca2 cl ratios range from 0 06 to 0 20 with an average of 0 12 k cl ratio values are very low and range from 0 002 to 0 012 with an average of 0 005 while hco3 cl ratio ranges from 0 04 to 0 18 with an average of 0 09 the surplus of ca2 ions may be attributed to the influence of two hydrochemical processes reverse iep and carbonate dissolution process zaidi et al 2015 the relatively low hco3 cl ratio compared to the higher ca2 cl ratio confirms that the source of high ca2 is the combination of reverse iep and carbonate dissolution process in this area the high deficiency in k ions which ranges from 6 to 20 mg l with an average of 9 mg l table 2 may be attributed to the adsorption of k ions on the clay minerals of the aquifer material during the saltwater up coning this distinct hydrochemical signature of higher ca2 content and lower k content relative to seawater signature confirms the influence of saltwater up coning as shown previously in this area abu alnaeem et al 2018 4 2 3 anthropogenic activities groundwater pollution from human activities is recorded by the high nitrate concentration all over the study area it ranges from 18 to 496 mg l with an average of 123 mg l table 2 the highest level of no3 pollution is recorded in clusters c5 127 496 mg l with av 223 mg l c1 68 323 mg l with av 171 mg l and c7 77 225 mg l with av 135 mg l which are located in densely populated urban areas in contrast the lowest level of no3 is recorded in clusters c9 28 198 mg l with av 81 mg l and c2 18 78 mg l with av 44 mg l which are characterized by low population areas of impermeable to semi permeable surface soil cover the high concentration of ca2 in clusters c5 and c7 in conjunction with the highest nitrate pollution may reflect the impact of acidic wastewater on the dissolution of carbonate and release of ca2 in groundwater hamilton and dennis 1995 discussed that ca mg no3 water facies which is a unique water type can be found under fertilized fields abu alnaeem et al 2018 showed that the influence of farming inputs is limited in gaza coastal aquifer and is recorded only in the northern area which is characterized by permeable sand dune soils with intensive farming practices the results of abu alnaeem et al 2018 are confirmed after applying nia where a limited existence of ca mg no3 water type is recorded in the northern area as will be discussed later in this research 4 2 4 eocene invasion the presence of an adjacent hydraulically connected brackish aquifer can influence groundwater chemistry in the study area the eocene chalk and limestone aquifer is located on the eastern side of the gaza coastal aquifer the flow of water from eocene chalk and limestone aquifer from the eastern boundary toward the gaza aquifer affected its groundwater chemistry ghabayen et al 2006 qahman and larabi 2006 the characteristic chemical signature of the eocene water is ca2 rich water type with medium tds up to 5000 mg l and na cl 0 86 vengosh et al 2005 consequently the high na cl ratio in the eastern clusters c1 and c3 and some wells in c2 table 2 with a deficiency in ca2 reveal that the eastern side is impacted by eocene brackish invasion abu alnaeem et al 2018 with the dominance of direct iep 4 2 5 rainfall recharge rainfall recharge process could be higher in the northern area where the rainfall amount is double that in the south and the areas of sand dunes and calcareous sandstone are wider in coastal areas rainfall components are similar to that of seawater with na cl water type and na cl ratio 0 86 but with very low tds clusters c7 and c8 which are located in the northern rainy area are characterized by the lowest salinity in this area most of the wells of cluster c7 and all of c8 are freshwater where their tds values range from 617 to 1418 mg l av 922 mg l and 370 819 mg l av 640 mg l respectively table 2 4 2 6 water rock interaction processes in coastal aquifers the chemical composition of groundwater may be modified by a diversity of rock water interaction processes such as ion exchange and mineral dissolution monjerezi 2012 4 2 6 1 carbonate dissolution ca2 hco3 molar ratio versus tds mg l fig 9 shows that most of the wells of clusters c7 c8 c9 and c5 are located between the calcite dissolution ratio 1 2 and the dolomite dissolution ratio 1 4 i e within zone 0 25 0 5 this could happen as a result of rainfall recharge and or the acidity of the sewage infiltration and farming inputs in nitrate polluted areas the diagram displays a high surplus of ca2 in clusters c6 and c4 which may be attributed to reverse iep during seawater intrusion c6 and saltwater up coning c4 on the other hand clusters of c3 and c1 show a high deficiency in ca2 ions this deficiency may suggest the fixation of calcium ion during the continuous invasion of eocene water from the eastern areas 4 2 6 2 ion exchange process ion exchange process iep is one of the most important hydrogeochemical processes which is commonly determined using the classical methods such as cai and other ionic ratios it is commonly expected that freshwater recharge is dominated by ca hco3 but in coastal regions rainfall contents resemble seawater i e na cl water type with na c1 ratio of 0 86 rosenthal et al 2009 consequently the rainfall recharge process freshening process in coastal areas can change the na cl ratio of groundwater to appear as a fallacious salinization process the scatter plots of ionic ratios cai ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 and na cl fig 10 a b c show an upnormal location of the highest salinity clusters of c6 and c4 and the lowest salinity clusters of c7 and c8 they are located in the plots within the field of salinization as a result of the influence of reverse iep on these areas iep could also be evaluated by the scatter plot of na cl versus ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 fig 10d which is widely used by researchers carol et al 2013 huang et al 2013 it is found that the slope of the nine clusters is near 1 where c1 0 95 c2 0 97 c3 0 55 c4 0 98 c5 0 83 c6 0 92 c7 0 82 c8 0 87 and c9 0 83 are estimated thus these results indicate that ion exchange process is likely to be one of the major contributors to higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations in some clusters and higher na and k concentrations in other clusters these confusing results in interpretation provide a reasonable discussion of iep in aquifers and highlight the need for further methods to characterise these processes beyond the typical indices that are used based on ionic ratios 4 2 6 3 piper and chadha plots these plots show that most of the clustered data are plotted within the na cl water type field around 71 6 indicating that the saline water is dominant in groundwater chemistry of the gaza coastal aquifer fig 11 a and b the remaining clusters of c7 and c8 are located in zone 2 revealing that the dominance of ca mg cl in salinization area is as a result of reverse iep around 25 a few wells are scattered in na hco3 and ca hco3 water types so the freshwater and freshening areas are very limited and could be neglected this result is similar to the previous plots it is noticed also that the freshwater clusters c7 and c8 are located in the field of ca cl water type indicating salinization areas due to reverse iep 4 2 6 4 the novel integrated approach for this complex coastal aquifer system which is influenced by a diversity of natural and anthropogenic factors initially the dataset is split into nine clusters of different hydrogeochemical signatures using hca the clustered data is plotted on the iep sf ha wt plot fig 12 then on bsn plot fig 13 they elucidate the dominance of na cl 65 4 fig 12 with na cl so4 type in c6 c4 c1 and c2 and na cl hco3 type in c3 c5 and c9 fig 13 the prevailing water types in c7 and c8 are ca mg hco3 no3 type 15 9 and ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 ca mg cl is 8 of samples and na hco3 is 8 4 of samples figs 12 and 13 the presence of ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 which is a unique water type in c8 6 wells c5 1 well and c5 3 wells suggests the influence of fertilizers input in these areas actually the northern area is the only location which is influenced by the mixied inputs from sewage infiltration and farming activities while other areas are dominated by sewage inputs abu alnaeem et al 2018 these water types cannot be recorded by using the traditional plots as chadha and piper plots for visual iep identification and ca2 mg2 enrichment process investigation all the clustered data shows a negative trend except clusters c7 and c8 fig 12 this negative trend for the most of the clusters reveals that iep can be the dominant process in this area and ca2 mg2 enrichment process is limited within c7 and c8 the negative trend clusters in the right field are direct iep while those in the left field are reverse iep on the other hand the positive data trend cluster c7 and nearly horizontal trend c8 fig 12 reflect the increase of concentrations in both of na and ca2 mg2 in these areas c8 wells are divided into two groups based on their location on the iep sf ha wt plot a small one in the right field of the plot c8r and a large one in the left field c8l fig 12 the left position wells of clusters c7 and c8l may suggest a scenario of three hydrogeochemical processes which can happen in these areas while the right position wells of clusters c8r may suggest a scenario of two hydrogeochemical processes as will be discussed later 4 2 7 correlation analysis the linear association between na k cl cl and ca2 mg2 cl ratios for the nine clusters is mathematically estimated using correlation analysis a scale for measuring this relation to deduce the comparative degree of influence of the iep and ca2 mg2 enrichment is proposed in table 1 after applying the mathematical analysis on the nine clusters it is found that all the clusters show negative correlations except clusters c7 and c8 as shown in table 3 the highest negative values are recorded in c1 0 86 c2 0 87 and c4 0 81 while the positive and near zero values are recorded in clusters c7 and c8 these results confirm the previous visual outputs and indicate that iep can be the dominant process especially in the southern areas where the abundance of clay sediments favors iep mathematically reverse iep type is the dominant process in this area it can be mainly attributed to the wide effect of seawater intrusion saltwater up coning and sewage invasion on this area on the other hand ca2 mg2 enrichment process is more effective in the northern clusters c7 and c8 this result confirms the fact that dissolution of carbonate rocks is more likely in humid areas soumya et al 2013 this enrichment process is identified from the location of the clusters c7 and c8 within the diagonal field 11 on the iep sf ha wt plot fig 12 the sources of humidity in this northern area are related to higher rate of rainfall the existence of infiltration basins of the north gaza wastewater treatment plant ngwwtp beit lahia lake of improperly treated waste water on sand dunes beit lahia wadi crossing the northern area moreover the abundance of thick calcareous sandstone with a wide distribution of sand dunes in this northern area facilitates the recharging process in this way this approach helps in the differentiation between the more humid areas and more arid areas in this area a comparison between the nine clusters with the hydrochemical interpretation for each cluster is shown in table 3 4 2 8 the hydrochemical scenario of clusters c7 and c8 a hydrogeochemical schematic representation for this area fig 14 shows the suggested scenario for the sequence of hydrogeochemical processes which are influenced by these clusters c7 and c8l this northern rainy area is characterized by mixing recharge of treated wastewater irrigation return and rainfall recharge initially reverse iep may occur in the soil zone and unsaturated zone initial salinization process so na cl ratio is decreased from 1 2 in treated wastewater and 0 86 in coastal rainfall to 0 40 fig 14 then the flow of this acidic nitrate polluted water average no3 100 mg l could accelerate the dissolution of carbonates in the aquifer matrix and liberate ca2 and hco3 ions in this area the high no3 concentration in this area is derived from the mixed inputs of sewage infiltration and farming activities abu alnaeem et al 2018 finally the surplus of ca2 and mg2 ions in water may cause desorption of the na ions from the clay minerals in the aquifer matrix this direct iep could increase again the na cl ratios thus the na and ca2 mg2 concentrations are increased together along the groundwater flow paths however increasing ca2 mg2 content is more obvious than the increasing of na content in cluster c7 as shown from the minimum and maximum values of ca2 cl and na cl table 1 in cluster c8 there is nearly equal increase of ca2 and na contents as discussed in the correlation analysis and confirmed here by ca2 cl and na cl ratios table 1 this hydrogeochemical signature of ca hco3 type with low tds in c7 and c8l suggests the occurrence of freshening process in these areas but with high no3 content thus all of the wells in the northern rainy area belonging to clusters c7 and most of c8 show dilution chemistry due to continuous mixing input of rainfall recharge irrigation return flow and partially treated sewage infiltration on the other hand most of the southern clusters wells do not always receive the entire rainfall in terms of magnitude and actual adequate recharge does not take place for an effective influence on the chemistry of groundwater in the southern area this sequence of hydrogeochemical processes cannot be deduced and interpreted without applying nia 5 conclusion in this research nia which combines three techniques hca new hydrochemical analysis and correlation analysis is applied on ten physiochemical water chemistry parameters for 214 municipal wells belong to gaza coastal aquifer system gaza strip palestine in contrast to conventional approaches this approach enables accurate determination of iep precise identification of hydrogeochemical facies to characterise signatures of aquifer salinization and freshening discrimination between humid and arid areas and investigation of ca2 mg2 enrichment that may accompany iep and would not be explained using conventional methods hca yields nine distinct hydrogeochemical signature clusters iep is evaluated for the nine clusters using six conventional hydrogeochemical methods they show a confusing plot for the highly saline clusters c6 and c4 with the freshwater clusters c7 and c8 iep sf ha wt approach solved this puzzle by defining iep of the nine clusters based on their location and their trend on iep sf ha wt diagram it shows the dominance of iep and the wide impact of reverse iep as a result of the wide ranging influence of seawater intrusion saltwater up coning and sewage inputs similarly it illuminates the impact of direct iep and carbonate dissolution on the groundwater of the northern area also two hydrogeochemical processes accompanied with reverse iep have been deduced for the northern clusters c7 and c8 that would have not explained using other conventional methods moreover it reveals the predominance of na cl type 65 4 ca mg hco3 no3 15 9 na hco3 8 4 ca mg cl 8 and the existence of a unique ca mg no3 hco3 type 3 3 in the northern area as a new indication for the influence of fertilizers inputs in this area additionally it elucidates the humidity conditions of the northern area due to rainfall recharge irrigation return flow and partially treated sewage infiltration therefore the implication of this multi beneficial approach is essential to effectively manage the groundwater resources in water stressed regions such as the gaza coastal aquifer system and other similar aquifers systems elsewhere
