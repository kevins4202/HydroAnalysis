18295,extracellular polymeric substances eps from activated sludge comprise many organic constituents with polysaccharides and proteins as the main components of two different functionalities despite a number of previous eps studies a fundamental question remained unanswered namely whether the different eps components would have the same turnover cycle i e formation dissolution in biological wastewater treatment systems in this study we employed a stable isotope labeling approach based on isotope enriched substrates i e 13c glucose and 15nh4cl to examine the potential discrepancies in the turnover cycles among different major eps constituents our results based on substrate consumption in a batch bioreactor evidenced the existence of differences in carbon and nitrogen cycles within bulk eps with an earlier replenishment of organic carbon relative to organic nitrogen the changes in the 13c nuclear magnetic resonance 13c nmr spectra of eps with operation clarified the relative differences in the turnover periods among several identified eps structures with different chemical functionalities two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos on the 13c nmr spectra further showed that the substrate assimilated carbon functional groups appear to preferably formed within bulk eps in the order of o alkyl carbons amides Î± amino acids aliphatic carbons this study provides a novel insight into the dissimilar formation rates of different eps structures after substrate assimilation this isotope labeling approach can be further applied to determine the mass balance among the substrate biomass and bound soluble eps within activated sludge systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps stable isotope two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos source tracking 1 introduction activated sludge consisting of numerous and complex microbial species play critical roles in biological wastewater treatment systems by degrading existing organic matters and consuming nutrients as their substrates ju and zhang 2014 microbial cells tend to aggregate and form flocs rather than to remain in dispersion the extracellular matrix of the flocs serves as a channel for substrates to be transported into the flocs and also for the interactions among microbial cells shi et al 2017 the stability of the matrix as an indicator for the integrity of flocs structures is heavily affected by the operating conditions of a given treatment system the involved environmental factors and the composition of influent wastewater more et al 2014 in turn the structure of the flocs and the chemical composition of the matrix contribute to controlling the quality of produced water the extent of degradation the settleability and dewaterability of activated sludge some common phenomena occurring within the matrix include sorption xu et al 2013 enzymes retention comte et al 2006 mutual cooperation among microorganisms through cell signaling yeon et al 2009 tolerances to foreign toxicity hou et al 2015 and degradation of substrates by numerous enzymes in the matrix in stress conditions this platform structure i e extracellular matrix can act as a source of nutrients and organic substrates through self hydrolysis the formation of the enclosing matrix for microorganisms is a continuous process that involves the cycling of carbon nitrogen and other elements as the matrix is still a so called dark matter to researchers a fuller comprehension of the individual functions formation and or degradation cycles of the different major constituents is of immense theoretical and practical value flemming et al 2016 extracellular polymeric substances eps are known to constitute a fundamental unit of the microbial matrix consequently an in depth understanding of the fate and the properties of the major constituents in eps as well as the bulk or overall eps properties is crucial for the optimized design and operation of biological treatment systems eps may cause several environmental problems in wastewater treatment systems which include membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors and the formation of soluble microbial products in effluent organic matter as a potential pollution source to receiving water bodies several engineering approaches have been attempted to control the excessive production of eps the common practices are the manipulation of the operational parameters such as hydraulic and sludge retention times huang et al 2011 the addition of polymers or media iversen et al 2009 and a microbiological approach based on quorum quenching yeon et al 2009 eps mostly consist of protein polysaccharide humic substances and secondary constituents such as deoxyribonucleic acid dna and lipids basuvaraj et al 2015 wei et al 2012 these eps components have been typically determined using conventional colorimetric analyses such as the lowry and the phenol methods for proteins and polysaccharides respectively recently fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography have also been employed for the characterization of eps such emerging and on line compatible tools have revealed the eps characteristics with respect to the distributions of molecular sizes and optical properties jacquin et al 2017 xiao et al 2017b however these tools are very limited in the identification of the individual fate or turnover periods of different eps components functionalities because the newly formed and the removed components are indistinguishable by such methods such lacking information if obtained could help to better understand the variations in eps composition which is largely affected by different operational and environmental conditions the individual formation dissolution cycles of different eps components can help the explication of the detailed roles of eps in biological treatment systems and can also provide useful insights for optimal control of specific eps constituents in the treated effluent the diversity and relative distributions of different eps constituents functional groups have been successfully probed using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy and or nuclear magnetic resonance nmr duan et al 2013 jiao et al 2010 wei et al 2012 stable isotope analysis has been established as a reliable tool for element source identification and flow tracking in a given biological system gehring et al 2016 onodera et al 2018 2015 onodera et al 2015 demonstrated the use of stable isotope ratios as a tracer for understanding the spatial dynamics of suspended solids and microbial ecosystems within a wastewater treatment system in particular stable isotope labeling approach facilitates the identification of the specific pathways of organic compounds in their cycles provided the routes are accompanied by isotopic fractionation there are a few previous studies available to highlight the roles of different eps constituents in the food web of natural systems through isotope labeling analysis evrard et al 2008 miyatake et al 2014 moerdijk poortvliet et al 2018 for example miyatake et al 2014 studied the carbon flow from benthic diatoms to bacteria after spraying 13c labeled bicarbonates on sediments however to the best of the author s knowledge no attempt has been made to track the individual turnover cycles of different eps components in biological wastewater treatment systems this study employed an isotope labeling approach to truly examine the formation dissolution cycles of bulk eps and the different eps components functional groups in activated sludge process in particular combined use of stable isotopes analysis and 13c cross polarization magic angle spinning cpmas nmr could provide the extent of the formation of new eps and the dissolution of its different components high resolution 13c cpmas nmr spectroscopy is highly suitable for the acquisition of the information concerning the chemical structures or functional groups of organic molecules in eps jiao et al 2010 yu et al 2011 it has a great potential to reflect the environmental fate of organic structures in biological systems when 13c labeled substrate is fed to activated sludge microorganisms the main objectives were thus 1 to compare the carbon and nitrogen cycles of bulk eps in a typical batch bioreactor during a mean cell residence time and 2 to determine the sequential orders of the formation and dissolution or transformation into other forms cycles of the major constituents including proteins and polysaccharides in eps to this end 13c and 15n labeled compounds were utilized as the main constituents glucose and nh4cl respectively of the substrates of an activated sludge system which allows the distinction between the eps from new cells formed by the consumption of isotope labeled substrates and the old eps not related to the new substrates it is notable that the scope of the current study is limited to the formation dissolution cycles of different eps functionalities not encompassing the whole carbon cycles concerning biomass and all the transformed forms occurring in activated sludge systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of a batch activated sludge bioreactor a batch bioreactor with a working volume of 5 l was operated with a continuous air supply of 4 liters min the seed sludge was collected from an aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in seoul south korea before the start of the experiment the collected sludge was acclimated to the new laboratory condition using synthetic wastewater the bioreactor was operated under aerobic condition with the substrate i e synthetic wastewater containing glucose 500 mg l nh4cl and kh2po4 as the major sources of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus respectively along with trace amounts of micro nutrients i e mgso4 fecl3 and cacl2 nahco3 was used to maintain the influent ph to 7 0 the feed composition is detailed in table s1 the substrate was prepared in 3 l deionized di water by adding one by one constituent and stirring for more than 1 h a similar volume 3 l of the supernatant was replenished every 24 h the organic loading rate was maintained at 0 1 kg cod m3 the system operated with a solid retention time srt of 35 days the amount of waste sludge was set to equal the size of samples collected for eps analysis after each cycle of 24 h a standard procedure of measuring mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss was adopted apha et al 2005 2 2 addition of isotope labeled substrates 13c labeled glucose d glucose u 13c6 99 and 15n labeled ammonium chloride 15nh4cl nlm 467 5 99 were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories inc usa the two labeled substrates were diluted so that the influent finally contained 5 of 13c labeled glucose and 15n labeled nh4cl considering the natural abundances of 13c 1 1 and 15n 0 4 the added labeled compounds corresponded to 3 9 19 5 mg l 13c glucose in 500 mg l of total glucose and 4 6 1 78 mg l 15nh4cl in 38 5 mg l of total nh4cl c n ratio in the influent was maintained at 20 the unlabeled substrates refer to the influent without the addition of 13c labeled glucose and 15nh4cl in general the phases of operation may consist of i new eps formation phase or the first phase in which microorganisms consume the isotope labeled substrates and assimilate them to form new eps as reflected by increased stable isotope contents and ii eps dissolution elimination phase or the second phase in which isotope contents are on the decline with the hydrolysis of the isotope enriched eps and or the wasted activated sludge during the first phase of operation the influent isotope labeled glucose and nh4cl content were maintained at 5 by weight while unlabeled substrates were fed to the sludge only during the second phase to this end a flexible feeding strategy was adopted to reflect the variations of the stable isotope contents once eps reached a saturation state of the element 13c or 15n or reached the srt period i e 35 days the labeled substrates were replaced with unlabeled counterparts in the influent wastewater since it was assumed that carbon and nitrogen had different turnover periods the division of the two phases might be element specific and thus the completed time of the first phase could differ between the two elements the division of the phases is presented in fig 1 2 3 eps extraction eps samples were collected every 24 h of operation before the introduction of substrates eps were extracted using the so called heating method as described in xiao et al 2017a with some modifications briefly 50 ml of sludge samples which were collected in conical tubes in triplicate from the bioreactor were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant containing soluble eps was collected the flocs were resuspended vortexed in a 0 05 nacl solution and heated at 70 c in a water bath for 30 min the bound eps were obtained by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min the eps samples were then filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m cellulose triacetate cta membrane filter advantec mfs inc japan as suggested by several previous studies keithley and kirisits 2018 ni et al 2009 wei et al 2012 zsolnay 2003 and stored at 10 c for further analysis 2 4 analyses for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of eps dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations i e organic carbon content of eps samples were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu inc japan for stable isotope analyses the extracted eps were freeze dried at a temperature of 90 c for a week before the 13c isotope measurements the inorganic carbon was removed through acid fumigation using 12n hcl while the nitrogen isotope was measured without any pretreatment ramnarine et al 2011 stable carbon 13c and nitrogen 15n isotope ratios of the samples were measured using elemental analyzer coupled with isotope ratio mass spectroscopy ea irms euroea isoprime irms gv instruments uk for convenience the per mil units were converted to atom percent atom which represents the absolute number of atoms of a given isotope in 100 atoms of a total element based on the following equation coplen 2011 a t o m 100 1 Î´ 100 1 r r 1 where Î´ refers to 13c or 15n and rr is the reference values for either 13c 12c or 15n 14n which are 0 011237 and 0 003676 respectively craig 1957 junk and svec 1958 the standard reference materials are vienna pee dee belemnite vpdp for 13c 12c and atmospheric n2 for 15n 14n turnover rate of each content of eps can be determined by calculating the ratio in percentage between the atom at any operation day relative to the natural abundance i e observed atom minus 1 1 for 13c or 0 4 for 15n and the initial composition of the labeled compounds added in the influent 3 9 for 13c or 4 6 for 15n 2 5 13c cpmas nmr spectroscopy a solid state 13c cpmas nmr was employed to track the individual structural changes within bulk eps during the whole operation period of up to 61 days the 13c nmr analyses were performed using an agilent vnmrs 700mhz spectrometer agilent technologies usa the measurement conditions were set to 10 khz for the spinning rate 5 ms for the acquisition time and 3 s for the recycling delay the temperature was maintained at 25 c the spectral smoothing and the integral area calculation were conducted using origin 2018 2 6 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos combined with 13c nmr 2d cos was applied to the 13c nmr spectra of eps to enhance the resolution of the spectral changes and to capture the sequential changes of different eps structures yu et al 2011 2d cos maps were generated using the open source software 2dshige http sites google com site shigemorita home 2dshige the principles and the detailed mathematical formulas of 2d cos are well described in noda and ozaki 2005 in this study the operation time of the bioreactor was taken into account as an external perturbation to induce the 13c nmr spectral changes briefly 2d cos generates two different maps consisting of i synchronous map showing the auto peaks located on the diagonal and the cross peaks placed off diagonal and ii asynchronous map illustrating the dynamic changes of the signals at different wavenumbers for this study the intensities and the signs of auto peaks refer to the extent of the spectral changes with respect to the operation of the bioreactor or increasing external perturbation and the direction of the changes respectively on the other hand the cross peaks of the asynchronous map provides information on the sequential changes of different eps structures the interpretation of the 2d cos maps followed exclusively the so called noda s rule noda et al 2000 in brief the chemical shifts at the x axis of the asynchronous map precede those at the y axis if the signs are the same between the synchronous and the asynchronous maps if the signs are different the relative order is reversed 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon and nitrogen cycling in the eps the isotope contents of eps calculated based on the 13c and 15n isotope ratios exhibited dynamic variations within the time frame of the operation fig 1 the assimilation of the labeled substrates contained in the influent was mirrored by the increasing trend of the isotope contents or atom in the eps with increasing operation time in the first phase fig 1 the assimilation of 13c into eps seems to occur relatively faster than that of 15n as shown by the peak of the isotope content at an earlier operation time for example on the operation days of 10 and 26 the 13c result showed that the turnover rates of carbon contents in eps were up to 70 and 100 respectively which contrasted with 37 and 60 for nitrogen contents reflected in 15n such fast assimilation of carbon substrate into eps can be explained by the relatively rapid microbial utilization of carbon versus nitrogen containing compounds which agrees with the previous observation zhang and bishop 2003 of a higher microbial degradation rate for carbohydrates compared to proteins for the microbial consumption of eps as substrate the peaks of the 13c isotope contents reflect the enrichment maxima of the labeled substrate in the eps following microbial utilization unlike the 13c labeled glucose the assimilation cycle of the labeled nitrogen into new eps was behind the srt set for the bioreactor i e 35 days fig 1 after the completion of one srt period the maximum enrichment of 15n in eps was found to be 3 5 there are several sinks for carbon and nitrogen in biological wastewater systems which include biomass and eps bound and soluble although all of these components play important roles in operating the systems bound eps has been in the spotlight due to the well known functions hampering the effective operation of treatment systems such as low dewaterability and membrane fouling detecting the abundances of 13c and 15n makes it possible to discriminate the turnover periods between carbon and nitrogen enriched structures in eps considering that variations of the labeled carbon and nitrogen contents in eps may represent the individual cycles of polysaccharides and proteins plus other n containing structures e g n glycans and lipids these results imply that the eps formation cycle could be different between the two main eps components with the faster formation of polysaccharides versus proteins plus n containing structures within bulk eps this finding also suggests a shorter turnover or replenishment time taken for polysaccharides than for nitrogen containing constituents within bulk eps no previous study has explored the whole cycles of different elements in eps with respect to their formation and degradation dissolution in biological treatment systems it is interesting to note that the assimilation frequency of nitrogen into eps was similar to the srt period while that of carbon was shorter as demonstrated by the times of the two labeled isotope peaks fig 1 it can be inferred from the results that compared to the carbon related eps structures such as polysaccharides nitrogen containing eps structures e g proteins n glycans and others might be more refractory in nature and or are formed at a slower rate after the assimilation of nitrogen substrate carbon and nitrogen are the major elements in eps to determine the relative composition of polysaccharides and proteins plus other n containing compounds their relative abundances in eps are closely related to microbial communities in sludge and their growth phases sheng et al 2006 for example a previous study has shown a lower nitrogen content of soluble eps in the endogenous phase relative to the exogenous phase maqbool et al 2019 the relative ratios of carbon to nitrogen have also been widely used as an indicator to represent the relative abundances of polysaccharides and proteins in eps kroll et al 2014 stewart et al 2013 it was previously reported that the ratios of polysaccharides to proteins could determine the major chemical features of eps such as hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and aromatic contents zhang et al 2007 furthermore the ratios can be associated with many environmental problems occurring in wastewater treatment systems such as membrane fouling and dewaterability lin et al 2014 the 13c and 15n abundances interpret the formation dissolution cycles of eps in terms of carbon and nitrogen fig 1 it is important to note that eps formation and dissolution or elimination with wasting sludge is a continuous process in biological wastewater treatments to confirm the uniform production of eps with time the bulk doc concentrations were measured fig s1 which helped to avoid any fallacious calculation of the isotope abundances that might be caused by a substantial increase or decrease in eps concentration the bulk eps concentrations or doc remained nearly constant without any increasing or decreasing trends shown throughout the operation fig s1 this is also indicative of the normal functioning of the activated sludge with respect to the eps formation irrespective of the presence absence of the isotope labeled substrates in the influent again this confirms the successful application of the isotope labeling approach for tracking the turnover i e formation dissolution cycles of eps which provides much more valuable information on the fate of eps in a given biological treatment system than does conventional bulk eps analyses in sum the temporal variations of the isotope contents expressed by atom evidenced the existence of different formation dissolution frequencies between carbon and nitrogen enriched structures within bulk eps 3 2 relative changes of different eps structures upon substrate consumption the 13c nmr spectra of the eps were compared at varying operation time fig 2 several peaks were observed in the nmr spectra at different days of operation the signal assignments for the chemical shifts presented in table 1 follow previous studies on eps jiao et al 2010 metzger et al 2009 yu et al 2011 metzger et al 2009 utilized the 13c cpmas nmr spectra of the eps formed by pseudomonas putida and aureobasidum pullulans to probe the different organic structures in the eps the cpmas method reduces to a great extent the effects of chemical shift anisotropy leading to an improved resolution compared to the conventional solid state nmr furthermore this technique can minimize the interference from homonuclear e g 13c 13c dipolar coupling norris et al 2012 in comparison with liquid state nmr the 13c cpmas nmr is sensitive to a broader range of polymers in eps is non destructive of samples and does not require a prior extraction step a total of six different carbon structures were identified from the measured spectra the peak at 0 45 ppm is indicative of aliphatic carbon the peak was assigned to methylene groups in long chain aliphatic structures caricasole et al 2010 metzger et al 2009 metzger et al 2009 linked such a structure to phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides wang et al 2017 referred this to humic substances and lipid structures for this study there is one broad peak at the chemical shifts 0 45 ppm which contrasted with the multiple peaks previously reported jiao et al 2010 metzger et al 2009 the area under the curve between 45 and 65 ppm represents the Î± carbon of amino acids with o or n substituted aliphatic carbon structures which can be referred to as peptide backbones the chemical shifts of 65 110 ppm are unambiguously associated with the sugar structures of eps at this range the fraction at the lower shift ppm is more related to the o alkyl carbon of polysaccharides while that at the longer shift represents the anomeric carbon metzger et al 2009 simpson and simpson 2017 the chemical shifts between 110 and 160 ppm have been assigned to aromatic carbon structures which can be linked to the presence of phenolic groups and proteins yu et al 2011 meanwhile the shifts between 160 and 200 ppm predominantly indicate amidyl carbonyl carbon jiao et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 substantial changes in the nmr spectra were observed for the eps collected at different operation days at the first phase or the eps formation phase most of the peaks at the chemical shifts of 0 90 ppm and 160 180 ppm exhibited increasing trends as the operation progressed fig 2a the increasing signals indicate that the associated carbon structures were newly formed in the eps as the result of the assimilation of the isotope labeled substrates on the other hand the same signals were on decline with time at the second phase i e the eps declining phase when unlabeled substrates started to be consumed by the microorganisms in the activated sludge fig 2b in this study the extents of the increases in the nmr spectral signals were compared at different chemical shifts to explore the relative contributions of the two main eps components i e polysaccharides and proteins to the formation or the dissolution of the eps or the eps turnover cycle for the estimation of the eps structures associated with either polysaccharides or proteins and aromatic contents the approach of metzger et al 2009 was adopted in which the combined signals of o alkyl and anomeric c were taken into account to estimate the contribution of polysaccharides to bulk eps while those of aliphatic c Î±c of amino acids aromatic and amides were used for proteins along with other n containing structures the relative abundances of the individual eps structures categorized based on different chemical shift ranges are presented at different operation days in table s2 except for the first few days of operation the relative distribution of the polysaccharide structures showed a general increasing trend during the first phase of operation fig 3 while those of proteins and other n containing structures declined with time these results suggest that the microorganisms in the activated sludge tended to produce preferably polysaccharides over proteins within bulk eps as substrates are assimilated it can also be deduced that polysaccharides are replenished faster than proteins during an eps turnover cycle during the second phase of operation on the other hand the protein and other n containing structures content became relatively more enriched with time while the polysaccharide composition was diminished fig 3 again the results suggest that the protein related carbon structures are likely to be more resistant to dissolution or transformation into other forms compared to polysaccharide within bulk eps this study is the first report that used the stable isotope labeling approach to evidence the existence of different preferences for polysaccharides and proteins with other structures upon the formation of eps in biological wastewater treatment from the novel findings it can be posited that the activated sludge microorganisms are likely to preferentially form polysaccharides relative to other structures in their eps via the assimilation of substrates our results also indicate that polysaccharides might be dissimulated more easily than proteins or other structures within bulk eps and thus that the former might have a relatively shorter frequency in the formation dissolution cycle than the latter 3 3 comparing the formation tendencies of different carbon structures of eps via 2d cos the dissimilar frequencies in the formation of different eps carbon structures which were previously identified from the nmr spectra were further explored using 2d cos with increasing days of operation from 1 to 26 days as an external perturbation the synchronous and asynchronous maps generated from the 2d cos are shown in fig 4 a time span of 26 days was selected for the eps formation period as the 13c nmr data showed that it well matched the transition time of the variations in the estimated polysaccharide or protein contents fig 3 in the synchronous map five main auto peaks were identified which are located at 22 53 73 92 and 169 ppm and they were assigned to aliphatic carbon Î± carbon o alkyl carbon anomeric carbon and amides groups respectively the peak intensity at 73 ppm corresponding to a polysaccharide structure was the highest among the five identified peaks suggesting that the carbon structure is the most predominant structure in the newly formed eps meanwhile the off diagonal peaks represent the different tendencies of the changes at the chemical shifts of the x and y axes for example the long shaped peak at 165 175 ppm x axis 12 83 ppm y axis indicates the opposing direction of the spectral changes at the two different ranges of the chemical shifts which agreed with the previous observation on the changes of the 13c nmr spectra fig 2a the sequential orders of the changes in different eps structures can be captured by comparing the cross peaks of the asynchronous map there are two positive peaks at 73 22 ppm and 73 53 ppm while one negative peak appears at 169 73 ppm based on the noda s rule if the peaks overlying the same region of both synchronous and asynchronous maps have the same sign the spectral changes corresponding to the x axis occur earlier than those at the y axis i e preferential changes the sequence is reversed if the overlapping peaks in both maps have the opposite sign thus an interpretation of the 2d cos results in this study indicates that the eps carbon structures were preferentially formed at the chemical shifts following the order of 73 ppm 169 ppm 53 ppm 22 ppm table s3 based on the assignments of the carbon structures and the 2d cos interpretation eps seems to be formed following a decreasing structural preference of o alkyl carbon amide group Î± carbon aliphatic carbon which corresponded to polysaccharides 73 ppm proteins and or other n containing compounds 169 ppm proteins 53 ppm proteins and or other n containing compounds 22 ppm this sequence is consistent with the previous result of fig 1 showing the shorter assimilation frequency of carbon relative to nitrogen in eps thus it appears that polysaccharides are is precedent to proteins and other nitrogen containing structures in the formation of eps 3 4 environmental implications the combined results from the stable isotope analysis and 13c cpmas nmr spectra provide a novel insight into dissimilar formation rates of the eps structures with different chemical functionalities these findings have implications for the operation of biological treatment systems the optimization of these systems and the potential environmental problems associated with eps this study also broadens the understanding of the changes in eps composition during the operation of treatment systems the method employed in this study which harnessed isotope labeled substrates for the evaluation of the mechanisms of bioreactors is not limited to the analysis of eps as it can be extensively applied in other studies tracking the sources and the pathways of the organic matter produced in biological treatment systems the information provided in this study would potentially assist in the optimization of biological treatment systems to produce effluents with eps containing relatively more labile organic compounds in addition the novel stable isotope approach demonstrated in this study could be modified to generate mass balance data for use in the evaluation of the utilization of substrate and its transformation into biomass the formation of eps and smp such applications could be extended to the development of a mathematical model for microbial growth and eps production the demonstrated technique is potentially applicable in the explication of the complex mechanisms of the biological assimilation of wastewater containing organic matters of various origins including organic pollutants taken together the stable isotope labeling approach in tandem with 2d cos tools employed in this study provided a novel approach to untangle the complex behaviors of different eps structures and the associated pathways occurring in biological treatment systems 4 conclusion the turnover cycles of different carbon structures within bulk eps were explored by adding 13c and 15n labeled substrates to the activated sludge and applying 2d cos on the nmr spectra of the formed eps the following main conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes analyses revealed that the carbon contents of eps could be replenished earlier than the nitrogen counterpart and also that the latter may be relatively more resistant to microbial consumption for a srt period of 35 days the turnover frequency of eps carbon contents was 26 days while that of the nitrogen containing structures was longer 2 different frequencies for the formation and the dissolution of eps carbon structures were distinguished by the 13c cpmas nmr spectra the structures assigned to polysaccharides were preferentially formed and dissimulated faster relative to structures assigned to proteins and other nitrogen containing structures consequently at end of the formation cycle of polysaccharides the eps was more enriched with nitrogen contents 3 2d cos based on 13c nmr spectra was successfully applied to distinguish the formation frequencies between different carbon structures present within the bulk eps the sequential formation of structures within bulk eps followed the relative order of o alkyl carbon amide group Î± carbon aliphatic carbon 4 the stable isotope labeling approach in combination with 2d cos provided a novel analytical methodology to untangle the complex behaviors of different eps structures and the associated pathways occurring in biological treatment systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18295,extracellular polymeric substances eps from activated sludge comprise many organic constituents with polysaccharides and proteins as the main components of two different functionalities despite a number of previous eps studies a fundamental question remained unanswered namely whether the different eps components would have the same turnover cycle i e formation dissolution in biological wastewater treatment systems in this study we employed a stable isotope labeling approach based on isotope enriched substrates i e 13c glucose and 15nh4cl to examine the potential discrepancies in the turnover cycles among different major eps constituents our results based on substrate consumption in a batch bioreactor evidenced the existence of differences in carbon and nitrogen cycles within bulk eps with an earlier replenishment of organic carbon relative to organic nitrogen the changes in the 13c nuclear magnetic resonance 13c nmr spectra of eps with operation clarified the relative differences in the turnover periods among several identified eps structures with different chemical functionalities two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos on the 13c nmr spectra further showed that the substrate assimilated carbon functional groups appear to preferably formed within bulk eps in the order of o alkyl carbons amides Î± amino acids aliphatic carbons this study provides a novel insight into the dissimilar formation rates of different eps structures after substrate assimilation this isotope labeling approach can be further applied to determine the mass balance among the substrate biomass and bound soluble eps within activated sludge systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps stable isotope two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos source tracking 1 introduction activated sludge consisting of numerous and complex microbial species play critical roles in biological wastewater treatment systems by degrading existing organic matters and consuming nutrients as their substrates ju and zhang 2014 microbial cells tend to aggregate and form flocs rather than to remain in dispersion the extracellular matrix of the flocs serves as a channel for substrates to be transported into the flocs and also for the interactions among microbial cells shi et al 2017 the stability of the matrix as an indicator for the integrity of flocs structures is heavily affected by the operating conditions of a given treatment system the involved environmental factors and the composition of influent wastewater more et al 2014 in turn the structure of the flocs and the chemical composition of the matrix contribute to controlling the quality of produced water the extent of degradation the settleability and dewaterability of activated sludge some common phenomena occurring within the matrix include sorption xu et al 2013 enzymes retention comte et al 2006 mutual cooperation among microorganisms through cell signaling yeon et al 2009 tolerances to foreign toxicity hou et al 2015 and degradation of substrates by numerous enzymes in the matrix in stress conditions this platform structure i e extracellular matrix can act as a source of nutrients and organic substrates through self hydrolysis the formation of the enclosing matrix for microorganisms is a continuous process that involves the cycling of carbon nitrogen and other elements as the matrix is still a so called dark matter to researchers a fuller comprehension of the individual functions formation and or degradation cycles of the different major constituents is of immense theoretical and practical value flemming et al 2016 extracellular polymeric substances eps are known to constitute a fundamental unit of the microbial matrix consequently an in depth understanding of the fate and the properties of the major constituents in eps as well as the bulk or overall eps properties is crucial for the optimized design and operation of biological treatment systems eps may cause several environmental problems in wastewater treatment systems which include membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors and the formation of soluble microbial products in effluent organic matter as a potential pollution source to receiving water bodies several engineering approaches have been attempted to control the excessive production of eps the common practices are the manipulation of the operational parameters such as hydraulic and sludge retention times huang et al 2011 the addition of polymers or media iversen et al 2009 and a microbiological approach based on quorum quenching yeon et al 2009 eps mostly consist of protein polysaccharide humic substances and secondary constituents such as deoxyribonucleic acid dna and lipids basuvaraj et al 2015 wei et al 2012 these eps components have been typically determined using conventional colorimetric analyses such as the lowry and the phenol methods for proteins and polysaccharides respectively recently fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography have also been employed for the characterization of eps such emerging and on line compatible tools have revealed the eps characteristics with respect to the distributions of molecular sizes and optical properties jacquin et al 2017 xiao et al 2017b however these tools are very limited in the identification of the individual fate or turnover periods of different eps components functionalities because the newly formed and the removed components are indistinguishable by such methods such lacking information if obtained could help to better understand the variations in eps composition which is largely affected by different operational and environmental conditions the individual formation dissolution cycles of different eps components can help the explication of the detailed roles of eps in biological treatment systems and can also provide useful insights for optimal control of specific eps constituents in the treated effluent the diversity and relative distributions of different eps constituents functional groups have been successfully probed using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy and or nuclear magnetic resonance nmr duan et al 2013 jiao et al 2010 wei et al 2012 stable isotope analysis has been established as a reliable tool for element source identification and flow tracking in a given biological system gehring et al 2016 onodera et al 2018 2015 onodera et al 2015 demonstrated the use of stable isotope ratios as a tracer for understanding the spatial dynamics of suspended solids and microbial ecosystems within a wastewater treatment system in particular stable isotope labeling approach facilitates the identification of the specific pathways of organic compounds in their cycles provided the routes are accompanied by isotopic fractionation there are a few previous studies available to highlight the roles of different eps constituents in the food web of natural systems through isotope labeling analysis evrard et al 2008 miyatake et al 2014 moerdijk poortvliet et al 2018 for example miyatake et al 2014 studied the carbon flow from benthic diatoms to bacteria after spraying 13c labeled bicarbonates on sediments however to the best of the author s knowledge no attempt has been made to track the individual turnover cycles of different eps components in biological wastewater treatment systems this study employed an isotope labeling approach to truly examine the formation dissolution cycles of bulk eps and the different eps components functional groups in activated sludge process in particular combined use of stable isotopes analysis and 13c cross polarization magic angle spinning cpmas nmr could provide the extent of the formation of new eps and the dissolution of its different components high resolution 13c cpmas nmr spectroscopy is highly suitable for the acquisition of the information concerning the chemical structures or functional groups of organic molecules in eps jiao et al 2010 yu et al 2011 it has a great potential to reflect the environmental fate of organic structures in biological systems when 13c labeled substrate is fed to activated sludge microorganisms the main objectives were thus 1 to compare the carbon and nitrogen cycles of bulk eps in a typical batch bioreactor during a mean cell residence time and 2 to determine the sequential orders of the formation and dissolution or transformation into other forms cycles of the major constituents including proteins and polysaccharides in eps to this end 13c and 15n labeled compounds were utilized as the main constituents glucose and nh4cl respectively of the substrates of an activated sludge system which allows the distinction between the eps from new cells formed by the consumption of isotope labeled substrates and the old eps not related to the new substrates it is notable that the scope of the current study is limited to the formation dissolution cycles of different eps functionalities not encompassing the whole carbon cycles concerning biomass and all the transformed forms occurring in activated sludge systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of a batch activated sludge bioreactor a batch bioreactor with a working volume of 5 l was operated with a continuous air supply of 4 liters min the seed sludge was collected from an aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in seoul south korea before the start of the experiment the collected sludge was acclimated to the new laboratory condition using synthetic wastewater the bioreactor was operated under aerobic condition with the substrate i e synthetic wastewater containing glucose 500 mg l nh4cl and kh2po4 as the major sources of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus respectively along with trace amounts of micro nutrients i e mgso4 fecl3 and cacl2 nahco3 was used to maintain the influent ph to 7 0 the feed composition is detailed in table s1 the substrate was prepared in 3 l deionized di water by adding one by one constituent and stirring for more than 1 h a similar volume 3 l of the supernatant was replenished every 24 h the organic loading rate was maintained at 0 1 kg cod m3 the system operated with a solid retention time srt of 35 days the amount of waste sludge was set to equal the size of samples collected for eps analysis after each cycle of 24 h a standard procedure of measuring mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss was adopted apha et al 2005 2 2 addition of isotope labeled substrates 13c labeled glucose d glucose u 13c6 99 and 15n labeled ammonium chloride 15nh4cl nlm 467 5 99 were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories inc usa the two labeled substrates were diluted so that the influent finally contained 5 of 13c labeled glucose and 15n labeled nh4cl considering the natural abundances of 13c 1 1 and 15n 0 4 the added labeled compounds corresponded to 3 9 19 5 mg l 13c glucose in 500 mg l of total glucose and 4 6 1 78 mg l 15nh4cl in 38 5 mg l of total nh4cl c n ratio in the influent was maintained at 20 the unlabeled substrates refer to the influent without the addition of 13c labeled glucose and 15nh4cl in general the phases of operation may consist of i new eps formation phase or the first phase in which microorganisms consume the isotope labeled substrates and assimilate them to form new eps as reflected by increased stable isotope contents and ii eps dissolution elimination phase or the second phase in which isotope contents are on the decline with the hydrolysis of the isotope enriched eps and or the wasted activated sludge during the first phase of operation the influent isotope labeled glucose and nh4cl content were maintained at 5 by weight while unlabeled substrates were fed to the sludge only during the second phase to this end a flexible feeding strategy was adopted to reflect the variations of the stable isotope contents once eps reached a saturation state of the element 13c or 15n or reached the srt period i e 35 days the labeled substrates were replaced with unlabeled counterparts in the influent wastewater since it was assumed that carbon and nitrogen had different turnover periods the division of the two phases might be element specific and thus the completed time of the first phase could differ between the two elements the division of the phases is presented in fig 1 2 3 eps extraction eps samples were collected every 24 h of operation before the introduction of substrates eps were extracted using the so called heating method as described in xiao et al 2017a with some modifications briefly 50 ml of sludge samples which were collected in conical tubes in triplicate from the bioreactor were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant containing soluble eps was collected the flocs were resuspended vortexed in a 0 05 nacl solution and heated at 70 c in a water bath for 30 min the bound eps were obtained by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min the eps samples were then filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m cellulose triacetate cta membrane filter advantec mfs inc japan as suggested by several previous studies keithley and kirisits 2018 ni et al 2009 wei et al 2012 zsolnay 2003 and stored at 10 c for further analysis 2 4 analyses for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of eps dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations i e organic carbon content of eps samples were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu inc japan for stable isotope analyses the extracted eps were freeze dried at a temperature of 90 c for a week before the 13c isotope measurements the inorganic carbon was removed through acid fumigation using 12n hcl while the nitrogen isotope was measured without any pretreatment ramnarine et al 2011 stable carbon 13c and nitrogen 15n isotope ratios of the samples were measured using elemental analyzer coupled with isotope ratio mass spectroscopy ea irms euroea isoprime irms gv instruments uk for convenience the per mil units were converted to atom percent atom which represents the absolute number of atoms of a given isotope in 100 atoms of a total element based on the following equation coplen 2011 a t o m 100 1 Î´ 100 1 r r 1 where Î´ refers to 13c or 15n and rr is the reference values for either 13c 12c or 15n 14n which are 0 011237 and 0 003676 respectively craig 1957 junk and svec 1958 the standard reference materials are vienna pee dee belemnite vpdp for 13c 12c and atmospheric n2 for 15n 14n turnover rate of each content of eps can be determined by calculating the ratio in percentage between the atom at any operation day relative to the natural abundance i e observed atom minus 1 1 for 13c or 0 4 for 15n and the initial composition of the labeled compounds added in the influent 3 9 for 13c or 4 6 for 15n 2 5 13c cpmas nmr spectroscopy a solid state 13c cpmas nmr was employed to track the individual structural changes within bulk eps during the whole operation period of up to 61 days the 13c nmr analyses were performed using an agilent vnmrs 700mhz spectrometer agilent technologies usa the measurement conditions were set to 10 khz for the spinning rate 5 ms for the acquisition time and 3 s for the recycling delay the temperature was maintained at 25 c the spectral smoothing and the integral area calculation were conducted using origin 2018 2 6 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos combined with 13c nmr 2d cos was applied to the 13c nmr spectra of eps to enhance the resolution of the spectral changes and to capture the sequential changes of different eps structures yu et al 2011 2d cos maps were generated using the open source software 2dshige http sites google com site shigemorita home 2dshige the principles and the detailed mathematical formulas of 2d cos are well described in noda and ozaki 2005 in this study the operation time of the bioreactor was taken into account as an external perturbation to induce the 13c nmr spectral changes briefly 2d cos generates two different maps consisting of i synchronous map showing the auto peaks located on the diagonal and the cross peaks placed off diagonal and ii asynchronous map illustrating the dynamic changes of the signals at different wavenumbers for this study the intensities and the signs of auto peaks refer to the extent of the spectral changes with respect to the operation of the bioreactor or increasing external perturbation and the direction of the changes respectively on the other hand the cross peaks of the asynchronous map provides information on the sequential changes of different eps structures the interpretation of the 2d cos maps followed exclusively the so called noda s rule noda et al 2000 in brief the chemical shifts at the x axis of the asynchronous map precede those at the y axis if the signs are the same between the synchronous and the asynchronous maps if the signs are different the relative order is reversed 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon and nitrogen cycling in the eps the isotope contents of eps calculated based on the 13c and 15n isotope ratios exhibited dynamic variations within the time frame of the operation fig 1 the assimilation of the labeled substrates contained in the influent was mirrored by the increasing trend of the isotope contents or atom in the eps with increasing operation time in the first phase fig 1 the assimilation of 13c into eps seems to occur relatively faster than that of 15n as shown by the peak of the isotope content at an earlier operation time for example on the operation days of 10 and 26 the 13c result showed that the turnover rates of carbon contents in eps were up to 70 and 100 respectively which contrasted with 37 and 60 for nitrogen contents reflected in 15n such fast assimilation of carbon substrate into eps can be explained by the relatively rapid microbial utilization of carbon versus nitrogen containing compounds which agrees with the previous observation zhang and bishop 2003 of a higher microbial degradation rate for carbohydrates compared to proteins for the microbial consumption of eps as substrate the peaks of the 13c isotope contents reflect the enrichment maxima of the labeled substrate in the eps following microbial utilization unlike the 13c labeled glucose the assimilation cycle of the labeled nitrogen into new eps was behind the srt set for the bioreactor i e 35 days fig 1 after the completion of one srt period the maximum enrichment of 15n in eps was found to be 3 5 there are several sinks for carbon and nitrogen in biological wastewater systems which include biomass and eps bound and soluble although all of these components play important roles in operating the systems bound eps has been in the spotlight due to the well known functions hampering the effective operation of treatment systems such as low dewaterability and membrane fouling detecting the abundances of 13c and 15n makes it possible to discriminate the turnover periods between carbon and nitrogen enriched structures in eps considering that variations of the labeled carbon and nitrogen contents in eps may represent the individual cycles of polysaccharides and proteins plus other n containing structures e g n glycans and lipids these results imply that the eps formation cycle could be different between the two main eps components with the faster formation of polysaccharides versus proteins plus n containing structures within bulk eps this finding also suggests a shorter turnover or replenishment time taken for polysaccharides than for nitrogen containing constituents within bulk eps no previous study has explored the whole cycles of different elements in eps with respect to their formation and degradation dissolution in biological treatment systems it is interesting to note that the assimilation frequency of nitrogen into eps was similar to the srt period while that of carbon was shorter as demonstrated by the times of the two labeled isotope peaks fig 1 it can be inferred from the results that compared to the carbon related eps structures such as polysaccharides nitrogen containing eps structures e g proteins n glycans and others might be more refractory in nature and or are formed at a slower rate after the assimilation of nitrogen substrate carbon and nitrogen are the major elements in eps to determine the relative composition of polysaccharides and proteins plus other n containing compounds their relative abundances in eps are closely related to microbial communities in sludge and their growth phases sheng et al 2006 for example a previous study has shown a lower nitrogen content of soluble eps in the endogenous phase relative to the exogenous phase maqbool et al 2019 the relative ratios of carbon to nitrogen have also been widely used as an indicator to represent the relative abundances of polysaccharides and proteins in eps kroll et al 2014 stewart et al 2013 it was previously reported that the ratios of polysaccharides to proteins could determine the major chemical features of eps such as hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and aromatic contents zhang et al 2007 furthermore the ratios can be associated with many environmental problems occurring in wastewater treatment systems such as membrane fouling and dewaterability lin et al 2014 the 13c and 15n abundances interpret the formation dissolution cycles of eps in terms of carbon and nitrogen fig 1 it is important to note that eps formation and dissolution or elimination with wasting sludge is a continuous process in biological wastewater treatments to confirm the uniform production of eps with time the bulk doc concentrations were measured fig s1 which helped to avoid any fallacious calculation of the isotope abundances that might be caused by a substantial increase or decrease in eps concentration the bulk eps concentrations or doc remained nearly constant without any increasing or decreasing trends shown throughout the operation fig s1 this is also indicative of the normal functioning of the activated sludge with respect to the eps formation irrespective of the presence absence of the isotope labeled substrates in the influent again this confirms the successful application of the isotope labeling approach for tracking the turnover i e formation dissolution cycles of eps which provides much more valuable information on the fate of eps in a given biological treatment system than does conventional bulk eps analyses in sum the temporal variations of the isotope contents expressed by atom evidenced the existence of different formation dissolution frequencies between carbon and nitrogen enriched structures within bulk eps 3 2 relative changes of different eps structures upon substrate consumption the 13c nmr spectra of the eps were compared at varying operation time fig 2 several peaks were observed in the nmr spectra at different days of operation the signal assignments for the chemical shifts presented in table 1 follow previous studies on eps jiao et al 2010 metzger et al 2009 yu et al 2011 metzger et al 2009 utilized the 13c cpmas nmr spectra of the eps formed by pseudomonas putida and aureobasidum pullulans to probe the different organic structures in the eps the cpmas method reduces to a great extent the effects of chemical shift anisotropy leading to an improved resolution compared to the conventional solid state nmr furthermore this technique can minimize the interference from homonuclear e g 13c 13c dipolar coupling norris et al 2012 in comparison with liquid state nmr the 13c cpmas nmr is sensitive to a broader range of polymers in eps is non destructive of samples and does not require a prior extraction step a total of six different carbon structures were identified from the measured spectra the peak at 0 45 ppm is indicative of aliphatic carbon the peak was assigned to methylene groups in long chain aliphatic structures caricasole et al 2010 metzger et al 2009 metzger et al 2009 linked such a structure to phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides wang et al 2017 referred this to humic substances and lipid structures for this study there is one broad peak at the chemical shifts 0 45 ppm which contrasted with the multiple peaks previously reported jiao et al 2010 metzger et al 2009 the area under the curve between 45 and 65 ppm represents the Î± carbon of amino acids with o or n substituted aliphatic carbon structures which can be referred to as peptide backbones the chemical shifts of 65 110 ppm are unambiguously associated with the sugar structures of eps at this range the fraction at the lower shift ppm is more related to the o alkyl carbon of polysaccharides while that at the longer shift represents the anomeric carbon metzger et al 2009 simpson and simpson 2017 the chemical shifts between 110 and 160 ppm have been assigned to aromatic carbon structures which can be linked to the presence of phenolic groups and proteins yu et al 2011 meanwhile the shifts between 160 and 200 ppm predominantly indicate amidyl carbonyl carbon jiao et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 substantial changes in the nmr spectra were observed for the eps collected at different operation days at the first phase or the eps formation phase most of the peaks at the chemical shifts of 0 90 ppm and 160 180 ppm exhibited increasing trends as the operation progressed fig 2a the increasing signals indicate that the associated carbon structures were newly formed in the eps as the result of the assimilation of the isotope labeled substrates on the other hand the same signals were on decline with time at the second phase i e the eps declining phase when unlabeled substrates started to be consumed by the microorganisms in the activated sludge fig 2b in this study the extents of the increases in the nmr spectral signals were compared at different chemical shifts to explore the relative contributions of the two main eps components i e polysaccharides and proteins to the formation or the dissolution of the eps or the eps turnover cycle for the estimation of the eps structures associated with either polysaccharides or proteins and aromatic contents the approach of metzger et al 2009 was adopted in which the combined signals of o alkyl and anomeric c were taken into account to estimate the contribution of polysaccharides to bulk eps while those of aliphatic c Î±c of amino acids aromatic and amides were used for proteins along with other n containing structures the relative abundances of the individual eps structures categorized based on different chemical shift ranges are presented at different operation days in table s2 except for the first few days of operation the relative distribution of the polysaccharide structures showed a general increasing trend during the first phase of operation fig 3 while those of proteins and other n containing structures declined with time these results suggest that the microorganisms in the activated sludge tended to produce preferably polysaccharides over proteins within bulk eps as substrates are assimilated it can also be deduced that polysaccharides are replenished faster than proteins during an eps turnover cycle during the second phase of operation on the other hand the protein and other n containing structures content became relatively more enriched with time while the polysaccharide composition was diminished fig 3 again the results suggest that the protein related carbon structures are likely to be more resistant to dissolution or transformation into other forms compared to polysaccharide within bulk eps this study is the first report that used the stable isotope labeling approach to evidence the existence of different preferences for polysaccharides and proteins with other structures upon the formation of eps in biological wastewater treatment from the novel findings it can be posited that the activated sludge microorganisms are likely to preferentially form polysaccharides relative to other structures in their eps via the assimilation of substrates our results also indicate that polysaccharides might be dissimulated more easily than proteins or other structures within bulk eps and thus that the former might have a relatively shorter frequency in the formation dissolution cycle than the latter 3 3 comparing the formation tendencies of different carbon structures of eps via 2d cos the dissimilar frequencies in the formation of different eps carbon structures which were previously identified from the nmr spectra were further explored using 2d cos with increasing days of operation from 1 to 26 days as an external perturbation the synchronous and asynchronous maps generated from the 2d cos are shown in fig 4 a time span of 26 days was selected for the eps formation period as the 13c nmr data showed that it well matched the transition time of the variations in the estimated polysaccharide or protein contents fig 3 in the synchronous map five main auto peaks were identified which are located at 22 53 73 92 and 169 ppm and they were assigned to aliphatic carbon Î± carbon o alkyl carbon anomeric carbon and amides groups respectively the peak intensity at 73 ppm corresponding to a polysaccharide structure was the highest among the five identified peaks suggesting that the carbon structure is the most predominant structure in the newly formed eps meanwhile the off diagonal peaks represent the different tendencies of the changes at the chemical shifts of the x and y axes for example the long shaped peak at 165 175 ppm x axis 12 83 ppm y axis indicates the opposing direction of the spectral changes at the two different ranges of the chemical shifts which agreed with the previous observation on the changes of the 13c nmr spectra fig 2a the sequential orders of the changes in different eps structures can be captured by comparing the cross peaks of the asynchronous map there are two positive peaks at 73 22 ppm and 73 53 ppm while one negative peak appears at 169 73 ppm based on the noda s rule if the peaks overlying the same region of both synchronous and asynchronous maps have the same sign the spectral changes corresponding to the x axis occur earlier than those at the y axis i e preferential changes the sequence is reversed if the overlapping peaks in both maps have the opposite sign thus an interpretation of the 2d cos results in this study indicates that the eps carbon structures were preferentially formed at the chemical shifts following the order of 73 ppm 169 ppm 53 ppm 22 ppm table s3 based on the assignments of the carbon structures and the 2d cos interpretation eps seems to be formed following a decreasing structural preference of o alkyl carbon amide group Î± carbon aliphatic carbon which corresponded to polysaccharides 73 ppm proteins and or other n containing compounds 169 ppm proteins 53 ppm proteins and or other n containing compounds 22 ppm this sequence is consistent with the previous result of fig 1 showing the shorter assimilation frequency of carbon relative to nitrogen in eps thus it appears that polysaccharides are is precedent to proteins and other nitrogen containing structures in the formation of eps 3 4 environmental implications the combined results from the stable isotope analysis and 13c cpmas nmr spectra provide a novel insight into dissimilar formation rates of the eps structures with different chemical functionalities these findings have implications for the operation of biological treatment systems the optimization of these systems and the potential environmental problems associated with eps this study also broadens the understanding of the changes in eps composition during the operation of treatment systems the method employed in this study which harnessed isotope labeled substrates for the evaluation of the mechanisms of bioreactors is not limited to the analysis of eps as it can be extensively applied in other studies tracking the sources and the pathways of the organic matter produced in biological treatment systems the information provided in this study would potentially assist in the optimization of biological treatment systems to produce effluents with eps containing relatively more labile organic compounds in addition the novel stable isotope approach demonstrated in this study could be modified to generate mass balance data for use in the evaluation of the utilization of substrate and its transformation into biomass the formation of eps and smp such applications could be extended to the development of a mathematical model for microbial growth and eps production the demonstrated technique is potentially applicable in the explication of the complex mechanisms of the biological assimilation of wastewater containing organic matters of various origins including organic pollutants taken together the stable isotope labeling approach in tandem with 2d cos tools employed in this study provided a novel approach to untangle the complex behaviors of different eps structures and the associated pathways occurring in biological treatment systems 4 conclusion the turnover cycles of different carbon structures within bulk eps were explored by adding 13c and 15n labeled substrates to the activated sludge and applying 2d cos on the nmr spectra of the formed eps the following main conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes analyses revealed that the carbon contents of eps could be replenished earlier than the nitrogen counterpart and also that the latter may be relatively more resistant to microbial consumption for a srt period of 35 days the turnover frequency of eps carbon contents was 26 days while that of the nitrogen containing structures was longer 2 different frequencies for the formation and the dissolution of eps carbon structures were distinguished by the 13c cpmas nmr spectra the structures assigned to polysaccharides were preferentially formed and dissimulated faster relative to structures assigned to proteins and other nitrogen containing structures consequently at end of the formation cycle of polysaccharides the eps was more enriched with nitrogen contents 3 2d cos based on 13c nmr spectra was successfully applied to distinguish the formation frequencies between different carbon structures present within the bulk eps the sequential formation of structures within bulk eps followed the relative order of o alkyl carbon amide group Î± carbon aliphatic carbon 4 the stable isotope labeling approach in combination with 2d cos provided a novel analytical methodology to untangle the complex behaviors of different eps structures and the associated pathways occurring in biological treatment systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18296,urea is a major source of nitrogen pollution in domestic sewage and its denitrification is difficult since it is very likely to be converted into ammonia or nitrate instead of expected n2 herein we propose an exhaustive denitrification method for urea via the oxidation of amine ammonia n with chlorine oxide radical which induced from a bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode and the highly selective reduction of nitrate n on cathode in photoelectrochemical cell pec under illumination the wo3 photoanode side promotes the quantities hydroxyl and reactive chlorine radical and these radicals are immediately combined to stronger chlorine oxide radical by ruo2 side which obviously enhances the efficiency and speed of the urea oxidation synchronously the over oxidized nitrate can be selectively reduced by pd and au nanoparticles on the surface of cathode eventually exhaustive denitrification is realized by the circulative reaction experimental observations and theoretical calculation revealed that chlorine oxide radical promoted significant denitrification of urea with an efficiency of 99 74 in 60 min under the optimum condition the removal rate constant of the ruo2 wo3 anode was 3 08 times than that of single wo3 anode and 2 64 times than that of single ruo2 anode confirming the chlorine oxide radical had stronger ability on denitrification than reactive chlorine radical also the bi functional anode contributed to best current efficiencies utilizing the energy availably this work proposes a promising method of exhaustive denitrification for urea graphical abstract image 1 keywords exhaustive denitrification urea chlorine oxide radical bi functional anode photoelectrochemical cell 1 introduction urea is one of the dominant nitrogen containing compound in human excreta and simultaneously the major nitrogen source in domestic sewage de laat et al 2011 maurer et al 2006 rollinson et al 2011 nowadays the denitrification in sewage treatment has been a severe challenge since excessive nitrogen pollution would contribute to odorous smell aquatic biota toxicity and even seriously eutrophic plague xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 so the available decomposition of urea is highly demanded for wastewater treatment plants and total environment maurer et al 2006 however the conventional technologies for instance biological means liu et al 2017 reverse osmosis masse et al 2008 electrochemical method wei et al 2012 and photochemical method hua et al 2014 remain limited by the disadvantages in traditional management and most importantly they should easily transform urea to ammonia n or nitrate n instead of harmless n2 resulting in terrible energy consumption and recontamination of nitrogen to this end it is very urgent to propose a new method to directly and utterly degrade urea to n2 and to co2 recently photoelectrochemical cell pec method gratzel 2001 pan et al 2019 shen et al 2019b wang et al 2014 zong et al 2014a as one of emerging topic in the sewage treatment and environment governance has been increasingly emphasized in urea denitrification due to the stronger oxidation capacities of photo generated holes and the faster process of the charge transfer under illumination garcia segura and brillas 2017 compared with the previous technique pec has an obvious superiority in rapid transfer of electron and decomposition of organics sharply enhancing electrogenesis by some orders of magnitude kang and kang 2015 rajeshwar et al 1994 zong et al 2014b thus we lately reported a pec system shen et al 2019b to remove tn from urine based on the cycle reaction of chlorine and hydroxyl radicals cl and ho demonstrating photo holes could oxidize h2o and cl to ho and cl and these radicals could promptly and completely transform urea to n2 eqs 1 4 despite the high selectivity of cl to n2 there existed some drawbacks in this process one of the most important involved the low concentration and reactivity of cl which seriously limited the process from nh4 to n2 and resulted in undesirable denitrification efficiency in the system cho et al 2014b minakata et al 2017 for another some articles exner et al 2015 menzel et al 2013 documented that compared with cl chlorine oxide radical clo had better performance on oxidizing nh4 to n2 jingyun et al 2014 sun et al 2016 since clo has high redox potential of 1 8 v vs nhe alfassi et al 1988 it can fleetly oxidize electron rich substance kong et al 2018 wu et al 2016 and according to eq 5 clo can be attained by the combination of ho and species of reactive chlorine rcs for example cl hclo and others wu et al 2017 so the utilization of clo may overcome the drawback caused by cl meanwhile clo was discovered to have greater generation when adopting the composite anode materials such as sb

via the oxidation of amine ammonia n with clo which induced by a bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode and the highly selective reduction of nitrate n on cathode in pec the hybrid anode is a unique combination whose one side is electrochemical ruo2 nano film and the other is photo responsive wo3 nano array in this bifacial anode the ho and cl are generated on the surface of wo3 under the irradiation of visible light eqs 1 and 2 while the ruo2 serves as a candidate for the generation of ocl due to considerable rcs and excellent electronic conductivity zeng et al 2017a in the cell the clo could rapidly oxidized urea or ammonia to n2 and slight no3 also the pd au pn electrode was selected as the cathode and specifically reduced the minor nitrate to n2 after a complex electrochemical reactions involving e g ammonia nitrite hydrazine hydroxylamine nitric oxide nitrous oxide and other intermediates or by products garcia segura et al 2018 the whole system would operate in a cyclical manner until the total nitrogen is exhausted the results indicated the clo induced by the bi facial ruo2 wo3 anode had a more significant promotion than only cl or hclo on denitrification efficiency the removal rate constant of the double sided electrode was 3 8 times than that of single wo3 and 3 1 times than that of single ruo2 simultaneously the denitrification rate was 99 74 under the optimum

electrochemical analyzer chi 660c chenhua instrument co ltd china to monitor the current and potential a ph buffer was applied in all the experiments to prevent ph drifting the scheme image of the pec device were presented in fig s1 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the bi functional anode the morphologies of ruo2 side were characterized by sem the sem images shown in fig 1 a and fig 1b respectively display the different size ruo2 surface morphologies in macro the ruo2 layer prepared by spin coating was dense and smooth fig 1 a but in micro a uniform and ordered nano array structure was packed in the fig 1 b which could favor the improvement of stability from the edx images in fig 1 c two kinds of elements were performed for the compositional analysis confirming the ru and o have been tightly adhered to fto the element of sn is the result of the fto conducting layer and to further elucidate this the formation of the ruo2 film was then studied by xrd in fig s2 we characterized the xrd images of fto wo3 fto and ruo2 fto and after comparison it can be observed the xrd pattern of the ruo2 film has three peaks marked star at 2Î¸ 28 0 31 5 and 54 0 which are referenced to the 110 101 and 211 crystal planes of ruo2 wu et al 2010 meanwhile the surface morphology of the wo3 side was also investigated by sem measurement it presents to be plate like structure in the top view fig 2 a and cross section images fig 2b the average length of the plates is about 1 Î¼m while its thickness remains almost 950 nm this result agrees well with relevant researches ji et al 2017 zeng et al 2017b indicated in fig 2c the wo3 anode has an absorption edge at the approximate wavelength of 450 nm which demonstrates the anode can respond to visible light the bandgap energy eg was calculated to be 2 6 ev from fig 2d it can be seen that the photocurrent potential jv curves of the wo3 electrode are determined under am 1 5 irradiation by linear sweep voltammetry lsv in the pure electrolyte solution the photocurrent density was growing when the applied bias potential increased while the dark current densities were observed to be negligible also the wo3 nanoplate has an orthorhombic crystalline phase and the characteristic peaks are marked diamond in fig s2 the main top peaks concentrated on the range of 23 50 3 2 the performance of pec on denitrification d tn d t k t n initially we conducted the denitrification experiment to investigate the performance of the exhaustive photoeletrochemical cell with the novel bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode used as the nitrogen source a pool of 50 ml synthetic urea solution was poured into the cubic reaction tank under illumination and the original concentration of tn was kept at 30 mg l 1 the cell continued to operate for 60 min with the na2so4 as the electrolyte and nacl as the catalyst and thereafter the denitrification rate was measured the efficiency and kinetics curves of tn decomposition were analyzed in fig 3 a and fig 3b fig 3a presents the variation trend of tn in pec system with ruo2 wo3 wo3 and ruo2 anodes respectively after the ocular observation of fig 3a the curves in the utilization of ruo2 wo3 have sharp decline than that of the other two kinds of single materials and the experimental results without light current and electrodes had been given in our previous work whose tn removal rate were quite low respectively 0 5 0 8 and 43 89 the k is the denitrification rate constant compared with the single wo3 anode the novel ruo2 wo3 anode have more excellent properties on degrading urea fig 3b reveals the k value of the former is 0 498 mg l 1 min 1 3 08 times than that of the later demonstrating a significant improvement by the novel bi functional electrode in this work fig s4 gives a visual reason about the obvious efficiency increasing the bi functional anode shows the synergistic effect between the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation while the wo3 anode only displays the photocatalytic function luo et al 2018 synchronously for a more comprehensive comparison the pec with single ruo2 anode was also studied whose tn removal rate was only a little more than that with single wo3 electrode and also far below that with ruo2 wo3 electrode 3 3 influence factors on the performance of pec 3 3 1 effect of the tn original concentration in urea solution the original concentration c o of total nitrogen in the urea solution dominates the reaction time in the experiments so this parameter plays a significant role in the pec system zong et al 2014a thus to assess the impact of the tn concentration in urea solution 10 20 30 40 50 mg l 1 urea n were added in the electrolyte solution which simultaneously contained 50 mm na2so4 50 mm nacl and other constituents fig 4 a shows the tn removal capacity of the system under different concentration of urea solution it can be seen that along with the difference of c o tn degradation efficiency can has wide swings the higher the urea original concentration the lower efficiency is in the presence of 30 mg l 1 urea n the tn removal rate can be up to 98 63 in the reaction time of 50 min and achieve 99 74 in 60 min which means that there s little tn left certainly when the c o is 20 mg l 1 the tn removal rate is only a little higher than that in 30 mg l 1 urea n solution and simultaneously much higher than that in 40 and 50 mg l 1 whose specific data is respectively 90 36 and 85 13 in 60 min overview the 30 mg l 1 urea n as the original concentration value is relatively suitable to definitely investigate the denitrification performance of the whole system in a short period of time 3 3 2 effect of the cl dosage the cl has a crucial influence on denitrification as the cl or clo generated from cl could promptly oxidize ammonia nitrogen or urea to n2 even over oxidize to nitrate ding et al 2016 so it must be essential to study the effect of cl by controlling its dosage the initial concentrations of cl were set as 0 25 50 and 75 mm in 30 mg l 1 urea n solution with 50 mm na2so4 electrolyte it can be observed from fig 4b that the usage of cl has an outstanding effect on degrading urea n to n2 the optimal degradation efficiency of tn in the experiment with 50 mm or 75 mm cl dosage approaches 100 within 60 min more than twice the efficiency in the experiment without cl compared to the 25 mm dosage of cl the 50 mm or 75 mm dosage also presents a sharp increase of 15 34 in the tn removal rate the results should be attributed to higher chlorine usage as the higher cl promotes more yield of clo accelerating the oxidation of urea n and enhancing the tn degradation efficiency nevertheless it does not mean the higher cl dosage is always the better as the concentration of chlorine continually increased the rate of tn removal dropped slightly since the various by products of high chlorine in solution were easy to generate and further threaten the whole system as a result the 50 mm cl dosage is more appropriate in our study 3 3 3 effect of bias potential the bias potential can effectively control the urea denitrification efficiency so it is an extremely important factor known to impact tn removal rate by the cyclic pec process hence it is worthwhile to investigate the urea n degradation efficiency at different bias potentials cho et al 2014a a series of experiments were conducted to degrade tn at various potentials in a 30 mg l 1 urea n solution with 50 mm na2so4 and nacl the bias potentials were 1 0 v 1 2 v 1 4 v 1 6 v and 1 8 v vs sce respectively fig 4c reflects the denitrification efficiency improve from 79 95 to 99 74 when the potential slightly floated from 1 0 v to 1 8 v vs sce tn removal rate at 1 6 v is basically consistent with that at 1 8 v in the reaction time of 50 min also exceeds those at other bias potentials this result indicates a higher bias potential applied on the pec system would be to the benefit of tn removal due to the higher potential give rise to greater photoelectric conversion efficiency which can generate a stronger electric field to separate photoelectron from holes on the surface of bilateral anode herein from an energy saving standpoint the bias potential of 1 6 v vs sce was chosen as a suitable experiment parameter 3 3 4 effect of the ph value the ph value of solution plays a pivotal role in the experiment by adjusting the concentration of h it s a vital factor to impact the decrease of tn in urea solution kim et al 2005 therefore it is valuable to explore the function of different ph values on tn degradation efficiency some experiments were designed to find out the relationship between them with the initial solution ph values of 3 5 7 9 and 11 the c o of tn was 30 mg l 1 in urea solution and the na2so4 as the electrolyte whose concentration was 50 mm fig 4d reveals that neutral ph is for the benefit of constructing a good atmosphere for denitrification in the pec system in a ph range of 5 9 the tn degradation efficiency has slight variations tn can be removed almost completely within 60 min from 3 to 11 of initial ph of solution the urea n degradation efficiency firstly increases and then decreases with the gradually increasing of ph achieving the best condition when ph is 7 the higher or lower ph values are unfavorable jiang et al 2019 one reason is that lower concentration of h can motivate reducibility in the urea solution and cause the generation of superfluous nh4 and the higher the ph is the proton donor changes from hydronium to water lamoureux et al 2019 which means the fewer h can be utilized so the weakly reductive solution is easy to produce plentiful no3 additionally cl2 evolution was indicated to be favored in comparison to o2 evolution at acidic ph which was also a reason of negative denitrification efficient at low ph for high alkaline ph o2 evolution is the predominant reaction oh tend to thermodynamically electrogenerated oh radicals by o2 evolution precedes the required potential in alkaline electrolytes furthermore it is considered the oxidation of clo yielding clo radical which subsequently reacts with oh releasing superoxide radical o2 from a series of oxidation reactions this reactive oxygen species can further react with clo yielding chloride and oxygen as products in alkaline media mostafa et al 2018 there s another reason is electrochemical window it has been depicted that the o2 evolution onset potential is shifted negatively with respect to the chloride free electrolyte when ph is increased the o2 evolution currents in presence of chloride will be also suppressed in lower ph but o2 signal presents a slightly higher ionic current this trend is explained by the o2 potential shift that increases the relevance of oxygen evolution as competitive reaction thus the accumulation of clo in neutral ph can scavenges the generated hydroxyl radicals yielding oxyacids to suppress the evolution of oxygen mostafa et al 2018 hence the neutral ph values was feasible for the work and taking all of these factors into account the ph of 7 should be chosen to optimize the results in the experiment 3 4 electrochemical analysis after the single factor assays above mentioned it can be proved that under different conditions of each parameter the denitrification efficiency can vary greatly whose main reason is that the current efficiency would have an obvious variation when the experimental condition changed and the current efficiency is heavily associated to the total nitrogen removal in urea solution the average current efficiency ace and the instantaneous current efficiency ice calculated using the equations below were employed to evaluate the impact of each factor on the energy cost of the process according to previous work chen et al 2007 fan et al 2013 the results measured above were used to calculate the following parameters to characterize the electrochemical process of tn decomposition see the following formulas a c e 3 f v t n r 14 i t i c e 3 f v t n t Î´ t t n t 14 i Î´ t t n r u r e a n o u r e a n t n o 3 n t n h 4 n t where ace and ice are the average current efficiency and instantaneous current efficiency tn r is the total nitrogen removed in time t urea n o and urea n t are the concentration of urea nitrogen at time zero and t no 3 n t and nh 4 n t are the generation of no3 n and nh4 n at time t respectively tn t Î´t and tn t are the tn concentration in the solution at time t and t Î´t f is the faraday constant whose specific value is 96 485 c per mole t is the time s Î´t is a short time interval v is the volume of the urea solution l i is the current density a 3 is the number of exchanged electrons for the electrochemical oxidation of urea and 14 is the molecular mass of nitrogen whose unit is g mol 1 ace and ice can explain the effect of every factor on the denitrification efficiency from another point as well as the energy consumption during reaction time fig s5 demonstrates the change trend of ice under optimal conditions above mentioned in the section of 3 2 and at the time of 10 min the ice approximately reaches the peak value herein we used the ice10 as the parameter characterizing instantaneous current efficiency in the system table s1 presents the detail values of ace in the reaction time of 60 min and ice10 under different conditions it can be seen that the electrochemical efficiency of bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode is significantly better than that of wo3 or ruo2 anode using ruo2 wo3 as the anode the maximum of ace was 19 4 under the condition of ph 7 u 1 6 v vs sce cl 50 mm and the original tn concentration of 30 mg l 1 while the ice10 also peaked at 57 4 compared with ice and ace less than 10 of electrochemical oxidation of ammonia with ruo2 iro2 tio2 ti anode from the study of chen et al this result seem to be more gratifying demonstrating ruo2 wo3 a more suitable electrode material for tn removal and make full use of energy the dosage of cl is also critical for the increase of efficiency in the absence of chlorine the ace value was only 11 7 and the ace could continually improve by 7 7 with the higher and higher concentration of cl until the dosage reached 50 mm subsequently the ace value dropped to 16 8 when the nacl overdosed for ice10 this trend also applied the energy utilization could be maximized with the cl concentration of 50 mm similarly there were also a suitable potential and a best ph value for achieving optimum current efficiencies both the ace and ice initially increased and subsequently decreased as the bias potential gradually rose since a higher bias potential contributed to a higher current density and resulted in an increase in oxygen evolution this result is consistent with previous researches chen et al 2007 as for ph value different values had few effects on the tendency of ace and ice10 but under the condition of neutral ph the current efficiencies still had certain advantage as a consequence the influence of every factor on ace and ice is consistent with that on denitrification in addition it indicates the ice would be considerable within the first 10 min of the reaction time as the urea can be rapidly converted to n2 by the radicals of clo during this period after 10 min it is displayed that ice have declined substantially to 0 through the experiment data in fig s5 3 5 the mechanism of circulative pec system in this work we constructed an exhaustive denitrification system based on the photoelectrochemical cell pec as demonstrated in fig 5 in the pec system the most significant highlight was the application of bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode this novel anode had two sides one was attached to the wo3 nanoarray the other was covered by ruo2 nanoparticles the wo3 nano film has an excellent photo response under visible light irradiation the photoelectron escapes from the surface of wo3 film and photogenerated holes h yield fleetly forming the photoelectron hole pairs photogenerated holes have a strong oxidation capacity to rapidly transform h2o to hydroxy radicals ho and a little cl to chlorine radicals cl eq ji et al 2017 and it is also elucidated that ruo2 could facilitate and accelerate the generation of major active chlorine species hclo in studies published by luo et al and chen et al chen et al 2007 luo et al 2018 thus based on these facts we make a bifacial combination of two kinds of superior materials after that the bifacial ruo2 wo3 anode was synthesized and its performance was determined results indicates that the tn decomposition rate in pec system with bi functional anode is much higher than that with single wo3 anode or ruo2 anode as shown in fig 4a the rate constant of ruo2 wo3 electrode is the 3 08 times than that of wo3 and 2 64 times than that of ruo2 herein we speculated the reason why the efficiency was greatly enhanced was that the significant combination of bi functional anode contributed to the positive influence of clo on denitrification zhang et al and cho et al researched and confirmed the clo played a major role in stripping nitrogen from ammonia or urea cho and hoffmann 2014 zhang et al 2019 to verify the existence of radicals we investigated the radical species by epr spectra with the assistance of dmpo which was used as the capture reagent specific result was reflected in fig 6 on the image clear quartet peaks of dmpo oh with 1 2 2 1 intensity could be observed in the system without chlorine while a nine line epr spectra was observed with cl and the later was proved to be corresponding to reactive chlorine species our previous work shen et al 2019a also demonstrated the epr spectra with the single wo3 anode in the existence of cl and the intensities of radicals in which were weaker than that with ruo2 wo3 anode while the much stronger radicals accomplished the more rapid and efficient denitrification confirming the excellent properties of bi functional anode this two sides anode can induced the combination of cl and oh by the process of photo reactions from wo3 side and electrochemical reactions from ruo2 side since the wo3 motivated chlorine radicals and hydroxide radicals and these two could be effectively synthesized to clo which was characterized as the inverted triangle with strengthening peaks according to the experimental results above we tentatively propose the reasonable reaction route of radicals under irradiation condition oh generated by the oxidizing of photo holes can convert cl to cl on the side of wo3 eq 6 and on the other side chloride oxidation occurs efficiently in the low potential producing more rcs luan et al 2012 when hydroxy radicals and hypochlorous acid coincidentally happen together they would react to create the new species clo eq 11 and 12 certainly the chlorine radicals can also be oxidized to clo eq 10 which dominated the oxidation of urea and degraded tn fleetly hence the decomposition from urea to n2 is significantly enhanced as presented in fig 5 the urea n is first attacked by clo cl to inorganic monochloramine dichloramine and further trichloramine eq 13 17 as the reaction intermediates garcia segura et al 2019 and then the chloramines species were eventually dechlorinated by the rcs and transformed to major nitrogen in eq 24 26 and minor nitrate as by product over oxidized by clo in eq 21 23 7 2cl cl2 2e 8 cl2 h2o hclo hcl 9 cl 2oh ocl h2o 2e 10 cl hocl clo h cl 11 oh hocl clo h2o 12 oh ocl clo oh 13 nh2 2co clo nh2 nh2cl co2 14 nh2 hclo nh2cl oh 15 nh2cl

co2 2h meanwhile for the over oxidized nitrate we used the reductive cathode pd au pn to dispose we have known the nitrate could be selectively reduced to n2 and slight nh4 by metallic catalyst from jung et al sungyoon et al 2014 as a result the bimetallic pd au pn was adapted due to quick adsorption and conversion of nitrate through the positive charge eq 24 28 suggest that nitrate can be reduced to slightly intermediate nitrite extremely short lived after adsorption on au site and then further reduced to n2 on the pd sites once attached nitrite pd probably tend to convert nitrite to n2 which is rate limiting step in the whole process of reducing no3 to n2 cheng et al 2013 simultaneously the au is quite crucial position on the conversion of no3 to no2 tada et al 2004 24 no3 au au

mechanisms of nitrate to nitrogen also should be considered garcia segura et al 2019 involving numerous reactions products and stable intermediates eq 29 33 such as ammonia nitrite hydrazine hydroxylamine nitric oxide nitrous oxide and so on which span the many nitrogen oxidation states among this the mainly reactions could be calculated as eq 34 and 35 additionally very a little nitrate can also be directly transformed to nh4 by pd au pn cathode and subsequently oxidized by clo to n2 some researches dortsiou and kyriacou 2009 katsounaros et al 2006 have also discussed the conversion mechanism of urea to nitrate nitrite or ammonia and speculated the reaction pathways of tn transformation as follow urea n no2 n no3 n nh4 n n2 and in this work the by product nitrite was barely measured in the system as the clo was a kind of strong oxidant which could rapidly convert nitrite to nitrate shortening the lifespan of no2 as shown in fig 7 the concentration variation of the no3 n no2 n and nh4 n are revealed in the reaction time of 60 min the quantities of no3 n and nh4 n are major components for analysis in the solution and the no2 n is too little to be effectively detected thus the no2 n is only considered as an intermediate which immediately is oxidized to no3 n the reaction pathways can be simulated again according to the experiments results here urea n no3 n nh4 n n2 above all we achieved an exhaustive denitrification system by the combination of tn oxidation on the anode and nitrate reduction on the cathode the system can ensure the stable and consistent operation until the tn is sufficiently removed 3 6 the denitrification from synthetic and actual urine by the exhaustive pec system to further investigate the function of pec system with novel ruo2 wo3 anode the urea in synthetic urine and actual urine were employed as the targets the synthetic urine was prepared as initial urine sample according to the udert et al udert et al 2003 as described in table s2 and we diluted synthetic urine to 50 mgn l 1 the concentration in the domestic sewage the actual urine as the later sample was attained from 100 healthy volunteers half men and half women all healthy adults whose original concentration was surveyed approximately 6440 mgn l 1 both of 50 ml urine samples were poured into the cell under the illumination of a 350 w xe lamp with an am 1 5 filter the construction continued to work in neutral ph solution and the bias potential was 1 6 v vs sce and then the tn removal efficiencies were measured by tn analyzer fig 8 reflects the tn removal trend in synthetic and actual urine the tn in this two solutions both sharply declined the denitrification efficiency in synthetic sewage is 98 21 after the reaction time of 90 min the removal rate of 0 0102 mgn l 1 s 1 as comparation and the actual urine sample decreased by 892 mgn l 1 after 10 h with a removal rate of 0 0248 mg l 1 s 1 nevertheless the total nitrogen in the two samples could be running uninterruptedly even in the high nitrogen urine presenting the inventive pec system a serviceable creation 4 conclusions this study proposed an exhaustive pec system with the bi functional anode constituted of wo3 nanotubes and ruo2 coating to exhibit significant denitrification from urea the double sides anode could contribute to the synergistic performance of these two nano catalysts without the loss of their individual properties the synergetic effect mainly contained the simultaneous processes of photochemistry electrochemistry and reactive species chlorine oxidation which conduced to the generation of different radicals such as ho radicals cl and major clo radicals under the visible light the denitrification efficiency of the wo3 ruo2 was 3 08 times higher than the single wo3 and 2 64 times than ruo2 anodes in urea solution since the clo induced by bifacial anode had better performance on tn removal than cl or other rcs species the latter were produced by single wo3 or ruo2 anode the 30 mg l 1 tn could be completely removed in 60 min under the action of clo radicals and the optimum conditions eventually synthetic and actual urine were used as samples to investigate the pec cell the results demonstrated the diluted synthetic urine as well as the artificial domestic sewage had a denitrification efficiency of 98 21 after 90 min and the actual urine also had a sharp decline of tn this approach presents the promising technology on the directed clo generation by bi functional anode and its application on pec to remove tn and proposes an innovative mean

18296,urea is a major source of nitrogen pollution in domestic sewage and its denitrification is difficult since it is very likely to be converted into ammonia or nitrate instead of expected n2 herein we propose an exhaustive denitrification method for urea via the oxidation of amine ammonia n with chlorine oxide radical which induced from a bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode and the highly selective reduction of nitrate n on cathode in photoelectrochemical cell pec under illumination the wo3 photoanode side promotes the quantities hydroxyl and reactive chlorine radical and these radicals are immediately combined to stronger chlorine oxide radical by ruo2 side which obviously enhances the efficiency and speed of the urea oxidation synchronously the over oxidized nitrate can be selectively reduced by pd and au nanoparticles on the surface of cathode eventually exhaustive denitrification is realized by the circulative reaction experimental observations and theoretical calculation revealed that chlorine oxide radical promoted significant denitrification of urea with an efficiency of 99 74 in 60 min under the optimum condition the removal rate constant of the ruo2 wo3 anode was 3 08 times than that of single wo3 anode and 2 64 times than that of single ruo2 anode confirming the chlorine oxide radical had stronger ability on denitrification than reactive chlorine radical also the bi functional anode contributed to best current efficiencies utilizing the energy availably this work proposes a promising method of exhaustive denitrification for urea graphical abstract image 1 keywords exhaustive denitrification urea chlorine oxide radical bi functional anode photoelectrochemical cell 1 introduction urea is one of the dominant nitrogen containing compound in human excreta and simultaneously the major nitrogen source in domestic sewage de laat et al 2011 maurer et al 2006 rollinson et al 2011 nowadays the denitrification in sewage treatment has been a severe challenge since excessive nitrogen pollution would contribute to odorous smell aquatic biota toxicity and even seriously eutrophic plague xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 so the available decomposition of urea is highly demanded for wastewater treatment plants and total environment maurer et al 2006 however the conventional technologies for instance biological means liu et al 2017 reverse osmosis masse et al 2008 electrochemical method wei et al 2012 and photochemical method hua et al 2014 remain limited by the disadvantages in traditional management and most importantly they should easily transform urea to ammonia n or nitrate n instead of harmless n2 resulting in terrible energy consumption and recontamination of nitrogen to this end it is very urgent to propose a new method to directly and utterly degrade urea to n2 and to co2 recently photoelectrochemical cell pec method gratzel 2001 pan et al 2019 shen et al 2019b wang et al 2014 zong et al 2014a as one of emerging topic in the sewage treatment and environment governance has been increasingly emphasized in urea denitrification due to the stronger oxidation capacities of photo generated holes and the faster process of the charge transfer under illumination garcia segura and brillas 2017 compared with the previous technique pec has an obvious superiority in rapid transfer of electron and decomposition of organics sharply enhancing electrogenesis by some orders of magnitude kang and kang 2015 rajeshwar et al 1994 zong et al 2014b thus we lately reported a pec system shen et al 2019b to remove tn from urine based on the cycle reaction of chlorine and hydroxyl radicals cl and ho demonstrating photo holes could oxidize h2o and cl to ho and cl and these radicals could promptly and completely transform urea to n2 eqs 1 4 despite the high selectivity of cl to n2 there existed some drawbacks in this process one of the most important involved the low concentration and reactivity of cl which seriously limited the process from nh4 to n2 and resulted in undesirable denitrification efficiency in the system cho et al 2014b minakata et al 2017 for another some articles exner et al 2015 menzel et al 2013 documented that compared with cl chlorine oxide radical clo had better performance on oxidizing nh4 to n2 jingyun et al 2014 sun et al 2016 since clo has high redox potential of 1 8 v vs nhe alfassi et al 1988 it can fleetly oxidize electron rich substance kong et al 2018 wu et al 2016 and according to eq 5 clo can be attained by the combination of ho and species of reactive chlorine rcs for example cl hclo and others wu et al 2017 so the utilization of clo may overcome the drawback caused by cl meanwhile clo was discovered to have greater generation when adopting the composite anode materials such as sb sno2 wo3 biox tio2 tio2 ru iro2 and so on chen et al 2007 fan et al 2013 luo et al 2018 among these ruo2 can be used as one kind of available material to motivate the production of clo 1 wo3 hÎ½ h e 2

via the oxidation of amine ammonia n with clo which induced by a bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode and the highly selective reduction of nitrate n on cathode in pec the hybrid anode is a unique combination whose one side is electrochemical ruo2 nano film and the other is photo responsive wo3 nano array in this bifacial anode the ho and cl are generated on the surface of wo3 under the irradiation of visible light eqs 1 and 2 while the ruo2 serves as a candidate for the generation of ocl due to considerable rcs and excellent electronic conductivity zeng et al 2017a in the cell the clo could rapidly oxidized urea or ammonia to n2 and slight no3 also the pd au pn electrode was selected as the cathode and specifically reduced the minor nitrate to n2 after a complex electrochemical reactions involving e g ammonia nitrite hydrazine hydroxylamine nitric oxide nitrous oxide and other intermediates or by products garcia segura et al 2018 the whole system would operate in a cyclical manner until the total nitrogen is exhausted the results indicated the clo induced by the bi facial ruo2 wo3 anode had a more significant promotion than only cl or hclo on denitrification efficiency the removal rate constant of the double sided electrode was 3 8 times than that of single wo3 and 3 1 times than that of single ruo2 simultaneously the denitrification rate was 99 74 under the optimum condition approaching the complete removal moreover the superior ruo2 wo3 anode contributed to best current efficiencies maximizing the utilization of energy this work elucidates a more potential and reliable method to remove tn in sewage 2 materials and method 2 1 apparatus and reagents all of analytically pure reagents used in this work such as na2so4 nacl hcl urea and others were ordered from

after that the solution was transferred to a teflon lined autoclave with a piece of fto substrate placed at an angle to the wall of the teflon liner with the conductive side down the hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 400 c for 120 min and naturally cooled down eventually the as prepared sample was rinsed and dried followed by calcination at 500 c in air for 120 min and the wo3 film was well fabricated xia et al 2018 to prepare the bilateral anode the other side of fto was protected by parafilm and all edges were sealed with adhesive tape when prepared wo3 nano array the ruo2 thin films were electrodeposited on fto by cyclic voltammetry method tsuji et al 2011 in 5 mm rucl3 xh2o wako 99 9 aqueous solution and the protective measure of wo3 film was same as above a ruo2 layer was formed by the following reaction 6 ru â² h2o ruo2 4h e a pt plate and an ag agcl kcl electrode were used as the counter electrode ce and reference electrode re respectively for the electrodeposition of ruo2 films cyclic voltammetry was performed at the potential region from 0 to 1 0 v vs sce for 100 cycles with a scan rate of 50 mv s 1 after electrodeposition the obtained films were annealed at 500 c for 2 h under atmospheric air heating rate 1 c min 1 simultaneously the reductive pd au pn cathode was produced with the bimetallic plating method zhang et al 2018 whose detail procedure and characterization method were also provided in the supporting information 2 3 analytical methods the surface morphologies and elemental composition of all the prepared materials was characterized by

and after the treatment was measured by a ph meter a301681 shanghai all well designed experiments unless otherwise specified were carried out under visible light light intensity 100 mw cm 2 with illuminated area of 16 cm2 in the reactor moderately stirring with applying external constant potential the light source was a 350 w xe lamp with an am 1 5 filter the synthetic urea solution contains 30 mg l 1 urea n 0 05 m na2so4 and nacl to support adequate electrolyte and cl 50 ml of artificial urea wastewater were used as samples under the potentiometric conditions tethering the chi electrochemical analyzer chi 660c chenhua instrument co ltd china to monitor the current and potential a ph buffer was applied in all the experiments to prevent ph drifting the scheme image of the pec device were presented in fig s1 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the bi functional anode the morphologies of ruo2 side were characterized by sem the sem images shown in fig 1 a and fig 1b respectively display the different size ruo2 surface morphologies in macro the ruo2 layer prepared by spin coating was dense and smooth fig 1 a but in micro a uniform and ordered nano array structure was packed in the fig 1 b which could favor the improvement of stability from the edx images in fig 1 c two kinds of elements were performed for the compositional analysis confirming the ru and o have been tightly adhered to fto the element of sn is the result of the fto conducting layer and to further elucidate this the formation of the ruo2 film was then studied by xrd in fig s2 we characterized the xrd images of fto wo3 fto and ruo2 fto and after comparison it can be observed the xrd pattern of the ruo2 film has three peaks marked star at 2Î¸ 28 0 31 5 and 54 0 which are referenced to the 110 101 and 211 crystal planes of ruo2 wu et al 2010 meanwhile the surface morphology of the wo3 side was also investigated by sem measurement it presents to be plate like structure in the top view fig 2 a and cross section images fig 2b the average length of the plates is about 1 Î¼m while its thickness remains almost 950 nm this result agrees well with relevant researches ji et al 2017 zeng et al 2017b indicated in fig 2c the wo3 anode has an absorption edge at the approximate wavelength of 450 nm which demonstrates the anode can respond to visible light the bandgap energy eg was calculated to be 2 6 ev from fig 2d it can be seen that the photocurrent potential jv curves of the wo3 electrode are determined under am 1 5 irradiation by linear sweep voltammetry lsv in the pure electrolyte solution the photocurrent density was growing when the applied bias potential increased while the dark current densities were observed to be negligible also the wo3 nanoplate has an orthorhombic crystalline phase and the characteristic peaks are marked diamond in fig s2 the main top peaks concentrated on the range of 23 50 3 2 the performance of pec on denitrification d tn d t k t n initially we conducted the denitrification experiment to investigate the performance of the exhaustive photoeletrochemical cell with the novel bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode used as the nitrogen source a pool of 50 ml synthetic urea solution was poured into the cubic reaction tank under illumination and the original concentration of tn was kept at 30 mg l 1 the cell continued to operate for 60 min with the na2so4 as the electrolyte and nacl as the catalyst and thereafter the denitrification rate was measured the efficiency and kinetics curves of tn decomposition were analyzed in fig 3 a and fig 3b fig 3a presents the variation trend of tn in pec system with ruo2 wo3 wo3 and ruo2 anodes respectively after the ocular observation of fig 3a the curves in the utilization of ruo2 wo3 have sharp decline than that of the other two kinds of single materials and the experimental results without light current and electrodes had been given in our previous work whose tn removal rate were quite low respectively 0 5 0 8 and 43 89 the k is the denitrification rate constant compared with the single wo3 anode the novel ruo2 wo3 anode have more excellent properties on degrading urea fig 3b reveals the k value of the former is 0 498 mg l 1 min 1 3 08 times than that of the later demonstrating a significant improvement by the novel bi functional electrode in this work fig s4 gives a visual reason about the obvious efficiency increasing the bi functional anode shows the synergistic effect between the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation while the wo3 anode only displays the photocatalytic function luo et al 2018 synchronously for a more comprehensive comparison the pec with single ruo2 anode was also studied whose tn removal rate was only a little more than that with single wo3 electrode and also far below that with ruo2 wo3 electrode 3 3 influence factors on the performance of pec 3 3 1 effect of the tn original concentration in urea solution the original concentration c o of total nitrogen in the urea solution dominates the reaction time in the experiments so this parameter plays a significant role in the pec system zong et al 2014a thus to assess the impact of the tn concentration in urea solution 10 20 30 40 50 mg l 1 urea n were added in the electrolyte solution which simultaneously contained 50 mm na2so4 50 mm nacl and other constituents fig 4 a shows the tn removal capacity of the system under different concentration of urea solution it can be seen that along with the difference of c o tn degradation efficiency can has wide swings the higher the urea original concentration the lower efficiency is in the presence of 30 mg l 1 urea n the tn removal rate can be up to 98 63 in the reaction time of 50 min and achieve 99 74 in 60 min which means that there s little tn left certainly when the c o is 20 mg l 1 the tn removal rate is only a little higher than that in 30 mg l 1 urea n solution and simultaneously much higher than that in 40 and 50 mg l 1 whose specific data is respectively 90 36 and 85 13 in 60 min overview the 30 mg l 1 urea n as the original concentration value is relatively suitable to definitely investigate the denitrification performance of the whole system in a short period of time 3 3 2 effect of the cl dosage the cl has a crucial influence on denitrification as the cl or clo generated from cl could promptly oxidize ammonia nitrogen or urea to n2 even over oxidize to nitrate ding et al 2016 so it must be essential to study the effect of cl by controlling its dosage the initial concentrations of cl were set as 0 25 50 and 75 mm in 30 mg l 1 urea n solution with 50 mm na2so4 electrolyte it can be observed from fig 4b that the usage of cl has an outstanding effect on degrading urea n to n2 the optimal degradation efficiency of tn in the experiment with 50 mm or 75 mm cl dosage approaches 100 within 60 min more than twice the efficiency in the experiment without cl compared to the 25 mm dosage of cl the 50 mm or 75 mm dosage also presents a sharp increase of 15 34 in the tn removal rate the results should be attributed to higher chlorine usage as the higher cl promotes more yield of clo accelerating the oxidation of urea n and enhancing the tn degradation efficiency nevertheless it does not mean the higher cl dosage is always the better as the concentration of chlorine continually increased the rate of tn removal dropped slightly since the various by products of high chlorine in solution were easy to generate and further threaten the whole system as a result the 50 mm cl dosage is more appropriate in our study 3 3 3 effect of bias potential the bias potential can effectively control the urea denitrification efficiency so it is an extremely important factor known to impact tn removal rate by the cyclic pec process hence it is worthwhile to investigate the urea n degradation efficiency at different bias potentials cho et al 2014a a series of experiments were conducted to degrade tn at various potentials in a 30 mg l 1 urea n solution with 50 mm na2so4 and nacl the bias potentials were 1 0 v 1 2 v 1 4 v 1 6 v and 1 8 v vs sce respectively fig 4c reflects the denitrification efficiency improve from 79 95 to 99 74 when the potential slightly floated from 1 0 v to 1 8 v vs sce tn removal rate at 1 6 v is basically consistent with that at 1 8 v in the reaction time of 50 min also exceeds those at other bias potentials this result indicates a higher bias potential applied on the pec system would be to the benefit of tn removal due to the higher potential give rise to greater photoelectric conversion efficiency which can generate a stronger electric field to separate photoelectron from holes on the surface of bilateral anode herein from an energy saving standpoint the bias potential of 1 6 v vs sce was chosen as a suitable experiment parameter 3 3 4 effect of the ph value the ph value of solution plays a pivotal role in the experiment by adjusting the concentration of h it s a vital factor to impact the decrease of tn in urea solution kim et al 2005 therefore it is valuable to explore the function of different ph values on tn degradation efficiency some experiments were designed to find out the relationship between them with the initial solution ph values of 3 5 7 9 and 11 the c o of tn was 30 mg l 1 in urea solution and the na2so4 as the electrolyte whose concentration was 50 mm fig 4d reveals that neutral ph is for the benefit of constructing a good atmosphere for denitrification in the pec system in a ph range of 5 9 the tn degradation efficiency has slight variations tn can be removed almost completely within 60 min from 3 to 11 of initial ph of solution the urea n degradation efficiency firstly increases and then decreases with the gradually increasing of ph achieving the best condition when ph is 7 the higher or lower ph values are unfavorable jiang et al 2019 one reason is that lower concentration of h can motivate reducibility in the urea solution and cause the generation of superfluous nh4 and the higher the ph is the proton donor changes from hydronium to water lamoureux et al 2019 which means the fewer h can be utilized so the weakly reductive solution is easy to produce plentiful no3 additionally cl2 evolution was indicated to be favored in comparison to o2 evolution at acidic ph which was also a reason of negative denitrification efficient at low ph for high alkaline ph o2 evolution is the predominant reaction oh tend to thermodynamically electrogenerated oh radicals by o2 evolution precedes the required potential in alkaline electrolytes furthermore it is considered the oxidation of clo yielding clo radical which subsequently reacts with oh releasing superoxide radical o2 from a series of oxidation reactions this reactive oxygen species can further react with clo yielding chloride and oxygen as products in alkaline media mostafa et al 2018 there s another reason is electrochemical window it has been depicted that the o2 evolution onset potential is shifted negatively with respect to the chloride free electrolyte when ph is increased the o2 evolution currents in presence of chloride will be also suppressed in lower ph but o2 signal presents a slightly higher ionic current this trend is explained by the o2 potential shift that increases the relevance of oxygen evolution as competitive reaction thus the accumulation of clo in neutral ph can scavenges the generated hydroxyl radicals yielding oxyacids to suppress the evolution of oxygen mostafa et al 2018 hence the neutral ph values was feasible for the work and taking all of these factors into account the ph of 7 should be chosen to optimize the results in the experiment 3 4 electrochemical analysis after the single factor assays above mentioned it can be proved that under different conditions of each parameter the denitrification efficiency can vary greatly whose main reason is that the current efficiency would have an obvious variation when the experimental condition changed and the current efficiency is heavily associated to the total nitrogen removal in urea solution the average current efficiency ace and the instantaneous current efficiency ice calculated using the equations below were employed to evaluate the impact of each factor on the energy cost of the process according to previous work chen et al 2007 fan et al 2013 the results measured above were used to calculate the following parameters to characterize the electrochemical process of tn decomposition see the following formulas a c e 3 f v t n r 14 i t i c e 3 f v t n t Î´ t t n t 14 i Î´ t t n r u r e a n o u r e a n t n o 3 n t n h 4 n t where ace and ice are the average current efficiency and instantaneous current efficiency tn r is the total nitrogen removed in time t urea n o and urea n t are the concentration of urea nitrogen at time zero and t no 3 n t and nh 4 n t are the generation of no3 n and nh4 n at time t respectively tn t Î´t and tn t are the tn concentration in the solution at time t and t Î´t f is the faraday constant whose specific value is 96 485 c per mole t is the time s Î´t is a short time interval v is the volume of the urea solution l i is the current density a 3 is the number of exchanged electrons for the electrochemical oxidation of urea and 14 is the molecular mass of nitrogen whose unit is g mol 1 ace and ice can explain the effect of every factor on the denitrification efficiency from another point as well as the energy consumption during reaction time fig s5 demonstrates the change trend of ice under optimal conditions above mentioned in the section of 3 2 and at the time of 10 min the ice approximately reaches the peak value herein we used the ice10 as the parameter characterizing instantaneous current efficiency in the system table s1 presents the detail values of ace in the reaction time of 60 min and ice10 under different conditions it can be seen that the electrochemical efficiency of bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode is significantly better than that of wo3 or ruo2 anode using ruo2 wo3 as the anode the maximum of ace was 19 4 under the condition of ph 7 u 1 6 v vs sce cl 50 mm and the original tn concentration of 30 mg l 1 while the ice10 also peaked at 57 4 compared with ice and ace less than 10 of electrochemical oxidation of ammonia with ruo2 iro2 tio2 ti anode from the study of chen et al this result seem to be more gratifying demonstrating ruo2 wo3 a more suitable electrode material for tn removal and make full use of energy the dosage of cl is also critical for the increase of efficiency in the absence of chlorine the ace value was only 11 7 and the ace could continually improve by 7 7 with the higher and higher concentration of cl until the dosage reached 50 mm subsequently the ace value dropped to 16 8 when the nacl overdosed for ice10 this trend also applied the energy utilization could be maximized with the cl concentration of 50 mm similarly there were also a suitable potential and a best ph value for achieving optimum current efficiencies both the ace and ice initially increased and subsequently decreased as the bias potential gradually rose since a higher bias potential contributed to a higher current density and resulted in an increase in oxygen evolution this result is consistent with previous researches chen et al 2007 as for ph value different values had few effects on the tendency of ace and ice10 but under the condition of neutral ph the current efficiencies still had certain advantage as a consequence the influence of every factor on ace and ice is consistent with that on denitrification in addition it indicates the ice would be considerable within the first 10 min of the reaction time as the urea can be rapidly converted to n2 by the radicals of clo during this period after 10 min it is displayed that ice have declined substantially to 0 through the experiment data in fig s5 3 5 the mechanism of circulative pec system in this work we constructed an exhaustive denitrification system based on the photoelectrochemical cell pec as demonstrated in fig 5 in the pec system the most significant highlight was the application of bi functional ruo2 wo3 anode this novel anode had two sides one was attached to the wo3 nanoarray the other was covered by ruo2 nanoparticles the wo3 nano film has an excellent photo response under visible light irradiation the photoelectron escapes from the surface of wo3 film and photogenerated holes h yield fleetly forming the photoelectron hole pairs photogenerated holes have a strong oxidation capacity to rapidly transform h2o to hydroxy radicals ho and a little cl to chlorine radicals cl eq ji et al 2017 and it is also elucidated that ruo2 could facilitate and accelerate the generation of major active chlorine species hclo in studies published by luo et al and chen et al chen et al 2007 luo et al 2018 thus based on these facts we make a bifacial combination of two kinds of superior materials after that the bifacial ruo2 wo3 anode was synthesized and its performance was determined results indicates that the tn decomposition rate in pec system with bi functional anode is much higher than that with single wo3 anode or ruo2 anode as shown in fig 4a the rate constant of ruo2 wo3 electrode is the 3 08 times than that of wo3 and 2 64 times than that of ruo2 herein we speculated the reason why the efficiency was greatly enhanced was that the significant combination of bi functional anode contributed to the positive influence of clo on denitrification zhang et al and cho et al researched and confirmed the clo played a major role in stripping nitrogen from ammonia or urea cho and hoffmann 2014 zhang et al 2019 to verify the existence of radicals we investigated the radical species by epr spectra with the assistance of dmpo which was used as the capture reagent specific result was reflected in fig 6 on the image clear quartet peaks of dmpo oh with 1 2 2 1 intensity could be observed in the system without chlorine while a nine line epr spectra was observed with cl and the later was proved to be corresponding to reactive chlorine species our previous work shen et al 2019a also demonstrated the epr spectra with the single wo3 anode in the existence of cl and the intensities of radicals in which were weaker than that with ruo2 wo3 anode while the much stronger radicals accomplished the more rapid and efficient denitrification confirming the excellent properties of bi functional anode this two sides anode can induced the combination of cl and oh by the process of photo reactions from wo3 side and electrochemical reactions from ruo2 side since the wo3 motivated chlorine radicals and hydroxide radicals and these two could be effectively synthesized to clo which was characterized as the inverted triangle with strengthening peaks according to the experimental results above we tentatively propose the reasonable reaction route of radicals under irradiation condition oh generated by the oxidizing of photo holes can convert cl to cl on the side of wo3 eq 6 and on the other side chloride oxidation occurs efficiently in the low potential producing more rcs luan et al 2012 when hydroxy radicals and hypochlorous acid coincidentally happen together they would react to create the new species clo eq 11 and 12 certainly the chlorine radicals can also be oxidized to clo eq 10 which dominated the oxidation of urea and degraded tn fleetly hence the decomposition from urea to n2 is significantly enhanced as presented in fig 5 the urea n is first attacked by clo cl to inorganic monochloramine dichloramine and further trichloramine eq 13 17 as the reaction intermediates garcia segura et al 2019 and then the chloramines species were eventually dechlorinated by the rcs and transformed to major nitrogen in eq 24 26 and minor nitrate as by product over oxidized by clo in eq 21 23 7 2cl cl2 2e 8 cl2 h2o hclo hcl 9 cl 2oh ocl h2o 2e 10 cl hocl clo h cl 11 oh hocl clo h2o 12 oh ocl clo oh 13 nh2 2co clo nh2 nh2cl co2 14 nh2 hclo nh2cl oh 15 nh2cl

co2 2h meanwhile for the over oxidized nitrate we used the reductive cathode pd au pn to dispose we have known the nitrate could be selectively reduced to n2 and slight nh4 by metallic catalyst from jung et al sungyoon et al 2014 as a result the bimetallic pd au pn was adapted due to quick adsorption and conversion of nitrate through the positive charge eq 24 28 suggest that nitrate can be reduced to slightly intermediate nitrite extremely short lived after adsorption on au site and then further reduced to n2 on the pd sites once attached nitrite pd probably tend to convert nitrite to n2 which is rate limiting step in the whole process of reducing no3 to n2 cheng et al 2013 simultaneously the au is quite crucial position on the conversion of no3 to no2 tada et al 2004 24 no3 au au

mechanisms of nitrate to nitrogen also should be considered garcia segura et al 2019 involving numerous reactions products and stable intermediates eq 29 33 such as ammonia nitrite hydrazine hydroxylamine nitric oxide nitrous oxide and so on which span the many nitrogen oxidation states among this the mainly reactions could be calculated as eq 34 and 35 additionally very a little nitrate can also be directly transformed to nh4 by pd au pn cathode and subsequently oxidized by clo to n2 some researches dortsiou and kyriacou 2009 katsounaros et al 2006 have also discussed the conversion mechanism of urea to nitrate nitrite or ammonia and speculated the reaction pathways of tn transformation as follow urea n no2 n no3 n nh4 n n2 and in this work the by product nitrite was barely measured in the system as the clo was a kind of strong oxidant which could rapidly convert nitrite to nitrate shortening the lifespan of no2 as shown in fig 7 the concentration variation of the no3 n no2 n and nh4 n are revealed in the reaction time of 60 min the quantities of no3 n and nh4 n are major components for analysis in the solution and the no2 n is too little to be effectively detected thus the no2 n is only considered as an intermediate which immediately is oxidized to no3 n the reaction pathways can be simulated again according to the experiments results here urea n no3 n nh4 n n2 above all we achieved an exhaustive denitrification system by the combination of tn oxidation on the anode and nitrate reduction on the cathode the system can ensure the stable and consistent operation until the tn is sufficiently removed 3 6 the denitrification from synthetic and actual urine by the exhaustive pec system to further investigate the function of pec system with novel ruo2 wo3 anode the urea in synthetic urine and actual urine were employed as the targets the synthetic urine was prepared as initial urine sample according to the udert et al udert et al 2003 as described in table s2 and we diluted synthetic urine to 50 mgn l 1 the concentration in the domestic sewage the actual urine as the later sample was attained from 100 healthy volunteers half men and half women all healthy adults whose original concentration was surveyed approximately 6440 mgn l 1 both of 50 ml urine samples were poured into the cell under the illumination of a 350 w xe lamp with an am 1 5 filter the construction continued to work in neutral ph solution and the bias potential was 1 6 v vs sce and then the tn removal efficiencies were measured by tn analyzer fig 8 reflects the tn removal trend in synthetic and actual urine the tn in this two solutions both sharply declined the denitrification efficiency in synthetic sewage is 98 21 after the reaction time of 90 min the removal rate of 0 0102 mgn l 1 s 1 as comparation and the actual urine sample decreased by 892 mgn l 1 after 10 h with a removal rate of 0 0248 mg l 1 s 1 nevertheless the total nitrogen in the two samples could be running uninterruptedly even in the high nitrogen urine presenting the inventive pec system a serviceable creation 4 conclusions this study proposed an exhaustive pec system with the bi functional anode constituted of wo3 nanotubes and ruo2 coating to exhibit significant denitrification from urea the double sides anode could contribute to the synergistic performance of these two nano catalysts without the loss of their individual properties the synergetic effect mainly contained the simultaneous processes of photochemistry electrochemistry and reactive species chlorine oxidation which conduced to the generation of different radicals such as ho radicals cl and major clo radicals under the visible light the denitrification efficiency of the wo3 ruo2 was 3 08 times higher than the single wo3 and 2 64 times than ruo2 anodes in urea solution since the clo induced by bifacial anode had better performance on tn removal than cl or other rcs species the latter were produced by single wo3 or ruo2 anode the 30 mg l 1 tn could be completely removed in 60 min under the action of clo radicals and the optimum conditions eventually synthetic and actual urine were used as samples to investigate the pec cell the results demonstrated the diluted synthetic urine as well as the artificial domestic sewage had a denitrification efficiency of 98 21 after 90 min and the actual urine also had a sharp decline of tn this approach presents the promising technology on the directed clo generation by bi functional anode and its application on pec to remove tn and proposes an innovative mean

18297,inland lakes receive growing attentions on eutrophication and their roles in global carbon cycle however understanding how inland lakes contribute to global carbon cycle is seriously hampered due to a shortage of long term records this study investigated the carbon dioxide co2 flux from the lake taihu a large 2400 km2 and shallow mean depth 1 9 m eutrophic lake in subtropical region based on a long term 2000 2015 measurement of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 at high spatiotemporal resolution we found that the lake taihu was a significant source of atmospheric co2 with an average co2 emission flux at 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 mean 1standard deviation and a mean annual pco2 value of 778 169 Î¼atm the highest pco2 and co2 flux were observed in eutrophic zone with a high external input of carbon and nutrient and the lowest in non eutrophic zones with no direct external input of nutrient and carbon a substantial seasonal pattern in pco2 was observed particularly in eutrophic pelagic area and was significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyll a long term measurement showed the interannual variation in annual lake co2 dynamics which was highly sensitive to human induced nutrient input watershed input of carbon and nutrient leads to the high co2 level counterbalancing the in lake primary production all lines of evidence suggest that human activities may have predominate contribution to co2 source in the lake taihu and this mechanism might be widespread in global freshwater lakes keywords lake taihu co2 dynamic co2 budget external loadings human activity 1 introduction lakes are generally supersaturated with carbon dioxide co2 due to internal metabolic activities and external loading and thus play a disproportionately considerable role in the atmospheric co2 budget cole et al 1994 raymond et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 it is estimated that lakes occupy approximately 3 7 of global land area verpoorter et al 2014 but emit 0 11 0 57 pg c yr 1 as co2 which serve as a significant source of atmospheric co2 borges et al 2015 cole et al 2007 holgerson and raymond 2016 tranvik et al 2009 meanwhile some studies suggested that lake co2 production and emission will increase substantially due to warming hasler et al 2016 kosten et al 2010 marotta et al 2014 despite of high uncertainties it is well established that co2 emission from lakes is an important component in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 lake co2 emission varies strongly across regions and along latitudinal gradients marotta et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 sobek et al 2005 however the previous field measurements for lake co2 emission estimates are not geographically evenly distributed cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 lakes in the north temperate boreal and tropical zones are generally well investigated buffam et al 2011 hastie et al 2018 marotta et al 2009 however few field measurements of lake co2 have been reported for subtropical zone with only 3 of sampled lakes from this zone sobek et al 2005 eventually there are numerous lakes in subtropical regions it is estimated that approximately one third of lakes are located in subtropical zone that accounts for approximately 30 of total surface area lehner and doll 2004 verpoorter et al 2014 therefore long term monitoring of c cycling in subtropical lakes is critically important for accurately quantifying c budget in global lakes eutrophication is a serious environmental problem for inland lakes anderson et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 yet its impacts on lake c budget remains under investigated studies found that high nutrient loadings in eutrophic lakes stimulated mineralization and increased co2 emission kortelainen et al 2006 perga et al 2016 and the external carbon input further enhanced the co2 emission mcdonald et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2016 on the contrary a few studies found that high nutrient increased primary production in eutrophic lakes causing a decrease in co2 emission balmer and downing 2011 gu et al 2011 pacheco et al 2014 schindler et al 1997 a recent study reported a neutral impact of eutrophication on lake co2 emission in boreal lakes klaus et al 2018 considering accelerating eutrophication under changing climate sinha et al 2017 more field measurements are needed to better understand eutrophication impacts on lake c budget meanwhile understanding and predicting lake c cycling under a changing environment had been seriously hampered due to the shortage of long term records perga et al 2016 seekell and gudasz 2016 lake taihu a typical large area 2400 km2 shallow mean depth 1 9 m and eutrophic lake with frequent cyanobacterial blooms is located in the yangtze river delta china featuring marine monsoon subtropical climate the specific objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the variations in lake pco2 based on long term monthly and multi sites measurements 2 to determine the eutrophication impacts on pco2 variability and 3 to quantify the lake taihu s contribution to the watershed co2 budget this study presents one of the longest field records of large lake pco2 at high spatiotemporal resolution considering the dramatic changes in physical chemical and biological environments of lake taihu zhang et al 2018 this study provides a unique opportunity to examine co2 flux in an inland freshwater lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site lake taihu 30 56 31 33 n 119 52 120 36 e has a surface area of 2400 km2 a mean depth of 1 9 m and a catchment area of 36500 km2 the lake is surrounded by several large cities and its catchment is one of the most industrialized and densely populated regions in china the lake has a complex river network with 172 rivers or channels connecting to the lake showing distinct inflow and outflow regions inflow rivers are located in the northern and western sides of the lake and outflow in the eastern side of the lake the lake is located in a subtropical climate which is characterized by high water temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter the annual precipitation is approximately 1100 mm lee et al 2014 frequent eutrophication events have made lake taihu a priority environmental topic and a popular research site in the world duan et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 we divided the lake into three zones based on the eutrophic status and vegetation distribution fig 1 zone 1 including the northwest zone and meiliang bay is the most eutrophic part of the lake due to pollutant discharge of inflowing rivers zone 3 is connected to the outflowing rivers of the lake and is inhabited by dense aquatic vegetation zone 2 is connected to a few inflowing rivers and represents a transitional region this is evidenced from the mean total nitrogen concentrations of 3 25 mg l 1 2 14 mg l 1 and 1 29 mg l 1 for zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 respectively xiao et al 2019 and in the average vegetation coverage of 3 8 kg m 2 in zone 3 and close to zero in zone 1 and 2 luo et al 2016 qin et al 2007 there are 29 sampling sites that are evenly distributed across the lake fig 1 there are 9 sampling sites in zone 1 12 in zone 2 and 8 in zone 3 it is worth noting that there are some sampling sites in zone 1 and zone 2 nearby inflow rivers we further divided the two zones into two section the river mouth and the pelagic area in below analysis briefly there are three sites in river mouth for zone 1 the site of 6 10 and 16 and zone 2 the site of 11 13 and 14 fig 1 respectively 2 2 data acquisitions long term limnological observations of lake taihu including the measurements of physical chemical and biological parameters have been conducted by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller zhang et al 2018 qin et al 2019 the field measurements of the lake present some of the earliest limnological multi sites observations in china tller led the field sampling of the total 29 sampling sites across the lake and field measurements covered the entire lake zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 since 2000 thus this study focused on the data collected during 2000 2015 meanwhile monthly measurements were conducted in zones 1 and 2 while seasonal measurements were conducted in zone 3 in february may august and november each field survey across whole lake was generally completed between 9 00 and 17 00 in two consecutive days variables considered in this study include water temperature tw ph alkalinity alk dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen n h 4 n nitrate nitrogen n o 3 n total phosphorus tp dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic chlorophyll a chl a and water clarity ph was measured with a composite electrode in the field which was calibrated by standard buffer solution prior to measurement tw and do were measured with a multi parameter probe alk was measured via titration with hydrochloric acid standard solution nutrient tn n h 4 n n o 3 n and tp were measured with a spectrophotometer doc dic were measured with a toc analyzer chl a was determined spectrophotometrically and water clarity was given by secchi disk depth the measurements of alk were conducted immediately on the sampling date the surface water samples for the analysis of nutrient do dic chl a and alk were preserved in ice chilled coolers while in the field then these samples were transported to laboratory for immediate filtration and measurements the long term dynamic and trend of the physical chemical and biological parameters from tller have been reported in previous studies duan et al 2009 xu et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 2 3 calculations of co2 partial pressure and flux we calculated the partial pressure of co2 pco2 based on ph alkalinity and in situ water temperature from the tller dataset the details of the calculation equations are given in the supporting information text s1 meanwhile direct measurements of pco2 via headspace equilibration method were conducted in the lake since 2011 and the indirectly calculated pco2 was highly correlated with directly measured pco2 fig s1 r 2 0 76 p 0 01 diel sampling for direct pco2 measurements was also conducted at eutrophic zone of lake taihu the mlw site fig s2 to investigate diel cycle in the co2 dynamics the water samples were collected every 3 h for three consecutive days in each month from august 2012 to july 2013 fig s2 the co2 flux f c mmol m 2 d 2 a positive value indicates co2 emission from the water to atmosphere across the water air interface was estimated based on the bulk diffusion model cole and caraco 1998 1 f c k kh pco2 p a where kh is the henry s constant mol l 1 atm 1 adjusted for water temperature text s1 p a is the partial pressure of co2 in atmosphere Î¼atm local p a was measured by co2 gas analyzer model g1301 picarro inc ca usa in the study of xiao et al 2014 the gas transfer coefficient k m d 1 is dependent on wind speed based on the study of cole and caraco 1998 which was presented in details in the supporting information text s2 for k calculation we utilized the long term wind speed data 2000 2015 from dongshan ds station of the china meteorological observation network the data was downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc nmic cn the ds station is located at the peak of dongshan mountain and is surrounded by lake taihu on three sides fig 1 the wind speed at ds was lower than that at open area of lake taihu due to sheltering effect of the local terrain wang et al 2014 therefore we corrected the long term wind speed data based on the synchronous wind speed measurement at pts a micrometeorological site located in the center of lake taihu fig 1 lee et al 2014 given the measured wind speed at the two sites were highly correlated fig s3 there are several formulations considering both wind speed and water vertical mixing velocity for the k calculation e g macintyre et al 2010 read et al 2012 we calculated the co2 gas transfer coefficient k using the models given by read et al 2012 and podgrajsek et al 2015 in the supporting information text s2 there were insignificant p 0 05 differences between k values calculated by the equation described by cole and caraco 1998 and those calculated by equations considering both wind shear and water mixing regime in lake taihu fig s4 this is consistent with the study of read et al 2012 showing that the k value in the large lake was driven primarily by wind speed 2 4 statistic analysis simple linear regression was carried out to derive correlations between the environmental variables and pco2 prior to linear regression analyses these variables were log transformed to ensure normality the co2 flux over the lake was calculated based on the long term pco2 statistical analysis showed log transformation co2 flux over the lake were normally distributed a monthly zonal mean was calculated using all measurements within the corresponding zone from 2000 to 2015 the whole lake pco2 and corresponding co2 flux were computed as an area weighted zonal average monthly zonal mean variables including pco2 co2 flux and environmental variables were summarized as means for spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november winter december to february in next year and annual mean from 2000 to 2015 the zone 1 and zone 2 were further separated into river mouth and pelagic area to distinguish the watershed impacts respectively a least significant difference post hoc test was used to determine the differences among measured variables using spss version 18 0 and differences at the p 0 05 level were deemed statistically significant 3 results 3 1 environmental variabilities lake taihu showed dramatic spatial variability but reasonable temporal variability in chemical and biological properties based on multi year s measurements figs 2 3 b the highest concentrations of nutrient doc dic and chl a with annual mean values of 4 04 mg l 1 tn 6 27 mg l 1 19 50 mg l 1 and 30 42 Î¼g l 1 were observed in zone 1 significantly p 0 01 higher than those in zones 2 and 3 on the contrary the lowest do with an annual mean value of 8 60 mg l 1 was observed in zone 1 for zone 1 the concentrations of nutrient doc and dic in river mouth with annual mean values of 5 35 mg l 1 tn 6 81 mg l 1 and 21 09 mg l 1 were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in pelagic area due to the directly discharge via inflowing rivers table 1 fig s5 for zone 2 these variables showed nonsignificant p 0 05 difference between river mouth and pelagic area due to the less polluted inflow rivers fig s5 in contrast to chemical and biological properties water temperature and wind speed were remarkably uniform across the lake fig s6 the spatial variability of water temperature is less than 1 c during measurement period and the annual mean water temperature was 17 9 9 5 c the wind speed variation was 0 1 m s 1 across the entire lake with an annual mean value of 4 5 m s 1 the temperature has increased and wind speed has decreased significantly in recent decades fig 3a 3 2 spatiotemporal variabilities of pco2 3 2 1 inter annual variability the lake exhibited remarkable spatial and inter annual variations in pco2 figs 3c and 4 spatially the pco2 in zone 1 with an annual mean value of 1000 260 Î¼atm were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in the zone 2 663 148 Î¼atm and zone 3 707 176 Î¼atm and the highest pco2 occurred in river mouth of zone 1 temporally the inter annual variability in pco2 was substantial and showed the similar trend for all three zones fig 3c however the amplitude maximum minus minimum of pco2 in zone 1 824 Î¼atm was larger than those in zone 2 587 Î¼atm and zone 3 646 Î¼atm for the entire lake the highest pco2 appeared in 2010 with an annual mean value of 1053 467 Î¼atm and lowest in 2001 with an annual mean value of 455 216 Î¼atm the temporal variations in pco2 fall into three stages for the three zones 1 from 2000 to 2004 the pco2 increased significantly 2 from 2004 to 2010 the pco2 were relatively stable and then decreased since 2007 especially in zone 1 and 3 after 2010 the pco2 exhibited a decreasing trend multiple year measurements showed the most dramatic inter annual variabilities in pco2 were observed in river mouths fig 4 3 2 2 seasonal and monthly variability the pco2 showed substantial seasonal variations fig 5 and table s1 the pco2 was significantly different between summer and winter p 0 01 but not significantly different among spring autumn and winter p 0 05 the lake wide mean pco2 was the lowest in summer with a value of 634 224 Î¼atm and the highest in winter with a mean value of 874 230 Î¼atm the spatial variations in pco2 were relatively weak in summer except some isolated spots in river mouth showing pulse pco2 fig 5 the seasonal variation of pco2 was more remarkable in pelagic area than in river mouth in both zones 1 and 2 fig 6 in zone 1 the mean pco2 in winter 964 84 Î¼atm was 59 higher than the summer value 607 71 Î¼atm for pelagic area comparing with the 30 difference in river mouth area in zone 2 the mean pco2 in winter 762 71 Î¼atm was significantly p 0 01 higher than the summer value 575 37 Î¼atm for pelagic area while the differences between the two seasons winter 772 60 Î¼atm summer 665 66 Î¼atm were nonsignificant p 0 61 for river mouth 3 3 co2 flux the lake co2 emission varied seasonally annually and spatially table s1 and fig 7 the annual mean co2 flux was 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 adding up to an annual co2 emission of 0 7 0 3 tg yr 1 seasonally peak co2 emission appeared in winter with a mean value of 24 4 11 5 mmol m 2 d 1 and summertime flux was the lowest with a mean value of 10 0 11 8 mmol m 2 d 1 annually the peak co2 flux 38 0 16 7 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in 2005 which was approximately twenty times of the lowest flux in 2001 spatially zone 1 had significantly p 0 01 higher co2 flux 30 0 14 5 mmol m 2 d 1 than zone 2 12 4 6 7 mmol m 2 d 1 and zone 3 14 2 8 8 mmol m 2 d 1 the flux in river mouth 56 9 29 1 mmol m 2 d 1 was significantly p 0 01 higher than in pelagic area 19 0 12 1 mmol m 2 d 1 within the zone 1 however there was no significant p 0 73 difference between river mouth and pelagic area in the zone 2 3 4 factors influencing pco2 various factors affect the pco2 in the lake taihu the chl a influenced the seasonal variation of the lake pco2 fig 6 however the zonal pco2 exhibited different responses to chl a in zones 1 and 2 the lake monthly mean pco2 and were negatively correlated with chl a concentration for pelagic area but the patterns were not profound in river mouth within these same zones fig 8 in zone 3 pco2 showed low value in growing seasons summer and high value in winter overall and the variation was not associated with chl a but negatively associated with water clarity fig s7 an index of aquatic vegetation biomass in lake taihu xiao et al 2017 the variability in pco2 was positively correlated with n h 4 n n o 3 n tn tp dic and doc but negatively correlated with do table 2 and fig s8 the annual mean pco2 was highly correlated with nutrient loadings such as the tn in zone 1 r 0 84 p 0 01 n 16 zone 2 r 0 80 p 0 01 n 16 and zone 3 r 0 58 p 0 01 n 16 from 2000 to 2015 however the inter annual variability in pco2 was slightly affected by temperature and wind speed fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 whole lake co2 budget the estimated co2 flux in the lake taihu ranged from 23 6 to 808 1 mmol m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 based on the gas transfer model the mean co2 flux in the lake was slightly lower than those from lakes in the contiguous united states mcdonald et al 2013 significantly lower than from boreal lakes with a mean value of 33 3 mmol m 2 d 1 hastie et al 2018 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 and was higher than from temperature lake with mean value of 5 7 8 9 mmol m 2 d 1 buffam et al 2011 for comparison the mean co2 flux from global lakes was 20 9 28 6 mmol m 2 d 1 holgerson and raymond 2016 tranvik et al 2009 it should be noted that the mean pco2 and co2 emission flux in the lake taihu were generally higher than that in other eutrophic lakes table s2 a large amount of co2 evasion into the atmosphere was confirmed in this study indicating the lake taihu as a carbon source at an annual emission of 80 g c m 2 yr 1 it is difference from a study on carbon burial that reported lake taihu as a carbon sink with carbon burial rate of 5 g c m 2 yr 1 dong et al 2012 this discrepancy might due to the different approach in two studies extrapolating the estimated co2 flux of lake taihu in this study to others lakes in yangtze river delta given a large uncertainty 48 309 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 7b these lakes with carbon burial rate of 5 373 g c m 2 yr 1 dong et al 2012 were also likely to act as carbon sources since previous studies primarily focused on the eutrophication effects in the yangtze river delta china duan et al 2017 paerl et al 2011 qin et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 this study to our best knowledge is among the first attempts to report the eutrophication impacts on lake surface co2 dynamics at a high spatiotemporal resolution in this region the results not only fill the gap of co2 flux in lake taihu but also provide a valuable data sources for predicting how eutrophic lake co2 level evolve in a changing environment previous study reported that lake co2 emission was highly associated with catchment productivity butman et al 2016 maberly et al 2013 the net primary production npp in taihu basin with an area of 36500 km2 is about 14 5 tg c yr 1 xu et al 2017b the co2 emission from lake taihu alone accounted for 1 3 of the npp based on our measurements extrapolating lake taihu measurements to the whole lake basin 3160 km2 we estimated that approximately 1 7 of npp was lost to the atmosphere as co2 consisting with the study in english lake district maberly et al 2013 taking the national total lake co2 emissions as 12 1 tg c yr 1 li et al 2018 the co2 emissions from lake taihu accounted for 1 6 of the national lake co2 budget across china our data showed the lake pco2 varied seasonally and spatially potentially resulting in the similar trend for co2 flux natchimuthu et al 2017 it should be noted that a majority of lake co2 budget focus on warm season or use snapshot sampling regardless of temporal variability klaus et al 2019 mcdonald et al 2013 wen et al 2017 which is likely to lead to biased estimates previous studies showed large variability in lake co2 flux across region li et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 sobek et al 2005 our results suggest co2 flux varied dramatically within the single lake along the eutrophication gradients fig 4 annual mean co2 flux based on single sampling sites ranged from 62 to 397 of the whole lake mean flux suggesting the high underestimation or overestimation of lake co2 flux using single site measurement natchimuthu et al 2017 seekell et al 2014 4 2 causes of the lake co2 supersaturation eutrophic lakes were generally undersaturated for co2 and tend to be sink of atmospheric co2 due to the high primary production balmer and downing 2011 gu et al 2011 schindler et al 1997 however the eutrophic lake taihu are presently supersaturated with co2 778 169 Î¼atm and acts as a source of atmospheric co2 fig 7 this might be caused by the high external carbon and nutrient inputs watershed level carbon inputs may lead to the co2 supersaturation considering its complicated river network and high productivity perga et al 2016 rudorff et al 2011 high doc and dic concentrations in inflow rivers were associated with the spatial distribution of the lake carbon fractionation fig s5 the external dic input may directly increase the co2 level leading to the lake as a significant atmospheric co2 source kiuru et al 2018 mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 additionally the high river discharge of doc can also raise the lake co2 level via supplying c substrate algesten et al 2003 larsen et al 2011 sobek et al 2005 the pco2 in river mouth was about 2 times higher than that in pelagic areas in zone 1 with high external dic and doc input table s2 likely caused by the heavy external carbon input human driven nutrient inputs seem to elevate the lake pco2 level in this study the lake pco2 value increased with nutrient n h 4 n n o 3 n tn and tp table 2 and fig s8 which was consistent with previous studies kortelainen et al 2006 li et al 2012 natchimuthu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wen et al 2017 although nutrient loadings in lake can either increase co2 via enhancing respiration or decrease co2 via promoting primary production the ultimate impact depending the balance of co2 production and consumption perga et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the high human driven loadings input together with the high organic carbon would stimulate microbial activities and enhance respiration resulting in more co2 production in inland lakes the inverse relationship between do concentration and nutrient loadings fig 2 and the significantly negative correlation between do and pco2 fig s8f and table 2 also support this the substantial nutrient loadings in the lake is mainly from the watershed input paerl et al 2011 qin et al 2007 thus the high human driven nutrient inputs may potentially stimulate respiration and then increase lake co2 level the substantial difference in pco2 value between zone 1 and the other two zones demonstrated the importance of external input in determining lake co2 level the mean pco2 in zone 1 was 1000 260 Î¼atm compared with 663 148 Î¼atm in zone 2 and 707 176 Î¼atm in zone 3 table s2 the physical factors such as water temperature and wind speed were remarkably uniform across different zones of the lake wang et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 fig s6 however zone 1 received a large amount of anthropogenic derived nutrient and carbon via inflow rivers discharges zone 2 and zone 3 were relatively clean due to no direct river pollutant inputs fig 2 fig s5 these also suggested anthropogenic nutrient and carbon inputs increased co2 level and dominated spatial variation of co2 in the lake the substantial portion of co2 derived from external input had been demonstrated by field measurements and modeling in others worldwide lakes e g kiuru et al 2018 mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 suggesting this mechanism might be widespread in global freshwater lakes 4 3 roles of human activities in pco2 variation the weak influence of chl a on pco2 seasonal variation in river mouth may arise from the human driven pollutant input in regard to the seasonal variation in the lake pco2 our results showed significantly higher values occurred in the winter and lower values in the summer consistent with the field measurement in other lakes with algal blooms gu et al 2011 shao et al 2015 xing et al 2005 the seasonal patterns were associated with the chl a concentration however the roles of chl a in determining pco2 seasonal variation varied among regions the most apparent feature was the relatively weak correlation for the river mouths in zone 1 and zone 2 fig 8 these river mouth regions hold the anthropogenic loadings and the human driven nutrient and carbon may have confounded the effect of chl a on the co2 dynamics human activities may dominate the substantial inter annual variability in the pco2 the lake pco2 inter annual variability figs 3 and 4 was partly explained by the reduction of external pollutant input from the watershed imposed by the local government paerl et al 2011 qin et al 2007 xu et al 2017a the zero point action aiming at industrial pollution control was implemented around 2000 and ultimately reduced the lake pollutant level paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2017a probably leading to the lowest pco2 in 2000 2001 607 Î¼atm in 2001 table s1 the pco2 increased after 2001 this is partly attributed to pollutant discharge from watershed increased again after that xu et al 2017a evidencing from the increasing nutrient loading in the lake fig 3b a drinking water crisis in lake taihu took place in may 2007 due to a massive bloom of cyanobacteria qin et al 2010 prompting a wide range of activities e g closing a number of polluting factories in an effort to reduce external pollutant loading these measures may have led to a considerable decline in pollutant concentrations in recent years jeppesen et al 2005 xu et al 2017a and the associated decline in pco2 efforts aiming at eutrophication control may pose dramatic influences on lake co2 variability frequent eutrophication events in lake taihu had led to a series of environmental protection actions qin et al 2010 2019 xu et al 2017a paerl et al 2011 since 2007 these managements including shutting off heavily polluted rivers establishing wastewater treatment plants closing small polluting factories and resorting wetlands have been widely implemented qin et al 2019 these environmental investments may potentially decrease the external carbon input and the associated co2 level brigham et al 2019 fan et al 2003 on the others hand the nutrient loadings in the lake would be reduced due to these management practices jeppesen et al 2005 zhou et al 2017 as shown in fig 4b probably leading to the improving water quality and low co2 production rate brigham et al 2019 kortelainen et al 2006 wang et al 2017 the impacts of human activities on lake carbon biogeochemistry provide valuable information for management practices for the lake and upstream regions the annual mean lake co2 dynamics were highly sensitive to human driven pollutant fig 3 suggesting the important role of watershed and lake management on lake co2 budget our findings suggested that measures should be taken to reduce watershed nutrient and carbon discharge into the lake to further decrease co2 emission jiang et al 2018 schrier uijl et al 2011 and more studies should be carried out to investigate the underlying mechanisms to reach a harmonized relationship between lakes and human 4 4 uncertainties in pco2 and co2 estimations the calculated pco2 may be overestimated due to the contribution of organic acids to alkalinity and the lower carbonate system buffering capacity at low ph abril et al 2015 in this study less that 1 of all the samples with ph below 7 4 and only two samples with ph below 7 together with the low doc concentration table 1 suggested the overestimation could be neglected abril et al 2015 meanwhile the calculated pco2 was highly correlated with directly measured pco2 fig s1 implying a minor uncertainty in the calculated pco2 the co2 flux in this study was based on the wind dependent gas transfer coefficient k cole and caraco 1998 we showed that the k value does vary among methods but the differences between them were nonsignificant fig s4 the mean k value used for co2 flux estimation was 1 26 0 42 m d 1 we also compared part of the estimated co2 flux with those measured directly by eddy covariance method there is a sampling site 5 close to the micrometeorological site of lake taihu fig s9a in which the surface co2 flux was measured directly by eddy covariance method xiao et al 2014 part of the direct co2 flux measurement occurred under open fetch and coincided approximatively with the field sampling at 5 site the co2 flux estimated with the gas transfer model at 5 site was uncorrelated p 0 21 with the flux measured directly with the eddy covariance method at the micrometeorological site but the co2 flux difference fig s9b between the two measurements was insignificant p 0 93 the pco2 is a dominant variable influencing co2 flux natchimuthu et al 2017 in this study diurnal samplings showed the daytime pco2 was 2 lower than the whole day value fig s2 so the whole lake pco2 and associated co2 flux may have been underestimated by a similar amount the declining trend for pco2 from late morning 853 Î¼atm at 9 00 to evening 709 Î¼atm at 18 00 was found on annual basis fig s2 which was consistent with the field measurement in other subtropical mesotrophic lake yang et al 2019 although each whole lake survey was completed within the period the annual mean pco2 across each spatial sampling site ranged from 653 Î¼atm to 1867 Î¼atm fig 7a suggesting the sampling time may have mirror influence on the spatial pattern fan et al 2003 5 conclusions long term measurement 2000 2015 confirmed the lake taihu as a significant source for atmospheric co2 with an annual mean co2 flux of 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 or 0 7 0 3 tg yr 1 and the annual mean pco2 was 778 169 Î¼atm the highest flux occurred in eutrophic zone with substantial external input of carbon and nutrient and the lowest flux was in non eutrophic zones without directly external input the lake co2 dynamics also varied seasonally and annually emphasizing the importance of yearlong and spatially distributed sampling to achieve unbiased lake co2 budget high watershed input of carbon and nutrient is likely to lead to co2 emission rather than higher primary production in the lake but the underlying mechanisms deserve further investigation long term field measurements of co2 dynamics in the highly heterogeneous lake taihu will shed light on the effect of eutrophication and watershed management on co2 emissions from freshwater lakes this study presented one of the longest field records of large lake co2 at a high spatiotemporal resolution which not only provides useful information for the regional budget of co2 from lakes but also provides a valuable example to predict lake co2 fluxes under a changing environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18297,inland lakes receive growing attentions on eutrophication and their roles in global carbon cycle however understanding how inland lakes contribute to global carbon cycle is seriously hampered due to a shortage of long term records this study investigated the carbon dioxide co2 flux from the lake taihu a large 2400 km2 and shallow mean depth 1 9 m eutrophic lake in subtropical region based on a long term 2000 2015 measurement of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 at high spatiotemporal resolution we found that the lake taihu was a significant source of atmospheric co2 with an average co2 emission flux at 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 mean 1standard deviation and a mean annual pco2 value of 778 169 Î¼atm the highest pco2 and co2 flux were observed in eutrophic zone with a high external input of carbon and nutrient and the lowest in non eutrophic zones with no direct external input of nutrient and carbon a substantial seasonal pattern in pco2 was observed particularly in eutrophic pelagic area and was significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyll a long term measurement showed the interannual variation in annual lake co2 dynamics which was highly sensitive to human induced nutrient input watershed input of carbon and nutrient leads to the high co2 level counterbalancing the in lake primary production all lines of evidence suggest that human activities may have predominate contribution to co2 source in the lake taihu and this mechanism might be widespread in global freshwater lakes keywords lake taihu co2 dynamic co2 budget external loadings human activity 1 introduction lakes are generally supersaturated with carbon dioxide co2 due to internal metabolic activities and external loading and thus play a disproportionately considerable role in the atmospheric co2 budget cole et al 1994 raymond et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 it is estimated that lakes occupy approximately 3 7 of global land area verpoorter et al 2014 but emit 0 11 0 57 pg c yr 1 as co2 which serve as a significant source of atmospheric co2 borges et al 2015 cole et al 2007 holgerson and raymond 2016 tranvik et al 2009 meanwhile some studies suggested that lake co2 production and emission will increase substantially due to warming hasler et al 2016 kosten et al 2010 marotta et al 2014 despite of high uncertainties it is well established that co2 emission from lakes is an important component in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 lake co2 emission varies strongly across regions and along latitudinal gradients marotta et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 sobek et al 2005 however the previous field measurements for lake co2 emission estimates are not geographically evenly distributed cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 lakes in the north temperate boreal and tropical zones are generally well investigated buffam et al 2011 hastie et al 2018 marotta et al 2009 however few field measurements of lake co2 have been reported for subtropical zone with only 3 of sampled lakes from this zone sobek et al 2005 eventually there are numerous lakes in subtropical regions it is estimated that approximately one third of lakes are located in subtropical zone that accounts for approximately 30 of total surface area lehner and doll 2004 verpoorter et al 2014 therefore long term monitoring of c cycling in subtropical lakes is critically important for accurately quantifying c budget in global lakes eutrophication is a serious environmental problem for inland lakes anderson et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 yet its impacts on lake c budget remains under investigated studies found that high nutrient loadings in eutrophic lakes stimulated mineralization and increased co2 emission kortelainen et al 2006 perga et al 2016 and the external carbon input further enhanced the co2 emission mcdonald et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2016 on the contrary a few studies found that high nutrient increased primary production in eutrophic lakes causing a decrease in co2 emission balmer and downing 2011 gu et al 2011 pacheco et al 2014 schindler et al 1997 a recent study reported a neutral impact of eutrophication on lake co2 emission in boreal lakes klaus et al 2018 considering accelerating eutrophication under changing climate sinha et al 2017 more field measurements are needed to better understand eutrophication impacts on lake c budget meanwhile understanding and predicting lake c cycling under a changing environment had been seriously hampered due to the shortage of long term records perga et al 2016 seekell and gudasz 2016 lake taihu a typical large area 2400 km2 shallow mean depth 1 9 m and eutrophic lake with frequent cyanobacterial blooms is located in the yangtze river delta china featuring marine monsoon subtropical climate the specific objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the variations in lake pco2 based on long term monthly and multi sites measurements 2 to determine the eutrophication impacts on pco2 variability and 3 to quantify the lake taihu s contribution to the watershed co2 budget this study presents one of the longest field records of large lake pco2 at high spatiotemporal resolution considering the dramatic changes in physical chemical and biological environments of lake taihu zhang et al 2018 this study provides a unique opportunity to examine co2 flux in an inland freshwater lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site lake taihu 30 56 31 33 n 119 52 120 36 e has a surface area of 2400 km2 a mean depth of 1 9 m and a catchment area of 36500 km2 the lake is surrounded by several large cities and its catchment is one of the most industrialized and densely populated regions in china the lake has a complex river network with 172 rivers or channels connecting to the lake showing distinct inflow and outflow regions inflow rivers are located in the northern and western sides of the lake and outflow in the eastern side of the lake the lake is located in a subtropical climate which is characterized by high water temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter the annual precipitation is approximately 1100 mm lee et al 2014 frequent eutrophication events have made lake taihu a priority environmental topic and a popular research site in the world duan et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 we divided the lake into three zones based on the eutrophic status and vegetation distribution fig 1 zone 1 including the northwest zone and meiliang bay is the most eutrophic part of the lake due to pollutant discharge of inflowing rivers zone 3 is connected to the outflowing rivers of the lake and is inhabited by dense aquatic vegetation zone 2 is connected to a few inflowing rivers and represents a transitional region this is evidenced from the mean total nitrogen concentrations of 3 25 mg l 1 2 14 mg l 1 and 1 29 mg l 1 for zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 respectively xiao et al 2019 and in the average vegetation coverage of 3 8 kg m 2 in zone 3 and close to zero in zone 1 and 2 luo et al 2016 qin et al 2007 there are 29 sampling sites that are evenly distributed across the lake fig 1 there are 9 sampling sites in zone 1 12 in zone 2 and 8 in zone 3 it is worth noting that there are some sampling sites in zone 1 and zone 2 nearby inflow rivers we further divided the two zones into two section the river mouth and the pelagic area in below analysis briefly there are three sites in river mouth for zone 1 the site of 6 10 and 16 and zone 2 the site of 11 13 and 14 fig 1 respectively 2 2 data acquisitions long term limnological observations of lake taihu including the measurements of physical chemical and biological parameters have been conducted by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller zhang et al 2018 qin et al 2019 the field measurements of the lake present some of the earliest limnological multi sites observations in china tller led the field sampling of the total 29 sampling sites across the lake and field measurements covered the entire lake zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 since 2000 thus this study focused on the data collected during 2000 2015 meanwhile monthly measurements were conducted in zones 1 and 2 while seasonal measurements were conducted in zone 3 in february may august and november each field survey across whole lake was generally completed between 9 00 and 17 00 in two consecutive days variables considered in this study include water temperature tw ph alkalinity alk dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen n h 4 n nitrate nitrogen n o 3 n total phosphorus tp dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic chlorophyll a chl a and water clarity ph was measured with a composite electrode in the field which was calibrated by standard buffer solution prior to measurement tw and do were measured with a multi parameter probe alk was measured via titration with hydrochloric acid standard solution nutrient tn n h 4 n n o 3 n and tp were measured with a spectrophotometer doc dic were measured with a toc analyzer chl a was determined spectrophotometrically and water clarity was given by secchi disk depth the measurements of alk were conducted immediately on the sampling date the surface water samples for the analysis of nutrient do dic chl a and alk were preserved in ice chilled coolers while in the field then these samples were transported to laboratory for immediate filtration and measurements the long term dynamic and trend of the physical chemical and biological parameters from tller have been reported in previous studies duan et al 2009 xu et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 2 3 calculations of co2 partial pressure and flux we calculated the partial pressure of co2 pco2 based on ph alkalinity and in situ water temperature from the tller dataset the details of the calculation equations are given in the supporting information text s1 meanwhile direct measurements of pco2 via headspace equilibration method were conducted in the lake since 2011 and the indirectly calculated pco2 was highly correlated with directly measured pco2 fig s1 r 2 0 76 p 0 01 diel sampling for direct pco2 measurements was also conducted at eutrophic zone of lake taihu the mlw site fig s2 to investigate diel cycle in the co2 dynamics the water samples were collected every 3 h for three consecutive days in each month from august 2012 to july 2013 fig s2 the co2 flux f c mmol m 2 d 2 a positive value indicates co2 emission from the water to atmosphere across the water air interface was estimated based on the bulk diffusion model cole and caraco 1998 1 f c k kh pco2 p a where kh is the henry s constant mol l 1 atm 1 adjusted for water temperature text s1 p a is the partial pressure of co2 in atmosphere Î¼atm local p a was measured by co2 gas analyzer model g1301 picarro inc ca usa in the study of xiao et al 2014 the gas transfer coefficient k m d 1 is dependent on wind speed based on the study of cole and caraco 1998 which was presented in details in the supporting information text s2 for k calculation we utilized the long term wind speed data 2000 2015 from dongshan ds station of the china meteorological observation network the data was downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc nmic cn the ds station is located at the peak of dongshan mountain and is surrounded by lake taihu on three sides fig 1 the wind speed at ds was lower than that at open area of lake taihu due to sheltering effect of the local terrain wang et al 2014 therefore we corrected the long term wind speed data based on the synchronous wind speed measurement at pts a micrometeorological site located in the center of lake taihu fig 1 lee et al 2014 given the measured wind speed at the two sites were highly correlated fig s3 there are several formulations considering both wind speed and water vertical mixing velocity for the k calculation e g macintyre et al 2010 read et al 2012 we calculated the co2 gas transfer coefficient k using the models given by read et al 2012 and podgrajsek et al 2015 in the supporting information text s2 there were insignificant p 0 05 differences between k values calculated by the equation described by cole and caraco 1998 and those calculated by equations considering both wind shear and water mixing regime in lake taihu fig s4 this is consistent with the study of read et al 2012 showing that the k value in the large lake was driven primarily by wind speed 2 4 statistic analysis simple linear regression was carried out to derive correlations between the environmental variables and pco2 prior to linear regression analyses these variables were log transformed to ensure normality the co2 flux over the lake was calculated based on the long term pco2 statistical analysis showed log transformation co2 flux over the lake were normally distributed a monthly zonal mean was calculated using all measurements within the corresponding zone from 2000 to 2015 the whole lake pco2 and corresponding co2 flux were computed as an area weighted zonal average monthly zonal mean variables including pco2 co2 flux and environmental variables were summarized as means for spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november winter december to february in next year and annual mean from 2000 to 2015 the zone 1 and zone 2 were further separated into river mouth and pelagic area to distinguish the watershed impacts respectively a least significant difference post hoc test was used to determine the differences among measured variables using spss version 18 0 and differences at the p 0 05 level were deemed statistically significant 3 results 3 1 environmental variabilities lake taihu showed dramatic spatial variability but reasonable temporal variability in chemical and biological properties based on multi year s measurements figs 2 3 b the highest concentrations of nutrient doc dic and chl a with annual mean values of 4 04 mg l 1 tn 6 27 mg l 1 19 50 mg l 1 and 30 42 Î¼g l 1 were observed in zone 1 significantly p 0 01 higher than those in zones 2 and 3 on the contrary the lowest do with an annual mean value of 8 60 mg l 1 was observed in zone 1 for zone 1 the concentrations of nutrient doc and dic in river mouth with annual mean values of 5 35 mg l 1 tn 6 81 mg l 1 and 21 09 mg l 1 were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in pelagic area due to the directly discharge via inflowing rivers table 1 fig s5 for zone 2 these variables showed nonsignificant p 0 05 difference between river mouth and pelagic area due to the less polluted inflow rivers fig s5 in contrast to chemical and biological properties water temperature and wind speed were remarkably uniform across the lake fig s6 the spatial variability of water temperature is less than 1 c during measurement period and the annual mean water temperature was 17 9 9 5 c the wind speed variation was 0 1 m s 1 across the entire lake with an annual mean value of 4 5 m s 1 the temperature has increased and wind speed has decreased significantly in recent decades fig 3a 3 2 spatiotemporal variabilities of pco2 3 2 1 inter annual variability the lake exhibited remarkable spatial and inter annual variations in pco2 figs 3c and 4 spatially the pco2 in zone 1 with an annual mean value of 1000 260 Î¼atm were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in the zone 2 663 148 Î¼atm and zone 3 707 176 Î¼atm and the highest pco2 occurred in river mouth of zone 1 temporally the inter annual variability in pco2 was substantial and showed the similar trend for all three zones fig 3c however the amplitude maximum minus minimum of pco2 in zone 1 824 Î¼atm was larger than those in zone 2 587 Î¼atm and zone 3 646 Î¼atm for the entire lake the highest pco2 appeared in 2010 with an annual mean value of 1053 467 Î¼atm and lowest in 2001 with an annual mean value of 455 216 Î¼atm the temporal variations in pco2 fall into three stages for the three zones 1 from 2000 to 2004 the pco2 increased significantly 2 from 2004 to 2010 the pco2 were relatively stable and then decreased since 2007 especially in zone 1 and 3 after 2010 the pco2 exhibited a decreasing trend multiple year measurements showed the most dramatic inter annual variabilities in pco2 were observed in river mouths fig 4 3 2 2 seasonal and monthly variability the pco2 showed substantial seasonal variations fig 5 and table s1 the pco2 was significantly different between summer and winter p 0 01 but not significantly different among spring autumn and winter p 0 05 the lake wide mean pco2 was the lowest in summer with a value of 634 224 Î¼atm and the highest in winter with a mean value of 874 230 Î¼atm the spatial variations in pco2 were relatively weak in summer except some isolated spots in river mouth showing pulse pco2 fig 5 the seasonal variation of pco2 was more remarkable in pelagic area than in river mouth in both zones 1 and 2 fig 6 in zone 1 the mean pco2 in winter 964 84 Î¼atm was 59 higher than the summer value 607 71 Î¼atm for pelagic area comparing with the 30 difference in river mouth area in zone 2 the mean pco2 in winter 762 71 Î¼atm was significantly p 0 01 higher than the summer value 575 37 Î¼atm for pelagic area while the differences between the two seasons winter 772 60 Î¼atm summer 665 66 Î¼atm were nonsignificant p 0 61 for river mouth 3 3 co2 flux the lake co2 emission varied seasonally annually and spatially table s1 and fig 7 the annual mean co2 flux was 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 adding up to an annual co2 emission of 0 7 0 3 tg yr 1 seasonally peak co2 emission appeared in winter with a mean value of 24 4 11 5 mmol m 2 d 1 and summertime flux was the lowest with a mean value of 10 0 11 8 mmol m 2 d 1 annually the peak co2 flux 38 0 16 7 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in 2005 which was approximately twenty times of the lowest flux in 2001 spatially zone 1 had significantly p 0 01 higher co2 flux 30 0 14 5 mmol m 2 d 1 than zone 2 12 4 6 7 mmol m 2 d 1 and zone 3 14 2 8 8 mmol m 2 d 1 the flux in river mouth 56 9 29 1 mmol m 2 d 1 was significantly p 0 01 higher than in pelagic area 19 0 12 1 mmol m 2 d 1 within the zone 1 however there was no significant p 0 73 difference between river mouth and pelagic area in the zone 2 3 4 factors influencing pco2 various factors affect the pco2 in the lake taihu the chl a influenced the seasonal variation of the lake pco2 fig 6 however the zonal pco2 exhibited different responses to chl a in zones 1 and 2 the lake monthly mean pco2 and were negatively correlated with chl a concentration for pelagic area but the patterns were not profound in river mouth within these same zones fig 8 in zone 3 pco2 showed low value in growing seasons summer and high value in winter overall and the variation was not associated with chl a but negatively associated with water clarity fig s7 an index of aquatic vegetation biomass in lake taihu xiao et al 2017 the variability in pco2 was positively correlated with n h 4 n n o 3 n tn tp dic and doc but negatively correlated with do table 2 and fig s8 the annual mean pco2 was highly correlated with nutrient loadings such as the tn in zone 1 r 0 84 p 0 01 n 16 zone 2 r 0 80 p 0 01 n 16 and zone 3 r 0 58 p 0 01 n 16 from 2000 to 2015 however the inter annual variability in pco2 was slightly affected by temperature and wind speed fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 whole lake co2 budget the estimated co2 flux in the lake taihu ranged from 23 6 to 808 1 mmol m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 based on the gas transfer model the mean co2 flux in the lake was slightly lower than those from lakes in the contiguous united states mcdonald et al 2013 significantly lower than from boreal lakes with a mean value of 33 3 mmol m 2 d 1 hastie et al 2018 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 and was higher than from temperature lake with mean value of 5 7 8 9 mmol m 2 d 1 buffam et al 2011 for comparison the mean co2 flux from global lakes was 20 9 28 6 mmol m 2 d 1 holgerson and raymond 2016 tranvik et al 2009 it should be noted that the mean pco2 and co2 emission flux in the lake taihu were generally higher than that in other eutrophic lakes table s2 a large amount of co2 evasion into the atmosphere was confirmed in this study indicating the lake taihu as a carbon source at an annual emission of 80 g c m 2 yr 1 it is difference from a study on carbon burial that reported lake taihu as a carbon sink with carbon burial rate of 5 g c m 2 yr 1 dong et al 2012 this discrepancy might due to the different approach in two studies extrapolating the estimated co2 flux of lake taihu in this study to others lakes in yangtze river delta given a large uncertainty 48 309 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 7b these lakes with carbon burial rate of 5 373 g c m 2 yr 1 dong et al 2012 were also likely to act as carbon sources since previous studies primarily focused on the eutrophication effects in the yangtze river delta china duan et al 2017 paerl et al 2011 qin et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 this study to our best knowledge is among the first attempts to report the eutrophication impacts on lake surface co2 dynamics at a high spatiotemporal resolution in this region the results not only fill the gap of co2 flux in lake taihu but also provide a valuable data sources for predicting how eutrophic lake co2 level evolve in a changing environment previous study reported that lake co2 emission was highly associated with catchment productivity butman et al 2016 maberly et al 2013 the net primary production npp in taihu basin with an area of 36500 km2 is about 14 5 tg c yr 1 xu et al 2017b the co2 emission from lake taihu alone accounted for 1 3 of the npp based on our measurements extrapolating lake taihu measurements to the whole lake basin 3160 km2 we estimated that approximately 1 7 of npp was lost to the atmosphere as co2 consisting with the study in english lake district maberly et al 2013 taking the national total lake co2 emissions as 12 1 tg c yr 1 li et al 2018 the co2 emissions from lake taihu accounted for 1 6 of the national lake co2 budget across china our data showed the lake pco2 varied seasonally and spatially potentially resulting in the similar trend for co2 flux natchimuthu et al 2017 it should be noted that a majority of lake co2 budget focus on warm season or use snapshot sampling regardless of temporal variability klaus et al 2019 mcdonald et al 2013 wen et al 2017 which is likely to lead to biased estimates previous studies showed large variability in lake co2 flux across region li et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 sobek et al 2005 our results suggest co2 flux varied dramatically within the single lake along the eutrophication gradients fig 4 annual mean co2 flux based on single sampling sites ranged from 62 to 397 of the whole lake mean flux suggesting the high underestimation or overestimation of lake co2 flux using single site measurement natchimuthu et al 2017 seekell et al 2014 4 2 causes of the lake co2 supersaturation eutrophic lakes were generally undersaturated for co2 and tend to be sink of atmospheric co2 due to the high primary production balmer and downing 2011 gu et al 2011 schindler et al 1997 however the eutrophic lake taihu are presently supersaturated with co2 778 169 Î¼atm and acts as a source of atmospheric co2 fig 7 this might be caused by the high external carbon and nutrient inputs watershed level carbon inputs may lead to the co2 supersaturation considering its complicated river network and high productivity perga et al 2016 rudorff et al 2011 high doc and dic concentrations in inflow rivers were associated with the spatial distribution of the lake carbon fractionation fig s5 the external dic input may directly increase the co2 level leading to the lake as a significant atmospheric co2 source kiuru et al 2018 mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 additionally the high river discharge of doc can also raise the lake co2 level via supplying c substrate algesten et al 2003 larsen et al 2011 sobek et al 2005 the pco2 in river mouth was about 2 times higher than that in pelagic areas in zone 1 with high external dic and doc input table s2 likely caused by the heavy external carbon input human driven nutrient inputs seem to elevate the lake pco2 level in this study the lake pco2 value increased with nutrient n h 4 n n o 3 n tn and tp table 2 and fig s8 which was consistent with previous studies kortelainen et al 2006 li et al 2012 natchimuthu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wen et al 2017 although nutrient loadings in lake can either increase co2 via enhancing respiration or decrease co2 via promoting primary production the ultimate impact depending the balance of co2 production and consumption perga et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the high human driven loadings input together with the high organic carbon would stimulate microbial activities and enhance respiration resulting in more co2 production in inland lakes the inverse relationship between do concentration and nutrient loadings fig 2 and the significantly negative correlation between do and pco2 fig s8f and table 2 also support this the substantial nutrient loadings in the lake is mainly from the watershed input paerl et al 2011 qin et al 2007 thus the high human driven nutrient inputs may potentially stimulate respiration and then increase lake co2 level the substantial difference in pco2 value between zone 1 and the other two zones demonstrated the importance of external input in determining lake co2 level the mean pco2 in zone 1 was 1000 260 Î¼atm compared with 663 148 Î¼atm in zone 2 and 707 176 Î¼atm in zone 3 table s2 the physical factors such as water temperature and wind speed were remarkably uniform across different zones of the lake wang et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 fig s6 however zone 1 received a large amount of anthropogenic derived nutrient and carbon via inflow rivers discharges zone 2 and zone 3 were relatively clean due to no direct river pollutant inputs fig 2 fig s5 these also suggested anthropogenic nutrient and carbon inputs increased co2 level and dominated spatial variation of co2 in the lake the substantial portion of co2 derived from external input had been demonstrated by field measurements and modeling in others worldwide lakes e g kiuru et al 2018 mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 suggesting this mechanism might be widespread in global freshwater lakes 4 3 roles of human activities in pco2 variation the weak influence of chl a on pco2 seasonal variation in river mouth may arise from the human driven pollutant input in regard to the seasonal variation in the lake pco2 our results showed significantly higher values occurred in the winter and lower values in the summer consistent with the field measurement in other lakes with algal blooms gu et al 2011 shao et al 2015 xing et al 2005 the seasonal patterns were associated with the chl a concentration however the roles of chl a in determining pco2 seasonal variation varied among regions the most apparent feature was the relatively weak correlation for the river mouths in zone 1 and zone 2 fig 8 these river mouth regions hold the anthropogenic loadings and the human driven nutrient and carbon may have confounded the effect of chl a on the co2 dynamics human activities may dominate the substantial inter annual variability in the pco2 the lake pco2 inter annual variability figs 3 and 4 was partly explained by the reduction of external pollutant input from the watershed imposed by the local government paerl et al 2011 qin et al 2007 xu et al 2017a the zero point action aiming at industrial pollution control was implemented around 2000 and ultimately reduced the lake pollutant level paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2017a probably leading to the lowest pco2 in 2000 2001 607 Î¼atm in 2001 table s1 the pco2 increased after 2001 this is partly attributed to pollutant discharge from watershed increased again after that xu et al 2017a evidencing from the increasing nutrient loading in the lake fig 3b a drinking water crisis in lake taihu took place in may 2007 due to a massive bloom of cyanobacteria qin et al 2010 prompting a wide range of activities e g closing a number of polluting factories in an effort to reduce external pollutant loading these measures may have led to a considerable decline in pollutant concentrations in recent years jeppesen et al 2005 xu et al 2017a and the associated decline in pco2 efforts aiming at eutrophication control may pose dramatic influences on lake co2 variability frequent eutrophication events in lake taihu had led to a series of environmental protection actions qin et al 2010 2019 xu et al 2017a paerl et al 2011 since 2007 these managements including shutting off heavily polluted rivers establishing wastewater treatment plants closing small polluting factories and resorting wetlands have been widely implemented qin et al 2019 these environmental investments may potentially decrease the external carbon input and the associated co2 level brigham et al 2019 fan et al 2003 on the others hand the nutrient loadings in the lake would be reduced due to these management practices jeppesen et al 2005 zhou et al 2017 as shown in fig 4b probably leading to the improving water quality and low co2 production rate brigham et al 2019 kortelainen et al 2006 wang et al 2017 the impacts of human activities on lake carbon biogeochemistry provide valuable information for management practices for the lake and upstream regions the annual mean lake co2 dynamics were highly sensitive to human driven pollutant fig 3 suggesting the important role of watershed and lake management on lake co2 budget our findings suggested that measures should be taken to reduce watershed nutrient and carbon discharge into the lake to further decrease co2 emission jiang et al 2018 schrier uijl et al 2011 and more studies should be carried out to investigate the underlying mechanisms to reach a harmonized relationship between lakes and human 4 4 uncertainties in pco2 and co2 estimations the calculated pco2 may be overestimated due to the contribution of organic acids to alkalinity and the lower carbonate system buffering capacity at low ph abril et al 2015 in this study less that 1 of all the samples with ph below 7 4 and only two samples with ph below 7 together with the low doc concentration table 1 suggested the overestimation could be neglected abril et al 2015 meanwhile the calculated pco2 was highly correlated with directly measured pco2 fig s1 implying a minor uncertainty in the calculated pco2 the co2 flux in this study was based on the wind dependent gas transfer coefficient k cole and caraco 1998 we showed that the k value does vary among methods but the differences between them were nonsignificant fig s4 the mean k value used for co2 flux estimation was 1 26 0 42 m d 1 we also compared part of the estimated co2 flux with those measured directly by eddy covariance method there is a sampling site 5 close to the micrometeorological site of lake taihu fig s9a in which the surface co2 flux was measured directly by eddy covariance method xiao et al 2014 part of the direct co2 flux measurement occurred under open fetch and coincided approximatively with the field sampling at 5 site the co2 flux estimated with the gas transfer model at 5 site was uncorrelated p 0 21 with the flux measured directly with the eddy covariance method at the micrometeorological site but the co2 flux difference fig s9b between the two measurements was insignificant p 0 93 the pco2 is a dominant variable influencing co2 flux natchimuthu et al 2017 in this study diurnal samplings showed the daytime pco2 was 2 lower than the whole day value fig s2 so the whole lake pco2 and associated co2 flux may have been underestimated by a similar amount the declining trend for pco2 from late morning 853 Î¼atm at 9 00 to evening 709 Î¼atm at 18 00 was found on annual basis fig s2 which was consistent with the field measurement in other subtropical mesotrophic lake yang et al 2019 although each whole lake survey was completed within the period the annual mean pco2 across each spatial sampling site ranged from 653 Î¼atm to 1867 Î¼atm fig 7a suggesting the sampling time may have mirror influence on the spatial pattern fan et al 2003 5 conclusions long term measurement 2000 2015 confirmed the lake taihu as a significant source for atmospheric co2 with an annual mean co2 flux of 18 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 or 0 7 0 3 tg yr 1 and the annual mean pco2 was 778 169 Î¼atm the highest flux occurred in eutrophic zone with substantial external input of carbon and nutrient and the lowest flux was in non eutrophic zones without directly external input the lake co2 dynamics also varied seasonally and annually emphasizing the importance of yearlong and spatially distributed sampling to achieve unbiased lake co2 budget high watershed input of carbon and nutrient is likely to lead to co2 emission rather than higher primary production in the lake but the underlying mechanisms deserve further investigation long term field measurements of co2 dynamics in the highly heterogeneous lake taihu will shed light on the effect of eutrophication and watershed management on co2 emissions from freshwater lakes this study presented one of the longest field records of large lake co2 at a high spatiotemporal resolution which not only provides useful information for the regional budget of co2 from lakes but also provides a valuable example to predict lake co2 fluxes under a changing environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18298,phosphorus removal is an important issue in the field of water and wastewater treatment in this study a starch based flocculant st cta as an assisting agent was fed after the application of traditional inorganic precipitant of ferric chloride fecl3 to remove inorganic and organic phosphorus from their respective simulated turbid wastewaters the effects of various influencing factors including cta content of st cta dosage initial ph initial turbidity and initial total phosphorus tp were investigated systematically this modified chemical sedimentation process assisted by st cta not only showed high efficient in removing tp and turbidity but also evidently reduced the required dosage of fecl3 this combination exhibited better efficiency in removing organic tp than in removing inorganic tp from water the synergistic mechanisms of fecl3 and st cta were discussed in detail by combination of apparent removal effects and floc properties st cta exhibits strong charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects and can thus efficiently aggregate and precipitate various phosphorus and iron complexes previously formed through chemical sedimentation adsorption and chelation besides the validation of this combination usage was further confirmed by treating a real wastewater and half of the required fecl3 dosage and one third of the total cost were saved after addition of only 0 4 mg l st cta when 90 tp and 95 turbidity were reduced this study thus provided a novel technique for the diminution of tp and turbidity in turbid wastewater considerable reduction of fecl3 dosage and final cost and lowering of secondary pollution risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords modified chemical sedimentation phosphorus removal turbidity reduction ferric

irreversible destruction of ecosystem balance as a typical contaminant in surface water phosphorus has been considered the main trigger of eutrophication in water bodies daniel et al 2009 schindler et al 2008 withers and jarvie 2008 therefore removing phosphorus in aquatic environments is of significant importance phosphorus in water is mainly divided into inorganic phosphorus and organic phosphorus daniel et al 2009 smith et al 1999 stone 2011 the different chemical forms of phosphorus usually require different treatment techniques numerous methods such as chemical precipitation crystallization technologies sludge based processes and ion exchange have been developed for the removal of inorganic phosphorus from aqueous solutions chu et al 2018 de bashan and bashan 2004

salts can prevent hydrogen sulfide emissions charles et al 2006 ge et al 2013 higgins and murthy 2006 and wastewater pumping stations dose ferric salts to reduce phosphorus level and control odors and corrosion in wwtps gutierrez et al 2010 nielsen et al 2005 however residual ferric salts result in colourity production and corrosion in water and thus their practical applications are limited zhou et al 2008 ferric phosphate is unsuitable as fertilizer due to its low solubility moreover using ferric salts to remove phosphorus sometimes increases the content of suspended solid ss in water to levels exceeding the chinese national standard gb 3838 2002 zhou et al 2008 many traditional methods for inorganic phosphate removal are inadequate for efficient organic phosphorus removal due to their more complex structures rott et al 2017 2018 ternan et al 1998 in wwtps biological method is widely applied in nitrogen and phosphorus removal because of its good economic performance nontoxicity and environmental friendliness but it barely satisfies the requirements of increasingly strict laws melia et al 2017 morse et al 1998 adsorption is also used to remove organic phosphorus from water due to its simple operation high removal efficiency and fast removal rate liu et al 2018 pinto et al 2019 however adsorption efficiency strongly depends on the polarity of adsorbents surfaces liu et al 2018 pinto et al 2019 and the regeneration of adsorbents and the treatment of regenerated eluents restrict the actual application of adsorption precipitation and coagulation flocculation are well known and widely used to remove organic phosphorus because of their good economic performance simple operation and evident effects melia et al 2017 morse et al 1998 toor and kim 2019 rott et al 2017 2018 wei et al 2018 however inorganic coagulants such as ferric and aluminum salts in excessive amounts are usually used due to the complicated structural characteristics of organic phosphorus and thus various soluble and insoluble complexation of phosphonates form and ss content considerably increases in waterbodies rott et al 2017 therefore the dosage of metal salts should be reduced in organic phosphorus removal for the reduction of the dosage of metal salts and efficiently enhance the efficiency of inorganic and organic phosphorus removal some additional agents such as tannic acid and hybrid coagulants have been applied to improve chemical precipitation chu et al 2018 zhou et al 2008 natural polymer based flocculants such as starch cellulose chitosan and sodium alginate from nature plant

tp on tp and turbidity removal efficiency were systematically investigated the removal mechanisms of the combination of fecl3 and st cta were discussed in detail on the basis of apparent removal effects and floc properties flocs size and its two dimensional fractal dimensions in addition a real wastewater after treated by the activated sludge process obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant was also tested and compared by fecl3 and its combination with st cta for validation of this modified chemical sedimentation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials starch weight average molecular weight of 1 5 105 g mol was purchased from binzhou jinhui corn development co ltd 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cta c p was obtained from wuhan yuancheng science and technology development co ltd hedp was purchased from shanghai maclin biochemical co ltd ferric chloride hexahydrate was obtained from bioengineering shanghai co ltd kaolin average particle diameter 4 18 mm kh2po4 and other materials were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd a series of st ctas including st cta1 st cta2 st cta3 st cta4 and st cta5 with different cta contents was obtained from starch through etherification and their structural characteristics were confirmed by several molecular characterization methods which were described in detail in our previous work du et al 2017 2 2 flocculation experiments kh2po4 and hedp were used as representatives of common water soluble inorganic and organic phosphorus respectively and a suitable amount of kaolin a normal inorganic suspended colloid was added to provide the desired initial turbidity of water the initial solution ph was adjusted to the desired level approximately 3 0 11 0 by adding 0 1 mol l aqueous hcl or naoh solution the aqueous mixture primarily simulated the phosphorus containing turbid wastewater in addition to the synthetic wastewater a real wastewater was also tested the real wastewater sample was a secondary effluent after treated by the activated sludge process obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant in hefei china sample was stored at 4 c and analyzed within 4 days after sampling each set of experiments used the same wastewater sample for better comparison the detailed characteristics of this wastewater are listed in supporting information table s1 all experiments were carried out at room temperature conventional jar tests were carried out using 200 ml beakers and a six unit programmed paddle flocculator model ta6 wuhan hengling tech co ltd st cta and fecl3 stock solutions were freshly prepared before each test by dissolving 0 1 g of st cta and 3 0 g of fecl3 in 100 ml of distilled water respectively the modified chemical sedimentation process for removing phosphorus was similar to a coagulation flocculation process the detailed procedure established according to our pre experimental results was described below the desired amount of fecl3 solution was added into the wastewater under rapid mixing at 300 rpm for 1 min and then under slow stirring at 50 rpm for 4 min and then a known amount of st cta solution was added under a rapid mixing at 300 rpm for 3 min and then by slow stirring at 50 rpm for 12 min the beakers were finally allowed to settle for 20 min 2 3 sample analysis 2 3 1 analysis of turbidity and tp the supernatant of treated water was extracted at a beaker depth of 2 0 cm for the determination of turbidity with a wgz 200s turbidity meter shanghai xinrui instrument co ltd and tp tp was analyzed through a colorimetric method using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer 7200 unico according to the national standard method of china gb t 11893 1989 the removal extents of tp and turbidity were calculated by the following equation 1 removal extent s 0 s t s 0 100 where s 0 and s t are the values before and after treatment respectively of tp or turbidity each measurement in these experiments was tested in triplicate and the final results represented the values average s with the error bars representative of standard deviation Ï the confidence intervals were s 2Ï s 2Ï at 95 confidence level 2 3 2 analysis of floc properties after sedimentation the flocs were carefully taken from the beaker and placed onto a slide with distilled water the flocs were photographed with a digital camera ck 300 equipped with an optical microscope xtl 3400 shanghai caikon optical instrument co ltd under a fixed magnification then the characteristic length l and two dimensional fractal dimensions d 2 of the flocs were estimated using an image analysis software imagepro plus 6 0 more than 400 flocs were processed for each measurement for the reduction of systematic deviations and maximization of the comparability of final data in detail l was the longest diameter passing through the centroid of a floc and d 2 was defined by the exponential relationship between the projected area a and l as shown below chakraborti et al 2000 yang et al 2012 2 a l d 2 where l is a crucial parameter in evaluating floc size and d 2 describes the compactness of flocs a large d 2 value indicates dense flocs 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cta contents a series of st ctas with different cta contents was prepared and characterized which were described in detail in our previous report du et al 2017 st cta is a cationic starch based flocculant due to the grafted quaternary ammonium salt of cta the charge densities and cta contents of various st ctas are listed in table 1 accordingly the charge density is fully consistent with corresponding cta content then a modified chemical sedimentation process using fecl3 as precipitant was applied to remove phosphorus from the simulated turbid wastewaters followed by the addition of st cta fig 1 shows the removal extents of tp and turbidity by this modified chemical sedimentation process using various st ctas with fixed dosages of 0 4 mg l for inorganic phosphorus and 0 8 mg l for organic phosphorus based on our pre experimental results at ph of near 7 0 the effects of the cta contents were compared accordingly the optimal dosages of fecl3 corresponding to 90 of the tp removal extent are listed in table 1 on the basis of fig 1 and table 1 the required dosages of fecl3 were reduced from 13 47 mg l to 10 47 mg l and from 26 55 mg l to 17 26 mg l in removing inorganic and organic phosphorus respectively the corresponding removal extent of turbidity was also improved by this combined method compared with the removal extents obtained conventionally using only fecl3 in addition to the chemical sedimentation effects of fecl3 the addition of cationic st cta further improved the removal extents of tp and turbidity owing to compensatory effects additionally st cta with a high cta content showed a large slope at the initial stage in those removal extent curves fig 1 and a high efficiency with a higher turbidity removal extent but a lower required dosage of fecl3 table 1 indicating that increase in the content of cationic quaternary ammonium salts promotes the removal of phosphorus and turbidity through enhanced electrostatic interactions and charge neutralization pinto et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 in inorganic phosphorus removal st cta contributes not only to the adsorption and precipitation of anionic phosphates because of cationic cta groups but also to efficient bridging flocculation effects due to the extended long chain structure of st cta flory 1953 meanwhile the removing organic phosphorus fig 1c d from water was more difficult than removing inorganic phosphorus fig 1a b and an increase in fecl3 content was required due to the complicated structures and properties of organic phosphorus however the enhanced effects of st cta were more evident during organic phosphorus removal and the required fecl3 dosage decreased approximately 35 from 26 55 mg l to 17 26 mg l fig 1 and table 1 fecl3 interacted with organic phosphorus through multiple effects rott et al 2018 except in chemical sedimentation and adsorption on iron hydrolysates fe oh n wilfert et al 2015 some of the water soluble chelating products of organic phosphorus with iron can form and show an increase in fecl3 consumption rott et al 2017 the use of st cta results in the efficient adsorption and aggregation of not only residual organic phosphorus due to the good compatibility between st cta and organic phosphorus and their similar structural characteristics but also previously formed phosphorus iron complexes and kaolin colloidal particles through charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects st cta cause notable synergistic effects in the removal of phosphorus and turbidity the primary synergistic mechanisms of this combination for organic and inorganic phosphorus removal are schematically described in scheme 1 floc properties including l and d 2 at optimal conditions were measured the results are listed in table 1 l and d 2 increased in organic and inorganic phosphorus indicating that the formed flocs became large and compact after the addition of st cta this result further confirmed efficient charge neutralization and the bridging flocculation effects of st cta moreover l increased with cta content in st cta because of the improved bridging flocculation due to the extended conformation of st cta with high content of cationic cta owing to its enhanced intramolecular repulsion flory 1953 3 2 effects of some external factors for the actual application of the modified chemical sedimentation process the effects of some external factors including fecl3 and st cta dosages ph initial turbidity and initial tp on the removal of phosphorus from turbid wastewaters were investigated on the basis of fig 1 and table 1 st cta4 was selected for subsequent experiments owing to its good cost performance 3 2 1 effects of fecl3 dosage on the basis of fig 1 when the simulated wastewaters were treated by fecl3 alone they exhibited similar dependence on fecl3 dosage in tp removal but different tendencies in turbidity removal in inorganic and organic phosphorus systems the removal extents of tp in both systems almost increased continuously with the increase of fecl3 dosage in the measured dosage range the removal extent of turbidity in the organic phosphorus system roughly increased with fecl3 dosage synchronously however the removal extent of turbidity in the inorganic phosphorus system primarily showed two dominant stages the removal extent of turbidity increased rapidly and reached an optimum value at the beginning and then changed slightly with the further increase in fecl3 dosage these findings were ascribed to the different intrinsic mechanisms for the removal of different forms of phosphorus with considerably different structural characteristics in the inorganic phosphorus system fig 1a b the removal extent of tp constantly increased mainly because the chemical sedimentation process obeyed the stoichiometry of phosphate reacted with fecl3 the rapid increase in turbidity removal extent may be due to the fact that kaolin particles easily aggregate and precipitate through the coagulation of fecl3 in water these results indicated the absence of a synergistic effect in the simultaneous removal of inorganic phosphorus and turbidity after the addition of st cta the removal extents of tp and turbidity showed dependence on fecl3 dosage similar to those obtained without the addition of st cta but generally increased at varying degrees cationic st cta can adsorb and remove anionic phosphate by electrostatic interactions and reduce turbidity by charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects yang et al 2016 in the organic phosphorus system fig 1c d the slow increase in turbidity removal extent indicated that ferric ions tend to combine with organic phosphorus due to the formation of some water soluble and highly stable chelating products wilfert et al 2015 thus a high fecl3 dosage was required for the removal of tp and turbidity interestingly the removal extents especially for turbidity increased dramatically even at low fecl3 dosages after the addition of st cta except st cta1 due to low cationic content of st cta1 this phenomenon further confirmed the strong charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects of st cta for efficient adsorption and aggregation of not only kaolin particles but also residual organic phosphorus and various previously formed complexes of organic phosphorus with iron hydrolysates 3 2 2 effects of st cta dosage fig 2 compares the effects of different dosages of st cta4 on the removal extents of turbidity and tp including inorganic and organic phosphorus at ph of near 7 0 accordingly a typical st cta dosage dependence is shown in the insets of fig 2 at a constant fecl3 dosage the removal extents of tp and turbidity roughly increased with st cta4 dosage but slightly decreased after reaching optimal st cta4 dosages 0 4 mg l for inorganic phosphorus removal and 0 8 mg l for organic phosphorus removal indicating that the amount of st cta4 should be controlled in a suitable range this phenomenon was evident in the organic phosphorus wastewater system and high dosages of fecl3 and st cta4 were thus needed which further confirmed the complicated characteristics of the organic phosphorus system as compared with those of the inorganic phosphorus system the modified chemical sedimentation process using st cta for the removal of tp and turbidity was similar to a coagulation flocculation process in which a macromolecular flocculant is fed after an inorganic coagulant for the cationic polymeric flocculant of st cta charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects play important roles in the removal of tp and turbidity overdosing with cationic flocculants may deteriorate coagulation and flocculation performance due to the re stabilization effect resulting from an excessive positive charge du et al 2017 yang et al 2016 3 2 3 effect of ph ph is another essential environmental parameter in the removal of phosphorus and turbidity because it changes the surface charges of contaminants in water the effects of ph on the removal performance of the modified chemical sedimentation process were measured the results are presented in fig 3 table 2 summarized the corresponding turbidity removal extents and floc properties when the optimal dosages of fecl3 resulted in 90 tp removal or in the slight decrease in tp removal extent to levels not exceeding 90 these results provide insights into the application mechanisms of the combined method and thus essential in the design and optimization of flocculants and treatment processes fig 3a and b illustrate the different curves for the removal extents of tp and turbidity under varied ph levels in inorganic phosphorus simulated wastewater system treated by fecl3 with and without addition of st cta4 when the initial ph of simulated wastewater was 3 0 the efficiency of tp and turbidity removal is poor due to the following reasons fecl3 cannot hydrolyze to form hardly soluble metal hydroxide flocs under the ph of 3 0 cornell and schwertmann 2003 and phosphate is present in the solution in the forms of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 at different ratios according to ph as indicated by thermodynamic calculations chubar et al 2005 in dilute phosphate solution the ph values for the transition from uncharged species to charged species are 2 2 7 2 and 12 2 respectively chubar et al 2005 in water with a low ph condition phosphate is mainly present in water in the form of neutral h3po4 and thus neither chemical sedimentation nor adsorption is suitable for tp removal even after the addition of cationic st cta4 because of extremely weak charge interactions with the increase of ph from weak acidic to alkaline conditions the efficiency of tp or turbidity removal was evidently improved fig 3 and table 2 owing to enhanced interactions resulting from the hydrolysis of fecl3 and the transformation of phosphate forms to anionic species h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 in comparison with traditional chemical sedimentation the modified process using st cta exhibited improved efficiency in removing tp and turbidity at each tested ph level specifically in reducing fecl3 dosage and forming large flocs with compact structures table 2 removal efficiency optimal fecl3 dosage and flocs properties in the organic phosphorus system treated by fecl3 with and without the addition of st cta4 fig 3c and d depended on ph similar to those in the inorganic phosphorus system fig 3a and b and table 2 thus the surface charges of organic phosphorus are essential and evidently influence their interactions with precipitants however the removal extents of organic phosphorus at ph of 5 0 are extremely low due to the complicated structural characteristics of organic phosphorus 3 2 4 effect of initial turbidity the influences of initial turbidity on tp and turbidity removal efficiency were studied at neutral conditions as shown in fig 4 as the turbidity of effluents fluctuates in reality especially at various seasons accordingly the removal extents of tp and turbidity treated by the modified chemical sedimentation process all exhibited similar dependence on the fecl3 dosage fig 4a d regardless of initial turbidity but slightly improved with the increase in initial turbidity this result indicated that change in initial turbidity has no effect on treatment mechanisms the improved removal extent of tp with increasing initial turbidity was more evident in the inorganic phosphorus system as shown in fig 4 the possible reason is that high initial turbidity with concentrated kaolin particles not only promoted collision frequency but also caused a strong sweeping effect that efficiently enmeshed and swept residual colloidal particles zhao et al 2018 the increased flocs size at increased initial turbidity in table 2 confirmed this finding 3 2 5 effect of initial tp apart from the aforementioned external factors the initial tps influence the final removal behavior of the modified chemical sedimentation process fig 5 shows the effects of different initial tps on tp and turbidity removal extents in the inorganic and organic phosphorus systems at ph near 7 0 table 2 lists the optimal fecl3 dosages and corresponding floc properties as shown in fig 5 and table 2 the removal extents of tp and turbidity decreased with the increase in initial phosphorus concentration specifically the reduction of removal efficiency in the organic phosphorus system was more evident than that in the inorganic phosphorus in the organic phosphorus system when tp increased to 20 mg l the removal extents of tp and turbidity were extremely low the possible reasons are that high tp requires high fecl3 dosage and excessive amounts of ferric ions change the ph of wastewaters from neutral to acidic levels because of strong hydrolysis that largely weakens adsorption and precipitation effects this finding is consistent with previous results of ph effects fig 3 and further confirmed the highly complicated characteristics of organic phosphorus therefore chemical sedimentation is unsuitable for high concentration phosphorus treatment especially in treating wastewater with organic phosphorus 3 3 application in a real wastewater in order to further validate the efficiency of this technique a real wastewater after treated by the activated sludge process obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant was tested and compared by using fecl3 with and without the addition of st cta4 which results were showed in fig 6 on the basis of fig 6a the optimal dosage of fecl3 corresponding to 90 of the tp removal extent notably decreases from 17 0 mg l to 8 5 mg l after the addition of 0 4 mg l st cta and the corresponding turbidity removal extent is also as high as 95 fig 6b moreover the cost of fecl3 st cta4 and their combination usages in treating the real wastewater was roughly estimated and compared under their optimal dosages which is shown in supporting information table s2 accordingly the combination usage of fecl3 and st cta4 was cheaper and only cost 1 84 usd kt i e one third cost savings in comparison with that using only fecl3 2 72 usd kt although this starch based flocculant itself is much more expensive than fecl3 based on aforementioned discussion this modified chemical sedimentation process by using st cta in conjunction with fecl3 had a better performance in removal of tp and turbidity 4 conclusion in this work a modified chemical sedimentation process using fecl3 as precipitant followed by the addition of a starch based flocculant for the efficient removal of turbidity and inorganic and organic phosphorus from turbid wastewaters was proposed compared with traditional chemical sedimentation using fecl3 only the modified method showed evidently high tp and turbidity removal extents and improved floc properties ferric salts efficiently combine with phosphorus through chemical sedimentation adsorption and chelation effects and the following addition of cationic st cta results in the adsorption and aggregation of not only residual phosphorus in water but also previously formed various phosphorus iron complexes and kaolin colloidal particles through charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects these processes resulted in notable synergistic effects in phosphorus and turbidity removal removal efficiency can be further enhanced by increasing the cta content of st cta or the initial turbidity but a suitable dosage of this st cta is necessary to improve removal efficiencies strong acidic conditions and high initial tp decreases the efficiency of tp and turbidity removal the modified chemical sedimentation is suitable for low concentration phosphorus treatment particularly for the secondary effluents in wwtps besides in treating a real wastewater by using fecl3 in conjunction with this starch based flocculant for removal of tp and turbidity half of the required fecl3 dosage and one third of the total cost were saved after addition of only 0 4 mg l st cta which further confirmed the validation of this modified chemical sedimentation however this combined technique should be still tested in various actual wastewaters at large scale for the further evaluation of the feasibility of its practical applications

after addition of only 0 4 mg l st cta when 90 tp and 95 turbidity were reduced this study thus provided a novel technique for the diminution of tp and turbidity in turbid wastewater considerable

corrosion in wwtps gutierrez et al 2010 nielsen et al 2005 however residual ferric salts result in colourity production and corrosion in water and thus their practical applications are limited zhou et al 2008 ferric phosphate is unsuitable as fertilizer due to its low solubility moreover using ferric salts to remove phosphorus sometimes increases the content of suspended solid ss in water to levels exceeding the chinese national standard gb 3838 2002 zhou et al 2008 many traditional methods for inorganic phosphate removal are inadequate for efficient organic phosphorus removal due to their more

its simple operation high removal efficiency and fast removal rate liu et al 2018 pinto et al 2019 however adsorption efficiency strongly depends on the polarity of adsorbents surfaces liu et al 2018 pinto et al 2019 and the regeneration of adsorbents and the treatment of regenerated eluents restrict the actual application of adsorption precipitation and coagulation flocculation are well known and widely used to remove organic phosphorus because of their good economic performance simple operation and evident effects melia et al 2017 morse et al 1998 toor and kim 2019 rott et al 2017 2018 wei et al 2018 however inorganic coagulants such as ferric and aluminum salts in excessive amounts are usually used due to the complicated structural characteristics of organic phosphorus and thus various soluble and insoluble complexation of phosphonates form and ss content considerably increases in waterbodies rott et al 2017 therefore the dosage of metal salts should be reduced in organic phosphorus

tp on tp and turbidity removal efficiency were systematically investigated the removal mechanisms of the combination of fecl3 and st cta were discussed in detail on the basis of apparent removal effects and floc properties flocs size and its two dimensional fractal dimensions in addition a real wastewater after treated by the activated sludge process obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant was also tested and compared by fecl3 and its combination with st cta for validation of this modified chemical sedimentation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials starch weight average molecular weight of 1 5 105 g mol was purchased from binzhou jinhui corn development co ltd 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cta c p was obtained from wuhan yuancheng science and technology development co ltd hedp was purchased from shanghai maclin biochemical co ltd ferric chloride hexahydrate was obtained from bioengineering shanghai co ltd kaolin average particle diameter 4 18 mm kh2po4 and other materials were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd a series of st ctas including st cta1 st cta2 st cta3 st cta4 and st cta5 with different cta contents was obtained from starch through etherification and their structural characteristics were confirmed by several molecular characterization methods which were described in detail in our previous work du et al 2017 2 2 flocculation experiments kh2po4 and hedp were used as representatives of common water soluble inorganic and organic phosphorus respectively and a suitable amount of kaolin a normal inorganic suspended colloid was added to provide the desired initial turbidity of water the initial solution ph was adjusted to the desired level approximately 3 0 11 0 by adding 0 1 mol l aqueous hcl or naoh solution the aqueous mixture primarily simulated the phosphorus containing turbid wastewater in addition to the synthetic wastewater a real wastewater was also tested the real wastewater sample was a secondary effluent after treated by the activated sludge process obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant in hefei china sample was stored at 4 c and analyzed within 4 days after sampling each set of experiments used the same wastewater sample for better comparison the detailed characteristics of this wastewater are listed in supporting information table s1 all experiments were carried out at room temperature conventional jar tests were carried out using 200 ml beakers and a six unit programmed paddle flocculator model ta6 wuhan hengling tech co ltd st cta and fecl3 stock solutions were freshly prepared before each test by dissolving 0 1 g of st cta and 3 0 g of fecl3 in 100 ml of distilled water respectively the modified chemical sedimentation process for removing phosphorus was similar to a coagulation flocculation process the detailed procedure established according to our pre experimental results was described below the desired amount of fecl3 solution was added into the wastewater under rapid mixing at 300 rpm for 1 min and then under slow stirring at 50 rpm for 4 min and then a known amount of st cta solution was added under a rapid mixing at 300 rpm for 3 min and then by slow stirring at 50 rpm for 12 min the beakers were finally allowed to settle for 20 min 2 3 sample analysis 2 3 1 analysis of turbidity and tp the supernatant of treated water was extracted at a beaker depth of 2 0 cm for the determination of turbidity with a wgz 200s turbidity meter shanghai xinrui instrument co ltd and tp tp was analyzed through a colorimetric method using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer 7200 unico according to the national standard method of china gb t 11893 1989 the removal extents of tp and turbidity were calculated by the following equation 1 removal extent s 0 s t s 0 100 where s 0 and s t are the values before and after treatment respectively of tp or turbidity each measurement in these experiments was tested in triplicate and the final results represented the values average s with the error bars representative of standard deviation Ï the confidence intervals were s 2Ï s 2Ï at 95 confidence level 2 3 2 analysis of floc properties after sedimentation the flocs were carefully taken from the beaker and placed onto a slide with distilled water the flocs were photographed with a digital camera ck 300 equipped with an optical microscope xtl 3400 shanghai caikon optical instrument co ltd under a fixed magnification then the characteristic length l and two dimensional fractal dimensions d 2 of the flocs were estimated using an image analysis software imagepro plus 6 0 more than 400 flocs were processed for each measurement for the reduction of systematic deviations and maximization of the comparability of final data in detail l was the longest diameter passing through the centroid of a floc and d 2 was defined by the exponential relationship between the projected area a and l as shown below chakraborti et al 2000 yang et al 2012 2 a l d 2 where l is a crucial parameter in evaluating floc size and d 2 describes the compactness of flocs a large d 2 value indicates dense flocs 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cta contents a series of st ctas with different cta contents was prepared and characterized which were described in detail in our previous report du et al 2017 st cta is a cationic starch based flocculant due to the grafted quaternary ammonium salt of cta the charge densities and cta contents of various st ctas are listed in table 1 accordingly the charge density is fully consistent with corresponding cta content then a modified chemical sedimentation process using fecl3 as precipitant was applied to remove phosphorus from the simulated turbid wastewaters followed by the addition of st cta fig 1 shows the removal extents of tp and turbidity by this modified chemical sedimentation process using various st ctas with fixed dosages of 0 4 mg l for inorganic phosphorus and 0 8 mg l for organic phosphorus based on our pre experimental results at ph of near 7 0 the effects of the cta contents were compared accordingly the optimal dosages of fecl3 corresponding to 90 of the tp removal extent are listed in table 1 on the basis of fig 1 and table 1 the required dosages of fecl3 were reduced from 13 47 mg l to 10 47 mg l and from 26 55 mg l to 17 26 mg l in removing inorganic and organic phosphorus respectively the corresponding removal extent of turbidity was also improved by this combined method compared with the removal extents obtained conventionally using only fecl3 in addition to the chemical sedimentation effects of fecl3 the addition of cationic st cta further improved the removal extents of tp and turbidity owing to compensatory effects additionally st cta with a high cta content showed a large slope at the initial stage in those removal extent curves fig 1 and a high efficiency with a higher turbidity removal extent but a lower required dosage of fecl3 table 1 indicating that increase in the content of cationic quaternary ammonium salts promotes the removal of phosphorus and turbidity through enhanced electrostatic interactions and charge neutralization pinto et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 in inorganic phosphorus removal st cta contributes not only to the adsorption and precipitation of anionic phosphates because of cationic cta groups but also to efficient bridging flocculation effects due to the extended long chain structure of st cta flory 1953 meanwhile the removing organic phosphorus fig 1c d from water was more difficult than removing inorganic phosphorus fig 1a b and an increase in fecl3 content was required due to the complicated structures and properties of organic phosphorus however the enhanced effects of st cta were more evident during organic phosphorus removal and the required fecl3 dosage decreased approximately 35 from 26 55 mg l to 17 26 mg l fig 1 and table 1 fecl3 interacted with organic phosphorus through multiple effects rott et al 2018 except in chemical sedimentation and adsorption on iron hydrolysates fe oh n wilfert et al 2015 some of the water soluble chelating products of organic phosphorus with iron can form and show an increase in fecl3 consumption rott et al 2017 the use of st cta results in the efficient adsorption and aggregation of not only residual organic phosphorus due to the good compatibility between st cta and organic phosphorus and their similar structural characteristics but also previously formed phosphorus iron complexes and kaolin colloidal particles through charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects st cta cause notable synergistic effects in the removal of phosphorus and turbidity the primary synergistic mechanisms of this combination for organic and inorganic phosphorus removal are schematically described in scheme 1 floc properties including l and d 2 at optimal conditions were measured the results are listed in table 1 l and d 2 increased in organic and inorganic phosphorus indicating that the formed flocs became large and compact after the addition of st cta this result further confirmed efficient charge neutralization and the bridging flocculation effects of st cta moreover l increased with cta content in st cta because of the improved bridging flocculation due to the extended conformation of st cta with high content of cationic cta owing to its enhanced intramolecular repulsion flory 1953 3 2 effects of some external factors for the actual application of the modified chemical sedimentation process the effects of some external factors including fecl3 and st cta dosages ph initial turbidity and initial tp on the removal of phosphorus from turbid wastewaters were investigated on the basis of fig 1 and table 1 st cta4 was selected for subsequent experiments owing to its good cost performance 3 2 1 effects of fecl3 dosage on the basis of fig 1 when the simulated wastewaters were treated by fecl3 alone they exhibited similar dependence on fecl3 dosage in tp removal but different tendencies in turbidity removal in inorganic and organic phosphorus systems the removal extents of tp in both systems almost increased continuously with the increase of fecl3 dosage in the measured dosage range the removal extent of turbidity in the organic phosphorus system roughly increased with fecl3 dosage synchronously however the removal extent of turbidity in the inorganic phosphorus system primarily showed two dominant stages the removal extent of turbidity increased rapidly and reached an optimum value at the beginning and then changed slightly with the further increase in fecl3 dosage these findings were ascribed to the different intrinsic mechanisms for the removal of different forms of phosphorus with considerably different structural characteristics in the inorganic phosphorus system fig 1a b the removal extent of tp constantly increased mainly because the chemical sedimentation process obeyed the stoichiometry of phosphate reacted with fecl3 the rapid increase in turbidity removal extent may be due to the fact that kaolin particles easily aggregate and precipitate through the coagulation of fecl3 in water these results indicated the absence of a synergistic effect in the simultaneous removal of inorganic phosphorus and turbidity after the addition of st cta the removal extents of tp and turbidity showed dependence on fecl3 dosage similar to those obtained without the addition of st cta but generally increased at varying degrees cationic st cta can adsorb and remove anionic phosphate by electrostatic interactions and reduce turbidity by charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects yang et al 2016 in the organic phosphorus system fig 1c d the slow increase in turbidity removal extent indicated that ferric ions tend to combine with organic phosphorus due to the formation of some water soluble and highly stable chelating products wilfert et al 2015 thus a high fecl3 dosage was required for the removal of tp and turbidity interestingly the removal extents especially for turbidity increased dramatically even at low fecl3 dosages after the addition of st cta except st cta1 due to low cationic content of st cta1 this phenomenon further confirmed the strong charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects of st cta for efficient adsorption and aggregation of not only kaolin particles but also residual organic phosphorus and various previously formed complexes of organic phosphorus with iron hydrolysates 3 2 2 effects of st cta dosage fig 2 compares the effects of different dosages of st cta4 on the removal extents of turbidity and tp including inorganic and organic phosphorus at ph of near 7 0 accordingly a typical st cta dosage dependence is shown in the insets of fig 2 at a constant fecl3 dosage the removal extents of tp and turbidity roughly increased with st cta4 dosage but slightly decreased after reaching optimal st cta4 dosages 0 4 mg l for inorganic phosphorus removal and 0 8 mg l for organic phosphorus removal indicating that the amount of st cta4 should be controlled in a suitable range this phenomenon was evident in the organic phosphorus wastewater system and high dosages of fecl3 and st cta4 were thus needed which further confirmed the complicated characteristics of the organic phosphorus system as compared with those of the inorganic phosphorus system the modified chemical sedimentation process using st cta for the removal of tp and turbidity was similar to a coagulation flocculation process in which a macromolecular flocculant is fed after an inorganic coagulant for the cationic polymeric flocculant of st cta charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects play important roles in the removal of tp and turbidity overdosing with cationic flocculants may deteriorate coagulation and flocculation performance due to the re stabilization effect resulting from an excessive positive charge du et al 2017 yang et al 2016 3 2 3 effect of ph ph is another essential environmental parameter in the removal of phosphorus and turbidity because it changes the surface charges of contaminants in water the effects of ph on the removal performance of the modified chemical sedimentation process were measured the results are presented in fig 3 table 2 summarized the corresponding turbidity removal extents and floc properties when the optimal dosages of fecl3 resulted in 90 tp removal or in the slight decrease in tp removal extent to levels not exceeding 90 these results provide insights into the application mechanisms of the combined method and thus essential in the design and optimization of flocculants and treatment processes fig 3a and b illustrate the different curves for the removal extents of tp and turbidity under varied ph levels in inorganic phosphorus simulated wastewater system treated by fecl3 with and without addition of st cta4 when the initial ph of simulated wastewater was 3 0 the efficiency of tp and turbidity removal is poor due to the following reasons fecl3 cannot hydrolyze to form hardly soluble metal hydroxide flocs under the ph of 3 0 cornell and schwertmann 2003 and phosphate is present in the solution in the forms of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 at different ratios according to ph as indicated by thermodynamic calculations chubar et al 2005 in dilute phosphate solution the ph values for the transition from uncharged species to charged species are 2 2 7 2 and 12 2 respectively chubar et al 2005 in water with a low ph condition phosphate is mainly present in water in the form of neutral h3po4 and thus neither chemical sedimentation nor adsorption is suitable for tp removal even after the addition of cationic st cta4 because of extremely weak charge interactions with the increase of ph from weak acidic to alkaline conditions the efficiency of tp or turbidity removal was evidently improved fig 3 and table 2 owing to enhanced interactions resulting from the hydrolysis of fecl3 and the transformation of phosphate forms to anionic species h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 in comparison with traditional chemical sedimentation the modified process using st cta exhibited improved efficiency in removing tp and turbidity at each tested ph level specifically in reducing fecl3 dosage and forming large flocs with compact structures table 2 removal efficiency optimal fecl3 dosage and flocs properties in the organic phosphorus system treated by fecl3 with and without the addition of st cta4 fig 3c and d depended on ph similar to those in the inorganic phosphorus system fig 3a and b and table 2 thus the surface charges of organic phosphorus are essential and evidently influence their interactions with precipitants however the removal extents of organic phosphorus at ph of 5 0 are extremely low due to the complicated structural characteristics of organic phosphorus 3 2 4 effect of initial turbidity the influences of initial turbidity on tp and turbidity removal efficiency were studied at neutral conditions as shown in fig 4 as the turbidity of effluents fluctuates in reality especially at various seasons accordingly the removal extents of tp and turbidity treated by the modified chemical sedimentation process all exhibited similar dependence on the fecl3 dosage fig 4a d regardless of initial turbidity but slightly improved with the increase in initial turbidity this result indicated that change in initial turbidity has no effect on treatment mechanisms the improved removal extent of tp with increasing initial turbidity was more evident in the inorganic phosphorus system as shown in fig 4 the possible reason is that high initial turbidity with concentrated kaolin particles not only promoted collision frequency but also caused a strong sweeping effect that efficiently enmeshed and swept residual colloidal particles zhao et al 2018 the increased flocs size at increased initial turbidity in table 2 confirmed this finding 3 2 5 effect of initial tp apart from the aforementioned external factors the initial tps influence the final removal behavior of the modified chemical sedimentation process fig 5 shows the effects of different initial tps on tp and turbidity removal extents in the inorganic and organic phosphorus systems at ph near 7 0 table 2 lists the optimal fecl3 dosages and corresponding floc properties as shown in fig 5 and table 2 the removal extents of tp and turbidity decreased with the increase in initial phosphorus concentration specifically the reduction of removal efficiency in the organic phosphorus system was more evident than that in the inorganic phosphorus in the organic phosphorus system when tp increased to 20 mg l the removal extents of tp and turbidity were extremely low the possible reasons are that high tp requires high fecl3 dosage and excessive amounts of ferric ions change the ph of wastewaters from neutral to acidic levels because of strong hydrolysis that largely weakens adsorption and precipitation effects this finding is consistent with previous results of ph effects fig 3 and further confirmed the highly complicated characteristics of organic phosphorus therefore chemical sedimentation is unsuitable for high concentration phosphorus treatment especially in treating wastewater with organic phosphorus 3 3 application in a real wastewater in order to further validate the efficiency of this technique a real wastewater after treated by the activated sludge process obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant was tested and compared by using fecl3 with and without the addition of st cta4 which results were showed in fig 6 on the basis of fig 6a the optimal dosage of fecl3 corresponding to 90 of the tp removal extent notably decreases from 17 0 mg l to 8 5 mg l after the addition of 0 4 mg l st cta and the corresponding turbidity removal extent is also as high as 95 fig 6b moreover the cost of fecl3 st cta4 and their combination usages in treating the real wastewater was roughly estimated and compared under their optimal dosages which is shown in supporting information table s2 accordingly the combination usage of fecl3 and st cta4 was cheaper and only cost 1 84 usd kt i e one third cost savings in comparison with that using only fecl3 2 72 usd kt although this starch based flocculant itself is much more expensive than fecl3 based on aforementioned discussion this modified chemical sedimentation process by using st cta in conjunction with fecl3 had a better performance in removal of tp and turbidity 4 conclusion in this work a modified chemical sedimentation process using fecl3 as precipitant followed by the addition of a starch based flocculant for the efficient removal of turbidity and inorganic and organic phosphorus from turbid wastewaters was proposed compared with traditional chemical sedimentation using fecl3 only the modified method showed evidently high tp and turbidity removal extents and improved floc properties ferric salts efficiently combine with phosphorus through chemical sedimentation adsorption and chelation effects and the following addition of cationic st cta results in the adsorption and aggregation of not only residual phosphorus in water but also previously formed various phosphorus iron complexes and kaolin colloidal particles through charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects these processes resulted in notable synergistic effects in phosphorus and turbidity removal removal efficiency can be further enhanced by increasing the cta content of st cta or the initial turbidity but a suitable dosage of this st cta is necessary to improve removal efficiencies strong acidic conditions and high initial tp decreases the efficiency of tp and turbidity removal the modified chemical sedimentation is suitable for low concentration phosphorus treatment particularly for the secondary effluents in wwtps besides in treating a real wastewater by using fecl3 in conjunction with this starch based flocculant for removal of tp and turbidity half of the required fecl3 dosage and one third of the total cost were saved after addition of only 0 4 mg l st cta which further confirmed the validation of this modified chemical sedimentation however this combined technique should be still tested in various actual wastewaters at large scale for the further evaluation of the feasibility of its practical applications

18299,in this research extracellular polymeric substances eps such as epsflocs and epsgranules were successfully extracted from activated and aerobic granular sludge respectively and tested as bio based flame retardant materials flax fabric was coated by the biopolymeric substances and its flammability was evaluated based on a vertical burning test defined in us federal aviation regulation both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics achieved the self extinguishment due to effective char formation in particular the result of the epsgranules coated sample met the aviation requirements for the aircraft interior moreover the presence of carbonated hydroxyapatite was identified in epsgranules char residue by using ftir and xrd analysis it can contribute to the self extinguishing property of the fabric by enhancing char formation thermogravimetric analysis also demonstrated that epsgranules coated flax was able to produce greater amount of char residue and its decomposition rate was significantly reduced this research indicates that there is a great potential to use this biopolymer as a resource for developing high performance bio inspired flame retardant materials and contribute to a circular economy graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge extracellular polymeric substance flax fabric flame retardant 1 introduction wastewater treatment processes are widely implemented to protect the environment and recover clean water the main problem is the large amount of waste sludge that is generated which needs further disposal at present the sludge produced from wastewater treatment processes is considered as a waste product the cost of handling disposal of the waste sludge represents up to 50 of the wastewater treatment costs however from a circular economy point of view wastewater treatment processes should be combined with producing resources from the waste compounds in the sewage thus the waste sludge is actually a potential resource from which useful materials can be recovered a novel biological wastewater treatment process using aerobic sludge granulation has emerged for sewage treatment pronk et al 2015 it stimulates micro organisms to form granular biofilms called granules rather than the traditional flocs in the process in granular sludge microorganisms produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to form a polymeric hydrogel matrix and are thereby self immobilized into this matrix without involvement of any carrier materials it was found that a significant amount of eps can be recovered from aerobic granular sludge i e about 25 of granular sludge dry weight felz et al 2016 if those recovered eps can be applied to develop high performance new materials and contribute to a circular economy the sustainability and economics of wastewater treatment can be strongly increased therefore there is a great need to develop eps based high performance new materials one of the possible high performance materials could be eps based flame retardant materials currently conventional flame retardant treatments have extensively been applied in plastic and textile industries innes and innes 2011 different types of flame retardant agents e g mineral halogenated phosphorus containing and nano metric substrates have been applied onto textiles as additives and solutions to enable textile products meet fire safety regulatory standards to fight against various fire hazards horrock 2011 a 2017 market study of ihs markit consulting showed that 31 of the worldwide flame retardants consumption is covered by halogenated flame retardants e g bromine and chlorine based agents ihs markit 2017 while the halogenated flame retardant compounds have effectively worked to diminish combustion in gas phase by releasing halogen halide and scavenging reactive free radicals during combustion costes et al 2017 they have been associated with a wide range of harmful effects in human and environment due to releasing highly toxic organic pollutants like polybrominated dioxins and furans dasari et al 2013 furthermore three halogenated products are currently forbidden in the industrial market penta and octa bromodiphenyl ether and hexabro mocyclododecane costes et al 2017 and the usage of the halogen based flame retardant systems in textile products is gradually banned based on the growing awareness of environmental issues and health safety of users the design of bio based flame retardant materials is desirable as a replacement for synthetic counterparts bio based materials such as caseins dna and gluten have been explored as flame retardant foaming agents for fabric and polymer alongi et al 2013 alongi et al 2014 das et al 2019 in particular caseins can be considered as polyaminoacids containing numerous phosphate groups in its micellar structure the decomposition of caseins is assumed to be as similar as that of ammonium polyphosphate poly phosphoric acid and ammonia are produced in the thermal decomposition the poly phosphoric acid reacts with hydroxyl or other groups in the plastics or fabric forming non stable phosphate ester in the next step the dehydration of the phosphate ester follows a carbon foam is formed on the surface against the heat source charring this carbon barrier acts as a insulation layer preventing further decomposing of the material in addition releasing of ammonium dilutes the flammable gases produced from decomposition of the material and promotes intumescent char formation preventing the spreading of the heat alongi et al 2014 even though the content of phosphorus in caseins is less than 1 the presence of both phosphorus and ammonia containing molecules has been shown to lead to the formation of a thermally stable char alongi et al 2014 furthermore the combined effects of keratin protein fibre i e wool and intumescent flame retardant based on phosphorous significantly reduce heat and smoke production of polymers kim and bhattacharyya 2016 due to the fact that eps recovered from aerobic granular sludge epsgranules contains around 40 of proteins felz et al 2019 and recent studies have revealed considerable accumulation of phosphorus in the eps of sludge li et al 2015 it was hypothesised that epsgranules could be used to develop bio based flame retardant materials in addition as activated sludge process is the conventional biological wastewater treatment process that is still widely used the flammability of epsgranules and epsflocs should be compared both polymers have different properties gelling and flocculating for epsgranules and epsflocs respectively lin et al 2013 in this research the fire ignition performance of both epsgranules and epsflocs was investigated for their potential as flame retardant materials those biopolymers epsgranules and epsflocs were coated onto flax fabrics which have been widely used as fibre reinforcement and their flame retardant performance was evaluated to determine if epsgranules and epsflocs can provide flame retardant property to the flax fabrics the flammability of the coated fabrics was evaluated by following iso and federal aviation regulation far standard tests thermogravimetric analysis tga ft ir and x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis were employed to understand the self extinguish behaviour of the coated flax fabrics 2 material and

operated according to the conventional activated sludge process the wastewater treatment process in both wwtps achieve complete c n and p removal specifically p removal is carried out via enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr there is no addition of fecl3 in both processes the eps was recovered from both the collected granules and flocs according to felz felz et al 2019 dried biomass 0 5

by the pipette respectively those surfaces were air dried 1 h in a dust free enclosure samples were scanned with a digital instruments multimode atomic force microscope veeco nanoscopy iva dimension 3100 2 3 eps coating on flax fabrics twill weave flax fabric with two warp threads crossing every two weft threads 145 g m2 areal density was supplied from libero belgium the epsgranules and epsflocs water solution 3 w v prepared in section 2 1 was sprayed on the surface of the flax fabrics for three times 300 ml in total on a piece of the flax fabric with the same size 20 40 cm after the coating process the fabrics were air dried for 72 h 2 4 12s vertical burning test a bunsen vertical burning test was performed to investigate the burning characteristics of the coated flax fabric according to us federal aviation regulation far 25 853 for aircraft interior faa 2014 a fabric sample in the size of 304 55 mm was prepared and pre conditioned at 23 c and 50 humidity for 24 h before testing a flame in the temperature of 850 c was applied to the bottom edge of a vertically mounted fabric strip for 12 s two tests of each sample were conducted and the flame extinguishing time duration dripping time and the burnt length were recorded for each test in comparison the flame extinguishing and dripping times required for faa certified materials are less than 15s and 3s respectively and the burnt length is less than 152 4 mm 6 in the uncoated flax fabrics were also evaluated as reference control samples 2 5 fourier transform infrared ft ir analysis of the coated flax fabric before and after vertical burning test the ft ir spectra of the coated flax fabric before and after the vertical burning test were recorded on a ft ir spectrometer thermo electron scientific instruments corp wi usa equipped with a diamond atr accessory infrared spectra analysis software package omnic version 8 2 thermo nicolet analytical instruments wi usa was used for analysing the ftir spectra and recording the data from the spectra for each subsample three replicate spectra were recorded to ensure the spectral reproducibility and assess analytical precision all spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 550 cm 1 using the atr method with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and 32 scans 2 6 x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis of the remained residue after vertical burning test the xrd patterns of the fabrics after vertical burning test were recorded in a bragg brentano geometry of a bruker d5005 diffractometer equipped with huber incident beam monochromator and braun psd detector data collection was carried out at room temperature using monochromatic cu kÎ±1 radiation Î» 0 154056 nm in the 2Î¸ region between 5 and 90 step size 0 038 2Î¸ samples of about 20 mg were deposited on a si 510 wafer and rotated during measurement data evaluation was performed with the bruker program eva 2 7 thermal stability tests thermal decomposition processes of uncoated flax fabrics epsgranules and epsflocs coated flax fabrics were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyser tga 50 q5000 ta instruments around 7 mg of specimen was heated up to 800 c at a consistent heating rate of 10 c min under inert atmosphere 3 results 3 1 eps yields and morphology the eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge epsgranules represented 253 14 mg g volatile content of the sludge while the eps extracted from activated sludge epsflocs represented 150 20 mg g volatile content of the sludge the yields of epsflocs is lower than that of epsgranules lin et al 2013 the morphology of epsgranules and epsflocs is significantly different see fig 1 from each other epsgranules formed a web like matrix with fibres entangled with each other in fig 1 a the diameter of the fibres was around 40 50 nm this indicates that those fibres might be formed through self assembly process through entanglement the epsgranules web covered the entire surface which they attached on fig 1 c in comparison epsflocs did not form any fibres instead small patches with the size around 80 100 nm aggregated together fig 1 b it was worth noticing that there were cracks in between the aggregated patches especially when epsflocs attached on the surface fig 1 d the cracks can be 300 Î¼m in length and 45 50 nm in width due to the existence of cracks it is impossible for epsflocs to form a continuous layer on the surface where it attached on thus the different morphology of epsgranules and epsflocs can result to a significant dissimilar eps coating layer on the surface a continuous layer of epsgranules while a discontinuous coating layer of epsflocs thus the different morphology of epsgranules and epsflocs can result to a significant dissimilar eps coating layer on the surface a continuous layer of epsgranules while a discontinuous coating layer of epsflocs 3 2 the influence of eps coating on the flammability of flax fabric the effects of both epsgranules and epsflocs coating on the flammability of flax fabrics were clearly identified in the bunsen vertical burning test fig 2 shows the uncoated flax fabric epsflocs coated and epsgranules coated flax fabrics before during and after burning test the uncoated flax fabric is used as a reference control sample during burning process the significant difference can be seen at the moment of 5s the uncoated flax fabric was ignited by the flame of the burner and the flame has spread over the entire fabric strip the epsflocs coated flax fabric strip has been ignited and the flame has also spread into part of the fabric strip but has not spread over the entire fabric strip surface the epsgranules coated flax fabric has been ignited as well but the spreading of the flame is strongly inhibited at the moment of 5s and the flame size in this fabric during the testing was smaller than for the other two fabric samples after igniting of 12s the burner was removed the uncoated flax fabric was found to be in continuous combustion until it completely burnt out in comparison both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics were found to stop burning i e the flame was self extinguished as the exothermal heat still exist in burnt fabrics there were red glows afterglow on both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics the average afterglow time was recorded in table 1 for epsgranules coated flax fabrics this afterglow time was extremely short which is around Â¼ of that for epsflocs coated flax fabric indicating that the coating of epsgranules shielded the transfer of heat it was observed that the afterglow on the epsflocs coated flax fabrics displayed a certain path along the surface if the possibility of cracks formation is considered when epsflocs attached coated on the flax fabric surface based on the result of sem and afm analysis in section 3 1 the exothermal heat may conduct along the cracks on the flax fabric surface in which there was less or hardly epsflocs coverage in the cracks as the afterglow also consumed material consequently the average burnt length of epsflocs coated flax fabric was two times of that of the epsgranules coated flax fabrics table 1 and fig 2 the coating of both epsflocs and epsgranules provided the flax fabric self extinguishing property in fact the immediate flameout of the coated flax fabric was a remarkable result that indicate that both epsflocs and epsgranules behave as a flame retardant material the bunsen vertical burning test performed in the current research is against us far 25 853 for aircraft interior for any material that can be certified as aircraft interior material the required flame extinguishing and dripping times should be less than 15s and 3s respectively and the burnt length is less than 152 4 mm 6 in in comparison the flame extinguishing and dripping times for both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics were 0s which have apparently met the standard however the burnt length of epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabric was 260 mm and 130 mm respectively this means that only epsgranules coated flax fabrics in existing coating conditions reach the requirement for the aircraft interior material 3 3 functional groups in eps by ftir analysis in order to understand the functional groups that played a role in the self extinguishing property of both eps ftir analysis was performed on eps coated flax fabric before and after bunsen vertical burning test the spectrum of uncoated flax fabric was used as a reference as displayed in fig 3 a the spectra of epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics before burning are similar a broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 indicates the presence of oh group a relatively sharp peak at 3280 cm 1 is assigned to n h group in the proteins a peak at 1630 cm 1 implies the dominant protein secondary structure is cross beta sheet lin et al 2018 a band at 1200 940 cm 1 with the peak value at 1050 1080 cm 1 implies the presence of both carbohydrates and phosphate group in comparison to the reference spectrum of uncoated flax fabric the coating of epsflocs and epsgranules covered the ftir signal of uncoated flax fabric meaning the eps coating distributed evenly on the flax fabric surface it was noticed that there are two main differences between the spectra of epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics 1 for epsgranules coated flax the peak of the band at 1200 940 cm 1 is at 1050 cm 1 while the peak of the same band for epsflocs coated flax fabric is at 1080 cm 1 if the spectrum of uncoated flax at this region is compared the peak value and the shape of the band at 1200 940 cm 1 of epsflocs coated flax fabric is more similar to that of the uncoated flax fabric this is probably caused by the morphology of epsflocs there are cracks in between the patches which could make the flax fabric at the crack not completely covered by the epsflocs 2 there is a weak peak present in the spectrum of epsgranules coated flax at 870 cm 1 but not in the spectrum of epsflocs coated flax fabric this peak is normally assigned to carbonates co3 2 ribeiro et al 2006 epsgranules coated flax fabrics turned black due to char formation the similarities in the two spectra areas fig 3 b the broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 which indicates the presence of oh group is still present while the sharp peak at 3280 cm 1 disappeared likely the protein fraction was consumed in the burning process the peaks at 1630 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 that are amide i and ii peaks for proteins turned to one peak at 1598 cm 1 this is probably due to the burning product and char formation of proteins a new band appearing at 1408 cm 1 is assigned to carbonates socrates 2001 the peak of the band at 1200 940 cm 1 shifted to 1009 cm 1 which is one of the typical peaks of phosphates ribeiro et al 2006 the intensity of this band increased likely due to the burning out of the organic fraction the inorganic fraction such as phosphate becomes dominant in the residue in addition to the similarities the differences in the two spectra are although the new band with the peak at 1408 cm 1 appears in both spectra the intensity of this band is much stronger for epsgranules coated flax fabrics in addition there is a shoulder peak at 1483 cm 1 which is only present in the spectrum of epsgranules coated flax both two peaks are characteristics for carbonates rehman and bonfield 1997 the band at 876 cm 1 which is also assigned to carbonates becomes extremely sharp in the spectrum of epsgranules coated flax fabric a new band at 726 cm 1 only appeared in this spectrum indicating the presence of phosphate elliot 1994 the possibility that the carbonate bands were due to the formation of a calcium carbonate residue can be ruled out calcium carbonate decomposes at 825 c into cao and co2 the merck index while the temperature at bunsen vertical burning test is 850 c any calcium carbonate would disappear at this temperature regarding thermal stability and the typical carbonates and phosphates bands in the current spectra ribeiro et al 2006 carbonated hydroxyapatite is the most possible candidate for the inert residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric summarising the ftir analysis suggested that besides the char formed one of the dominate composites in the remaining residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric after burning is carbonated hydroxyapatite while in the residue of epsflocs coated flax fabric is phosphate in order to clarify if a carbonated hydroxyapatite was obtained xrd analysis was done to the remaining residue in the residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric the presence of carbonated hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 co3 was successfully detected unfortunately the phosphate in the residue of epsflocs coated flax fabric could not be detected leading to the assumption that the phosphate is in an amorphous mineral 3 4 thermal stability analysis to understand the impact of eps coating on the thermal stability of flax fabric thermogravimetric tg analysis was done on epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics the same analysis on uncoated flax fabric was taken as a reference a tg curve of uncoated flax demonstrates an initial weight loss approx 7 at around 100 150 c due to moisture evaporation further weight reduction at 250 c can be related to the thermal degradation of hemicellulose of flax which occurs at around 284 c kim et al 2018 in addition the tg curve indicates the second thermal decomposition at around 385 c that can be caused by the cleavage of glycosidic linkage of cellulose kim et al 2017 and then fully decomposition occurs at approx 670 c without any residue formation fig 4 the positive effects of epsflocs and epsgranules coating on thermal stability of flax are clearly observed in the tg and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves there was a significant increase in residue amount of both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics both coated flax fabrics left approx 28 wt carbonaceous residues at 800 c fig 4 a which indicates a higher amount of char formation the eps coating reduced the maximum decomposition rate from 1 4 c for uncoated flax fabric to 0 8 c for epsflocs coated flax fabric and 0 5 c for epsgranules coated flax fabric fig 4 b the char and inert residue formed during decomposition were thermally stable making further loss of material extremely slow even with the increasing of temperature especially the epsgranules coated flax fabric shows the lowest thermal decomposition rate suggesting the coating of epsgranules works successfully as a kind of barrier for heat and or mass transfer the durable char formation of epsgranules coating prevented the additional thermal decomposition and pyrolysis of flax fabric 4 discussions 4 1 the extracellular polymeric substances extracted from both activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge have self extinguishing property in order to investigate the possibility of developing bio based flame retardant material the extracellular polymeric substances recovered from activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge were used as a coating material for flax fabric it was found that both epsflocs and epsgranules have a self extinguishing property ftir spectroscopy indicated that both eps have proteins and phosphate is one of the main components in the remaining residue after burning biomacromolecules such as proteins whey proteins caseins hydrophobins and dna have very recently shown unexpected flame retardant suppressant features when deposited on cellulosic or synthetic substrates like cotton polyesters or cotton polyester blends alongi et al 2014b more specifically caseins are phosphoproteins during burning they are capable of influencing the cellulose pyrolysis toward the formation of char alongi et al 2013 the phosphate groups in dna will also result in phosphoric acid under thermal degradation which reacts with cellulose to enhance the char formation in addition the nitrogen containing base referred to the monomers of dna releases ammonia which can dilute the concentration of oxygen in the gas phase so that flame inhibition can be achieved price and horrocks 2009 considering that phosphates have been found as one of the main components in the remaining residue of both epsflocs and epsgranules they must originate from the recovered eps whether they are in the format of phosphoproteins phosphorylated carbohydrates or phosphates minerals still needs further investigation based on the self extinguishing property that they displayed in the current research it is reasonable to category them into the phosphorus based flame retardant category very recently phosphorus based flame retardants are proposed as halogen free flame retardants for various polymeric materials schartel 2010 phosphoric acid is formed upon degradation of organic phosphate they can act in the condensed phase by enhancing char formation yielding intumescence or through inorganic glass formation and in the gas phase through flame inhibition schartel 2010 it seems that epsflocs and epsgranules can enhance char formation likely due to phosphate and or the synergetic effect of both phosphate and nitrogen from amine group in proteins thereafter decelerate the decomposition reaction and shield the heat transfer especially the epsflocs and epsgranules coating greatly reduced the decomposition rate to almost a half or even one third of the uncoated flax fabric one interesting phenomenon was the epsflocs and epsgranules coating lowered the decomposition temperature making the coated flax fabrics start decomposition at lower temperature in a slower rate in fact a lot of successfully flame retarded systems start to decompose at lower temperatures than the corresponding material without any flame retardant this also results in flame retarded systems often igniting earlier than corresponding non flame retarded polymers the resulted two step or multi step decomposition of materials seems to be the more important general feature of charring systems lyon 2004 schartel 2010 study of the mechanism behind the self extinguishing property of epsflocs and epsgranules can be done in future research by using cone calorimeter tg ms and tg ftir analysis 4 2 the extracellular polymeric substances recovered from aerobic granular sludge is a better candidate of bio phosphorus based flame retardant although both epsflocs and epsgranules have self extinguishing property only epsgranules coated flax fabric reached the complete requirement for the vertical burning test for aircraft interior materials with the respect of flame retardancy different from epsflocs carbonated hydroxyapatite is one of the main components in the remaining residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric hydroxyapatite is the most stable calcium phosphate phase at neutral ph koutsoukos et al 1980 it is also thermally stable till 1300 c omelon and grynpas 2008 marine bacteria oral bacteria e coli and some other bacteria have been identified as microorganisms that are capable of metabolizing phosphorus and mineralizing apatite intra and extracellularly schulz et al 2005 it was reported that carbonated hydroxyapatite was formed when hydroxyapatite alginate was burned burning of alginate caused an increase of local concentration of co2 favoring the reaction between co2 and oh group of hydroxyapatite consequently form carbonated hydroxyapatite by substitute oh by co3 2 elliot 1994 thus it is reasonable to assume that there is hydroxyapatite in epsgranules which is produced by microorganisms during burning of the epsgranules coated flax fabric the production of co2 from the burning of proteins and other organic material favored the formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite carbonated hydroxyapatite itself is already reported as a flame retardant lu et al 2014 in comparison carbonated hydroxyapatite could not be detected in the residue of epsflocs coated flax fabric by xrd analysis this might be the reason that epsgranules is a better flame retardant than epsflocs why there are different forms of phosphate in different eps how does carbonated hydroxyapatite affect char formation and reduce the decomposition rate of epsgranules coated flax fabric requires better understanding in the future 4 3 practical and economic feasibility the worldwide consumption of flame retardant is more than 2 25 million tonnes per year https www flameretardants online com flame retardants market in volume terms the market size is expected to grow at a global rate of 3 1 until 2021 major flame retardant is aluminium hydroxide 38 and second large share 31 is the halogenated flame retardant systems consisting of brominated and chlorinated products the halogenated flame retardants have been associated with a wide range of harmful effects in human and environment due to releasing highly toxic organic pollutants like polybrominated dioxins and furans therefore the substitution of the halogenated flame retardant with more sustainable non halogenated products is a current trend in the flame retardant additive industry furthermore the end of life disposal of synthetic polymer and additive is mostly done through incineration and landfilling which result in air pollution increase of greenhouse gases and soil contamination based on environmental and human concerns bio based flame retardants have become vital and researches have actively been conducted to develop new types of the flame retardant additives made from renewable resources despite significant potential of proteins whey proteins caseins hydrophobins and dna in the flame retardancy field one challenging issue on the use of biomacromolecules as flame retardants is the possibility of adjusting this technology to a large scale which is a key point for assessing its further industrial development alongi et al 2014b 2014a at this point epsgranules has an advantage aerobic sludge granulation technology currently commercialized by royalhaskoningdhv rhdhv under the name nereda is rapidly spreading with already 70 full scale granular sludge wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide built or under construction on 5 continents since 2013 about hundred plants are expected to operate by next year sufficient waste granular sludge can be provided the commercial name of epsgranules is kaumera the first kaumera pilot production plant will be opened in october 2019 in the netherlands this plant can produce 400 tons of kaumera per year therefore large scale production of epsgranules kaumera is possible considering the technology of coating kaumera on the surface of the fabrics can be easily combined within the fabric production process there is a great potential for the practical and economic feasibility of using epsgranules as bio flame retardant for fabrics 5 conclusions the extracellular polymeric substances eps recovered from both activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge have self extinguishing property this fire resistant behaviour make them a suitable flame retardant materials for coatings flax fabric coated with eps recovered from aerobic granular sludge meets the flame retardancy requirements in us federal aviation regulation standards with the respect of flame retardancy the eps recovered from aerobic granular sludge is a better candidate of bio phosphorus based

18299,in this research extracellular polymeric substances eps such as epsflocs and epsgranules were successfully extracted from activated and aerobic granular sludge respectively and tested as bio based flame retardant materials flax fabric was coated by the biopolymeric substances and its flammability was evaluated based on a vertical burning test defined in us federal aviation regulation both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics achieved the self extinguishment due to effective char formation in particular the result of the epsgranules coated sample met the aviation requirements for the aircraft interior moreover the presence of carbonated hydroxyapatite was identified in epsgranules char residue by using ftir and xrd analysis it can contribute to the self extinguishing property of the fabric by enhancing char formation thermogravimetric analysis also demonstrated that epsgranules coated flax was able to produce greater amount of char residue and its decomposition rate was significantly reduced this research indicates that there is a great potential to use this biopolymer as a resource for developing high performance bio inspired flame retardant materials and contribute to a circular economy graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge extracellular polymeric substance flax fabric flame retardant 1 introduction wastewater treatment processes are widely implemented to protect the environment and recover clean water the main problem is the large amount of waste sludge that is generated which needs further disposal at present the sludge produced from wastewater treatment processes is considered as a waste product the cost of handling disposal of the waste sludge represents up to 50 of the wastewater treatment costs however from a circular economy point of view wastewater treatment processes should be combined with producing resources from the waste compounds in the sewage thus the waste sludge is actually a potential resource from which useful materials can be recovered a novel biological wastewater treatment process using aerobic sludge granulation has emerged for sewage treatment pronk et al 2015 it stimulates micro organisms to form granular biofilms called granules rather than the traditional flocs in the process in granular sludge microorganisms produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to form a polymeric hydrogel matrix and are thereby self immobilized into this matrix without involvement of any carrier materials it was found that a significant amount of eps can be recovered from aerobic granular sludge i e about 25 of granular sludge dry weight felz et al 2016 if those recovered eps can be applied to develop high performance new materials and contribute to a circular economy the sustainability and economics of wastewater treatment can be strongly increased therefore there is a great need to develop eps based high performance new materials one of the possible high performance materials could be eps based flame retardant materials currently conventional flame retardant treatments have extensively been applied in plastic and textile industries innes and innes 2011 different types of flame retardant agents e g mineral halogenated phosphorus containing and nano metric substrates have been applied onto textiles as additives and solutions to enable textile products meet fire safety regulatory standards to fight against various fire hazards horrock 2011 a 2017 market study of ihs markit consulting showed that 31 of the worldwide flame retardants consumption is covered by halogenated flame retardants e g bromine and chlorine based agents ihs markit 2017 while the halogenated flame retardant compounds have effectively worked to diminish combustion in gas phase by releasing halogen halide and scavenging reactive free radicals during combustion costes et al 2017 they have been associated with a wide range of harmful effects in human and environment due to releasing highly toxic organic pollutants like polybrominated dioxins and furans dasari et al 2013 furthermore three halogenated products are currently forbidden in the industrial market penta and octa bromodiphenyl ether and hexabro mocyclododecane costes et al 2017 and the usage of the halogen based flame retardant systems in textile products is gradually banned based on the growing awareness of environmental issues and health safety of users the design of bio based flame retardant materials is desirable as a replacement for synthetic counterparts bio based materials such as caseins dna and gluten have been explored as flame retardant foaming agents for fabric and polymer alongi et al 2013 alongi et al 2014 das et al 2019 in particular caseins can be considered as polyaminoacids containing numerous phosphate groups in its micellar structure the decomposition of caseins is assumed to be as similar as that of ammonium polyphosphate poly phosphoric acid and ammonia are produced in the thermal decomposition the poly phosphoric acid reacts with hydroxyl or other groups in the plastics or fabric forming non stable phosphate ester in the next step the dehydration of the phosphate ester follows a carbon foam is formed on the surface against the heat source charring this carbon barrier acts as a insulation layer preventing further decomposing of the material in addition releasing of ammonium dilutes the flammable gases produced from decomposition of the material and promotes intumescent char formation preventing the spreading of the heat alongi et al 2014 even though the content of phosphorus in caseins is less than 1 the presence of both phosphorus and ammonia containing molecules has been shown to lead to the formation of a thermally stable char alongi et al 2014 furthermore the combined effects of keratin protein fibre i e wool and intumescent flame retardant based on phosphorous significantly reduce heat and smoke production of polymers kim and bhattacharyya 2016 due to the fact that eps recovered from aerobic granular sludge epsgranules contains around 40 of proteins felz et al 2019 and recent studies have revealed considerable accumulation of phosphorus in the eps of sludge li et al 2015 it was hypothesised that epsgranules could be used to develop bio based flame retardant materials in addition as activated sludge process is the conventional biological wastewater treatment process that is still widely used the flammability of epsgranules and epsflocs should be compared both polymers have different properties gelling and flocculating for epsgranules and epsflocs respectively lin et al 2013 in this research the fire ignition performance of both epsgranules and epsflocs was investigated for their potential as flame retardant materials those biopolymers epsgranules and epsflocs were coated onto flax fabrics which have been widely used as fibre reinforcement and their flame retardant performance was evaluated to determine if epsgranules and epsflocs can provide flame retardant property to the flax fabrics the flammability of the coated fabrics was evaluated by following iso and federal aviation regulation far standard tests thermogravimetric analysis tga ft ir and x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis were employed to understand the self extinguish behaviour of the coated flax fabrics 2 material and

the netherlands which is operated according to the nereda technology activated sludge flocs was collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant harnaschpolder in the netherlands which is operated according to the conventional activated sludge process the wastewater treatment process in both wwtps achieve complete c n and p removal specifically p removal is carried out via enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr there is no addition of fecl3 in both processes the eps was recovered from both the collected granules and flocs according to felz felz et al 2019 dried biomass 0 5

dripping time and the burnt length were recorded for each test in comparison the flame extinguishing and dripping times required for faa certified materials are less than 15s and 3s respectively and the burnt length is less than 152 4 mm 6 in the uncoated flax fabrics were also evaluated as reference control samples 2 5 fourier transform infrared ft ir analysis of the coated flax fabric before

inert atmosphere 3 results 3 1 eps yields and morphology the eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge epsgranules represented 253 14 mg g volatile content of the sludge while the eps extracted from activated sludge epsflocs represented 150 20 mg g volatile content of the sludge the yields of epsflocs is lower than that of epsgranules lin et al 2013 the morphology of epsgranules and epsflocs is significantly different see fig 1 from each other epsgranules formed a web like matrix with fibres entangled with each other in fig 1 a the diameter of the fibres was around 40 50 nm this indicates that those fibres might be formed through self assembly process through entanglement the epsgranules web covered the entire surface which they attached on fig 1 c in comparison epsflocs did not form any fibres instead small patches with the size around 80 100 nm aggregated together fig 1 b it was worth noticing that there were cracks in between the aggregated patches especially when epsflocs attached on the surface fig 1 d the cracks can be 300 Î¼m in length and 45 50 nm in width due to the existence of cracks it is impossible for epsflocs to form a continuous layer on the surface where it attached on thus the different morphology of epsgranules and epsflocs can result to a significant dissimilar eps coating layer on the surface a continuous layer of epsgranules while a discontinuous coating layer of epsflocs thus the different morphology of epsgranules and epsflocs can result to a significant dissimilar eps coating layer on the surface a continuous layer of epsgranules while a discontinuous coating layer of epsflocs 3 2 the influence of eps coating on the flammability of flax fabric the effects of both epsgranules and epsflocs coating on the flammability of flax fabrics were clearly identified in the bunsen vertical burning test fig 2 shows the uncoated flax fabric epsflocs coated and epsgranules coated flax fabrics before during and after burning test the uncoated flax fabric is used as a reference control sample during burning process the significant difference can be seen at the moment of 5s the uncoated flax fabric was ignited by the flame of the burner and the flame has spread over the entire fabric strip the epsflocs coated flax fabric strip has been ignited and the flame has also spread into part of the fabric strip but has not spread over the entire fabric strip surface the epsgranules coated flax fabric has been ignited as well but the spreading of the flame is strongly inhibited at the moment of 5s and the flame size in this fabric during the testing was smaller than for the other two fabric samples after igniting of 12s the burner was removed the uncoated flax fabric was found to be in continuous combustion until it completely burnt out in comparison both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics were found to stop burning i e the flame was self extinguished as the exothermal heat still exist in burnt fabrics there were red glows afterglow on both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics the average afterglow time was recorded in table 1 for epsgranules coated flax fabrics this afterglow time was extremely short which is around Â¼ of that for epsflocs coated flax fabric indicating that the coating of epsgranules shielded the transfer of heat it was observed that the afterglow on the epsflocs coated flax fabrics displayed a certain path along the surface if the possibility of cracks formation is considered when epsflocs attached coated on the flax fabric surface based on the result of sem and afm analysis in section 3 1 the exothermal heat may conduct along the cracks on the flax fabric surface in which there was less or hardly epsflocs coverage in the cracks as the afterglow also consumed material consequently the average burnt length of epsflocs coated flax fabric was two times of that of the epsgranules coated flax fabrics table 1 and fig 2 the coating of both epsflocs and epsgranules provided the flax fabric self extinguishing property in fact the immediate flameout of the coated flax fabric was a remarkable result that indicate that both epsflocs and epsgranules behave as a flame retardant material the bunsen vertical burning test performed in the current research is against us far 25 853 for aircraft interior for any material that can be certified as aircraft interior material the required flame extinguishing and dripping times should be less than 15s and 3s respectively and the burnt length is less than 152 4 mm 6 in in comparison the flame extinguishing and dripping times for both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics were 0s which have apparently met the standard however the burnt length of epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabric was 260 mm and 130 mm respectively this means that only epsgranules coated flax fabrics in existing coating conditions reach the requirement for the aircraft interior material 3 3 functional groups in eps by ftir analysis in order to understand the functional groups that played a role in the self extinguishing property of both eps ftir analysis was performed on eps coated flax fabric before and after bunsen vertical burning test the spectrum of uncoated flax fabric was used as a reference as displayed in fig 3 a the spectra of epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics before burning are similar a broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 indicates the presence of oh group a relatively sharp peak at 3280 cm 1 is assigned to n h group in the proteins a peak at 1630 cm 1 implies the dominant protein secondary structure is cross beta sheet lin et al 2018 a band at 1200 940 cm 1 with the peak value at 1050 1080 cm 1 implies the presence of both carbohydrates and phosphate group in comparison to the reference spectrum of uncoated flax fabric the coating of epsflocs and epsgranules covered the ftir signal of uncoated flax fabric meaning the eps coating distributed evenly on the flax fabric surface it was noticed that there are two main differences between the spectra of epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics 1 for epsgranules coated flax the peak of the band at 1200 940 cm 1 is at 1050 cm 1 while the peak of the same band for epsflocs coated flax fabric is at 1080 cm 1 if the spectrum of uncoated flax at this region is compared the peak value and the shape of the band at 1200 940 cm 1 of epsflocs coated flax fabric is more similar to that of the uncoated flax fabric this is probably caused by the morphology of epsflocs there are cracks in between the patches which could make the flax fabric at the crack not completely covered by the epsflocs 2 there is a weak peak present in the spectrum of epsgranules coated flax at 870 cm 1 but not in the spectrum of epsflocs coated flax fabric this peak is normally assigned to carbonates co3 2 ribeiro et al 2006 epsgranules coated flax fabrics turned black due to char formation the similarities in the two spectra areas fig 3 b the broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 which indicates the presence of oh group is still present while the sharp peak at 3280 cm 1 disappeared likely the protein fraction was consumed in the burning process the peaks at 1630 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 that are amide i and ii peaks for proteins turned to one peak at 1598 cm 1 this is probably due to the burning product and char formation of proteins a new band appearing at 1408 cm 1 is assigned to carbonates socrates 2001 the peak of the band at 1200 940 cm 1 shifted to 1009 cm 1 which is one of the typical peaks of phosphates ribeiro et al 2006 the intensity of this band increased likely due to the burning out of the organic fraction the inorganic fraction such as phosphate becomes dominant in the residue in addition to the similarities the differences in the two spectra are although the new band with the peak at 1408 cm 1 appears in both spectra the intensity of this band is much stronger for epsgranules coated flax fabrics in addition there is a shoulder peak at 1483 cm 1 which is only present in the spectrum of epsgranules coated flax both two peaks are characteristics for carbonates rehman and bonfield 1997 the band at 876 cm 1 which is also assigned to carbonates becomes extremely sharp in the spectrum of epsgranules coated flax fabric a new band at 726 cm 1 only appeared in this spectrum indicating the presence of phosphate elliot 1994 the possibility that the carbonate bands were due to the formation of a calcium carbonate residue can be ruled out calcium carbonate decomposes at 825 c into cao and co2 the merck index while the temperature at bunsen vertical burning test is 850 c any calcium carbonate would disappear at this temperature regarding thermal stability and the typical carbonates and phosphates bands in the current spectra ribeiro et al 2006 carbonated hydroxyapatite is the most possible candidate for the inert residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric summarising the ftir analysis suggested that besides the char formed one of the dominate composites in the remaining residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric after burning is carbonated hydroxyapatite while in the residue of epsflocs coated flax fabric is phosphate in order to clarify if a carbonated hydroxyapatite was obtained xrd analysis was done to the remaining residue in the residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric the presence of carbonated hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 co3 was successfully detected unfortunately the phosphate in the residue of epsflocs coated flax fabric could not be detected leading to the assumption that the phosphate is in an amorphous mineral 3 4 thermal stability analysis to understand the impact of eps coating on the thermal stability of flax fabric thermogravimetric tg analysis was done on epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics the same analysis on uncoated flax fabric was taken as a reference a tg curve of uncoated flax demonstrates an initial weight loss approx 7 at around 100 150 c due to moisture evaporation further weight reduction at 250 c can be related to the thermal degradation of hemicellulose of flax which occurs at around 284 c kim et al 2018 in addition the tg curve indicates the second thermal decomposition at around 385 c that can be caused by the cleavage of glycosidic linkage of cellulose kim et al 2017 and then fully decomposition occurs at approx 670 c without any residue formation fig 4 the positive effects of epsflocs and epsgranules coating on thermal stability of flax are clearly observed in the tg and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves there was a significant increase in residue amount of both epsflocs and epsgranules coated flax fabrics both coated flax fabrics left approx 28 wt carbonaceous residues at 800 c fig 4 a which indicates a higher amount of char formation the eps coating reduced the maximum decomposition rate from 1 4 c for uncoated flax fabric to 0 8 c for epsflocs coated flax fabric and 0 5 c for epsgranules coated flax fabric fig 4 b the char and inert residue formed during decomposition were thermally stable making further loss of material extremely slow even with the increasing of temperature especially the epsgranules coated flax fabric shows the lowest thermal decomposition rate suggesting the coating of epsgranules works successfully as a kind of barrier for heat and or mass transfer the durable char formation of epsgranules coating prevented the additional thermal decomposition and pyrolysis of flax fabric 4 discussions 4 1 the extracellular polymeric substances extracted from both activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge have self extinguishing property in order to investigate the possibility of developing bio based flame retardant material the extracellular polymeric substances recovered from activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge were used as a coating material for flax fabric it was found that both epsflocs and epsgranules have a self extinguishing property ftir spectroscopy indicated that both eps have proteins and phosphate is one of the main components in the remaining residue after burning biomacromolecules such as proteins whey proteins caseins hydrophobins and dna have very recently shown unexpected flame retardant suppressant features when deposited on cellulosic or synthetic substrates like cotton polyesters or cotton polyester blends alongi et al 2014b more specifically caseins are phosphoproteins during burning they are capable of influencing the cellulose pyrolysis toward the formation of char alongi et al 2013 the phosphate groups in dna will also result in phosphoric acid under thermal degradation which reacts with cellulose to enhance the char formation in addition the nitrogen containing base referred to the monomers of dna releases ammonia which can dilute the concentration of oxygen in the gas phase so that flame inhibition can be achieved price and horrocks 2009 considering that phosphates have been found as one of the main components in the remaining residue of both epsflocs and epsgranules they must originate from the recovered eps whether they are in the format of phosphoproteins phosphorylated carbohydrates or phosphates minerals still needs further investigation based on the self extinguishing property that they displayed in the current research it is reasonable to category them into the phosphorus based flame retardant category very recently phosphorus based flame retardants are proposed as halogen free flame retardants for various polymeric materials schartel 2010 phosphoric acid is formed upon degradation of organic phosphate they can act in the condensed phase by enhancing char formation yielding intumescence or through inorganic glass formation and in the gas phase through flame inhibition schartel 2010 it seems that epsflocs and epsgranules can enhance char formation likely due to phosphate and or the synergetic effect of both phosphate and nitrogen from amine group in proteins thereafter decelerate the decomposition reaction and shield the heat transfer especially the epsflocs and epsgranules coating greatly reduced the decomposition rate to almost a half or even one third of the uncoated flax fabric one interesting phenomenon was the epsflocs and epsgranules coating lowered the decomposition temperature making the coated flax fabrics start decomposition at lower temperature in a slower rate in fact a lot of successfully flame retarded systems start to decompose at lower temperatures than the corresponding material without any flame retardant this also results in flame retarded systems often igniting earlier than corresponding non flame retarded polymers the resulted two step or multi step decomposition of materials seems to be the more important general feature of charring systems lyon 2004 schartel 2010 study of the mechanism behind the self extinguishing property of epsflocs and epsgranules can be done in future research by using cone calorimeter tg ms and tg ftir analysis 4 2 the extracellular polymeric substances recovered from aerobic granular sludge is a better candidate of bio phosphorus based flame retardant although both epsflocs and epsgranules have self extinguishing property only epsgranules coated flax fabric reached the complete requirement for the vertical burning test for aircraft interior materials with the respect of flame retardancy different from epsflocs carbonated hydroxyapatite is one of the main components in the remaining residue of epsgranules coated flax fabric hydroxyapatite is the most stable calcium phosphate phase at neutral ph koutsoukos et al 1980 it is also thermally stable till 1300 c omelon and grynpas 2008 marine bacteria oral bacteria e coli and some other bacteria have been identified as microorganisms that are capable of metabolizing phosphorus and mineralizing apatite intra and extracellularly schulz et al 2005 it was reported that carbonated hydroxyapatite was formed when hydroxyapatite alginate was burned burning of alginate caused an increase of local concentration of co2 favoring the reaction between co2 and oh group of hydroxyapatite consequently form carbonated hydroxyapatite by substitute oh by co3 2 elliot 1994 thus it is reasonable to assume that there is hydroxyapatite in epsgranules which is produced by microorganisms during burning of the epsgranules coated flax fabric the production of co2 from the burning of proteins and other organic material favored the formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite carbonated hydroxyapatite itself is already reported as a flame retardant lu et al 2014 in comparison carbonated hydroxyapatite could not be detected in the residue of epsflocs coated flax fabric by xrd analysis this might be the reason that epsgranules is a better flame retardant than epsflocs why there are different forms of phosphate in different eps how does carbonated hydroxyapatite affect char formation and reduce the decomposition rate of epsgranules coated flax fabric requires better understanding in the future 4 3 practical and economic feasibility the worldwide consumption of flame retardant is more than 2 25 million tonnes per year https www flameretardants online com flame retardants market in volume terms the market size is expected to grow at a global rate of 3 1 until 2021 major flame retardant is aluminium hydroxide 38 and second large share 31 is the halogenated flame retardant systems consisting of brominated and chlorinated products the halogenated flame retardants have been associated with a wide range of harmful effects in human and environment due to releasing highly toxic organic pollutants like polybrominated dioxins and furans therefore the substitution of the halogenated flame retardant with more sustainable non halogenated products is a current trend in the flame retardant additive industry furthermore the end of life disposal of synthetic polymer and additive is mostly done through incineration and landfilling which result in air pollution increase of greenhouse gases and soil contamination based on environmental and human concerns bio based flame retardants have become vital and researches have actively been conducted to develop new types of the flame retardant additives made from renewable resources despite significant potential of proteins whey proteins caseins hydrophobins and dna in the flame retardancy field one challenging issue on the use of biomacromolecules as flame retardants is the possibility of adjusting this technology to a large scale which is a key point for assessing its further industrial development alongi et al 2014b 2014a at this point epsgranules has an advantage aerobic sludge granulation technology currently commercialized by royalhaskoningdhv rhdhv under the name nereda is rapidly spreading with already 70 full scale granular sludge wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide built or under construction on 5 continents since 2013 about hundred plants are expected to operate by next year sufficient waste granular sludge can be provided the commercial name of epsgranules is kaumera the first kaumera pilot production plant will be opened in october 2019 in the netherlands this plant can produce 400 tons of kaumera per year therefore large scale production of epsgranules kaumera is possible considering the technology of coating kaumera on the surface of the fabrics can be easily combined within the fabric production process there is a great potential for the practical and economic feasibility of using epsgranules as bio flame retardant for fabrics 5 conclusions the extracellular polymeric substances eps recovered from both activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge have self extinguishing property this fire resistant behaviour make them a suitable flame retardant materials for coatings flax fabric coated with eps recovered from aerobic granular sludge meets the flame retardancy requirements in us federal aviation regulation standards with the respect of flame retardancy the eps recovered from aerobic granular sludge is a better candidate of bio phosphorus based
