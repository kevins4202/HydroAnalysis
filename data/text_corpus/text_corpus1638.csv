8190,study region northeast poland biebrza basin study focus studying reference ecosystems and their specific features provides information to be used as background principles for ecosystem management in the case of riparian wetlands these are hydrological indicators such as average water levels flooding extents and flood duration that are either used as criteria for ecosystem conservation or remain easy to measure targets for habitat restoration we focused on revealing whether any trends in flood extents and durations of inundation exist within near natural temperate floodplains persisting under the natural lowland river flow regime we analysed whether the fraction of inundation time in a year fit changed over time river discharge data from 1951 to 2011 applied as boundary conditions in a 1d hydrodynamic model were used to generate flood extents and durations in the lower basin of the biebrza valley new hydrological insights for the region we found no substantial trends in flood extents and flood durations in both time dependent mean and standard deviation we revealed that the average long term values of the fit influencing the persistence of caricetum approprinquatae caricetum gracilis glycerietum maximae and phragmitetum communis reached respectively 0 33 0 43 0 49 and 0 53 and did not present trends variability of the fit within particular plant communities was high the main challenges in conservation of temperate riparian wetlands are likely related to appropriate management addressing nonlinear climatic pressures keywords wetlands floodplains flooding vegetation climate change trends weighted least squares 1 introduction riparian wetlands have recently gained increasing concern in the worldwide scientific literature due to their environmental value and the services they provide for societies zhang et al 2010 after the 1990s when biodiversity oriented messages dominated wetland research new insights revealed that floodplains alongside being important habitats for unique biota should also be considered suppliers of multiple valuable services such as carbon storage fish and hay production and water purification maltby and acreman 2011 okruszko et al 2011 van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 contemporary scientific and environmental policy concerns have shifted towards appropriate management and restoration of these ecosystems as keystone elements of local economies also for the sake of local societies aronoson et al 2010 erwin 2009 nielsen pincus and moseley 2013 palmer et al 2014 the majority if not all of the services provided by wetlands and that are important from the management perspective depend on hydrological processes mitsch and gosselink 2015 environmental management and engineering measures applied to maintain or restore appropriate features of wetland ecosystems are oriented at providing waterlogging appropriate groundwater depths and defined inundation durations bradley 2002 caldwell et al 2011 grzywaczewski et al 2017 maciorowski et al 2014 mirosław świątek et al 2017 these unique attributes of riparian habitats depend on multiple catchment scale processes controlled by the set of stochastic features grouped and defined as a flood pulse junk et al 1989 keizer et al 2014 or a river continuum vannote et al 1980 these processes although they in principle remain dependent on natural climatic hydrological and geomorphological feedback are presently controlled by humans over the vast majority of the world s river basins dynesius and nilsson 1994 most of the eu catchments for many years have been exposed to human enforced changes and pressures such as intensive agriculture hydropower water abstraction and treatment adversely climatic changes have also been reported to be a vast challenge for both the management and conservation of riparian wetlands grygoruk and acreman 2015 stagl et al 2014 many model based studies were applied to reveal the importance of natural and human influenced temporal distribution of extreme hydrological events marcinkowski and grygoruk 2017 piniewski et al 2017 schneider et al 2011 extracting the natural background of the listed hydrological indicators in these strongly modified hydrological conditions full of external noises manipulating water levels controlling discharge using water for irrigation requires finding appropriate reference study areas and statistical methods the management and climate change interface is likely to become the main work field for ecological engineering approaches to wetlands especially when some engineering based solutions tend to be contradicted by climate change e g dorau et al 2015 in the riparian wetlands the extents and frequencies of floods keep floodplain ecosystems in appropriate hydrological and geochemical conditions emphasising their quantitative and temporal changes in reference natural areas remain critically important in long term planning of riparian wetlands management and conservation in our paper we quantify long term temporal trends of flood extents and durations considered key drivers of riparian ecological processes in the biebrza valley an element of the medium sized european lowland temperate catchment exposed to low human pressure located in ne poland the main goals of our study are to 1 reveal whether there are significant long term trends in flood durations and extents in the near natural catchment 2 discuss the relevance of the trends revealed for near natural riparian ecosystems and 3 provide hydrological characteristics such as durations of inundation within well preserved typical temperate riparian plant communities the paper consists of five sections after the introduction in the first section we present the materials and methods in section two the results are described and analysed in the third section and discussed in the fourth one the fifth section concludes the research in appendix 1 the theoretical methodology of the weighted least squares method is scrutinised electronic appendix 2 contains raw data used in the analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area and plant communities selected for the analysis the research was carried out in the northern part of the lower basin of the biebrza basin lbb fig 1 referred to as the stretch of biebrza valley between the confluence of rudzki canal and cross section delimited by villages budy eastern bound of the valley and okrasin western bound of the valley considered a well preserved natural floodplain ecosystem representing the main ecological features of such systems in temperate european lowlands the biebrza valley is located in a temperate continental climate with average annual air temperatures of 6 6 c but characterised by strong seasonal variability from extreme momentary air temperatures reaching as low as 25 c in winter january february up to 30 c in summer july august grygoruk et al 2014 average annual precipitation is 574 mm grygoruk and rannow 2017 the wetlands of the lbb depend on the dynamic interactions between seasonal flooding groundwater discharge and rain snowmelt water accumulation strongly related to meteorological and climatic variability berezowski et al 2019 chormański et al 2011 the average terrain elevations of the study site equal 106 m a s l and most of this glacial formed land depression is covered with a peat layer with a maximum thickness of 5 m which developed on a sandy plain and provides perfect conditions for development of rare and endemic species of fauna and flora mirosław świątek et al 2017 a dominant environmental characteristic responsible for sustaining riparian habitats is related to seasonal flooding that occurs in the thawing season march april according to the analysis of the long term measurements of the national monitoring system the flooding starts when the water stages at the burzyn water gauge exceed 250 cm and the discharge of the biebrza river at the osowiec gauging station exceeds 25 m3 s grygoruk et al 2013 the natural balance between the natural hydrological processes and limited non aggressive agricultural and settlement pressure create suitable conditions for the persistence of natural patterning of wetland vegetation chormański et al 2009 among the dominant plant communities four alliances remain typical for temperate european floodplains developed in peat filled valleys namely caricetum appropinquatae that develop along the edges of the valley in conditions of groundwater inundation caricetum gracilis glycerietum maximae and phragmitetum communis which are dependent on surface water flooding and usually develop in the adjacent vicinity of the surface water bodies floodplain lakes and biebrza river fig 1 these plant communities and their natural mosaic and habitat management constitute a keystone structure guaranteeing the persistence of the unique biodiversity budka et al 2019 polakowski and kasprzykowski 2016 polakowski et al 2018 within the extent of each of the five plant communities analysed we distinguished 20 monitoring plots five plots within the extent of each plant community fig 1 table 1 2 2 modelling of flood extents and durations according to mirosław świątek et al 2015 the 1d numerical model based on the dynamic saint venant equations strictly based on the diffusive wave approximation proved to be the most suitable tool to perform computational flood flow simulations in the low dynamic and spatially broad floodplain systems for the 60 year period the model was calibrated and validated for water level hydrographs recorded by the automatic sensors during the flood events in the 2006 2010 period kiczko and mirosław świątek 2018 mirosław świątek 2012 the flow area was represented by 59 river and floodplain cross sections evenly distributed along the modelled river stretch with an average distance of 250 m manning s friction coefficient was chosen to define the resistance of water flow in the river channel and floodplain the calibrated manning s coefficient ranged from 0 035 to 0 042 in the river channel and from 0 055 to 0 110 within the floodplain kiczko and mirosław świątek 2018 specific use of this model required analysis of the errors of water table recorded by an automatic sensor installed on the left floodplain 10 km upstream from the first cross section and 190 m away from the river course table 2 the model proved to generate satisfactory results of overbank flows which was fundamental hydrological information for the sake of this study the value of the correlation coefficient r between the observed and modelled water elevations along the river stretch analysed is between 0 970 and 0 980 and the mean square error mse varies from 0 06 to 0 08 m maximum error of the model calculation results versus observed water levels does not exceed 0 13 m once successfully calibrated the model was applied to forecast water levels in the river for the daily time series from the 1951 2011 period the results of calculations supported by the geo statistical analysis allowed us to determine inundation extent maps and analyse flood duration in the selected research locations fig 1 with daily time distribution the characteristics of flood waves duration depth extent and occurrence constitute the basis for the long term analysis of trends the high quality digital elevation model dem of the research area mirosław świątek et al 2016a 2016b minimised the risk of generic errors related to the quality of topographical data the original dem was generalised to the basic grid size 25 25 m as a result we were able to accurately determine the area ha inundated every day by the biebrza river in the studied period 1951 2011 the spatial data were pre processed to exclude the zones that are under water within the regular riverbed so we only analysed those flooded areas that are of particular importance for the wetland vegetation 2 3 detection and analysis of spatial and temporal trends in inundations the methods of detecting trends in the hydrological non stationary data series can be generally but subjectively divided into two approaches i non stationarity testing in the time series and ii detecting the non stationarity in the parameters of the models in our research we adopted the statistical methodology from the second group ii called the weighted least squares wls method the wls was developed by strupczewski and kaczmarek 1998 2001b to detect and estimate trends in parameters of the flood frequency models of peak annual river discharges however the simplicity and universality of this technique preordain it also to be used for trend detection in the area of residence of inundation waters and time of the inundation waters residence in the wetland pits a thorough description of the wls its pros and cons falls beyond the scope of this paper and can be found in the work of strupczewski and kaczmarek 1998 2001b and strupczewski et al 2016 but the key aspects of this methodology deserve a few comments the method is based on minimising the sums of weighted squared deviations of observed and estimated moments mean value and standard deviation in our case and the weights are reciprocals of their expected values the wls equations contain both time t dependent mean m t and variance μ2 t σ t 2 so they would be numerically solved jointly unless the standard deviation is assumed to be constant in fact one can assume any type of the functions m t f t and σ t g t depending on the data sets however the most common one from the data set analysis point of view is the assumption of the linear dependence of the non stationary process on time 1 m t a t b σ t c t d where a b c and d are coefficients the wls being conceptually quite different from the maximum likelihood ml method coincides with the latter when the data series are normally distributed in such a case it is possible to render the wls as a problem of the ml estimation after introduction of the linear mt and σt the formula for the probability density function of the gaussian distribution becomes 2 ϕ x t 1 c t d 2 π e x p x t a t b 2 2 c t d 2 where xt is the time dependent random argument of the function when the distributions of data sets are non gaussian the trends may be estimated using the ml method with time t as the covariant strupczewski et al 2001a 2016 a detailed description of the wls algorithm is provided in appendix a if the data analysed reveal an explicit non linear trend e g parabolic periodic etc the wls method can be applied too provided the population is normally distributed however in such cases the number of parameters to be estimated usually rises according to the principle of parsimony the number of parameters should be kept as low as possible especially if the time series used for the estimation is short the statistical analyses of flood durations in particular research plots were performed by means of a one way analysis of variance anova as a main indicator of inundation duration within particular plant communities the fraction of inundation time fit index was calculated eq 3 3 f i t n d f 365 where ndf stands for the number of days when inundation occurred both for individual research plots and for the whole community fitcomm the latter was expressed as the arithmetic mean of the fit values for five research plots within the particular plant community analysed 3 results 3 1 general trends of flooded area changes in the lbb the basic statistical calculations revealed that the variability of the maximum flood extents are insignificant both in a longer perspective and when analysed year by year within the analysed period 1951 2011 the maximum annual flood extents ranged from ca 420 ha in the extremely dry year of 1969 up to 5245 ha in the wet year of 1979 fig 2 a the average annual flood extents ranged from 59 ha in 1969 to 2881 ha in 1979 and clearly disclose an increasing trend over the analysed period fig 2b the average maximum flood extent that occurred during the analysed period is equal to 4098 ha whereas the mean of the average flood extents equals 1392 ha fig 2c the histogram of the mean annual range of inundations fig 3 shows that the main mass of the frequency is locate within the centre of the diagram which suggests normal distribution of the data thick black line in the figure however the visual resemblance should not be considered sound proof of the normality of the distribution and additional tests should be carried out the shapiro wilk test with statistic w 0 98 and n 61 elements does not provide a sound rationale to reject the zero hypothesis about the normality of the sample at the α 0 05 level of confidence therefore the use of the wls method of trend detection in mean and standard deviation is justified the results of the wls calculations for the mean annual area of flooding are as follows eq 4 4 a 15 2 b 879 6 a b 1 7 s o m t 15 2 t 879 6 a n d c 0 14 d 536 4 c d 0 03 s o σ t 0 14 t 536 4 the slope a of the time dependent mean mt is equal to 15 2 which means that considering the random character of the floods the value of the flood area in the 61st year will have a 50 probability of being higher than 1800 ha however if the intersect parameter b as the mean value for time t 0 is considered then a b indicates how the mean value changes over time when compared with the initial mean value the ratio a b 1 7 so from the practical point of view the annual changes are rather negligible in other words the mean value of the mean annual inundation area changed little over the 61 years of measurements the c d ratio is even smaller c d 0 03 thus the variability of the mean annual inundation area is practically barely detectable over the 61 years of inundations and as such can be neglected hence the trends in both mean values and standard deviations in the measurements of the mean annual flooded areas are small and should not be considered the essential issues in water management planning in the river valley in light of the presented results we conclude that seasonal flood extents in the years analysed reveal some trend in mean but it is small enough to be considered a stable factor influencing the biodiversity of the lbb a closer look at the variability of the time series in fig 2b suggests a shift in average inundation area between 1970 and 1980 indeed pettitt s test suggests an abrupt change point in 1973 which divides the data into two more homogeneous periods 1951 1973 and 1974 2011 fig 2b in both periods the absolute values of trends in mean are small a b well below 1 but they differ in sign with a negative sign for the latter period thus in fact for this particular data we deal with two semi stationary periods on the other hand it is not advisable to perform statistical analysis on high flow data shorter than ca 40 years huh et al 2005 it is recommended to use the longest possible time series to create prediction models for the future so our analyses are based on all available data 3 2 flood duration the shapiro wilk normality test clearly indicates that for all but one site 44 phragmitetum communis data set the zero hypothesis about the normality of the samples cannot be rejected at the α 0 05 level of confidence table 3 further analysis of the data from site 44 revealed that according to the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the normal distribution is the most suitable for representing the site 44 data from among other distribution functions commonly used in statistical hydrology log normal gumbel pearson type 3 generalised extreme value generalised logistic and weibull therefore we applied the wls method of trend analysis for all 20 data sets the results of the wls estimation of trends in mean value generally show positive but minimal trends in all considered sites however the a b ratios revolving around 2 suggest little change in the mean value of the water time residence over the 61 years of measurement which can be regarded as a fairly stable condition for the plant communities analysed inferring from the results of the wls models of trends for the phenomena and assuming stability of water management scenarios one could project a negligibly longer time of water residence in the future rather than a water deficiency regarding the standard deviation the detected trend is either negative or positive however c 1 the c d ratios also suggest that the change in the water residence time was stable over the 61 years of measurements to conclude time of water residence revealed stability of the flood phenomena over 61 years 1951 2011 3 3 time of inundation in different plant communities the distributions of inundation time within the plant communities analysed present different patterns of variability and magnitudes fig 4 table 4 here we decided to use the chi square test which confirmed the normal distribution of modelled inundation durations in each of the research plots p 0 05 the homogeneity of variance of these data sets was confirmed by the levene test p 0 05 average durations of inundation with caricetum approprinquatae analysed in five different plots varied from 97 to 155 days fit values from 0 26 to 0 42 average fit 0 33 fig 4a table 4 the one way anova pointed at the inequity of inundation time f 15 39 p 0 05 on the other hand there are research plots namely 11 12 and 15 where the average inundation time does not differ significantly p 0 05 the differences in the inundation time between locations 13 and 14 are also undetectable at a statistically significant level of p 0 05 these results indicate that the plots located within the extents of caricetum appropinquatae present similar dynamics in terms of flood duration on the contrary the average inundation durations in five research plots located within the extent of caricetum gracilis vary between 96 and 198 days per year in locations 21 and 24 respectively fit values from 0 26 to 0 54 average fit 0 43 fig 4b table 4 here the one way anova denotes the lack of equity of the average inundation time f 20 54 p 0 05 in locations 22 and 23 average inundation durations are not significantly statistically different p 0 95 consequently no dissimilarities were detected between inundation durations in research plots 23 and 25 p 0 05 as well as 24 and 25 p 0 85 the average inundation durations between the other plots differ considerably the average inundation durations within the extent of glycerietum maximae varied from 135 plot 31 to 241 days plot 32 fit values from 0 36 to 0 66 average fit 0 49 fig 4c table 4 additionally in this case the one way anova suggests inequity in the average inundation time f 24 85 p 0 05 in locations 31 and 35 the average inundation durations do not differ much p 0 99 similarly no statistically significant differences were detected between inundation durations in plots 33 and 34 p 0 63 the differences between the average inundation durations in other plots are noticeable within the extent of phragmitetum communis the average inundation duration varies from 138 plot 45 to 249 days plot 44 fit values from 0 38 to 0 68 average fit 0 53 fig 4d table 4 the lack of equity of the average inundation time f 24 92 p 0 05 within the extent of this plant community was confirmed by the one way anova the average inundation durations in locations 41 and 45 are fairly similar p 0 25 correspondingly no statistically significant differences were detected between inundation durations in plots 41 and 43 p 0 91 and in plots 42 and 44 p 0 79 the differences in the average inundation durations between other plots are noticeable and cannot be neglected averaged annual inundation durations in the analysed plant communities represented by the indicator fitcomm ranged from 0 33 to 0 53 representing that duration of inundation varied from 121 to 193 days among them the longest flooded species seems to be phragmitetum communis inundated for more than six months a year and the shortest inundations were recorded within the range of caricetum appropinquatae four months under water the chi square test confirms the accordance of inundation durations with the gaussian distribution p 0 05 as no homogeneity of the variances was detected levene test p 0 05 the anova was carried out using the welch s f test that gave the value p 0 05 pointing to significant differences in inundation duration in different plant communities statistically significant differences between the inundation durations within glycerietum maximae and phragmitetum communis were not noticed p 0 075 which allows us to hypothesise that in the examined reference it is not the flow duration in the near natural riparian ecosystem that differentiates the habitat conditions between these two plant communities 4 discussion the internal variabilities of the fit within particular plant communities are rather vast and located between ca 0 49 of the averaged fit for the community fitcomm within the extent of caricetum appropinquatae and 0 56 within the extent of phragmitetum communis this observation suggests that variability tolerance of particular well established riparian plant communities although exposed to large fit variability can tolerate a relatively broad range of hydrological conditions this information is of high importance for wetland managers to establish optimal hydrological conditions for plant development moreover within the analysed period there were no visible trends in either flood extents or inundation durations amongst four dominant and typical temperate floodplain plant communities although some of the former results suggested significant trends in earlier occurrence of thaw floods the indicators analysed in our study do not disclose any statistically significant temporal or spatial patterns this is because of the recent increase of air temperatures and consequently the increase of potential evapotranspiration followed by some shifts in vegetation into drier communities berezowski et al 2018 grygoruk et al 2014 unlike reihan et al 2012 who analysed discharge data from 70 stations in the baltic states and wrote that maximum discharges of spring floods decreased in the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century we cannot confirm these tendencies in the reach of the river we analysed despite its location in geographically similar conditions our results corroborate that the water and habitat behaviour within the biebrza valley and most likely similar temperate riparian ecosystems in central europe tend to depend on local water management policy rather than on general climatic conditions affecting the hydrological cycle and flood pulse in particular all the negative effects of the flood control policy in this case might be magnified by the inappropriate water management in the lake systems located in the upstream fragments of the biebrza catchment similarly a more negative influence on lbb floodplain hydrology rather than the climatic features can result from the ongoing incision of the riverbed of narew of which biebrza is the tributary which would lower the elevation of the drainage base of the biebrza river most likely resulting in shortening the duration and frequency of floods in the biebrza valley as far as the regional scale is concerned it has been already proven marcinkowski and grygoruk 2017 that the inappropriate water management measures adversely affect spring flood durations and frequencies and are likely to be responsible for shifts in vegetation from carex dominated riparian habitats to the phragmites alliances próchnicki 2005 similarly the observed negative changes of wetland habitat conditions in the lbb are liable to result from harmful ecosystem management measures such as the use of heavy track mowers on microtopography banaszuk et al 2016 kotowski et al 2013 or inappropriate spontaneous adaptation to climatic change by individual stakeholders uncontrolled and unmanaged draining of mires immediately after a flood grygoruk and rannow 2017 this observation is in accordance with studies on the trade offs of wetland management and climate change ross et al 2019 bearing in mind the importance of the flood pulse for the persistence of floodplain lakes and status of their ecosystems our results show that the evolution of the biebrza river channel and associated oxbows słapińska et al 2016 is an example of the morphogenetic process which was not affected by the climate related impacts in the analysed period similarly we also suspect that the biogeochemical processes i e deposition of particulate matter in the floodplain habitats within the selected analysed plant communities located in the near vicinity of the biebrza river keizer et al 2016 most likely have not been triggered by climate change the indicators in our research namely the flood durations and extents can serve as tools in the decision making process of managing temperate riparian wetlands that have either been created or restored researchers often search for hydrological parameters that could be considered a management goal asking for water levels that should be assured and maintained in re created or restored wetlands bendoricchio et al 2000 coole and brooks 2000 song et al 2010 regarding hydrological criteria to be fulfilled when seeking to establish wetland buffer zones jabłońska et al 2020 provided multi year fit values along with the values of σ for both individual research locations and whole communities analysed table 4 may remain scratch values that could be aimed at when setting the management goals for newly established or restored temperate riparian vegetation communities beyond the botanical perspective defined high stability and no significant trends in flooding can be considered important factors making lbb a relevant and constant from a hydrological perspective stopover site for migratory birds related to wetlands budka et al 2019 maciorowski et al 2014 polakowski et al 2018 considering the extreme hydrological events that occurred in the last few years namely severe and long droughts in 2015 and 2019 and heavy rainfalls e g in july 2016 it is advisable to analyse the influence of these particular phenomena on trends and statistical differences of flood recurrences and extents on a regional scale none of the studies referring to the recurrence and volumes of flooding in lowland systems of the region akstinas et al 2019 berezowski et al 2018 grygoruk et al 2014 reihan et al 2012 stonevičius et al 2018 analysed these most up to date data that might have influenced the steep decline of water resources in the region including flood extents and durations note that our modelling results especially the analysis of trends and trend directions cannot be extrapolated behind the modelling period faulkner et al 2020 most of the predictions indicate that in short until 2025 and long term until 2050 horizons riparian wetlands will be affected by climatic change schneider et al 2011 mirosław świątek et al 2020 that dramatically modifies their status and alters the natural services they provide okruszko et al 2011 the short term scenarios will soon be verified by new data from river discharge monitoring based on the analysis provided in our study one can conclude that in lbb neither the increasing nor decreasing long term trends in flooding occurred in the analysed period 5 conclusions the analyses based on a 61 year series 1951 2011 of flood extent modelling did not reveal any significant trends the flood durations and extents in the near natural river valley did not present any significant trends although a visible trend in average flooded areas can be distinguished it is not statistically significant fig 2b two contradictive trends detected for years 1951 1973 increasing and 1974 2011 decreasing also do not allow us to confirm any relevant and significant ongoing changes in the flooding regime of the lbb the fit values within the extents of plant communities ranged between 0 33 and 0 53 for the average year giving the long term constant inundation durations ranging from 121 to 193 days and being dependent mostly on meteorological conditions the shortest modelled inundations were determined for caricetum appropinquatae whereas the longest was for phragmitetum communis the internal variability of the modelled flood durations within the particular plant communities was relatively high which led us to the conclusion that well established temperate riparian habitats present high resilience to hydrological variability and can withstand severe droughts and long lasting floods in light of the presented results we infer that persistence evolution or degradation of temperate riparian ecosystems similar to the analysed lbb is related to the appropriate management measures both on the local scale habitat management and on the catchment scale water regime control authors statement mateusz grygoruk conceptualization investigation formal

8190,study region northeast poland biebrza basin study focus studying reference ecosystems and their specific features provides information to be used as background principles for ecosystem management in the case of riparian wetlands these are hydrological indicators such as average water levels flooding extents and flood duration that are either used as criteria for ecosystem conservation or remain easy to measure targets for habitat restoration we focused on revealing whether any trends in flood extents and durations of inundation exist within near natural temperate floodplains persisting under the natural lowland river flow regime we analysed whether the fraction of inundation time in a year fit changed over time river discharge data from 1951 to 2011 applied as boundary conditions in a 1d hydrodynamic model were used to generate flood extents and durations in the lower basin of the biebrza valley new hydrological insights for the region we found no substantial trends in flood extents and flood durations in both time dependent mean and standard deviation we revealed that the average long term values of the fit influencing the persistence of caricetum approprinquatae caricetum gracilis glycerietum maximae and phragmitetum communis reached respectively 0 33 0 43 0 49 and 0 53 and did not present trends variability of the fit within particular plant communities was high the main challenges in conservation of temperate riparian wetlands are likely related to appropriate management addressing nonlinear climatic pressures keywords wetlands floodplains flooding vegetation climate change trends weighted least squares 1 introduction riparian wetlands have recently gained increasing concern in the worldwide scientific literature due to their environmental value and the services they provide for societies zhang et al 2010 after the 1990s when biodiversity oriented messages dominated wetland research new insights revealed that floodplains alongside being important habitats for unique biota should also be considered suppliers of multiple valuable services such as carbon storage fish and hay production and water purification maltby and acreman 2011 okruszko et al 2011 van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 contemporary scientific and environmental policy concerns have shifted towards appropriate management and restoration of these ecosystems as keystone elements of local economies also for the sake of local societies aronoson et al 2010 erwin 2009 nielsen pincus and moseley 2013 palmer et al 2014 the majority if not all of the services provided by wetlands and that are important from the management perspective depend on hydrological processes mitsch and gosselink 2015 environmental management and engineering

caldwell et al 2011 grzywaczewski et al 2017 maciorowski et al 2014 mirosław świątek et al 2017 these unique attributes of riparian habitats depend on multiple catchment scale processes controlled by the set of stochastic features grouped and defined as a flood pulse junk et al 1989 keizer et al 2014 or a river continuum vannote et al 1980 these processes although they in principle remain dependent on natural climatic hydrological and geomorphological feedback are presently controlled by humans over the vast majority of the world s river basins dynesius and nilsson 1994 most of the eu

appropriate reference study areas and statistical methods the management and climate change interface is likely to become the main work field for ecological engineering approaches to wetlands especially when some engineering based solutions tend to be contradicted by climate change e g dorau et al 2015 in the riparian wetlands the extents and frequencies of floods keep floodplain ecosystems in appropriate hydrological and geochemical conditions emphasising their quantitative and temporal changes in reference natural areas remain critically important in long term planning of riparian wetlands management and conservation in our paper we quantify long term temporal trends of flood extents and durations considered key drivers of riparian ecological processes in the biebrza valley an element of the medium sized european lowland temperate catchment exposed to low human pressure located in ne poland the main goals of our study are to 1 reveal whether there are significant long term trends in flood durations and extents in the near natural catchment 2 discuss the relevance of the trends revealed for near natural riparian ecosystems and 3 provide hydrological characteristics such as durations of inundation within well preserved typical temperate riparian plant communities the paper consists of five sections after the introduction in the first section we present the materials and methods in section two the results are described and analysed in the third section and discussed in the fourth one the fifth section concludes the research in appendix 1 the theoretical methodology of the weighted least squares method is scrutinised electronic appendix 2 contains raw data used in the analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area and plant communities selected for the analysis the research was carried out in the northern part of the lower basin of the biebrza basin lbb fig 1 referred to as the stretch of biebrza valley between the confluence of rudzki canal and cross section delimited by villages budy eastern bound of the valley and okrasin western bound of the valley considered a well preserved natural floodplain ecosystem representing the main ecological features of such systems in temperate european lowlands the biebrza valley is located in a temperate continental climate with average annual air temperatures of 6 6 c but characterised by strong seasonal variability from extreme momentary air temperatures reaching as low as 25 c in winter january february up to 30 c in summer july august grygoruk et al 2014 average annual precipitation is 574 mm grygoruk and rannow 2017 the wetlands of the lbb depend on the dynamic interactions between seasonal flooding groundwater discharge and rain snowmelt water accumulation strongly related to meteorological and climatic variability berezowski et al 2019 chormański et al 2011 the average terrain elevations of the study site equal 106 m a s l and most of this glacial formed land depression is covered with a peat layer with a maximum thickness of 5 m which developed on a sandy plain and provides perfect conditions for development of rare and endemic species of fauna and flora mirosław świątek et al 2017 a dominant environmental characteristic responsible for sustaining riparian habitats is related to seasonal flooding that occurs in the thawing season march april according to the analysis of the long term measurements of the national monitoring system the flooding starts when the water stages at the burzyn water gauge exceed 250 cm and the discharge of the biebrza river at the osowiec gauging station exceeds 25 m3 s grygoruk et al 2013 the natural balance between the natural hydrological processes and limited non aggressive agricultural and settlement pressure create suitable conditions for the persistence of natural patterning of wetland vegetation chormański et al 2009 among the dominant plant communities four alliances remain typical for temperate european floodplains developed in peat filled valleys namely caricetum appropinquatae that develop along the edges of the valley in conditions of groundwater inundation caricetum gracilis glycerietum maximae and phragmitetum communis which are dependent on surface water flooding and usually develop in the adjacent vicinity of the surface water bodies floodplain lakes and biebrza river fig 1 these plant communities and their natural mosaic and habitat management constitute a keystone structure guaranteeing the persistence of the unique biodiversity budka et al 2019 polakowski and kasprzykowski 2016 polakowski et al 2018 within the extent of each of the five plant communities analysed we distinguished 20 monitoring plots five plots within the extent of each plant community fig 1 table 1 2 2 modelling of flood extents and durations according to mirosław świątek et al 2015 the 1d numerical model based on the dynamic saint venant equations strictly based on the diffusive wave approximation proved to be the most suitable tool to perform computational flood flow simulations in the low dynamic and spatially broad floodplain systems for the 60 year period the model was calibrated and validated for water level hydrographs recorded by the automatic sensors during the flood events in the 2006 2010 period kiczko and mirosław świątek 2018 mirosław świątek 2012 the flow area was represented by 59 river and floodplain cross sections evenly distributed along the modelled river stretch with an average distance of 250 m manning s friction coefficient was chosen to define the resistance of water flow in the river channel and floodplain the calibrated manning s coefficient ranged from 0 035 to 0 042 in the river channel and from 0 055 to 0 110 within the floodplain kiczko and mirosław świątek 2018 specific use of this model required analysis of the errors of water table recorded by an automatic sensor installed on the left floodplain 10 km upstream from the first cross section and 190 m away from the river course table 2 the model proved to generate satisfactory results of overbank flows which was fundamental hydrological information for the sake of this study the value of the correlation coefficient r between the observed and modelled water elevations along the river stretch analysed is between 0 970 and 0 980 and the mean square error mse varies from 0 06 to 0 08 m maximum error of the model calculation results versus observed water levels does not exceed 0 13 m once successfully calibrated the model was applied to forecast water levels in the river for the daily time series from the 1951 2011 period the results of calculations supported by the geo statistical analysis allowed us to determine inundation extent maps and analyse flood duration in the selected research locations fig 1 with daily time distribution the characteristics of flood waves duration depth extent and occurrence constitute the basis for the long term analysis of trends the high quality digital elevation model dem of the research area mirosław świątek et al 2016a 2016b minimised the risk of generic errors related to the quality of topographical data the original dem was generalised to the basic grid size 25 25 m as a result we were able to accurately determine the area ha inundated every day by the biebrza river in the studied period 1951 2011 the spatial data were pre processed to exclude the zones that are under water within the regular riverbed so we only analysed those flooded areas that are of particular importance for the wetland vegetation 2 3 detection and analysis of spatial and temporal trends in inundations the methods of detecting trends in the hydrological non stationary data series can be generally but subjectively divided into two approaches i non stationarity testing in the time series and ii detecting the non stationarity in the parameters of the models in our research we adopted the statistical methodology from the second group ii called the weighted least squares wls method the wls was developed by strupczewski and kaczmarek 1998 2001b to detect and estimate trends in parameters of the flood frequency models of peak annual river discharges however the simplicity and universality of this technique preordain it also to be used for trend detection in the area of residence of inundation waters and time of the inundation waters residence in the wetland pits a thorough description of the wls its pros and cons falls beyond the scope of this paper and can be found in the work of strupczewski and kaczmarek 1998 2001b and strupczewski et al 2016 but the key aspects of this methodology deserve a few comments the method is based on minimising the sums of weighted squared deviations of observed and estimated moments mean value and standard deviation in our case and the weights are reciprocals of their expected values the wls equations contain both time t dependent mean m t and variance μ2 t σ t 2 so they would be numerically solved jointly unless the standard deviation is assumed to be constant in fact one can assume any type of the functions m t f t and σ t g t depending on the data sets however the most common one from the data set analysis point of view is the assumption of the linear dependence of the non stationary process on time 1 m t a t b σ t c t d where a b c and d are coefficients the wls being conceptually quite different from the maximum likelihood ml method coincides with the latter when the data series are normally distributed in such a case it is possible to render the wls as a problem of the ml estimation after introduction of the linear mt and σt the formula for the probability density function of the gaussian distribution becomes 2 ϕ x t 1 c t d 2 π e x p x t a t b 2 2 c t d 2 where xt is the time dependent random argument of the function when the distributions of data sets are non gaussian the trends may be estimated using the ml method with time t as the covariant strupczewski et al 2001a 2016 a detailed description of the wls algorithm is provided in appendix a if the data analysed reveal an explicit non linear trend e g parabolic periodic etc the wls method can be applied too provided the population is normally distributed however in such cases the number of parameters to be estimated usually rises according to the principle of parsimony the number of parameters should be kept as low as possible especially if the time series used for the estimation is short the statistical analyses of flood durations in particular research plots were performed by means of a one way analysis of variance anova as a main indicator of inundation duration within particular plant communities the fraction of inundation time fit index was calculated eq 3 3 f i t n d f 365 where ndf stands for the number of days when inundation occurred both for individual research plots and for the whole community fitcomm the latter was expressed as the arithmetic mean of the fit values for five research plots within the particular plant community analysed 3 results 3 1 general trends of flooded area changes in the lbb the basic statistical calculations revealed that the variability of the maximum flood extents are insignificant both in a longer perspective and when analysed year by year within the analysed period 1951 2011 the maximum annual flood extents ranged from ca 420 ha in the extremely dry year of 1969 up to 5245 ha in the wet year of 1979 fig 2 a the average annual flood extents ranged from 59 ha in 1969 to 2881 ha in 1979 and clearly disclose an increasing trend over the analysed period fig 2b the average maximum flood extent that occurred during the analysed period is equal to 4098 ha whereas the mean of the average flood extents equals 1392 ha fig 2c the histogram of the mean annual range of inundations fig 3 shows that the main mass of the frequency is locate within the centre of the diagram which suggests normal distribution of the data thick black line in the figure however the visual resemblance should not be considered sound proof of the normality of the distribution and additional tests should be carried out the shapiro wilk test with statistic w 0 98 and n 61 elements does not provide a sound rationale to reject the zero hypothesis about the normality of the sample at the α 0 05 level of confidence therefore the use of the wls method of trend detection in mean and standard deviation is justified the results of the wls calculations for the mean annual area of flooding are as follows eq 4 4 a 15 2 b 879 6 a b 1 7 s o m t 15 2 t 879 6 a n d c 0 14 d 536 4 c d 0 03 s o σ t 0 14 t 536 4 the slope a of the time dependent mean mt is equal to 15 2 which means that considering the random character of the floods the value of the flood area in the 61st year will have a 50 probability of being higher than 1800 ha however if the intersect parameter b as the mean value for time t 0 is considered then a b indicates how the mean value changes over time when compared with the initial mean value the ratio a b 1 7 so from the practical point of view the annual changes are rather negligible in other words the mean value of the mean annual inundation area changed little over the 61 years of measurements the c d ratio is even smaller c d 0 03 thus the variability of the mean annual inundation area is practically barely detectable over the 61 years of inundations and as such can be neglected hence the trends in both mean values and standard deviations in the measurements of the mean annual flooded areas are small and should not be considered the essential issues in water management planning in the river valley in light of the presented results we conclude that seasonal flood extents in the years analysed reveal some trend in mean but it is small enough to be considered a stable factor influencing the biodiversity of the lbb a closer look at the variability of the time series in fig 2b suggests a shift in average inundation area between 1970 and 1980 indeed pettitt s test suggests an abrupt change point in 1973 which divides the data into two more homogeneous periods 1951 1973 and 1974 2011 fig 2b in both periods the absolute values of trends in mean are small a b well below 1 but they differ in sign with a negative sign for the latter period thus in fact for this particular data we deal with two semi stationary periods on the other hand it is not advisable to perform statistical analysis on high flow data shorter than ca 40 years huh et al 2005 it is recommended to use the longest possible time series to create prediction models for the future so our analyses are based on all available data 3 2 flood duration the shapiro wilk normality test clearly indicates that for all but one site 44 phragmitetum communis data set the zero hypothesis about the normality of the samples cannot be rejected at the α 0 05 level of confidence table 3 further analysis of the data from site 44 revealed that according to the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the normal distribution is the most suitable for representing the site 44 data from among other distribution functions commonly used in statistical hydrology log normal gumbel pearson type 3 generalised extreme value generalised logistic and weibull therefore we applied the wls method of trend analysis for all 20 data sets the results of the wls estimation of trends in mean value generally show positive but minimal trends in all considered sites however the a b ratios revolving around 2 suggest little change in the mean value of the water time residence over the 61 years of measurement which can be regarded as a fairly stable condition for the plant communities analysed inferring from the results of the wls models of trends for the phenomena and assuming stability of water management scenarios one could project a negligibly longer time of water residence in the future rather than a water deficiency regarding the standard deviation the detected trend is either negative or positive however c 1 the c d ratios also suggest that the change in the water residence time was stable over the 61 years of measurements to conclude time of water residence revealed stability of the flood phenomena over 61 years 1951 2011 3 3 time of inundation in different plant communities the distributions of inundation time within the plant communities analysed present different patterns of variability and magnitudes fig 4 table 4 here we decided to use the chi square test which confirmed the normal distribution of modelled inundation durations in each of the research plots p 0 05 the homogeneity of variance of these data sets was confirmed by the levene test p 0 05 average durations of inundation with caricetum approprinquatae analysed in five different plots varied from 97 to 155 days fit values from 0 26 to 0 42 average fit 0 33 fig 4a table 4 the one way anova pointed at the inequity of inundation time f 15 39 p 0 05 on the other hand there are research plots namely 11 12 and 15 where the average inundation time does not differ significantly p 0 05 the differences in the inundation time between locations 13 and 14 are also undetectable at a statistically significant level of p 0 05 these results indicate that the plots located within the extents of caricetum appropinquatae present similar dynamics in terms of flood duration on the contrary the average inundation durations in five research plots located within the extent of caricetum gracilis vary between 96 and 198 days per year in locations 21 and 24 respectively fit values from 0 26 to 0 54 average fit 0 43 fig 4b table 4 here the one way anova denotes the lack of equity of the average inundation time f 20 54 p 0 05 in locations 22 and 23 average inundation durations are not significantly statistically different p 0 95 consequently no dissimilarities were detected between inundation durations in research plots 23 and 25 p 0 05 as well as 24 and 25 p 0 85 the average inundation durations between the other plots differ considerably the average inundation durations within the extent of glycerietum maximae varied from 135 plot 31 to 241 days plot 32 fit values from 0 36 to 0 66 average fit 0 49 fig 4c table 4 additionally in this case the one way anova suggests inequity in the average inundation time f 24 85 p 0 05 in locations 31 and 35 the average inundation durations do not differ much p 0 99 similarly no statistically significant differences were detected between inundation durations in plots 33 and 34 p 0 63 the differences between the average inundation durations in other plots are noticeable within the extent of phragmitetum communis the average inundation duration varies from 138 plot 45 to 249 days plot 44 fit values from 0 38 to 0 68 average fit 0 53 fig 4d table 4 the lack of equity of the average inundation time f 24 92 p 0 05 within the extent of this plant community was confirmed by the one way anova the average inundation durations in locations 41 and 45 are fairly similar p 0 25 correspondingly no statistically significant differences were detected between inundation durations in plots 41 and 43 p 0 91 and in plots 42 and 44 p 0 79 the differences in the average inundation durations between other plots are noticeable and cannot be neglected averaged annual inundation durations in the analysed plant communities represented by the indicator fitcomm ranged from 0 33 to 0 53 representing that duration of inundation varied from 121 to 193 days among them the longest flooded species seems to be phragmitetum communis inundated for more than six months a year and the shortest inundations were recorded within the range of caricetum appropinquatae four months under water the chi square test confirms the accordance of inundation durations with the gaussian distribution p 0 05 as no homogeneity of the variances was detected levene test p 0 05 the anova was carried out using the welch s f test that gave the value p 0 05 pointing to significant differences in inundation duration in different plant communities statistically significant differences between the inundation durations within glycerietum maximae and phragmitetum communis were not noticed p 0 075 which allows us to hypothesise that in the examined reference it is not the flow duration in the near natural riparian ecosystem that differentiates the habitat conditions between these two plant communities 4 discussion the internal variabilities of the fit within particular plant communities are rather vast and located between ca 0 49 of the averaged fit for the community fitcomm within the extent of caricetum appropinquatae and 0 56 within the extent of phragmitetum communis this observation suggests that variability tolerance of particular well established riparian plant communities although exposed to large fit variability can tolerate a relatively broad range of hydrological conditions this information is of high importance for wetland managers to establish optimal hydrological conditions for plant development moreover within the analysed period there were no visible trends in either flood extents or inundation durations amongst four dominant and typical temperate floodplain plant communities although some of the former results suggested significant trends in earlier occurrence of thaw floods the indicators analysed in our study do not disclose any statistically significant temporal or spatial patterns this is because of the recent increase of air temperatures and consequently the increase of potential evapotranspiration followed by some shifts in vegetation into drier communities berezowski et al 2018 grygoruk et al 2014 unlike reihan et al 2012 who analysed discharge data from 70 stations in the baltic states and wrote that maximum discharges of spring floods decreased in the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century we cannot confirm these tendencies in the reach of the river we analysed despite its location in geographically similar conditions our results corroborate that the water and habitat behaviour within the biebrza valley and most likely similar temperate riparian ecosystems in central europe tend to depend on local water management policy rather than on general climatic conditions affecting the hydrological cycle and flood pulse in particular all the negative effects of the flood control policy in this case might be magnified by the inappropriate water management in the lake systems located in the upstream fragments of the biebrza catchment similarly a more negative influence on lbb floodplain hydrology rather than the climatic features can result from the ongoing incision of the riverbed of narew of which biebrza is the tributary which would lower the elevation of the drainage base of the biebrza river most likely resulting in shortening the duration and frequency of floods in the biebrza valley as far as the regional scale is concerned it has been already proven marcinkowski and grygoruk 2017 that the inappropriate water management measures adversely affect spring flood durations and frequencies and are likely to be responsible for shifts in vegetation from carex dominated riparian habitats to the phragmites alliances próchnicki 2005 similarly the observed negative changes of wetland habitat conditions in the lbb are liable to result from harmful ecosystem management measures such as the use of heavy track mowers on microtopography banaszuk et al 2016 kotowski et al 2013 or inappropriate spontaneous adaptation to climatic change by individual stakeholders uncontrolled and unmanaged draining of mires immediately after a flood grygoruk and rannow 2017 this observation is in accordance with studies on the trade offs of wetland management and climate change ross et al 2019 bearing in mind the importance of the flood pulse for the persistence of floodplain lakes and status of their ecosystems our results show that the evolution of the biebrza river channel and associated oxbows słapińska et al 2016 is an example of the morphogenetic process which was not affected by the climate related impacts in the analysed period similarly we also suspect that the biogeochemical processes i e deposition of particulate matter in the floodplain habitats within the selected analysed plant communities located in the near vicinity of the biebrza river keizer et al 2016 most likely have not been triggered by climate change the indicators in our research namely the flood durations and extents can serve as tools in the decision making process of managing temperate riparian wetlands that have either been created or restored researchers often search for hydrological parameters that could be considered a management goal asking for water levels that should be assured and maintained in re created or restored wetlands bendoricchio et al 2000 coole and brooks 2000 song et al 2010 regarding hydrological criteria to be fulfilled when seeking to establish wetland buffer zones jabłońska et al 2020 provided multi year fit values along with the values of σ for both individual research locations and whole communities analysed table 4 may remain scratch values that could be aimed at when setting the management goals for newly established or restored temperate riparian vegetation communities beyond the botanical perspective defined high stability and no significant trends in flooding can be considered important factors making lbb a relevant and constant from a hydrological perspective stopover site for migratory birds related to wetlands budka et al 2019 maciorowski et al 2014 polakowski et al 2018 considering the extreme hydrological events that occurred in the last few years namely severe and long droughts in 2015 and 2019 and heavy rainfalls e g in july 2016 it is advisable to analyse the influence of these particular phenomena on trends and statistical differences of flood recurrences and extents on a regional scale none of the studies referring to the recurrence and volumes of flooding in lowland systems of the region akstinas et al 2019 berezowski et al 2018 grygoruk et al 2014 reihan et al 2012 stonevičius et al 2018 analysed these most up to date data that might have influenced the steep decline of water resources in the region including flood extents and durations note that our modelling results especially the analysis of trends and trend directions cannot be extrapolated behind the modelling period faulkner et al 2020 most of the predictions indicate that in short until 2025 and long term until 2050 horizons riparian wetlands will be affected by climatic change schneider et al 2011 mirosław świątek et al 2020 that dramatically modifies their status and alters the natural services they provide okruszko et al 2011 the short term scenarios will soon be verified by new data from river discharge monitoring based on the analysis provided in our study one can conclude that in lbb neither the increasing nor decreasing long term trends in flooding occurred in the analysed period 5 conclusions the analyses based on a 61 year series 1951 2011 of flood extent modelling did not reveal any significant trends the flood durations and extents in the near natural river valley did not present any significant trends although a visible trend in average flooded areas can be distinguished it is not statistically significant fig 2b two contradictive trends detected for years 1951 1973 increasing and 1974 2011 decreasing also do not allow us to confirm any relevant and significant ongoing changes in the flooding regime of the lbb the fit values within the extents of plant communities ranged between 0 33 and 0 53 for the average year giving the long term constant inundation durations ranging from 121 to 193 days and being dependent mostly on meteorological conditions the shortest modelled inundations were determined for caricetum appropinquatae whereas the longest was for phragmitetum communis the internal variability of the modelled flood durations within the particular plant communities was relatively high which led us to the conclusion that well established temperate riparian habitats present high resilience to hydrological variability and can withstand severe droughts and long lasting floods in light of the presented results we infer that persistence evolution or degradation of temperate riparian ecosystems similar to the analysed lbb is related to the appropriate management measures both on the local scale habitat management and on the catchment scale water regime control authors statement mateusz grygoruk conceptualization investigation formal

8191,study region a coupled framework linking subsurface flow and surface hydrodynamics is developed and applied to a real world case study of pingtung coastal aquifer in southwest of taiwan in east asia study focus feflow is adopted to develop a 3 d variable density and transient groundwater model of the pingtung shallow aquifer lying 250 m below mean sea level msl this model is coupled with a 1 d river network model comprised of the main river and its two tributaries using mike 11 through the ifm mike 11 coupling interface the model is capable of analysing the relationship between rainfall surface water and groundwater recharge lag time also the analysis of potential river inundation and maximum river discharge enable the model to choose the best location to apply artificial recharge as a management scenario to mitigate the effect of seawater intrusion swi to the authors knowledge the developed coupled model is the first detailed integrated framework analysing the interaction of surface and subsurface water with the capability to contribute to the restoration rehabilitation and management of the river network new hydrological insights for the region the rainfall ratio in the wet season to dry season is significant in this plain comparing with the rest of taiwan also southern taiwan experiences the largest sea and river interaction while kaoping river playing as a pathway role for inland lead of seawater intrusion keywords coupled model groundwater surface water swi feflow taiwan 1 introduction in recent decades there has been significant spatial and temporal instability in hydrological conditions due to climate change simonovic and li 2003 increasing the vulnerability of water resources chang et al 2011 groundwater plays a vital role in providing stable regional water resources tsur 1990 fresh groundwater in coastal aquifers is vulnerable to salinization by upconing and seawater intrusion post 2005 an integrated framework considering surface and subsurface water as a single resource is essential for improving the reliability of water supply sophocleous 2002 montazar et al 2010 numerical models can be used to investigate the behaviour of surface subsurface water systems in coastal areas for different climate change scenarios yang et al 2015 surface water and groundwater are inseparable elements in a hydrological system from climatic and physiographic viewpoints they interact in different ways such that e g contamination of one directly affects the other winter 1998 studies in catchment scale have illustrated the relative connection between surface and subsurface water resources for example there is clear relationship between the availability of water and the effect of groundwater over abstraction on rivers or seepage of contaminants from rivers towards groundwater shaad 2015 integrated water resource management is one of the cornerstones of the global water framework rahaman et al 2004 increasing the demand for modelling tools and methodologies to investigate integrated fully dynamic surface subsurface models at the catchment scale numerical modelling of aquifer stream interactions has become an imperative tool for management of water resources for example the coupled models can be used to evaluate the performance of infiltration wells in cutting off the runoff of extreme rainfall and attenuating flood peaks sommer et al 2009 the groundwater can interact with streams in three ways inflow of groundwater through the streambed outflow of groundwater along the streambed or both losing and gaining stream in some stream reaches irvine et al 2012 storey et al 2003 also abstraction of groundwater can cause local exchange of water between streams and adjacent shallow aquifers sophocleous 2002 brunner et al 2011 several factors control the groundwater and surface water interaction in a large scale landscape these include the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in both alluvial plain sediments and channel the relationship between groundwater level and adjacent stream stage and the position and geometry of the stream channel located in the alluvial plain woessner 2000 the direction of surface and subsurface water exchange is variable and is influenced by changes in hydraulic head due to the seasonal pattern and climate change scibek et al 2007 the exchange flow between stream and aquifer is a function of the water head difference between aquifer and river stage in this study an integrated 3 d groundwater model and 1 d river model was developed for coupled transient analysis of groundwater flow river flow and river inundation considering the interactions between surface water and groundwater although there are some coupled models simulating the flow exchange between surface and subsurface water to the authors knowledge this is the first numerical model that also simulates the effects of rainfall occurrence and duration on groundwater surface water interaction lag time the developed model is also used to select appropriate locations and sources for applying recharge wells in coastal aquifer based on resulted river discharge and inundation the model is validated against experimental results and applied to study the interaction between the kaoping river and the sea with the aquifer system in southern taiwan wang et al 2009 this model is capable of computing the monthly variation of salinity amount and the exchange of mass flux in the mixing zone this is the first numerical model for simulating the changes in salinity of the mixing zone for this specific region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area pingtung plain with an area of 1210 km2 is approximately 20 km wide from east to west and 60 km long from north to south and is located in the southwest of taiwan the plain is bounded by foothills and river valleys in the north low hills along the west a mountain range extending along the east and the taiwan strait along the southern boundary dibaj et al 2020 the mountainous regions surrounding the plain are consisted of black slate embedded with sandstone in western part of mountain range shale and sandstone in north and sand stone with sandy shale in north west the black slate with very low water bearing texture and low porosity causes high rate of run off consequently water is stored only in local joints and cleavages ting et al 1998a these characteristics of the plain turn most of the precipitation to surface run off and flow towards the streams and rivers tu et al 2011 the elevation of the plain is less than 100 m above mean sea level msl and it is a relatively flat area drained by three major rivers the kaoping donggang and linbian these rivers divide the plain into three areas of proximal fan mid fan and distal fan dibaj et al 2020 hsu et al 2007 see fig 1 these rivers make a regular discharge base for the regional groundwater in this basin the 171 km long kaoping river covers a catchment area of about 3257 km2 and is the second longest river in taiwan originating from yushan mountain and wandering south westward receiving the streamflow of four main tributaries laonong river cishan river i lio river zhuokou river before discharging into the taiwan strait wang et al 2009 the laonong and zhuokou rivers are out of study domain area and not included in fig 1 capart et al 2010 the estuary of kaoping river has the largest sea and river interaction in southern taiwan wang et al 2009 the entire aquifer underlying the plain is formed by unconsolidated sediments the direct penetration of rainfall due to the unconsolidated sediments through the foothills along the north and east of plain is the principle mechanism for the groundwater recharge furthermore the river seepage in the higher areas of the plain is another source for groundwater recharge chang et al 2004 the rivers in taiwan possess huge sediment discharge compared to major rivers of the world liu et al 2008 hung et al 2004 this is mainly because of the general characteristics of rivers in this country with a short length small basin area steep gradient and brittle geology wang et al 2009 the upper and middle stream of kaoping river flows through mainly sandstone shale and metamorphic rocks while the downstream portion is mostly formed by recent alluvium deposits according to the several stratigraphic units exposed in its drainage basin wang et al 2009 yang 2001 the cishan river watershed has an area of 842 km2 with 118 km river length chiang and liu 2013 chen et al 2011 the upstream of the watershed is composed of sand and shale and the mid and downstream are composed of gravel and sand the i lio river watershed has an area of about 642 km2 and a river length of 68 5 km yeh and chang 2019 and its watershed is composed of gravel and sand with high permeability the tortuous up and mid stream has good potential for subsurface flow development lee and wang 2011 according to the literature groundwater aquifers supply almost 60 of tap water demand in taiwan highlighting the importance of this water resource for this country liang et al 2019 pingtung alluvial plain is one of the major agricultural and aquacultural production regions in taiwan yu and lin 2015 about 50 5 of the pingtung plain land is used for agricultural activities and 5 5 for aquaculture liang et al 2020 pingtung plain aquifer is the second largest aquifer in taiwan playing a primary role in supplying the major water resources for over 50 of population in pingtung county as well as neighbouring areas yu and lin 2015 while surface water only supplies 20 of water resource demand in the plain lin et al 2011 this highlights the dependency of this plain on groundwater resources a recent study showed that every year approximately 25 million tons of groundwater is abstracted of which 63 8 and 29 is used for agriculture aquaculture and other demands respectively liang et al 2020 the permeability of the soil decreases from north east to south west the proximal fan is mainly comprised of gravel and sand 20 sand and 60 gravel with storage factor of 6 5 10 3 and a transmissivity of about 9000 m2 day hsieh et al 2010 it is followed by finer grain size in the mid fan zone in the centre of the plain 40 gravel and 40 sand with a 9 5 10 4 storage factor and 2300 m2 day transmissivity reaching the distal fan in the south west that is comprised of silt and clay with 0 00005 storage factor and 1200 m2 day transmissivity dibaj et al 2020 the indicated storage factor values used by previous studies were only monitored for the top aquifer and not defined for other layers due to the lack of data the default value of this parameter in feflow was applied with 0 0001 m 1 as specific storage s s for whole aquifer system the precipitation distribution in pingtung is closely related to the monsoon consequently increasing with a rise in topographical elevation fan and hsieh 2010 hsu and guo 2005 forming a higher precipitation rate along the north and north east of the plain the location of the i lio river watershed in the north east of the domain gives it the potential to have a maximum average annual precipitation varying between 3400 and 5000 mm this rate decreases to the range of 3000 3400 mm and a maximum of 3000 mm in the cishan river watershed and along the kaoping river respectively lin et al 2011 most of the rainfall occurs due to regular thunderstorms and typhoons over the wet season may october with a little rain over the dry season november march dibaj et al 2020 the temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven such that the precipitation in the wet season is 9 times higher than in the dry season hsu et al 2007 the summer season may to october has the highest precipitation concentration in the kaoping river basin while the rest of the year is almost dry due to prevailing winds along the northwest of the plain chu 2012 accumulation of discharge from june to september forms about 78 of the total annual discharge occurring in the kaoping river the average annual water discharge in this river has been reported as 6 33 10 6 m3 per year based on the observations from 1999 to 2004 wang et al 2009 2 2 development of the numerical model 2 2 1 finite element modelling a three dimensional variable density finite element groundwater model of pingtung s multilayer aquifer system was developed including its three aquifers and two aquitards dibaj et al 2020 huang and chiu 2018 the groundwater was abstracted from 25 pumping wells and monitored through 95 observation wells over the period from 2011 to 2015 groundwater level gwl stations for top aquifer are shown in fig 1 first the 2d domain of the plain was generated as a polygon shapefile captured by arcgis and then three river polylines and 25 pumping well points were added in the feflow finite element subsurface flow software dibaj et al 2020 trefry and muffels 2007a the mesh generation was performed as an intermediate stage representing inner and outer geometries a triangular prism mesh was used to discretise the domain this type of mesh has the capability to discretise irregular geometries including complex polygons or polylines with narrow sections along their boundaries variable layer thickness and well fields or coastlines dibaj et al 2020 dhi wasy 2010 it also allows a minimum angle for all finite elements as well as providing the means for local mesh refinement with maximum element size the finite element mesh design was implemented with a special attention to minimise the distorted elements through application of local mesh refinement in the coastal area polygon domain pumping well points and river polylines the local mesh refinement and mesh smoothing would allow to build a higher mesh quality than later elemental subdivisions to eliminate the difficulties arising from highly distorted elements in the transport simulation the peclet criterion was calculated and updated at each time step for determining the required mesh density during simulation trefry and muffels 2007a the available elevation x y z data from 95 observation wells were used for extending the 2d model into a 3d multilayer aquifer system dibaj et al 2020 the nearest neighbour interpolation method was used for allocating the elevation to the adjacent node or batch of nodes adjoining the original locations of the observation wells the aquifer with six layers and seven slices was achieved after the interpolation vertical mesh disorders were prevented by discretising each layer into sub layers leaving the model with 42 layers dibaj et al 2020 see fig 2 b the model includes 39 221 elements per layer and 20 352 nodes per slice the elevation of the model surface varies between 2 3 m and 89 m above the msl with the top layer having a depth of 10 16 m this layer overlies the top aquifer with 10 121 m thickness a semi pervious layer with 10 81 m depth is located beneath the first aquifer as the first aquitard overlying the middle aquifer with 10 96 m thickness this second aquifer overlies the second aquitard with 10 63 m depth and the bottom aquifer with 10 103 m depth the base of the bottom aquifer reaches to around 197 m below msl once the multilayer aquifer system with dedicated mesh generation and model dimensions were set up its properties were then asigned as an unconfined free surface fully saturated water table modelling approach with moveable variable mesh therefore the mesh can be adapted to the groundwater level variation and all unsaturated or variably saturated parts can be excluded from the model avoiding the dry cell problem in the mass transport cases the dry cells can also freeze the solute and make it unable to transfer through the water table yielding an incorrect model all the slices below the free surface were set as dependent except for the bottom slice which should always be fixed the dependent slices underlying the free surface are able to move if necessary the layers located under confined layers regardless of the hydraulic head being below or above the layer were treated as fully saturated during the entire simulation this is also in good agreement with previous studies in this region based on the available soil permeability and precipitation data huang and chiu 2018 dibaj et al 2020 the unconfined layer was given a default residual water depth of 0 01 m to avoid any dry cells in top slice during simulation the precipitation was monitored daily at 24 rainfall stations in different locations of the plain over a period of 5 years from 1st january 2011 to 31st december 2015 based on taiwan s water resource bureau moea the average monthly rainfall distribution data assuming 60 run off and evaporation moea were applied to the top layer of the model as a spatial inflow using the delogarithmic kriging interpolation method dibaj et al 2020 an automatic time step control technique based on a predictor corrector scheme was selected for time discretisation by choosing an appropriate length for time step in line with the changing of the groundwater head variations between the time steps trefry and muffels 2007a this feature of feflow among others persuaded the present study to choose this software for its detailed simulation using automatic and flexible time stepping techniques although this model could also be developed using physical based models such as wash123d yeh et al 2006 it may not have the high capabilities of feflow for example wash123d is also capable of simulating 3d subsurface flow models coupled with surface flows but in wash123d the time step size for both domains should be fixed and cannot change during simulation besides it has limitations for local mesh refinement that may result in simulations being computationally expensive england et al 2006 feflow applies default second order accurate semi implicit forward adams bashforth backward trapezoid rule ab tr for the flow and transport models the details of average monitored rainfall data can be found in our recent study as well as the sensitivity of the inland encroachment distance of seawater due to 30 increase and decrease in rainfall which has been analysed as well dibaj et al 2020 the results showed the model was much more under influence of pumping rate the groundwater hydraulic head was monitored via 95 observation wells in different layers of the aquifer on a monthly basis over the same period of time the data for the first month january 2011 were applied as the initial head in the model using the delogarithmic inverse distance interpolation method for each layer of the model due to lack of data for the abstraction rates the depths of the wells and their exact locations in the plain the model used the pumping rates of the year 1996 the only available data for 25 townships of the plain as multilayer pumping wells screened at the entire depth of the aquifer system as input transient pumping data over the simulation period detailed information about townships with their allocated pumping rates in pingtung plain is available in a recent study dibaj et al 2020 based on the available data moea the hydraulic conductivity was measured only in the horizontal direction k x k y in different layers of the aquifer ranging from 1 to 520 m day 5 to 90 m day and 1 to 100 m day in the top middle and bottom aquifer respectively considering the leading directions of the axis parallel anisotropic hydraulic conductivity in coincident with cartesian coordinates k x k y k z along the x y and z axes dibaj et al 2020 yields the following relationship k x k y 10 k z as an initial model set up for each aquifer in the model using the kriging logarithmic interpolation method for spatial distribution in the 3d model a constant value of 0 0001 m day was assigned as the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitards dibaj et al 2020 an automatic time stepping method with a predictor corrector scheme and initial time step of 0 001 day was selected for the simulation dibaj et al 2020 hydraulic conductivity along x y and z axes was considered for calibration due to the sensitivity of the model to this parameter and its significance for natural groundwater recharge from precipitation the southern border the coastal line was assigned first type dirichlet head and mass concentration seawater salt concentration is 35 000 mg l boundary conditions and the remaining borders were considered as no fluid flux boundary due to the low permeability soil and faults with impervious bedrocks surrounding the plain from north east and west dibaj et al 2020 ting et al 1998a the only contaminant was salt and the adsorption was assumed negligible dibaj et al 2020 the groundwater flows westward into kaoping and donggang rivers and south westward into the taiwan strait detail of the boundary conditions governing equations and the parameter definitions can be found in our pervious study dibaj et al 2020 the model was simulated in steady state and then transient conditions the initial salinity data were obtained through a steady state analysis of the model due to the lack of data the results showed that the entire depth of the aquifer system was intruded with seawater while from the plain view the middle and west of the plain were affected in greater areas than the east which is in good agreement with the previous studies huang and chiu 2018 dibaj et al 2020 in this study the molecular diffusivity is assumed as zero the hydrodynamic dispersion is considered as a function of velocity and dispersivity is assumed to be larger in the flow direction than vertical and lateral directions ogata 1970 voss 1984 feflow approximates the longitudinal dispersivity based on the mean elemental size in a way that a good convergence is also guaranteed trefry and muffels 2007a the longitudinal dispersivity varies between 6 and 150 m for most of studies gelhar et al 1992 sherif et al 2012 in this study the mean elemental dimension was 70 m which was set as longitudinal dispersivity the transverse dispersivity was selected as 10 percent of this value based on the literature and feflow parameter definition huang and chiu 2018 sherif et al 2012 bear et al 1999 according to the literature this model also set the value of the horizontal transverse dispersivity the same as longitudinal dispersivity huang and chiu 2018 dibaj et al 2020 the model convergence and accuracy of meshing were monitored based on maximum interior angle of triangles which was as regular as possible with the mean angle of 124 4 degree for the entire model also the numerical stability of advection dispersion transport process was investigated based on peclet number with value less than 2 along the shoreline boundary trefry and muffels 2007a 2 2 2 surface water model development mike 11 is an advanced hydroinformatics engineering software with the capability of simulating 1d flow in rivers estuaries channels irrigation systems and other water bodies mike 11 solves the saint venant equations using a finite difference scheme madsen et al 2003 kamel 2008 and can reflect fully dynamic diffusive or kinematic conditions some assumptions are involved in the solution of these equations firstly assuming water as homogeneous and incompressible leads to neglecting density variations secondly if the water depth is smaller than the wave length then the flow is assumed to be parallel everywhere to the bottom level leading to vertical acceleration being ignored and assuming that the hydrostatic pressure varies vertically finally the flow is assumed to be sub critical because of restrictions associated with applying super critical flow models kamel 2008 thompson et al 2004 the river data were implemented and edited separately with different editors and linked together via the simulation editor the kaoping cishan and i lio rivers were developed using point digitisation in mike 11 network see fig 2 c the river centre points hpoints were achieved using the centre of the right and left banks of each cross section data using their x and y coordinates this network was comprised of 146 centre points the distance between each point from the nearest point represents the chainage which was calculated automatically starting with 0 km in the furthest upstream part and increasing towards the downstream of the river the kaoping river cishan river and i lio river stretch from chainage 0 49120 m 0 10793 m and 0 11785 m respectively see fig 2 c from the collected data moea the water level hydrological stations w l in fig 1 streamflow and rainfall data that were monitored from 1st january 2011 to 31st december 2015 were used as input data for surface water simulation in mike 11 the streamflow was monitored in five stations namely shanlin bridge lilin bridge wannta bridge da jin bridge and liouguei bridge see fig 1 the water levels measured at 22 stations with only two of them located at i lio river upstream and kaoping river downstream were applied as open end river boundary conditions the monitored water levels in qishan bridge lilin bridge gaobing bridge and wannta bridge see fig 1 were used for calibration and validation of the model the daily time series of river water level and streamflow starting from 1st january 2011 and ending on 31st december 2015 were applied for kaoping downstream and upstream respectively both upstream and downstream of cishan river were assigned as daily streamflow time series boundary conditions but as the downstream of cishan river was discharging into the kaoping river and was not an open end boundary hence a lateral discharge was assigned as a point source at this location the water level time series was applied for the upstream of the i lio river the rivers were assumed to be freshwater and assigned with a constant 0 mg l as the initial salinity over the simulation time the model did not simulate the saline river intruding into groundwater but only mass transports from groundwater to river water the raw cross sectional data x z based on the distance from the far left side and elevation from datum were applied for each river centre point representing the river profile then the model used the raw data to calculate cross sectional area level hydraulic radius and hydraulic resistance as processed data see fig 2c d the steady state of the river profile was computed automatically at the dedicated start time by using the given boundary conditions via the simulation editor the actual cross section data river nodes hpoints gave the head values h due to processed data level cross sectional area hydraulic radius and flow width and the q flow values were simulated through the manning equation assuming uniform or critical flow this study assumed uniform flow using the following equation thompson et al 2004 panda et al 2010 mike 2003 1 q h 1 n a h r h 2 3 s where q h is the discharge amount m3 s depending on the water depth h m calculated in the processed cross section data the bed slope is represented by s while a h m2 is the level relevant to the area resulting from the cross section processed data r is the hydraulic radius m and the manning roughness coefficient n s m 1 3 represents the resistance of the river bed 2 2 3 coupling of the groundwater and surface water models the coupling of mike 11 and feflow was not an iterative process and each time step was only calculated once by either feflow or mike 11 for defining the actual water levels in coupled boundary nodes feflow took mike 11 s water levels at the end of the last time step feflow calculated the exchange fluxes q of each single boundary condition third type cauchy between the surface and groundwater separately using the transfer coefficient ɸh 1 d as the main element for controlling this flux monninkhoff and hartnack 2009a 2 q ɸ h h r e f h g w where q is the darcy flux m d of fluid positive flow is towards the groundwater and hgw and href represent the groundwater and river heads m respectively the river was laterally coupled to the top two slices of the feflow model which is illustrated in supplementary material as data 1 the total discharge at each node q m3 d was calculated through multiplication of the flux q at every single finite element boundary node by the related exchange area in m2 at the end of each time step in feflow the obtained values budgets were transferred to the hpoints of mike 11 as single point source inflow lateral boundary condition monninkhoff and hartnack 2009b mike 11 calculated as many as internal time steps as required to reach the actual time of feflow transferring the resultant water level in the final feflow time step from hpoints of mike 11 to the boundary nodes of feflow was the last stage of the coupling process monninkhoff and hartnack 2009a an interface controlled the internal time steps of mike 11 which could be either constant or fit to the model s dynamic on the other hand feflow controlled the groundwater time steps in which ifm mike 11 automatically integrated the spatial overlay of both meshes every node of the feflow boundary was assigned to the adjacent hpoint of the mike 11 therefore the possibility of assigning one hpoint to more than one boundary node in feflow could be increased coupling of mass transport between mike 11 and feflow is a straightforward process and once a time step is completed by feflow it is passed to mike 11 to exchange the values taking a time step in turn for each coupling point feflow must pass the values of flow m3 s and mass flux g s of each chemical species inflow into river every time a mike 11 time step is calculated in return mike 11 passes the water level concentration mg l and mass flux g s of each chemical species outflow of a river at the hpoints the flow boundary nodes where the flow has been coupled are automatically used for mass boundary node generation by feflow to prevent overshooting a lumped mass matrix was selected in feflow trefry and muffels 2007b the river boundaries were assigned with the first kind dirichlet mass transport boundary condition in convective form due to its high degree of stability especially along outflow boundaries 2 3 calibration and validation of the model providing reliable information on different features of real situation requires a well stablished calibration of hydraulic model the manning roughness coefficient was subjected to calibration to be adjusted for achieving the least possible gap between measured and computed water levels for this purpose the uniform values of this parameter ranging between 0 031 and 0 039 m 1 3s were specified through the river network system these values were selected based on the flow of the river through the alluvium deposit arcement and schneider 1989 the observed water levels in qishan bridge lilin bridge gaoping bridge and wannta bridge see fig 1 were used for comparison with the corresponding simulated values in these locations during the calibration period of 1st january to 31st december 2011 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient r2 was used to assess model performance for each station asce task committee on definition of criteria for evaluation of watershed models of the watershed management committee i and d division 1993 the daily calibration results for the first year of the simulation period are presented in fig 3 based on the available data the qishan station monitoring water levels at cishan river upstream showed a maximum of 39 m over may to june by using manning numbers of 0 039 0 037 and 0 035 m 1 3s the maximum water levels were over predicted as 44 43 and 42 m respectively on the other hand the computed water levels using manning numbers 0 031 and 0 033 m 1 3s were underestimated by 2 and 1 m maximum of 37 and 38 m respectively lilin station monitoring the water levels of the cishan river in its downstream indicated a maximum amount of 26 m in august and september and a minimum of 23 m from january to april the computed water levels using manning numbers 0 031 and 0 033 m 1 3s were underestimated reaching a minimum of 19 m and maximum of 21 m during the same periods an overestimation of about 1 4 and 7 m 24 27 and 30 m was yielded due to manning coefficients 0 035 0 037 and 0 039 m 1 3s respectively the observed water levels at gaoping station showed its minimum level fluctuating between 8 and 9 m during january to may rising to above 9 m until the end of july and reaching its peak value of over 11 m in august and september it then followed a decreasing trend from october to december varying between 9 and 10 m among the computed levels all of their peak values determined in august and september were slightly below 12 m however the computed values with manning numbers 0 031 and 0 033 m 1 3s underestimated the water level during other months except the peak times applying uniform manning roughness of 0 035 m 1 3s provided rather better estimation compared to other values the last stage of calibration was accomplished at wannta station where the observed water levels from january to mid july fluctuated between 4 and 5 m rising by up to 1 5 m from august to early november and jumping to the maximum level of about 7 5 m by the end of november therefore the manning factor of 0 035 m 1 3s was applied to all rivers within the pingtung plain the r2 values for each simulation are provided in fig 4 with their overall average values a reliable steady state solution is a primary need for simulation of flow and solute transport problems to achieve a stable condition both river and groundwater head and mass boundary conditions were kept unchanged over time using a time stepping method with time step length of 0 001 day voss 1984 diersch and kolditz 1998 to simulate the initial transient model the model reached a steady condition using a predictor corrector scheme over a long time of 8395 days which was not unexpected for such a large scale numerical model due to the lack of observed mass concentration data the resulting salinity values obtained as the output of the steady state simulation were applied as input mass data for the transient model after checking their validity with previous studies the results indicated kaoping river mouth and estuary as the origin of inland encroachment of seawater following its passage into the aquifer system and horizontal and vertical expansion in all layers of the aquifer system at different rates this was in good agreement with previous studies showing the middle and left sides of the domain as being more vulnerable to seawater intrusion compared to the right side dibaj et al 2020 huang and chiu 2018 ellis 1999 jang et al 2016 also the top aquifer showed more intrusion than the bottom one and the second aquifer was less intruded which was in good agreement with the permeability distribution in different layers of the aquifer system hsieh et al 2010 one of the limitations of using fepest calibration software is its inability to calibrate the coupled models at the same time to overcome this issue the ifm mike 11 interface was deactivated during calibration and the effect of the rivers and their boundary conditions were applied into the feflow model in the form of cauchy head and dirichlet mass boundary conditions the hydraulic conductivities of the three aquifers were selected for adjustment in calibration using fepest software doherty and hunt 2010 the entire calibration process was set up the same as the previous study dibaj et al 2020 and accomplished for the year 2011 against all observed hydraulic heads in this process the hydraulic conductivity along x y and z axes in each aquifer was considered as adjustable parameter with the assumption k x k y 10 k z based on the observed permeability data moea in each aquifer k x and k y were bounded between 0 1 and 600 m day and kz could range between 0 01 and 100 m day as lower and upper bounds details of the observed permeability data can be found in dibaj et al 2020 both k y and k z were tied to the change of k x during calibration using the kriging interpolation method for 50 random pilot points the calibrated values for each aquifer are illustrated in the supplementary material as data 2 the scatter plot comparing the observed and computed hydraulic heads is illustrated in fig 5 using root mean square rms for all 95 observation wells the hydraulic heads were calibrated with rms of 0 987 m as the best fit with less than 1 m deviation between the observed and computed heads see fig 5a the mike 11 river model was run over the period of 1st january 2012 to 31st december 2015 using a uniform manning coefficient of 0 035 m 1 3s based on the output of calibration in this case the observed and computed results were compared in the four stations of qishan lilin gaoping and wannta the values of r2 had an overall minimum value of 0 68 and maximum of 0 86 at the lilin and gaoping stations respectively most of the observed peak values were also predicted by the developed computational model see fig 4 this model was coupled to the transient groundwater model for the same time period 1st january 2012 to 31st december 2015 employing the resulting mass concentration at the end of 2011 the time variable monthly hydraulic head of january 2012 as initial head calibrated conductivities and monthly precipitation data over 2012 2015 the southern boundary of the domain was assigned first type constant head dirichlet and mass concentration as well as no fluid flux condition bounding the north east and west of the plain as with the previous study dibaj et al 2020 the model was validated using a scatter plot of computed against observed hydraulic heads with rms of 3 012 m at the end of the simulation period see fig 5b 3 results and discussion 3 1 river precipitation groundwater interaction generally the interactions between groundwater and precipitation are represented by large scale procedures depending on landscape geometry and spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity gurdak et al 2007 the interactions can generally vary with time under influence of soil saturation conditions resulting in non linear relationships between groundwater level and rainfall time series yu and lin 2015 the precipitation distribution is the main parameter affecting availability of groundwater resources in pingtung plain while the soil permeability plays an important role in the recharging pattern hsu et al 2007 hsieh et al 2010 the proximal fan extending along east and north east of the domain compromised by sand and gravel has high potential for recharge and infiltration by river flow and precipitation hsieh et al 2010 the main focus of this study is to investigate the interaction between river network and underlying groundwater under influence of the rainfall this interaction is mainly due to the water level differences between river and groundwater which is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the interaction point hpoint this will help to estimate the surface water groundwater interaction and the mass exchange and water flux in the river network and and its adjacent nodes the rigours calibration and validation of this model in a previous study dibaj et al 2020 showed that hydraulic conductivity is the main parameter for groundwater recharge and its lag time to rainfall the simulated groundwater sim gw and river water sim river stage levels interacting with each other based on the average monthly rainfall rate are presented at six selected river hpoints during the simulation period see fig 6 the exchange flux qfe see fig 7 shows groundwater discharge gaining stream as positive and groundwater recharge losing stream as negative flow the duration and amount of rainfall are effective parameters in the interaction of the groundwater and rivers although the groundwater recharge generally lagged by one to two months after peak rainfall this period varied in different areas of the plain from the simulated results the hpoints located at the proximal fan like kaoping river upstream and i lio river showed two to three months delay in the groundwater level s reaction to the occurrence of peak rainfall see fig 6a b which was in good agreement with the literature yu and lin 2015 considering the river bed as a reference interaction point the groundwater head was always lower than the river level but it reached to bed level or higher during september and october the groundwater fluctuated between its minimum and maximum levels with up to 20 and 15 m deviation at kaoping upstream and i lio river respectively see fig 6a b the precipitation river stage and groundwater head in the proximal fan showed highest interannual variation over the simulation time reaching their maximum level in the summer of 2012 while 2013 and 2014 experienced typical flow conditions 2015 showed a lower level of groundwater and river stage due to lower average precipitation groundwater had its lowest level from march to april and reached its maximum level during september and october after the recharge period between june and august in 2012 the lag time of groundwater recharge was the shortest leading to a fast up to one month reaction to the peak rainfall typhoon the interaction of the river and groundwater increased by rising groundwater level during recharge time and was at its maximum level over september to october the flux exchange in the upstream of the kaoping river reached its peak value by around 0 5 0 5 m3 s in june and august of 2012 respectively by discharging of the river into the underlying groundwater and vice versa see fig 7a this amount was not significant compared to the abstraction rate at least 20 times less than abstraction at the pumping wells adjacent to the hpoints dibaj et al 2020 it can be said that the groundwater was highly under the influence of precipitation and abstraction leading to its fluctuation and interaction with the river water i lio river showed almost the same trend as kaoping river upstream for groundwater and river water levels however the resulted exchange flux was totally different the values of the river flow were significantly higher and the groundwater had a high potential to be recharged by the river with maximum of about 6 3 m3 s after peak rainfall in june 2012 see fig 7b which was in good agreement with previous studies ting et al 1998a this together with a lower abstraction rate and higher precipitation led to the right side of the plain having a higher groundwater level ting et al 1998b the groundwater recharge lag time to the peak rainfall at all hpoints located at the mid fan of the plain was about one to two months which was in good agreement with the literature yu and lin 2015 compared to the proximal fan the groundwater had a lower interannual fluctuation in the mid fan and the maximum head difference between the groundwater and river was about 4 m in april and 2 3 m in may at cishan river upstream and downstream respectively see fig 6d e increasing the rainfall led to decrease in this deviation reaching its minimum gap over september and october this trend was exceptional in 2012 when heavy rainfall occurred earlier than usual in june the computed exchange flow at cishan river upstream showed that the river discharges into the groundwater at a higher rate than the groundwater discharges into the river this rate reached its maximum level in june 2012 with around 1 5 m3 s towards groundwater see fig 7d the conjunction of the cishan river and kaoping river occupied the largest cross sectional area in the river network with more than 130 000 m2 with a maximum hydraulic radius of 46 m covering almost 3000 m storage width this gave it the potential to be in connection with the underlying groundwater in addition the abstraction of groundwater in this area with less than 50 mld for a large area of qishan township dibaj et al 2020 helped the groundwater interact with the river at higher levels and have a lower head deviation similar to the river upstream the maximum exchange flux at this hpoint occurred in june 2012 with 0 8 m3 s see fig 7e also this hpoint showed the maximum river discharge see supplementary material data 3 which was in good agreement with available data reported by moea fig 6 c represents hpoint located at about 30 km from the kaoping river upstream at mid fan area the groundwater head reached its highest level over october and november 2012 with largest interannual oscillation of about 3 5 m between april and november the groundwater level showed a sharp increase one month after the peak rainfall in june 2012 it was recharged by the river with maximum of about 1 5 m3 s see fig 7c which led the interaction of groundwater with river by exceeding the river stage by up to 1 m over august 2012 and february 2013 this interaction reached its lowest level during 2014 due to increasing the gap between groundwater and river levels growing the gap between groundwater and river by moving towards the river downstream the interaction between the river and the underlying aquifers decreased due to increased groundwater abstraction rate fading the groundwater head meaning that the rivers were losing stream almost all the time in the downstream of the kaoping river water flowed over a confined aquifer consisting of silt and clay with lower permeability located at the distal fan the results show that the groundwater had a faster reaction less than one month to rainfall events with insignificant head fluctuation which was in good agreement with previous literature yu and lin 2015 the grain size becomes finer and finer from the kaoping upstream in the proximal fan towards the river mid and downstream in the mid and distal fans in upstream portions before the conjunction of the three rivers the river beds are located between slices 1 and 2 of the model however by moving towards the kaoping midstream the bed of the river lowers and is located between slices 2 and 3 with lower permeability deprecating the interaction effect and exchange flow rate the most downstream hpoint of the kaoping river was selected to present the resulting surface and subsurface water interaction after coupling see fig 6f although the typhoon event in june 2012 caused both the groundwater and the river levels to increase there was a limited rise of about 0 6 m with almost no delay in the level of the groundwater high rainfall caused the river and groundwater to almost maintain their own levels from june to september the river level declined during october and november and then it maintained its level by the end of february 2013 see fig 6f accordingly the groundwater head started to decrease from october and reached its lowest value in january 2013 moving towards the dry season the maximum level of the river was almost the same as the minimum about 0 5 m higher than mean sea level in august 2013 and 2015 3 2 seawater intrusion swi a cross section along the kaoping river from its origin in the northeast to its discharge point into the sea in the southwest of the plain has been chosen to show the effect of river discharge on seawater intrusion see fig 8 a c at the end of 2011 and 2015 the cross section view has been magnified 100 times in the vertical direction to present a clearer view also a detailed view of this encroachment is presented along 4 km of the downstream portion of the kaoping river cross section see fig 8b d the results showed that seawater has intruded in the entire depth of the aquifer at different inland distances in different layers of the aquifer system the kaoping river estuary acted as an interaction zone mixing the river water with seawater this is one of the largest river and sea interaction zones in the world wang et al 2009 the high river discharge pushed the seawater back into the sea in the surface layer top slice of the model of the aquifer system however the river bed which is located between top aquifer and first aquitard in contact with the top aquifer played a pathway role for inland movement of seawater towards the top layers of the aquifer system mixing of the fresh water of the kaoping river rivers were assumed as fresh water with the saline seawater in the estuary turned the saline water 18 000 tds 35 000 mg l into brackish water 10 000 tds 18 000 mg l before discharging into the sea with a circulation pattern through the top layer of the aquifer dibaj et al 2020 the saline water found its pathway through kaoping river downstream from the top aquitard and first aquifer towards the upper layers with a cone shape encroachment at the end of 2011 see fig 8a b the bottom aquifer along this cross section was further intruded by the saline water highlighting the significant effect of groundwater abstraction in this aquifer which is far from the river and its effect however the middle aquifer located between two confining layers showed less intrusion this pattern was generally in good agreement with previous studies dibaj et al 2020 huang and chiu 2018 the semi brackish water 1000 tds 10 000 mg l extended further inland in the top aquifer compared to the other two aquifers highlighting the effect of fresh river discharge in diluting the salinity concentration at the top layers after four years at the end of 2015 the tip of the saline water cone moved towards the lower layers extending between the first aquitard and second aquifer see fig 8c d highlighting the significant effect of the kaoping river bed location in the salinization of lower aquifers through the river mouth besides the effect of groundwater abstraction in addition to this cross section along the kaoping river the inland length of seawater intrusion with 10 000 tds 35 000 mg l along cross sections a a b b and c c see fig 10a at right middle and left sides of the domain respectively is presented at the end of 2011 and 2015 see table 1 distance of inland encroachment is measured as the distance between the shoreline contour line 35 000 mg l and contour line 10 000 mg l see fig 10b this allows to compare the results of this model with those of a pervious study that did not consider the effect of the river dibaj et al 2020 the simulated mass concentrations at the end of 2011 and 2015 remained almost unchanged from the predicted encroachment at the end of 2010 and 2015 dibaj et al 2020 in all the layers of the aquifer along the a a cross section with nearly 1790 m and 1820 m intrusion respectively the seawater had a forward pattern towards the land along all the layers of the aquifer through cross section b b intruding the top middle and bottom aquifers with the inland distances of 2380 2350 and 2400 m respectively with around 2 difference from the previous study at the end of 2010 dibaj et al 2020 at the end of 2015 this encroachment exceeded more than 180 m 160 m and 90 m through the top middle and bottom aquifers respectively the resulted swi at the end of 2015 showed about 100 m less encroachment through middle aquifer while the intrusion along the top aquifer decreased about 50 m and it was almost unchanged at the bottom aquifer the first and second aquifers showed at least 100 m less encroachment along cross section c c at the end of 2011 highlighting the effect of fresh river water on shrinking of the salinity zone however this decline did not last long with about 600 m inland progression of seawater along the first aquifer at the end of 2015 due to the expansion of brackish water 10 000 tds 18 000 mg l see table 1 this transition was slowed down through the middle aquifer and kept growing through the bottom aquifer almost at the same distance as the top aquifer at the beginning of the simulation mixing of fresh river water with saline seawater at the river downstream reduced the salinity of water through the top layers of the aquifer but with time the kaoping river estuary played a pathway role guiding seawater inland through the river mouth due to the hydraulic head gradients caused by groundwater over abstraction 3 2 1 mass interaction in kaoping river estuary an experimental investigation wang et al 2009 has shown the variation of salinity in the kaoping river estuary in different monitoring stations during winter and summer which is in good agreement with the predicted salinity changes in the developed coupled model our study aims to give a clear understanding of the effects of transient flow and coupling on the salinity variations in the mixing zone before discharging to the sea the results of mass flux exchanges between the river and groundwater are shown in fig 9 these results highlight the consequent effect of rainfall events on the river water discharge and change of salinity in the mixing zone of the two water bodies river and the sea before discharging into the sea the results of the coupled model showed only transfer of mass from the groundwater towards the river the rivers were assumed as freshwater bodies and the exchange of mass between river and groundwater was investigated at 5 points along 4 km of kaoping river downstream with 1 km distance between each two points before discharging into the sea see fig 8b d due to lack of water quality data and focus of present study on groundwater salinisation the mass exchange was simulated from groundwater towards the rivers the mass concentration at the first point p1 located at 1 km from the sea showed minimum average monthly salinity of 1121 mg l in june 2012 and maximum 7700 mg l in march 2015 the mass flux was determined by multiplying the concentration mg l of the river hpoint by the exchange fluid flux m3 s between the river and groundwater due to the fast and high variation of river discharge ning et al 2001 compared to the salinity change between wet and dry seasons the mass flux between these two water bodies was dominated by the changing of fluid flux for example in point p1 during the dry season january may the mass flux from the underlying groundwater towards the river was slow and less than in the wet season and consequently a lower amount of fluid was exchanged between these two water bodies followed by lower river discharge yielding salinity rise in their interaction see fig 9a generally the results for p1 showed higher mass flux from the river to the sea due to this area s position adjacent to the sea and the high salinity of underlying groundwater the discharged salt into the sea varied between a minimum of 150 kg d and a maximum of 9000 kg d in january 2014 and september 2013 respectively by moving further inland the second point p2 showed slightly less salt transferring towards the river which reached its maximum of 8000 kg d at the end of july 2013 see fig 9b although the maximum fluid exchange occurred in june 2012 due to heavy rainfall the peak mass exchange happened at the end of july 2013 due to three consecutive high exchange flows during july and august 2013 the salt concentration varied between 1000 and 7000 mg l at this point during high rainfall and dry periods respectively by exchanging salt at the river bed from the underlying aquifer during the simulation time but this was not a considerable change as the range was still in the semi brackish water range the mass flux reached the highest level twice in 2015 due to an increase in the salinity of water in may and september at the third point p3 the salinity concentration changed from freshwater tds 1000 mg l in wet months to semi brackish water 1000 tds 10 000 mg l in dry periods the peak of fluid exchange occurred with heavy rainfall in june 2012 yielding the peak amounts of salt to be exchanged from top aquifer towards the river bed see fig 9c the fourth and fifth points located 4 and 5 km from the sea showed lower salinity concentration varying between 800 and 3400 mg l and 600 and 1800 mg l between wet and dry seasons respectively in the top layer of the aquifer system as with the other points the fluid flowed downward at a maximum of 0 05 and 0 06 m3 s in june 2012 at p4 and p5 respectively yielding maximum salt exchange at the same time see fig 9d e the salinity variation between wet and dry seasons in these two points was not as high as the three previous points causing the fluid flux to be the driving force in the salt transition the fluid flux in these points except in 2012 was on average at the same level which gave a similar trend for the rest of the simulation time from the vertical and plan views of the model the surface layer and top aquifer were under the influence of river effects the first aquifer in contact with the river bed had about 20 30 percent more salinity than the top surface layer which was in good agreement with the previous study wang et al 2009 the salinity of the underlying layers beneath the first aquifer did not change significantly along the river and almost maintained the trend as shown in a previous study dibaj et al 2020 3 3 seawater intrusion mitigation artificial recharge of groundwater is one of the effective methods for swi mitigation javadi et al 2015 for this purpose high quality water e g surface water treated waste water rainwater or desalinated water can be used to recharge the aquifer yielding a rise in inland piezometric heads and retaining the seaward gradient of the system selecting appropriate location s for recharge is very important for the recharge efficiency previous studies ting et al 1998a tu et al 2011 used pilot tests for estimating the groundwater recharge rate by selecting random locations as ponding areas in pingtung plain four locations were selected in parallel with the groundwater flow direction running from i lio river at north east towards the kaoping river at southwest to evaluate the soil permeability and texture impact on the recharge rate the results showed the upper first location and lower part second location of i lio river with coarse texture have higher rate of recharge tu et al 2011 this rate was decreased by moving towards the middle of the plain before reaching to kaoping river third location in mid fan and the lower parts of kaoping river fourth location which was in good agreement with textural change between these areas although the fourth location along the kaoping river possesses coarse texture allowing high input of rainfall and irrigation water through the land surface it showed lower contribution through the underlying aquifers however this location was likely located in river discharge area where the infiltrated water was possibly lost due to shallow drainage to adjacent canals or ditches tu et al 2011 this location was also intruded by seawater which was not a good option for surface recharging ponding the present study used recharge wells for recharge purpose using the excess of river water based on the river flow and river inundation results in agricultural fields based on the river model results see fig 11 and available land use data collected from national land surveying and mapping centre fig 1 the conjunction point of kaoping and cishan rivers indicated the maximum river discharge this is where a weir has already been constructed to regulate the river flow moea the ecological base flow at downstream of the kaoping weir is 37 m3 s moea this location was selected as first artificial recharge using river as water source maintaining the ecological base flow in rivers is crucial for heath of river ecological system by not exceeding 37 m3 s for abstraction although artificial recharge could reduce seawater intrusion its efficiency could be increased by choosing a recharge source adjacent to the toe of the saltwater wedge hussain et al 2019 for this purpose the kaoping river downstream around chainage 43 295 m which had the potential for maximum river inundation see fig 11 was selected as the second source of water for artificial recharge the details of maximum river discharge and inundation area values in these two chainages along kaoping river profile are illustrated in supplementary material as data 3 the results showed that an appropriate rate for recharge would be between 2 10 5 and 8 10 5 m3 d see table 2 the rates less than 2 10 5 m3 d showed negligible effects on the transition of the saltwater wedge this study applied injection wells direct recharge screening at the entire depth of aquifer system which were the best option compared to surface infiltration for this area considering the high rate of evaporation yeh and chen 2004 permeability of soil and underlying confined layers especially in the distal fan on the transition of saline water seawards distance with tds 10 000 mg l is illustrated in table 2 along the dedicated cross sections the results show that the toe of the saline water interface in the south east of the plain along cross section a a had less than 100 m seaward movement through both recharge sources see table 2 however by moving towards the middle of the domain the saline water zone 10 000 tds 35 000 mg l showed more seaward transition along cross section b b reaching a maximum of about 100 and 300 m through the aquifer layers due to artificially recharging from cishan river downstream first location and kaoping river downstream second location respectively recharging near the toe location around kaoping river downstream was more effective in moving the saline water towards the sea compared to the recharge from the upstream point the conjunction point of kaoping and cishan rivers see table 2 this was also in good agreement with the pervious literature showing the lower part of kaoping river had more potential for recharge tu et al 2011 compared to the top and bottom aquifers seawater was less intruded in the middle aquifer also the middle aquifer showed a slower reaction to the recharge compared to the other two aquifers from the results it can be concluded that seawater intrusion can be mitigated by choosing kaoping river downstream as a recharging source also the results in table 2 show that recharge rates between 2 105 and 6 105 m3 day lead to a sharper decline in inland intrusion of seawater compared to rates between 6 105 and 8 105 m3 d which show a gradual pattern choosing rates higher than 8 105 m3 d did not cause a significant change in the results 4 conclusion a 3 d transient density dependent finite element model for groundwater flow and solute transport was developed the developed model was coupled with a 1 d river network model for integrated simulation of groundwater flow surface water flow and seawater intrusion in pingtung plain a meticulous calibration and validation was conducted on the model using real data the developed coupled model is capable of analysing the flow and transient interaction between the aquifer system and rivers also the effects of occurrence time intensity and duration of precipitation on the groundwater surface water interaction and lag time were investigated the results showed that the groundwater in the proximal fan has the slowest reaction time to heavy rainfall whilst the lowest delay was observed in the distal fan it can be concluded that the top layer of the aquifer system was less intruded due to fresh river water discharge pushing back the saline water seaward at the beginning of the simulation however with time the kaoping river mouth acted as the main pathway letting seawater inland through river bed towards the top aquifer at the end of the simulation time the middle aquifer located between two large confining layers was less intruded compared to the first and third aquifers while seawater at the bottom aquifer showed farther inland encroachment the inland distance of seawater was examined along 4 cross sections in the right middle along kaoping river and left side of the plain the east side of the plain showed shortest intrusion distance and it was almost unchanged during the simulation period due to natural groundwater recharge and higher groundwater level however by moving towards the middle and west side of the plain the inland encroachment of seawater extended significantly the results of monthly variation of salinity of water in the mixing zone of kaoping river and taiwan strait illustrated the exchange of mass flux between river and groundwater it highlighted the effect of precipitation on exchanging fluid flux between river and the underlying aquifer during wet and dry seasons the developed model was able to determine the appropriate locations for artificial groundwater recharge for swi mitigation the conjunction of kaoping river and cishan river where the river flow reached its peak was selected as the first location to apply injection well using the excess of river water the kaoping river downstream which was vulnerable to inundation was selected as the second location for recharge the resulted seaward movement of seawater highlighted the effectiveness of applying recharge wells near toe location the developed model has some limitations the storativity parameter for the entire model was assigned as the default value of the software due to lack of data the river water was assumed as fresh water and the exchange mass flux was considered only from groundwater towards the river also the rate of pumping wells was only available for one specific period of time with no information about their screening depth the same rates were applied for the consecutive years considering the screening in the entire depth of the aquifer system funding the authors would like to thank dhi group for providing the feflow and mike software packages

8191,study region a coupled framework linking subsurface flow and surface hydrodynamics is developed and applied to a real world case study of pingtung coastal aquifer in southwest of taiwan in east asia study focus feflow is adopted to develop a 3 d variable density and transient groundwater model of the pingtung shallow aquifer lying 250 m below mean sea level msl this model is coupled with a 1 d river network model comprised of the main river and its two tributaries using mike 11 through the ifm mike 11 coupling interface the model is capable of analysing the relationship between rainfall surface water and groundwater recharge lag time also the analysis of potential river inundation and maximum river discharge enable the model to choose the best location to apply artificial recharge as a management scenario to mitigate the effect of seawater intrusion swi to the authors knowledge the developed coupled model is the first detailed integrated framework analysing the interaction of surface and subsurface water with the capability to contribute to the restoration rehabilitation and management of the river network new hydrological insights for the region the rainfall ratio in the wet season to dry season is significant in this plain comparing with the rest of taiwan also southern taiwan experiences the largest sea and river interaction while kaoping river playing as a pathway role for inland lead of seawater intrusion keywords coupled model groundwater surface water swi feflow taiwan 1 introduction in recent decades there has been significant spatial and temporal instability in hydrological conditions due to climate change simonovic and li 2003 increasing the vulnerability of water resources chang et al 2011 groundwater plays a vital role in providing stable regional water resources tsur 1990 fresh groundwater in coastal aquifers is vulnerable to salinization by upconing and seawater intrusion post 2005 an integrated framework considering surface and subsurface water as a single resource is essential for improving the reliability of water supply sophocleous 2002 montazar et al 2010 numerical models can be used to investigate the behaviour of surface subsurface water systems in coastal areas for different climate change scenarios yang et al 2015 surface water and groundwater are inseparable elements in a hydrological system from climatic and physiographic viewpoints they interact in different ways such that e g contamination of one directly affects the other winter 1998 studies in catchment scale have illustrated the relative connection between surface and subsurface water resources for example there is clear relationship between the availability of water and the effect of groundwater over abstraction on rivers or seepage of contaminants from rivers towards groundwater shaad 2015 integrated water resource management is one of the cornerstones of the global water framework rahaman et al 2004 increasing the demand for modelling tools and methodologies to investigate integrated fully dynamic surface subsurface models at the catchment scale numerical modelling of aquifer stream interactions has become an imperative tool for management of water resources for example the coupled models can be used to evaluate the performance of infiltration wells in cutting off the runoff of extreme rainfall and attenuating flood peaks sommer et al 2009 the groundwater can interact with streams in three ways inflow of groundwater through the streambed outflow of groundwater along the streambed or both losing and gaining stream in some stream reaches irvine et al 2012 storey et al 2003 also abstraction of groundwater can cause local exchange of water between streams and adjacent shallow aquifers sophocleous 2002 brunner et al 2011 several factors control the groundwater and surface water interaction in a large scale landscape these include the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in both alluvial plain sediments and channel the relationship between groundwater level and adjacent stream stage and the position and geometry of the stream channel located in the alluvial plain woessner 2000 the direction of surface and subsurface water exchange is variable and is influenced by changes in hydraulic head due to the seasonal pattern and climate change scibek et al 2007 the exchange flow between stream and aquifer is a function of the water head difference between aquifer and river stage in this study an integrated 3 d groundwater model and 1 d river model was developed for coupled transient analysis of groundwater flow river flow and river inundation considering the interactions between surface water and groundwater although there are some coupled models simulating the flow exchange between surface and subsurface water to the authors knowledge this is the first numerical model that also simulates the effects of rainfall occurrence and duration on groundwater surface water interaction lag time the developed model is also used to select appropriate locations and sources for applying recharge wells in coastal aquifer based on resulted river discharge and inundation the model is validated against experimental results and applied to study the interaction between the kaoping river and the sea with the aquifer system in southern taiwan wang et al 2009 this model is capable of computing the monthly variation of salinity amount and the exchange of mass flux in the mixing zone this is the first numerical model for simulating the changes in salinity of the mixing zone for this specific region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area pingtung plain with an area of 1210 km2 is approximately 20 km wide from east to west and 60 km long from north to south and is located in the southwest of taiwan the plain is bounded by foothills and river valleys in the north low hills along the west a mountain range extending along the east and the taiwan strait along the southern boundary dibaj et al 2020 the mountainous regions surrounding the plain are consisted of black slate embedded with sandstone in western part of mountain range shale and sandstone in north and sand stone with sandy shale in north west the black slate with very low water bearing texture and low porosity causes high rate of run off consequently water is stored only in local joints and cleavages ting et al 1998a these characteristics of the plain turn most of the precipitation to surface run off and flow towards the streams and rivers tu et al 2011 the elevation of the plain is less than 100 m above mean sea level msl and it is a relatively flat area drained by three major rivers the kaoping donggang and linbian these rivers divide the plain into three areas of proximal fan mid fan and distal fan dibaj et al 2020 hsu et al 2007 see fig 1 these rivers make a regular discharge base for the regional groundwater in this basin the 171 km long kaoping river covers a catchment area of about 3257 km2 and is the second longest river in taiwan originating from yushan mountain and wandering south westward receiving the streamflow of four main tributaries laonong river cishan river i lio river zhuokou river before discharging into the taiwan strait wang et al 2009 the laonong and zhuokou rivers are out of study domain area and not included in fig 1 capart et al 2010 the estuary of kaoping river has the largest sea and river interaction in southern taiwan wang et al 2009 the entire aquifer underlying the plain is formed by unconsolidated sediments the direct penetration of rainfall due to the unconsolidated sediments through the foothills along the north and east of plain is the principle mechanism for the groundwater recharge furthermore the river seepage in the higher areas of the plain is another source for groundwater recharge chang et al 2004 the rivers in taiwan possess huge sediment discharge compared to major rivers of the world liu et al 2008 hung et al 2004 this is mainly because of the general characteristics of rivers in this country with a short length small basin area steep gradient and brittle geology wang et al 2009 the upper and middle stream of kaoping river flows through mainly sandstone shale and metamorphic rocks while the downstream portion is mostly formed by recent alluvium deposits according to the several stratigraphic units exposed in its drainage basin wang et al 2009 yang 2001 the cishan river watershed has an area of 842 km2 with 118 km river length chiang and liu 2013 chen et al 2011 the upstream of the watershed is composed of sand and shale and the mid and downstream are composed of gravel and sand the i lio river watershed has an area of about 642 km2 and a river length of 68 5 km yeh and chang 2019 and its watershed is composed of gravel and sand with high permeability the tortuous up and mid stream has good potential for subsurface flow development lee and wang 2011 according to the literature groundwater aquifers supply almost 60 of tap water demand in taiwan highlighting the importance of this water resource for this country liang et al 2019 pingtung alluvial plain is one of the major agricultural and aquacultural production regions in taiwan yu and lin 2015 about 50 5 of the pingtung plain land is used for agricultural activities and 5 5 for aquaculture liang et al 2020 pingtung plain aquifer is the second largest aquifer in taiwan playing a primary role in supplying the major water resources for over 50 of population in pingtung county as well as neighbouring areas yu and lin 2015 while surface water only supplies 20 of water resource demand in the plain lin et al 2011 this highlights the dependency of this plain on groundwater resources a recent study showed that every year approximately 25 million tons of groundwater is abstracted of which 63 8 and 29 is used for agriculture aquaculture and other demands respectively liang et al 2020 the permeability of the soil decreases from north east to south west the proximal fan is mainly comprised of gravel and sand 20 sand and 60 gravel with storage factor of 6 5 10 3 and a transmissivity of about 9000 m2 day hsieh et al 2010 it is followed by finer grain size in the mid fan zone in the centre of the plain 40 gravel and 40 sand with a 9 5 10 4 storage factor and 2300 m2 day transmissivity reaching the distal fan in the south west that is comprised of silt and clay with 0 00005 storage factor and 1200 m2 day transmissivity dibaj et al 2020 the indicated storage factor values used by previous studies were only monitored for the top aquifer and not defined for other layers due to the lack of data the default value of this parameter in feflow was applied with 0 0001 m 1 as specific storage s s for whole aquifer system the precipitation distribution in pingtung is closely related to the monsoon consequently increasing with a rise in topographical elevation fan and hsieh 2010 hsu and guo 2005 forming a higher precipitation rate along the north and north east of the plain the location of the i lio river watershed in the north east of the domain gives it the potential to have a maximum average annual precipitation varying between 3400 and 5000 mm this rate decreases to the range of 3000 3400 mm and a maximum of 3000 mm in the cishan river watershed and along the kaoping river respectively lin et al 2011 most of the rainfall occurs due to regular thunderstorms and typhoons over the wet season may october with a little rain over the dry season november march dibaj et al 2020 the temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven such that the precipitation in the wet season is 9 times higher than in the dry season hsu et al 2007 the summer season may to october has the highest precipitation concentration in the kaoping river basin while the rest of the year is almost dry due to prevailing winds along the northwest of the plain chu 2012 accumulation of discharge from june to september forms about 78 of the total annual discharge occurring in the kaoping river the average annual water discharge in this river has been reported as 6 33 10 6 m3 per year based on the observations from 1999 to 2004 wang et al 2009 2 2 development of the numerical model 2 2 1 finite element modelling a three dimensional variable density finite element groundwater model of pingtung s multilayer aquifer system was developed including its three aquifers and two aquitards dibaj et al 2020 huang and chiu 2018 the groundwater was abstracted from 25 pumping wells and monitored through 95 observation wells over the period from 2011 to 2015 groundwater level gwl stations for top aquifer are shown in fig 1 first the 2d domain of the plain was generated as a polygon shapefile captured by arcgis and then three river polylines and 25 pumping well points were added in the feflow finite element subsurface flow software dibaj et al 2020 trefry and muffels 2007a the mesh generation was performed as an intermediate stage representing inner and outer geometries a triangular prism mesh was used to discretise the domain this type of mesh has the capability to discretise irregular geometries including complex polygons or polylines with narrow sections along their boundaries variable layer thickness and well fields or coastlines dibaj et al 2020 dhi wasy 2010 it also allows a minimum angle for all finite elements as well as providing the means for local mesh refinement with maximum element size the finite element mesh design was implemented with a special attention to minimise the distorted elements through application of local mesh refinement in the coastal area polygon domain pumping well points and river polylines the local mesh refinement and mesh smoothing would allow to build a higher mesh quality than later elemental subdivisions to eliminate the difficulties arising from highly distorted elements in the transport simulation the peclet criterion was calculated and updated at each time step for determining the required mesh density during simulation trefry and muffels 2007a the available elevation x y z data from 95 observation wells were used for extending the 2d model into a 3d multilayer aquifer system dibaj et al 2020 the nearest neighbour interpolation method was used for allocating the elevation to the adjacent node or batch of nodes adjoining the original locations of the observation wells the aquifer with six layers and seven slices was achieved after the interpolation vertical mesh disorders were prevented by discretising each layer into sub layers leaving the model with 42 layers dibaj et al 2020 see fig 2 b the model includes 39 221 elements per layer and 20 352 nodes per slice the elevation of the model surface varies between 2 3 m and 89 m above the msl with the top layer having a depth of 10 16 m this layer overlies the top aquifer with 10 121 m thickness a semi pervious layer with 10 81 m depth is located beneath the first aquifer as the first aquitard overlying the middle aquifer with 10 96 m thickness this second aquifer overlies the second aquitard with 10 63 m depth and the bottom aquifer with 10 103 m depth the base of the bottom aquifer reaches to around 197 m below msl once the multilayer aquifer system with dedicated mesh generation and model dimensions were set up its properties were then asigned as an unconfined free surface fully saturated water table modelling approach with moveable variable mesh therefore the mesh can be adapted to the groundwater level variation and all unsaturated or variably saturated parts can be excluded from the model avoiding the dry cell problem in the mass transport cases the dry cells can also freeze the solute and make it unable to transfer through the water table yielding an incorrect model all the slices below the free surface were set as dependent except for the bottom slice which should always be fixed the dependent slices underlying the free surface are able to move if necessary the layers located under confined layers regardless of the hydraulic head being below or above the layer were treated as fully saturated during the entire simulation this is also in good agreement with previous studies in this region based on the available soil permeability and precipitation data huang and chiu 2018 dibaj et al 2020 the unconfined layer was given a default residual water depth of 0 01 m to avoid any dry cells in top slice during simulation the precipitation was monitored daily at 24 rainfall stations in different locations of the plain over a period of 5 years from 1st january 2011 to 31st december 2015 based on taiwan s water resource bureau moea the average monthly rainfall distribution data assuming 60 run off and evaporation moea were applied to the top layer of the model as a spatial inflow using the delogarithmic kriging interpolation method dibaj et al 2020 an automatic time step control technique based on a predictor corrector scheme was selected for time discretisation by choosing an appropriate length for time step in line with the changing of the groundwater head variations between the time steps trefry and muffels 2007a this feature of feflow among others persuaded the present study to choose this software for its detailed simulation using automatic and flexible time stepping techniques although this model could also be developed using physical based models such as wash123d yeh et al 2006 it may not have the high capabilities of feflow for example wash123d is also capable of simulating 3d subsurface flow models coupled with surface flows but in wash123d the time step size for both domains should be fixed and cannot change during simulation besides it has limitations for local mesh refinement that may result in simulations being computationally expensive england et al 2006 feflow applies default second order accurate semi implicit forward adams bashforth backward trapezoid rule ab tr for the flow and transport models the details of average monitored rainfall data can be found in our recent study as well as the sensitivity of the inland encroachment distance of seawater due to 30 increase and decrease in rainfall which has been analysed as well dibaj et al 2020 the results showed the model was much more under influence of pumping rate the groundwater hydraulic head was monitored via 95 observation wells in different layers of the aquifer on a monthly basis over the same period of time the data for the first month january 2011 were applied as the initial head in the model using the delogarithmic inverse distance interpolation method for each layer of the model due to lack of data for the abstraction rates the depths of the wells and their exact locations in the plain the model used the pumping rates of the year 1996 the only available data for 25 townships of the plain as multilayer pumping wells screened at the entire depth of the aquifer system as input transient pumping data over the simulation period detailed information about townships with their allocated pumping rates in pingtung plain is available in a recent study dibaj et al 2020 based on the available data moea the hydraulic conductivity was measured only in the horizontal direction k x k y in different layers of the aquifer ranging from 1 to 520 m day 5 to 90 m day and 1 to 100 m day in the top middle and bottom aquifer respectively considering the leading directions of the axis parallel anisotropic hydraulic conductivity in coincident with cartesian coordinates k x k y k z along the x y and z axes dibaj et al 2020 yields the following relationship k x k y 10 k z as an initial model set up for each aquifer in the model using the kriging logarithmic interpolation method for spatial distribution in the 3d model a constant value of 0 0001 m day was assigned as the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitards dibaj et al 2020 an automatic time stepping method with a predictor corrector scheme and initial time step of 0 001 day was selected for the simulation dibaj et al 2020 hydraulic conductivity along x y and z axes was considered for calibration due to the sensitivity of the model to this parameter and its significance for natural groundwater recharge from precipitation the southern border the coastal line was assigned first type dirichlet head and mass concentration seawater salt concentration is 35 000 mg l boundary conditions and the remaining borders were considered as no fluid flux boundary due to the low permeability soil and faults with impervious bedrocks surrounding the plain from north east and west dibaj et al 2020 ting et al 1998a the only contaminant was salt and the adsorption was assumed negligible dibaj et al 2020 the groundwater flows westward into kaoping and donggang rivers and south westward into the taiwan strait detail of the boundary conditions governing equations and the parameter definitions can be found in our pervious study dibaj et al 2020 the model was simulated in steady state and then transient conditions the initial salinity data were obtained through a steady state analysis of the model due to the lack of data the results showed that the entire depth of the aquifer system was intruded with seawater while from the plain view the middle and west of the plain were affected in greater areas than the east which is in good agreement with the previous studies huang and chiu 2018 dibaj et al 2020 in this study the molecular diffusivity is assumed as zero the hydrodynamic dispersion is considered as a function of velocity and dispersivity is assumed to be larger in the flow direction than vertical and lateral directions ogata 1970 voss 1984 feflow approximates the longitudinal dispersivity based on the mean elemental size in a way that a good convergence is also guaranteed trefry and muffels 2007a the longitudinal dispersivity varies between 6 and 150 m for most of studies gelhar et al 1992 sherif et al 2012 in this study the mean elemental dimension was 70 m which was set as longitudinal dispersivity the transverse dispersivity was selected as 10 percent of this value based on the literature and feflow parameter definition huang and chiu 2018 sherif et al 2012 bear et al 1999 according to the literature this model also set the value of the horizontal transverse dispersivity the same as longitudinal dispersivity huang and chiu 2018 dibaj et al 2020 the model convergence and accuracy of meshing were monitored based on maximum interior angle of triangles which was as regular as possible with the mean angle of 124 4 degree for the entire model also the numerical stability of advection dispersion transport process was investigated based on peclet number with value less than 2 along the shoreline boundary trefry and muffels 2007a 2 2 2 surface water model development mike 11 is an advanced hydroinformatics engineering software with the capability of simulating 1d flow in rivers estuaries channels irrigation systems and other water bodies mike 11 solves the saint venant equations using a finite difference scheme madsen et al 2003 kamel 2008 and can reflect fully dynamic diffusive or kinematic conditions some assumptions are involved in the solution of these equations firstly assuming water as homogeneous and incompressible leads to neglecting density variations secondly if the water depth is smaller than the wave length then the flow is assumed to be parallel everywhere to the bottom level leading to vertical acceleration being ignored and assuming that the hydrostatic pressure varies vertically finally the flow is assumed to be sub critical because of restrictions associated with applying super critical flow models kamel 2008 thompson et al 2004 the river data were implemented and edited separately with different editors and linked together via the simulation editor the kaoping cishan and i lio rivers were developed using point digitisation in mike 11 network see fig 2 c the river centre points hpoints were achieved using the centre of the right and left banks of each cross section data using their x and y coordinates this network was comprised of 146 centre points the distance between each point from the nearest point represents the chainage which was calculated automatically starting with 0 km in the furthest upstream part and increasing towards the downstream of the river the kaoping river cishan river and i lio river stretch from chainage 0 49120 m 0 10793 m and 0 11785 m respectively see fig 2 c from the collected data moea the water level hydrological stations w l in fig 1 streamflow and rainfall data that were monitored from 1st january 2011 to 31st december 2015 were used as input data for surface water simulation in mike 11 the streamflow was monitored in five stations namely shanlin bridge lilin bridge wannta bridge da jin bridge and liouguei bridge see fig 1 the water levels measured at 22 stations with only two of them located at i lio river upstream and kaoping river downstream were applied as open end river boundary conditions the monitored water levels in qishan bridge lilin bridge gaobing bridge and wannta bridge see fig 1 were used for calibration and validation of the model the daily time series of river water level and streamflow starting from 1st january 2011 and ending on 31st december 2015 were applied for kaoping downstream and upstream respectively both upstream and downstream of cishan river were assigned as daily streamflow time series boundary conditions but as the downstream of cishan river was discharging into the kaoping river and was not an open end boundary hence a lateral discharge was assigned as a point source at this location the water level time series was applied for the upstream of the i lio river the rivers were assumed to be freshwater and assigned with a constant 0 mg l as the initial salinity over the simulation time the model did not simulate the saline river intruding into groundwater but only mass transports from groundwater to river water the raw cross sectional data x z based on the distance from the far left side and elevation from datum were applied for each river centre point representing the river profile then the model used the raw data to calculate cross sectional area level hydraulic radius and hydraulic resistance as processed data see fig 2c d the steady state of the river profile was computed automatically at the dedicated start time by using the given boundary conditions via the simulation editor the actual cross section data river nodes hpoints gave the head values h due to processed data level cross sectional area hydraulic radius and flow width and the q flow values were simulated through the manning equation assuming uniform or critical flow this study assumed uniform flow using the following equation thompson et al 2004 panda et al 2010 mike 2003 1 q h 1 n a h r h 2 3 s where q h is the discharge amount m3 s depending on the water depth h m calculated in the processed cross section data the bed slope is represented by s while a h m2 is the level relevant to the area resulting from the cross section processed data r is the hydraulic radius m and the manning roughness coefficient n s m 1 3 represents the resistance of the river bed 2 2 3 coupling of the groundwater and surface water models the coupling of mike 11 and feflow was not an iterative process and each time step was only calculated once by either feflow or mike 11 for defining the actual water levels in coupled boundary nodes feflow took mike 11 s water levels at the end of the last time step feflow calculated the exchange fluxes q of each single boundary condition third type cauchy between the surface and groundwater separately using the transfer coefficient ɸh 1 d as the main element for controlling this flux monninkhoff and hartnack 2009a 2 q ɸ h h r e f h g w where q is the darcy flux m d of fluid positive flow is towards the groundwater and hgw and href represent the groundwater and river heads m respectively the river was laterally coupled to the top two slices of the feflow model which is illustrated in supplementary material as data 1 the total discharge at each node q m3 d was calculated through multiplication of the flux q at every single finite element boundary node by the related exchange area in m2 at the end of each time step in feflow the obtained values budgets were transferred to the hpoints of mike 11 as single point source inflow lateral boundary condition monninkhoff and hartnack 2009b mike 11 calculated as many as internal time steps as required to reach the actual time of feflow transferring the resultant water level in the final feflow time step from hpoints of mike 11 to the boundary nodes of feflow was the last stage of the coupling process monninkhoff and hartnack 2009a an interface controlled the internal time steps of mike 11 which could be either constant or fit to the model s dynamic on the other hand feflow controlled the groundwater time steps in which ifm mike 11 automatically integrated the spatial overlay of both meshes every node of the feflow boundary was assigned to the adjacent hpoint of the mike 11 therefore the possibility of assigning one hpoint to more than one boundary node in feflow could be increased coupling of mass transport between mike 11 and feflow is a straightforward process and once a time step is completed by feflow it is passed to mike 11 to exchange the values taking a time step in turn for each coupling point feflow must pass the values of flow m3 s and mass flux g s of each chemical species inflow into river every time a mike 11 time step is calculated in return mike 11 passes the water level concentration mg l and mass flux g s of each chemical species outflow of a river at the hpoints the flow boundary nodes where the flow has been coupled are automatically used for mass boundary node generation by feflow to prevent overshooting a lumped mass matrix was selected in feflow trefry and muffels 2007b the river boundaries were assigned with the first kind dirichlet mass transport boundary condition in convective form due to its high degree of stability especially along outflow boundaries 2 3 calibration and validation of the model providing reliable information on different features of real situation requires a well stablished calibration of hydraulic model the manning roughness coefficient was subjected to calibration to be adjusted for achieving the least possible gap between measured and computed water levels for this purpose the uniform values of this parameter ranging between 0 031 and 0 039 m 1 3s were specified through the river network system these values were selected based on the flow of the river through the alluvium deposit arcement and schneider 1989 the observed water levels in qishan bridge lilin bridge gaoping bridge and wannta bridge see fig 1 were used for comparison with the corresponding simulated values in these locations during the calibration period of 1st january to 31st december 2011 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient r2 was used to assess model performance for each station asce task committee on definition of criteria for evaluation of watershed models of the watershed management committee i and d division 1993 the daily calibration results for the first year of the simulation period are presented in fig 3 based on the available data the qishan station monitoring water levels at cishan river upstream showed a maximum of 39 m over may to june by using manning numbers of 0 039 0 037 and 0 035 m 1 3s the maximum water levels were over predicted as 44 43 and 42 m respectively on the other hand the computed water levels using manning numbers 0 031 and 0 033 m 1 3s were underestimated by 2 and 1 m maximum of 37 and 38 m respectively lilin station monitoring the water levels of the cishan river in its downstream indicated a maximum amount of 26 m in august and september and a minimum of 23 m from january to april the computed water levels using manning numbers 0 031 and 0 033 m 1 3s were underestimated reaching a minimum of 19 m and maximum of 21 m during the same periods an overestimation of about 1 4 and 7 m 24 27 and 30 m was yielded due to manning coefficients 0 035 0 037 and 0 039 m 1 3s respectively the observed water levels at gaoping station showed its minimum level fluctuating between 8 and 9 m during january to may rising to above 9 m until the end of july and reaching its peak value of over 11 m in august and september it then followed a decreasing trend from october to december varying between 9 and 10 m among the computed levels all of their peak values determined in august and september were slightly below 12 m however the computed values with manning numbers 0 031 and 0 033 m 1 3s underestimated the water level during other months except the peak times applying uniform manning roughness of 0 035 m 1 3s provided rather better estimation compared to other values the last stage of calibration was accomplished at wannta station where the observed water levels from january to mid july fluctuated between 4 and 5 m rising by up to 1 5 m from august to early november and jumping to the maximum level of about 7 5 m by the end of november therefore the manning factor of 0 035 m 1 3s was applied to all rivers within the pingtung plain the r2 values for each simulation are provided in fig 4 with their overall average values a reliable steady state solution is a primary need for simulation of flow and solute transport problems to achieve a stable condition both river and groundwater head and mass boundary conditions were kept unchanged over time using a time stepping method with time step length of 0 001 day voss 1984 diersch and kolditz 1998 to simulate the initial transient model the model reached a steady condition using a predictor corrector scheme over a long time of 8395 days which was not unexpected for such a large scale numerical model due to the lack of observed mass concentration data the resulting salinity values obtained as the output of the steady state simulation were applied as input mass data for the transient model after checking their validity with previous studies the results indicated kaoping river mouth and estuary as the origin of inland encroachment of seawater following its passage into the aquifer system and horizontal and vertical expansion in all layers of the aquifer system at different rates this was in good agreement with previous studies showing the middle and left sides of the domain as being more vulnerable to seawater intrusion compared to the right side dibaj et al 2020 huang and chiu 2018 ellis 1999 jang et al 2016 also the top aquifer showed more intrusion than the bottom one and the second aquifer was less intruded which was in good agreement with the permeability distribution in different layers of the aquifer system hsieh et al 2010 one of the limitations of using fepest calibration software is its inability to calibrate the coupled models at the same time to overcome this issue the ifm mike 11 interface was deactivated during calibration and the effect of the rivers and their boundary conditions were applied into the feflow model in the form of cauchy head and dirichlet mass boundary conditions the hydraulic conductivities of the three aquifers were selected for adjustment in calibration using fepest software doherty and hunt 2010 the entire calibration process was set up the same as the previous study dibaj et al 2020 and accomplished for the year 2011 against all observed hydraulic heads in this process the hydraulic conductivity along x y and z axes in each aquifer was considered as adjustable parameter with the assumption k x k y 10 k z based on the observed permeability data moea in each aquifer k x and k y were bounded between 0 1 and 600 m day and kz could range between 0 01 and 100 m day as lower and upper bounds details of the observed permeability data can be found in dibaj et al 2020 both k y and k z were tied to the change of k x during calibration using the kriging interpolation method for 50 random pilot points the calibrated values for each aquifer are illustrated in the supplementary material as data 2 the scatter plot comparing the observed and computed hydraulic heads is illustrated in fig 5 using root mean square rms for all 95 observation wells the hydraulic heads were calibrated with rms of 0 987 m as the best fit with less than 1 m deviation between the observed and computed heads see fig 5a the mike 11 river model was run over the period of 1st january 2012 to 31st december 2015 using a uniform manning coefficient of 0 035 m 1 3s based on the output of calibration in this case the observed and computed results were compared in the four stations of qishan lilin gaoping and wannta the values of r2 had an overall minimum value of 0 68 and maximum of 0 86 at the lilin and gaoping stations respectively most of the observed peak values were also predicted by the developed computational model see fig 4 this model was coupled to the transient groundwater model for the same time period 1st january 2012 to 31st december 2015 employing the resulting mass concentration at the end of 2011 the time variable monthly hydraulic head of january 2012 as initial head calibrated conductivities and monthly precipitation data over 2012 2015 the southern boundary of the domain was assigned first type constant head dirichlet and mass concentration as well as no fluid flux condition bounding the north east and west of the plain as with the previous study dibaj et al 2020 the model was validated using a scatter plot of computed against observed hydraulic heads with rms of 3 012 m at the end of the simulation period see fig 5b 3 results and discussion 3 1 river precipitation groundwater interaction generally the interactions between groundwater and precipitation are represented by large scale procedures depending on landscape geometry and spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity gurdak et al 2007 the interactions can generally vary with time under influence of soil saturation conditions resulting in non linear relationships between groundwater level and rainfall time series yu and lin 2015 the precipitation distribution is the main parameter affecting availability of groundwater resources in pingtung plain while the soil permeability plays an important role in the recharging pattern hsu et al 2007 hsieh et al 2010 the proximal fan extending along east and north east of the domain compromised by sand and gravel has high potential for recharge and infiltration by river flow and precipitation hsieh et al 2010 the main focus of this study is to investigate the interaction between river network and underlying groundwater under influence of the rainfall this interaction is mainly due to the water level differences between river and groundwater which is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the interaction point hpoint this will help to estimate the surface water groundwater interaction and the mass exchange and water flux in the river network and and its adjacent nodes the rigours calibration and validation of this model in a previous study dibaj et al 2020 showed that hydraulic conductivity is the main parameter for groundwater recharge and its lag time to rainfall the simulated groundwater sim gw and river water sim river stage levels interacting with each other based on the average monthly rainfall rate are presented at six selected river hpoints during the simulation period see fig 6 the exchange flux qfe see fig 7 shows groundwater discharge gaining stream as positive and groundwater recharge losing stream as negative flow the duration and amount of rainfall are effective parameters in the interaction of the groundwater and rivers although the groundwater recharge generally lagged by one to two months after peak rainfall this period varied in different areas of the plain from the simulated results the hpoints located at the proximal fan like kaoping river upstream and i lio river showed two to three months delay in the groundwater level s reaction to the occurrence of peak rainfall see fig 6a b which was in good agreement with the literature yu and lin 2015 considering the river bed as a reference interaction point the groundwater head was always lower than the river level but it reached to bed level or higher during september and october the groundwater fluctuated between its minimum and maximum levels with up to 20 and 15 m deviation at kaoping upstream and i lio river respectively see fig 6a b the precipitation river stage and groundwater head in the proximal fan showed highest interannual variation over the simulation time reaching their maximum level in the summer of 2012 while 2013 and 2014 experienced typical flow conditions 2015 showed a lower level of groundwater and river stage due to lower average precipitation groundwater had its lowest level from march to april and reached its maximum level during september and october after the recharge period between june and august in 2012 the lag time of groundwater recharge was the shortest leading to a fast up to one month reaction to the peak rainfall typhoon the interaction of the river and groundwater increased by rising groundwater level during recharge time and was at its maximum level over september to october the flux exchange in the upstream of the kaoping river reached its peak value by around 0 5 0 5 m3 s in june and august of 2012 respectively by discharging of the river into the underlying groundwater and vice versa see fig 7a this amount was not significant compared to the abstraction rate at least 20 times less than abstraction at the pumping wells adjacent to the hpoints dibaj et al 2020 it can be said that the groundwater was highly under the influence of precipitation and abstraction leading to its fluctuation and interaction with the river water i lio river showed almost the same trend as kaoping river upstream for groundwater and river water levels however the resulted exchange flux was totally different the values of the river flow were significantly higher and the groundwater had a high potential to be recharged by the river with maximum of about 6 3 m3 s after peak rainfall in june 2012 see fig 7b which was in good agreement with previous studies ting et al 1998a this together with a lower abstraction rate and higher precipitation led to the right side of the plain having a higher groundwater level ting et al 1998b the groundwater recharge lag time to the peak rainfall at all hpoints located at the mid fan of the plain was about one to two months which was in good agreement with the literature yu and lin 2015 compared to the proximal fan the groundwater had a lower interannual fluctuation in the mid fan and the maximum head difference between the groundwater and river was about 4 m in april and 2 3 m in may at cishan river upstream and downstream respectively see fig 6d e increasing the rainfall led to decrease in this deviation reaching its minimum gap over september and october this trend was exceptional in 2012 when heavy rainfall occurred earlier than usual in june the computed exchange flow at cishan river upstream showed that the river discharges into the groundwater at a higher rate than the groundwater discharges into the river this rate reached its maximum level in june 2012 with around 1 5 m3 s towards groundwater see fig 7d the conjunction of the cishan river and kaoping river occupied the largest cross sectional area in the river network with more than 130 000 m2 with a maximum hydraulic radius of 46 m covering almost 3000 m storage width this gave it the potential to be in connection with the underlying groundwater in addition the abstraction of groundwater in this area with less than 50 mld for a large area of qishan township dibaj et al 2020 helped the groundwater interact with the river at higher levels and have a lower head deviation similar to the river upstream the maximum exchange flux at this hpoint occurred in june 2012 with 0 8 m3 s see fig 7e also this hpoint showed the maximum river discharge see supplementary material data 3 which was in good agreement with available data reported by moea fig 6 c represents hpoint located at about 30 km from the kaoping river upstream at mid fan area the groundwater head reached its highest level over october and november 2012 with largest interannual oscillation of about 3 5 m between april and november the groundwater level showed a sharp increase one month after the peak rainfall in june 2012 it was recharged by the river with maximum of about 1 5 m3 s see fig 7c which led the interaction of groundwater with river by exceeding the river stage by up to 1 m over august 2012 and february 2013 this interaction reached its lowest level during 2014 due to increasing the gap between groundwater and river levels growing the gap between groundwater and river by moving towards the river downstream the interaction between the river and the underlying aquifers decreased due to increased groundwater abstraction rate fading the groundwater head meaning that the rivers were losing stream almost all the time in the downstream of the kaoping river water flowed over a confined aquifer consisting of silt and clay with lower permeability located at the distal fan the results show that the groundwater had a faster reaction less than one month to rainfall events with insignificant head fluctuation which was in good agreement with previous literature yu and lin 2015 the grain size becomes finer and finer from the kaoping upstream in the proximal fan towards the river mid and downstream in the mid and distal fans in upstream portions before the conjunction of the three rivers the river beds are located between slices 1 and 2 of the model however by moving towards the kaoping midstream the bed of the river lowers and is located between slices 2 and 3 with lower permeability deprecating the interaction effect and exchange flow rate the most downstream hpoint of the kaoping river was selected to present the resulting surface and subsurface water interaction after coupling see fig 6f although the typhoon event in june 2012 caused both the groundwater and the river levels to increase there was a limited rise of about 0 6 m with almost no delay in the level of the groundwater high rainfall caused the river and groundwater to almost maintain their own levels from june to september the river level declined during october and november and then it maintained its level by the end of february 2013 see fig 6f accordingly the groundwater head started to decrease from october and reached its lowest value in january 2013 moving towards the dry season the maximum level of the river was almost the same as the minimum about 0 5 m higher than mean sea level in august 2013 and 2015 3 2 seawater intrusion swi a cross section along the kaoping river from its origin in the northeast to its discharge point into the sea in the southwest of the plain has been chosen to show the effect of river discharge on seawater intrusion see fig 8 a c at the end of 2011 and 2015 the cross section view has been magnified 100 times in the vertical direction to present a clearer view also a detailed view of this encroachment is presented along 4 km of the downstream portion of the kaoping river cross section see fig 8b d the results showed that seawater has intruded in the entire depth of the aquifer at different inland distances in different layers of the aquifer system the kaoping river estuary acted as an interaction zone mixing the river water with seawater this is one of the largest river and sea interaction zones in the world wang et al 2009 the high river discharge pushed the seawater back into the sea in the surface layer top slice of the model of the aquifer system however the river bed which is located between top aquifer and first aquitard in contact with the top aquifer played a pathway role for inland movement of seawater towards the top layers of the aquifer system mixing of the fresh water of the kaoping river rivers were assumed as fresh water with the saline seawater in the estuary turned the saline water 18 000 tds 35 000 mg l into brackish water 10 000 tds 18 000 mg l before discharging into the sea with a circulation pattern through the top layer of the aquifer dibaj et al 2020 the saline water found its pathway through kaoping river downstream from the top aquitard and first aquifer towards the upper layers with a cone shape encroachment at the end of 2011 see fig 8a b the bottom aquifer along this cross section was further intruded by the saline water highlighting the significant effect of groundwater abstraction in this aquifer which is far from the river and its effect however the middle aquifer located between two confining layers showed less intrusion this pattern was generally in good agreement with previous studies dibaj et al 2020 huang and chiu 2018 the semi brackish water 1000 tds 10 000 mg l extended further inland in the top aquifer compared to the other two aquifers highlighting the effect of fresh river discharge in diluting the salinity concentration at the top layers after four years at the end of 2015 the tip of the saline water cone moved towards the lower layers extending between the first aquitard and second aquifer see fig 8c d highlighting the significant effect of the kaoping river bed location in the salinization of lower aquifers through the river mouth besides the effect of groundwater abstraction in addition to this cross section along the kaoping river the inland length of seawater intrusion with 10 000 tds 35 000 mg l along cross sections a a b b and c c see fig 10a at right middle and left sides of the domain respectively is presented at the end of 2011 and 2015 see table 1 distance of inland encroachment is measured as the distance between the shoreline contour line 35 000 mg l and contour line 10 000 mg l see fig 10b this allows to compare the results of this model with those of a pervious study that did not consider the effect of the river dibaj et al 2020 the simulated mass concentrations at the end of 2011 and 2015 remained almost unchanged from the predicted encroachment at the end of 2010 and 2015 dibaj et al 2020 in all the layers of the aquifer along the a a cross section with nearly 1790 m and 1820 m intrusion respectively the seawater had a forward pattern towards the land along all the layers of the aquifer through cross section b b intruding the top middle and bottom aquifers with the inland distances of 2380 2350 and 2400 m respectively with around 2 difference from the previous study at the end of 2010 dibaj et al 2020 at the end of 2015 this encroachment exceeded more than 180 m 160 m and 90 m through the top middle and bottom aquifers respectively the resulted swi at the end of 2015 showed about 100 m less encroachment through middle aquifer while the intrusion along the top aquifer decreased about 50 m and it was almost unchanged at the bottom aquifer the first and second aquifers showed at least 100 m less encroachment along cross section c c at the end of 2011 highlighting the effect of fresh river water on shrinking of the salinity zone however this decline did not last long with about 600 m inland progression of seawater along the first aquifer at the end of 2015 due to the expansion of brackish water 10 000 tds 18 000 mg l see table 1 this transition was slowed down through the middle aquifer and kept growing through the bottom aquifer almost at the same distance as the top aquifer at the beginning of the simulation mixing of fresh river water with saline seawater at the river downstream reduced the salinity of water through the top layers of the aquifer but with time the kaoping river estuary played a pathway role guiding seawater inland through the river mouth due to the hydraulic head gradients caused by groundwater over abstraction 3 2 1 mass interaction in kaoping river estuary an experimental investigation wang et al 2009 has shown the variation of salinity in the kaoping river estuary in different monitoring stations during winter and summer which is in good agreement with the predicted salinity changes in the developed coupled model our study aims to give a clear understanding of the effects of transient flow and coupling on the salinity variations in the mixing zone before discharging to the sea the results of mass flux exchanges between the river and groundwater are shown in fig 9 these results highlight the consequent effect of rainfall events on the river water discharge and change of salinity in the mixing zone of the two water bodies river and the sea before discharging into the sea the results of the coupled model showed only transfer of mass from the groundwater towards the river the rivers were assumed as freshwater bodies and the exchange of mass between river and groundwater was investigated at 5 points along 4 km of kaoping river downstream with 1 km distance between each two points before discharging into the sea see fig 8b d due to lack of water quality data and focus of present study on groundwater salinisation the mass exchange was simulated from groundwater towards the rivers the mass concentration at the first point p1 located at 1 km from the sea showed minimum average monthly salinity of 1121 mg l in june 2012 and maximum 7700 mg l in march 2015 the mass flux was determined by multiplying the concentration mg l of the river hpoint by the exchange fluid flux m3 s between the river and groundwater due to the fast and high variation of river discharge ning et al 2001 compared to the salinity change between wet and dry seasons the mass flux between these two water bodies was dominated by the changing of fluid flux for example in point p1 during the dry season january may the mass flux from the underlying groundwater towards the river was slow and less than in the wet season and consequently a lower amount of fluid was exchanged between these two water bodies followed by lower river discharge yielding salinity rise in their interaction see fig 9a generally the results for p1 showed higher mass flux from the river to the sea due to this area s position adjacent to the sea and the high salinity of underlying groundwater the discharged salt into the sea varied between a minimum of 150 kg d and a maximum of 9000 kg d in january 2014 and september 2013 respectively by moving further inland the second point p2 showed slightly less salt transferring towards the river which reached its maximum of 8000 kg d at the end of july 2013 see fig 9b although the maximum fluid exchange occurred in june 2012 due to heavy rainfall the peak mass exchange happened at the end of july 2013 due to three consecutive high exchange flows during july and august 2013 the salt concentration varied between 1000 and 7000 mg l at this point during high rainfall and dry periods respectively by exchanging salt at the river bed from the underlying aquifer during the simulation time but this was not a considerable change as the range was still in the semi brackish water range the mass flux reached the highest level twice in 2015 due to an increase in the salinity of water in may and september at the third point p3 the salinity concentration changed from freshwater tds 1000 mg l in wet months to semi brackish water 1000 tds 10 000 mg l in dry periods the peak of fluid exchange occurred with heavy rainfall in june 2012 yielding the peak amounts of salt to be exchanged from top aquifer towards the river bed see fig 9c the fourth and fifth points located 4 and 5 km from the sea showed lower salinity concentration varying between 800 and 3400 mg l and 600 and 1800 mg l between wet and dry seasons respectively in the top layer of the aquifer system as with the other points the fluid flowed downward at a maximum of 0 05 and 0 06 m3 s in june 2012 at p4 and p5 respectively yielding maximum salt exchange at the same time see fig 9d e the salinity variation between wet and dry seasons in these two points was not as high as the three previous points causing the fluid flux to be the driving force in the salt transition the fluid flux in these points except in 2012 was on average at the same level which gave a similar trend for the rest of the simulation time from the vertical and plan views of the model the surface layer and top aquifer were under the influence of river effects the first aquifer in contact with the river bed had about 20 30 percent more salinity than the top surface layer which was in good agreement with the previous study wang et al 2009 the salinity of the underlying layers beneath the first aquifer did not change significantly along the river and almost maintained the trend as shown in a previous study dibaj et al 2020 3 3 seawater intrusion mitigation artificial recharge of groundwater is one of the effective methods for swi mitigation javadi et al 2015 for this purpose high quality water e g surface water treated waste water rainwater or desalinated water can be used to recharge the aquifer yielding a rise in inland piezometric heads and retaining the seaward gradient of the system selecting appropriate location s for recharge is very important for the recharge efficiency previous studies ting et al 1998a tu et al 2011 used pilot tests for estimating the groundwater recharge rate by selecting random locations as ponding areas in pingtung plain four locations were selected in parallel with the groundwater flow direction running from i lio river at north east towards the kaoping river at southwest to evaluate the soil permeability and texture impact on the recharge rate the results showed the upper first location and lower part second location of i lio river with coarse texture have higher rate of recharge tu et al 2011 this rate was decreased by moving towards the middle of the plain before reaching to kaoping river third location in mid fan and the lower parts of kaoping river fourth location which was in good agreement with textural change between these areas although the fourth location along the kaoping river possesses coarse texture allowing high input of rainfall and irrigation water through the land surface it showed lower contribution through the underlying aquifers however this location was likely located in river discharge area where the infiltrated water was possibly lost due to shallow drainage to adjacent canals or ditches tu et al 2011 this location was also intruded by seawater which was not a good option for surface recharging ponding the present study used recharge wells for recharge purpose using the excess of river water based on the river flow and river inundation results in agricultural fields based on the river model results see fig 11 and available land use data collected from national land surveying and mapping centre fig 1 the conjunction point of kaoping and cishan rivers indicated the maximum river discharge this is where a weir has already been constructed to regulate the river flow moea the ecological base flow at downstream of the kaoping weir is 37 m3 s moea this location was selected as first artificial recharge using river as water source maintaining the ecological base flow in rivers is crucial for heath of river ecological system by not exceeding 37 m3 s for abstraction although artificial recharge could reduce seawater intrusion its efficiency could be increased by choosing a recharge source adjacent to the toe of the saltwater wedge hussain et al 2019 for this purpose the kaoping river downstream around chainage 43 295 m which had the potential for maximum river inundation see fig 11 was selected as the second source of water for artificial recharge the details of maximum river discharge and inundation area values in these two chainages along kaoping river profile are illustrated in supplementary material as data 3 the results showed that an appropriate rate for recharge would be between 2 10 5 and 8 10 5 m3 d see table 2 the rates less than 2 10 5 m3 d showed negligible effects on the transition of the saltwater wedge this study applied injection wells direct recharge screening at the entire depth of aquifer system which were the best option compared to surface infiltration for this area considering the high rate of evaporation yeh and chen 2004 permeability of soil and underlying confined layers especially in the distal fan on the transition of saline water seawards distance with tds 10 000 mg l is illustrated in table 2 along the dedicated cross sections the results show that the toe of the saline water interface in the south east of the plain along cross section a a had less than 100 m seaward movement through both recharge sources see table 2 however by moving towards the middle of the domain the saline water zone 10 000 tds 35 000 mg l showed more seaward transition along cross section b b reaching a maximum of about 100 and 300 m through the aquifer layers due to artificially recharging from cishan river downstream first location and kaoping river downstream second location respectively recharging near the toe location around kaoping river downstream was more effective in moving the saline water towards the sea compared to the recharge from the upstream point the conjunction point of kaoping and cishan rivers see table 2 this was also in good agreement with the pervious literature showing the lower part of kaoping river had more potential for recharge tu et al 2011 compared to the top and bottom aquifers seawater was less intruded in the middle aquifer also the middle aquifer showed a slower reaction to the recharge compared to the other two aquifers from the results it can be concluded that seawater intrusion can be mitigated by choosing kaoping river downstream as a recharging source also the results in table 2 show that recharge rates between 2 105 and 6 105 m3 day lead to a sharper decline in inland intrusion of seawater compared to rates between 6 105 and 8 105 m3 d which show a gradual pattern choosing rates higher than 8 105 m3 d did not cause a significant change in the results 4 conclusion a 3 d transient density dependent finite element model for groundwater flow and solute transport was developed the developed model was coupled with a 1 d river network model for integrated simulation of groundwater flow surface water flow and seawater intrusion in pingtung plain a meticulous calibration and validation was conducted on the model using real data the developed coupled model is capable of analysing the flow and transient interaction between the aquifer system and rivers also the effects of occurrence time intensity and duration of precipitation on the groundwater surface water interaction and lag time were investigated the results showed that the groundwater in the proximal fan has the slowest reaction time to heavy rainfall whilst the lowest delay was observed in the distal fan it can be concluded that the top layer of the aquifer system was less intruded due to fresh river water discharge pushing back the saline water seaward at the beginning of the simulation however with time the kaoping river mouth acted as the main pathway letting seawater inland through river bed towards the top aquifer at the end of the simulation time the middle aquifer located between two large confining layers was less intruded compared to the first and third aquifers while seawater at the bottom aquifer showed farther inland encroachment the inland distance of seawater was examined along 4 cross sections in the right middle along kaoping river and left side of the plain the east side of the plain showed shortest intrusion distance and it was almost unchanged during the simulation period due to natural groundwater recharge and higher groundwater level however by moving towards the middle and west side of the plain the inland encroachment of seawater extended significantly the results of monthly variation of salinity of water in the mixing zone of kaoping river and taiwan strait illustrated the exchange of mass flux between river and groundwater it highlighted the effect of precipitation on exchanging fluid flux between river and the underlying aquifer during wet and dry seasons the developed model was able to determine the appropriate locations for artificial groundwater recharge for swi mitigation the conjunction of kaoping river and cishan river where the river flow reached its peak was selected as the first location to apply injection well using the excess of river water the kaoping river downstream which was vulnerable to inundation was selected as the second location for recharge the resulted seaward movement of seawater highlighted the effectiveness of applying recharge wells near toe location the developed model has some limitations the storativity parameter for the entire model was assigned as the default value of the software due to lack of data the river water was assumed as fresh water and the exchange mass flux was considered only from groundwater towards the river also the rate of pumping wells was only available for one specific period of time with no information about their screening depth the same rates were applied for the consecutive years considering the screening in the entire depth of the aquifer system funding the authors would like to thank dhi group for providing the feflow and mike software packages

8192,study region athabasca river basin arb in alberta canada study focus understanding the historical streamflow variability within basins is crucial to reduce the effect of utmost events such as drought and floods on agriculture fishery and other human activities the least squares wavelet software lswave is applied to estimate the trend and seasonal components of sixty year long climate and discharge time series and to study the impact of climate change on streamflow over time new hydrological insights for the region the seasonal components of the discharge and precipitation time series including annual and semi annual are coherent with phase discrepancy the mean temperature has been gradually increasing since 1960 and it is projected to increase by approximately 2 c during the mid century which may reduce the snowpack volume during the spring from the recurring pattern of spectral peaks in the spectrograms and jumps in the trend component of streamflow time series the blue water is projected to increase during the mid century in particular in early 2030s the results also highlight the potential of lswave in analyzing climate and hydrological time series without any need for interpolation gap filling and de spiking keywords climate change coherency analysis data gaps spectral analysis trend analysis water flow analysis 1 introduction an understanding of spatial and temporal variability of streamflow and its relationship with climate change in a region not only can enhance our hydrological and ecological knowledge but it can also help to improve forecasting and reducing the impact of extreme events including floods and drought within the region on human activities payne et al 2004 schultea et al 2016 eum et al 2017 there are many challenges in hydrological processes most of which arise from the quality and quantity of measurements and uncertainties in the measurements furthermore climate and hydrological data often contain inter and intra annual variations that must be considered when studying both short and long term changes within a region a time series is a sequence of measurements observations recorded over time time indexed time series in many practical applications are not sampled at equally spaced time intervals unequally spaced and may have associated covariance matrices that contain the variances of measurements and the co variances between the measurements vaníček 1969 proposed the least squares spectral analysis lssa to analyze unequally spaced time series in the frequency domain unlike the fourier transform lssa can analyze unequally spaced time series and can consider the associated covariance matrices craymer 1998 mallat 1999 the anti leakage least squares spectral analysis allssa is an improved version of lssa that uses the original data to iteratively decide whether there are any statistically significant components in the time series thus allssa finds an optimal series of functions e g sinusoids and trends that simultaneously fit best to the time series which can prevent over under fitting problems like the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator tibshirani 1996 zhu et al 2015 for regularization and forecasting purposes allssa performs better than the ordinary least squares method ghaderpour et al 2018b ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020a b the relationship between climate change and streamflow is not straightforward the climate and streamflow time series usually contain inter and intra annual components that can be scrutinized in the time frequency domain wavelet analysis is a robust approach for investigating whether such components exist and how they are varying over time the continuous wavelet transform cwt transforms an equally spaced time series without gaps and missing values into the time scale or time frequency domain and obtains a scalogram or a spectrogram respectively torrence and compo 1998 mallat 1999 the cross wavelet transform xwt is also based on cwt proposed for the sake of analyzing two non stationary time series together in the time scale or time frequency domain torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 the time series in xwt must however be equally spaced with the same time distributions same sampling rates cwt and xwt are widely used to analyze climate and hydrological time series labat 2008 schultea et al 2016 azuara et al 2020 liu et al 2020 for example labat 2008 and schultea et al 2016 applied cwt using the morlet wavelet and found annual and intra annual components in the streamflow time series of rivers across the mid atlantic region and they further investigated the impact of climate on streamflow via xwt other wavelet analyses are also increasingly used in hydrology such as wavelet coherence analysis graf et al 2014 fang et al 2015 and the hilbert huang transform rudi et al 2010 on the other hand the least squares wavelet analysis lswa and the least squares cross wavelet analysis lscwa natural extensions of lssa decompose the time series into the time frequency domain and can be directly applied to any type of time series i e the time series do not have to be equally spaced and they can have any time distributions ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 ghaderpour et al 2018a lswa and lscwa can also consider the covariance matrices associated with the time series and provide higher time frequency resolution spectrograms and more accurate amplitude estimation as compared to cwt and xwt see the supplementary materials and ghaderpour 2018 lssa allssa lswa and lscwa are the main tools in the least squares wavelet software lswave 1 1 lswave https www ngs noaa gov gps toolbox lswave htm updates https github com ghaderpour lswave signalprocessing ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2019 describes lswave in detail the athabasca river basin arb one of the major watershed in alberta and widely studied by many researchers bawden et al 2014 eum et al 2017 hwang et al 2018 du et al 2019 is chosen herein to show how lswave can be used to study the streamflow variability over several decades and to show how climate change may have impacted the streamflow the streamflow simulation has successfully been implemented using process based models for example shrestha et al 2017 shrestha and wang 2018 simulated the effects of climate change on streamflow freshwater resources and sediment using the soil and water assessment tool swat in arb also dibike et al 2018 investigated the snow response of the athabasca watershed to projected climate using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model and statistically downscaled future climate data from a selected set of cmip5 global climate models gcms forced with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emissions scenarios the main goal of this research is to highlight the potential of lswave in analyzing climate and hydrological time series as they are provided without any need for pre processing including interpolation gap filling and de spiking the gradual and seasonal changes in streamflow over time are rigorously investigated via lswave applied to the streamflow data acquired at eight major hydrometric stations along the athabasca river from spatiotemporal analysis of climate data and recurring spectral patterns in the spectrograms some projections for blue water resources and climate for the mid century are made and compared with previous results furthermore for the sake of comparisons and completeness other popular and traditional methods such as hydrographs box plots and flow duration curves are also described herein and applied to the climate and streamflow data sets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region arb is a region of approximately 150 000 km2 which covers about 24 of alberta s landmass see fig 1 the athabasca river the longest undammed river in the canadian prairies begins at the columbia glacier in jasper national park and travels the region about 1300 km toward the northeast and flows through the peace athabasca delta into lake athabasca du et al 2019 the range of basin elevation is from 185 m near lake athabasca to about 3700 m above sea level in the mountainous areas near jasper bawden et al 2014 the basin is divided into a series of subbasins as shown in fig 1 the athabasca river passes the towns of jasper hinton whitecourt athabasca and fort mcmurray where there are hydrological stations that have been continuously measuring the streamflow since the 1960s see p1 p5 in fig 1 approximately 82 of the region is forested and 9 5 is agricultural land du et al 2019 forestry agriculture tourism oil and gas extraction coal and oil sand mining are the major activities in this region 2 2 data sets and pre processing the historical climate data i e the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures and daily precipitation since 1960 within alberta are provided by the alberta agriculture and forestry government of alberta 2 2 climate data sets https agriculture alberta ca acis the climate data have a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree in both latitude and longitude townships estimated by a mathematical data interpolation procedure that weighs up to several nearest station observations ruan et al 2016 eum and gupta 2019 generally the climate data are less reliable in the mountainous areas toward the southwest of the basin due to several factors such as sparse observation network topographic complexity and orographic effects eum and gupta 2019 the geographic coordinates of the hydrological stations with their drainage areas and elevations are listed in table 1 the discharge data sets are provided by the government of canada 3 3 streamflow data sets https wateroffice ec gc ca search historical e html herein five primary stations denoted by letter p and three secondary stations denoted by letter s with continuous recorded measurements and relatively large drainage areas are analyzed the discharge time series have many missing values and data gaps in particular for p1 p2 p3 and s3 the data gaps are mostly during the winter period from november to mid april due to several reasons such as ice condition backwater equipment damage and malfunctioning of the recording system kundzewicz and robson 2004 slater and villarini 2016 the spectral and wavelet analyses performed herein leave the data gaps as they are without any need for gap filling 2 3 methods in this section the traditional tools such as box plots hydrographs and flow duration curves are described first then the least squares spectral and wavelet analyses are briefly described and the reader is referred to the supplementary materials for their mathematical details and some quantitative results 2 3 1 box plots box plots are frequently used for demonstrating basic statistics of data sets including their medians quartiles and outliers a box plot conventionally uses five values from a data set upper and lower extremes upper and lower hinges quartiles the box edges and the median inside the box mcgill et al 1978 the outliers are data points located outside the whiskers of the box plot i e data points whose values are beyond the extremes 2 3 2 hydrographs herein hydrographs for a discharge time series are simply obtained as follows 1 for monthly hydrographs over years the monthly minimum mean and maximum of the discharge values are obtained for each year 2 for each day of the year the historical minimum mean and maximum of the discharge values are obtained for that day since 1960 thus three graphs are obtained corresponding to the historical minimum mean and maximum discharge values illustrated in one figure herein 2 3 3 flow duration curve flow duration curve is another popular graphical tool that demonstrates the discharge that equaled or exceeded some percent of the time for a catchment or drainage area foster 1934 vogel and fennessey 1994 the time unit used in calculating a flow duration curve affects its appearance a commonly used time unit is the mean daily discharge li et al 2010 suppose that n is the total number of discharge daily values first sort the daily discharge in descending order and then assign a rank λ 1 λ n to each discharge value starting with 1 for the largest daily discharge value finally calculate the exceedance probability as follows 1 p λ n 1 λ 1 2 n which shows the probability that a given flow will be equaled or exceeded 2 3 4 least squares spectral analysis lssa lssa obtains a frequency spectrum for a given time series which may not be equally spaced vaníček 1969 lomb 1976 the spectrum is obtained by fitting the sinusoids to the entire time series without any need for pre processing of the original measurements including interpolation gap filling de spiking etc craymer 1998 pagiatakis 1999 the anti leakage lssa allssa is an iterative method based on lssa that finds an optimal set of sinusoids that along with the initial constituents e g trends simultaneously fit best the time series ghaderpour et al 2018b allssa compared to lssa especially when the time series is unequally spaced can therefore increase the accuracy of signal estimation as it simultaneously considers the correlation among the constituents of known forms and the sinusoidal functions of different frequencies that can be any real numbers the anti leakage least squares spectrum allss shows the estimated amplitudes of statistically significant signals in the time series ghaderpour et al 2018b 2 3 5 least squares wavelet analysis lswa lswa is a natural extension of lssa in that it decomposes the time series into the time frequency domain rather than into the frequency domain ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 this allows the detection of both short and long duration signals with the variability of frequencies and amplitudes over time in other words the estimated amplitudes and phases of the time series components are localized in time and frequency neighborhoods following the heisenberg uncertainty principle like in cwt mallat 1999 chapter 1 3 lswa segments the time series frequency wise i e as the frequency increases the segment size decreases and vice versa therefore an amplitude and or normalized spectrogram lsws will be obtained which shows how the amplitude and or percentage variance of the time series components change over time and frequency ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 using a gaussian function one may assign higher weights to the observations toward the center of segments and lower weights to the observations toward both ends of the segment to mitigate the spectral leakages and smooth the spectral peaks in the spectrograms ghaderpour 2018 chapter 2 7 this selection for the weights will adapt the sinusoidal basis functions to the morlet wavelet in the least squares sense foster 1996 torrence and compo 1998 2 3 6 least squares cross wavelet analysis lscwa lscwa is a robust method of analyzing two time series together e g discharge and precipitation time series for investigating the coherency and phase differences between the components of both time series in the time frequency domain like xwt grinsted et al 2004 ghaderpour et al 2018a since the time distributions of the time series may not be the same one may choose a common set of times for both time series e g the union of the times in both time series and compute a normalized spectrogram for each time series the least squares cross wavelet spectrogram lscws is defined by the product of the two spectrograms which shows the coherency of the components in percentage variance when multiplied by 100 if the values of lscws are closer to 100 then the components of both series are highly coherent within the corresponding time frequency neighborhoods and they are incoherent for values closer to 0 the phase differences in lscws show how much the components of the second time series lead lag the ones in the first time series like in xwt the phase difference is usually displayed by an arrow on lscws following the trigonometric circle principle thus arrows pointing to the right and left mean the components are in phase and out of phase respectively ghaderpour et al 2018a preferably the arrows can be displayed only for the peaks in lscws whose percentage values are the highest among the values of neighboring peaks the least squares cross spectral analysis lscsa is a special case of lscwa which multiplies the least squares spectra lsss of both time series to obtain a cross spectrum lscs and no windowing strategy is applied therefore lscsa is not suitable for estimating the phase differences of unstable components over time as it averages them out similarly for the signal estimation like lssa vs lswa finally the statistical properties of lscwa and lscsa follow from the normality assumption of time series like in lssa and lswa ghaderpour et al 2018a 2 3 7 trend analysis to investigate gradual changes over decades rather than an overall gradual change for the entire discharge time series the jumps upon spectrum and trend just is also applied herein to find potential jumps in the trend component of the time series ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020a just applies an appropriate windowing segmentation technique to find an optimal set of jump locations in the trend component of the time series herein a window covering approximately a decade of data is selected that translates over time by four year steps within each translating window a linear trend with two pieces will be estimated that minimizes the residual norm see supplementary section 1 following this process an optimal jump location for the linear trend within each window is estimated finally only the jumps will be selected whose locations are closest to the window locations where they were estimated and are at least a decade apart from each other ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020a ghaderpour 2021 describes the just software in detail freely available online in both matlab and python 4 4 just https geodesy noaa gov gps toolbox just htm the estimated daily climate data are used herein for equally spaced grids that are 0 1 degrees apart in both latitude and longitude within arb and alberta s border for each spatial grid the means of time series for the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and annual precipitation are calculated furthermore for each spatial grid and each year since 1960 the average of daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures are calculated to obtain two time series of size sixty each similarly the daily precipitations are added within each year to obtain an annual precipitation time series for each spatial grid then just is applied to each time series of size sixty to estimate the overall linear trend for each of the annual mean of daily maximum and minimum temperature as well as for the annual precipitation time series therefore six sets of spatial data points for the region within alberta s border are obtained where the value of each data point in a set is either the average climate value or the rate of change of climate values since 1960 finally the triangulated irregular network tin interpolation mitas and mitasova 1999 a popular method in geographic information system gis is applied to generate the climate maps for arb in this study 3 results 3 1 climate data analyses figure 2 shows the climate variation results for arb since the southwest part of the region near jasper p1 is by the rocky mountains it is generally colder than the rest of the region with higher average annual precipitation about 700 mm the north part of the region above fort mcmurray is colder than the center of the region and the trend analysis result shows that the north part is getting warmer at a faster rate compared to the central region since 1960 from the six sets of spatial data points before the tin interpolation the maximum and minimum temperatures of 99 and 97 the region have been increasing by 0 029 and 0 034 c a on average respectively moreover the annual precipitation of 91 of the region has been decreasing by 1 56 mm a since 1960 to further investigate the temporal variability of climate data the region within alberta s border is divided into two sub regions namely the southern and northern regions using the red dashed line shown in fig 1 the historical monthly box plots of the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures for the basin within alberta s border and the southern and northern regions are illustrated in fig 3 furthermore the monthly accumulated precipitations are calculated and their corresponding historical box plots are shown in the bottom three panels of fig 3 the blue circles in these panels are the outliers and the red solid lines inside the boxes are the medians of the historical data sets since 1960 from the box plots one can observe that months of january and july are the coldest and warmest months for the region and sub regions the trend spectral and wavelet analyses of the daily maximum daily minimum and daily precipitation time series for the northern region are illustrated in fig 4 for the sake of brevity such climate analyses are shown only for the northern region to show how one may investigate the impact of climate change on the streamflow using theses analyses herein the northern region is chosen to investigate how the precipitation may have affected the flow near fort mcmurray p5 with the highest drainage area 133 000 km2 after the flow is measured at athabasca p4 the estimated linear trends using the simple and simultaneous season trend fit models are shown by the solid red and green lines in the time series panels in fig 4 respectively from table 2 one can see that the estimated intercepts and slopes of the linear trends are approximately the same using both models in these cases the allssa amplitude spectra whose estimated linear trends are shown by the solid green lines are illustrated in the left panels of fig 4 lswss representing the estimated amplitudes are shown under the time series panels from lswss in fig 4a and b both daily maximum and daily minimum temperature time series show almost stable dominant annual components over time see the reddish horizontal band of spectra at one cycle year from fig 4c lsws shows annual and semi annual components and many other short duration higher frequency components with amplitude variability over time for the daily precipitation series 3 2 streamflow analyses the monthly hydrographs of the discharge time series since 1960 are shown in fig 5 from this figure one can observe that the seasonal component of streamflow in arb may be simulated by asymmetric gaussian functions as demonstrated in the supplementary materials the sixty year hydrographs of the discharge time series since 1960 are also illustrated in fig 6 the maximum flows of more than 2000 4000 4500 m3 s are observed in july at stations p3 p4 p5 respectively see fig 6c d and e the least overall streamflow is also observed in fig 6h s3 fig 6d h also show large peaks during april and may for the daily maximum historical discharge figure 7 shows the flow duration curves of the discharge data measured at the eight stations from the left panel in this figure it can be seen that the probability that the flow at the athabasca river below fort mcmurray exceeds 1000 m3 s is 0 2 while at athabasca is 0 1 see the blue solid and black dashed lines the right panel also shows that the probability that the flow at the clearwater river above christina river exceeds 100 m3 s is 0 2 while with the same probability flow exceeds 50 m3 s for the pembina river at jarvie see the blue solid and red dashed lines furthermore the flow in none of the curves in the right panel corresponding to stations p1 s1 s2 and s3 exceeds 1000 m3 s the box plots of the historical discharge data sets for the eight stations are shown in fig 8 the largest and smallest medians are for the discharge data sets corresponding to p5 457 m3 s and s1 14 m3 s respectively the outliers are shown by the blue circles from the box plots one can observe that the discharge values generally increase from p1 to p5 mainly due to flowing water into the athabasca river from other smaller streams and rivers such as the pembina river s1 and clearwater river s2 the daily discharge time series corresponding to each station along with the estimated linear trends using simple and simultaneous season trend fit models are illustrated in blue red and green lines respectively in figs 9 and 10 the estimated intercepts and slopes of the linear trends via each model are listed in table 3 the estimated intercepts and slopes using allssa are more accurate with lower uncertainties errors as compared to the simple model especially for unequally spaced time series considering the errors these results are approximately the same for all the time series except for p3 and s3 see figs 9b and 10d one of the main reasons that the slope difference is significant for p3 is the consistent data gaps during the winter since 1979 where the presumably smaller discharge values are missing making the simple trend fit unrealistic similarly the consistent data gaps from 1967 to 1976 and from 1997 to 2014 during winter for s3 significantly increased the estimated intercept via the simple fit that is less reliable compared to the simultaneous season trend fit see fig 10d and table 3 the gradual temperature increase by about 0 03 c a and annual precipitation decrease by about 1 5 mm a in arb are likely the main factors that have reduced the streamflow gradually since 1960 as listed in table 3 the quadratic trend and seasonal components are also fitted to the discharge time series for p4 and p5 but the results show almost the same decreasing rate in streamflow since 1960 only the linear trend results are shown herein to provide an overall estimate for changing streamflow since 1960 note that the overall decreasing or increasing linear trend since 1960 may not however be a reliable forecast for the mid and late 21st century figures 9 and 10 also show allsss and lswss of each time series from the amplitude spectra and spectrograms one can see that the annual components have the highest amplitudes in all the eight discharge time series the semi annual components followed by the higher frequency components have more amplitude variability over time for all the eight time series fig 9b shows higher amplitude for the semi annual component since 1979 this is mainly due to the presence of consistent data gaps during the winter since 1979 where the presumably lower and flatter discharge values are missing similarly for fig 10d see the supplementary materials for more details slater and villarini 2016 ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020b jumps in the trend component of a hydrological time series may occur due to various events such as floods and drought and human induced changes including urbanization deforestation and water diversions farsi et al 2020 to investigate whether there are any significant jumps in the trend component of the time series just is applied to estimate the jump locations in the trend component of each time series by allowing them to be at least a decade apart the estimated trend results are illustrated in fig 11 the most significant jumps are detected for p4 and p5 in april 1971 may 1989 and april 2011 see the black and blue broken lines as listed in table 3 the estimated trends for the entire time series show gradual reductions in discharge values except for p1 3 3 coherency analysis to see how the flow fluctuation at athabasca p4 impacts the flow below fort mcmurray p5 lscsa and lscwa are applied to their corresponding discharge time series and the results are demonstrated in fig 12 the white arrows displayed on lscwss represent the phase differences between the components of the first p5 and the second p4 time series following the trigonometric circle principle the top lscws shows strong coherency between the annual components of both discharge time series with an overall phase difference of 2 degrees estimated by lscsa which indicates that the amplitude of the annual component for p5 reaches its maximum about two days after the one for p4 the bottom lscs and lscws in fig 12 are obtained by suppressing the annual peaks i e by removing the annual components while considering their removal effects in the residual series note that almost all the arrows displayed on the most coherent components are pointing to the southeast falling in the fourth quadrant meaning that the components of the time series for p4 lead the ones for p5 for the arrows as an example note that an angle of 14 degrees at 10 cycles year is equivalent to an angle of 2 degrees at 1 cycle year when converted to time both means about two days lag lead toward the athabasca river path from athabasca p4 to fort mcmurray p5 many streams in the nearby subbasins flow into the athabasca river and result in an increase in the flow at p5 as compared to p4 one of the main sources of the discrepancy in the discharge values measured at p4 and p5 is the water flowing into the athabasca river from the clearwater river s2 from the bottom left panel in fig 2 the means of the annual precipitation time series are almost the same across the northern region and so the coherency analysis between the discharge time series at p5 and the precipitation time series for the northern region is generally a logical approach figure 13 shows the lscsa and lscwa of these two time series from the cross spectrograms one can observe that the seasonal components are coherent in particular the annual and semi annual components the annual and semi annual components of the precipitation time series generally lead the ones in the discharge time series by a few days from the direction of the arrows the phase differences at the higher frequencies are up to several days for example the single arrow displayed at 11 8 cycles year one month in 2005 in the top lscws has an angle of ψ 94 degrees meaning that the monthly component of the precipitation time series in 2005 leads the one in the discharge time series by about eight days the bottom lscs and lscws are obtained by suppressing the annual peaks from both time series the percentage variances between the annual and semi annual components in fig 13 are less than the ones shown in fig 12 indicating comparatively lower coherency see the maximum of 8 and 4 vs 50 and 25 in the color bars lscwa can also be applied to the discharge and precipitation time series corresponding to each subbasin to investigate the coherency and phase differences more accurately 4 discussion the spectral and wavelet analyses presented herein did not require any interpolation gap filling and de spiking of the original measurements highlighting one of the main advantages of lswave as compared to cwt and xwt ghaderpour et al 2018a the spectrograms showed significantly higher annual and semi annual amplitudes in the early 1970s 1990s and 2010s for all the eight time series in particular for p1 to p5 the high amplitude peaks in the spectrograms shown in figs 9 and 10 may correspond to the historical flood events for example in june 2013 arb experienced a significant and devastating flood event on the hangingstone and clearwater rivers upstream of fort mcmurray mainly as a result of ice jams heavy rainfall and subsequent high flows in the hagingstone river according to the reports by the government of alberta the impact of this flood event on the discharge time series and their corresponding spectrograms can be observed in fig 10c and d see the red arrows and consequently in fig 9d for forecasting purposes one may expect to see similar seasonal amplitudes in the early 2030s provided that other conditions impacting the flow will not drastically change such pattern cannot be observed in lssa or allssa because their results are only in the frequency domain not in the time frequency domain segmentation allows a better fit of harmonics and linear trend to the series especially when the time series has components with variability of frequency and amplitude over time of course quadratic and cubic trends may also be used in just however as a simple estimate for the rate of change of flow over decades the linear trend is considered herein the just results illustrated in fig 11 also showed significant jumps in the trend component of discharge series for p4 and p5 with relatively higher drainage areas around years 1970 1990 and 2010 and so one may expect to observe a significant jump in the early 2030s for the flow at p4 and p5 as well from lscsa and lscwa the precipitation and temperature were found to be two of the main drivers of the streamflow fluctuation for arb unlike the correlation analysis that shows a possible relationship between climate and flow values the coherency analysis shows how the signals are coherent in the frequency or time frequency domain that along with the phase difference information provides a more robust result for example fig 13 showed that the coherent annual semi annual and higher frequency signals of the daily precipitation generally lead the ones in the streamflow providing such phase relationship between the components of both time series is extremely helpful in forestry precision agriculture and streamflow forecasting note that the variances of coherent signals were below 10 that shows other factors such as vegetation and soil moisture may have also significantly impacted the streamflow the results herein showed that the mean temperature of arb has increased by about 2 c since 1960 the mean temperature is projected to increase by approximately 2 c for the mid century 2021 2060 that is consistent with the observations made by leong and donner 2015 and shrestha et al 2017 eum et al 2017 used the ensemble mean of several gcms and reported an increase of 7 10 mean annual precipitation in arb during the mid century therefore due to increased snowmelt as the result of temperature increase one may expect that the blue water increases during the mid century in arb shrestha et al 2017 however this may also decrease the snowpack volume for the spring freshet as for the streamflow simulation one would expect wider left tail for the asymmetric gaussian function demonstrated in supplementary fig 3 from the recurring patterns of spectral peaks in the spectrograms shown in figs 10 and 11 one may deduce that the water resources in arb may increase in 2030s which somewhat agrees with the observations made by shrestha et al 2017 the lower elevated regions of arb e g below fort mcmurray may also experience a substantial increase in spring season blue water yield since about 82 of the region is forested one may investigate the relationships between the precipitation and plant root mechanism and water absorption via coherency analysis of satellite data to get an insight on how much delay is expected for a change to occur in streamflow after precipitation particularly crucial for forecasting and mitigating drought and flood strong and la roi 1983 xu et al 2019 ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020b inverse modeling methods are not usually related to any control equations such as richards equation richards 1931 streamflow is one of key hydrological parameters which is very complex in nature depending on soil types vegetation topology and weather condition lswa results presented herein have only shown how the seasonal component of the streamflow has changed over time while the lscwa has shown the possible coherency between the components of climate and streamflow time series 5 conclusions in this contribution the sixty year long streamflow temperature and precipitation time series for arb were analyzed using several methods where each method provided certain and useful information although traditional tools such as box plots hydrographs and flow duration curves provide specific information about the hydrological data they cannot clearly show the components of the data and how they change over time for example from the flow duration curves illustrated in fig 7 it is predicted that the probability that streamflow exceeds 1000 m3 s along the athabasca river is less than 0 2 during the mid century furthermore these tools cannot be used to investigate how climate change influences the streamflow because they provide no phase information and no coherency correlation on the other hand wavelet and cross wavelet analyses clearly show how the components of the data change over time and how climate change may impact the streamflow over time the trend analyses showed gradual changes in the time series values the simultaneous season trend fit using the spectral analysis showed more reliable results for estimating the trend component of the discharge time series as compared to the traditional regression method simple fit especially for unequally spaced time series with data gaps the spectral analysis provided the amplitudes and frequencies of the inter and intra annual components while the spectrograms also showed amplitude variability of these components over time all the eight streamflow time series showed statistically significant annual and semi annual components with variability of amplitudes over time as well as other short duration high frequency components that were linked to the climate change via the coherency analyses from the recurring patterns in the spectrograms and trend results it is projected that the blue water resources may increase during the mid century in particular below fort mcmurray therefore it is crucial for hydrological and climate studies to consider seasonal variations along with gradual changes in the ecology and hydrology of watersheds it is expected that such spectral and wavelet analyses can also help to provide more reliable climate and hydrological forecasts as demonstrated in the supplementary materials lswave can estimate the trend and seasonal components more accurately than the traditional regression analysis and cwt without any need for interpolation and repairing the data the tools in the lswave and just software packages can also estimate the signals more accurately by considering the observational uncertainties limitations of this study include 1 the proposed spectral and wavelet methods were only applied to discharge and climate data without considering other factors such as soil profile topology and vegetation and 2 the analyses of discharge time series were shown for only eight hydrometric stations

8192,study region athabasca river basin arb in alberta canada study focus understanding the historical streamflow variability within basins is crucial to reduce the effect of utmost events such as drought and floods on agriculture fishery and other human activities the least squares wavelet software lswave is applied to estimate the trend and seasonal components of sixty year long climate and discharge time series and to study the impact of climate change on streamflow over time new hydrological insights for the region the seasonal components of the discharge and precipitation time series including annual and semi annual are coherent with phase discrepancy the mean temperature has been gradually increasing since 1960 and it is projected to increase by approximately 2 c during the mid century which may reduce the snowpack volume during the spring from the recurring pattern of spectral peaks in the spectrograms and jumps in the trend component of streamflow time series the blue water is projected to increase during the mid century in particular in early 2030s the results also highlight the potential of lswave in analyzing climate and hydrological time series without any need for interpolation gap filling and de spiking keywords climate change coherency analysis data gaps spectral analysis trend analysis water flow analysis 1 introduction an understanding of spatial and temporal variability of streamflow and its relationship with climate change in a region not only can enhance our hydrological and ecological knowledge but it can also help to improve forecasting and reducing the impact of extreme events including floods and drought within the region on human activities payne et al 2004 schultea et al 2016 eum et al 2017 there are many challenges in hydrological processes most of which arise from the quality and quantity of measurements and uncertainties in the measurements furthermore climate and hydrological data often contain inter and intra annual variations that must be considered when studying both short and long term changes within a region a time series is a sequence of measurements observations recorded over time time indexed time series in many practical applications are not sampled at equally spaced time intervals unequally spaced and may have associated covariance matrices that contain the variances of measurements and the co variances between the measurements vaníček 1969 proposed the least squares spectral analysis lssa to analyze unequally spaced time series in the frequency domain unlike the fourier transform lssa can analyze unequally spaced time series and can consider the associated covariance matrices craymer 1998 mallat 1999 the anti leakage least squares spectral analysis allssa is an improved version of lssa that uses the original data to iteratively decide whether there are any statistically significant components in the time series thus allssa finds an optimal series of functions e g sinusoids and trends that simultaneously fit best to the time series which can prevent over under fitting problems like the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator tibshirani 1996 zhu et al 2015 for regularization and forecasting purposes allssa performs better than the ordinary least squares method ghaderpour et al 2018b ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020a b the relationship between climate change and streamflow is not straightforward the climate and streamflow time series usually contain inter and intra annual components that can be scrutinized in the time frequency domain wavelet analysis is a robust approach for investigating whether such components exist and how they are varying over time the continuous wavelet transform cwt transforms an equally spaced time series without gaps and missing values into the time scale or time frequency domain and obtains a scalogram or a spectrogram respectively torrence and compo 1998 mallat 1999 the cross wavelet transform xwt is also based on cwt proposed for the sake of analyzing two non stationary time series together in the time scale or time frequency domain torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 the time series in xwt must however be equally spaced with the same time distributions same sampling rates cwt and xwt are widely used to analyze climate and hydrological time series labat 2008 schultea et al 2016 azuara et al 2020 liu et al 2020 for example labat 2008 and schultea et al 2016 applied cwt using the morlet wavelet and found annual and intra annual components in the streamflow time series of rivers across the mid atlantic region and they further investigated the impact of climate on streamflow via xwt other wavelet analyses are also increasingly used in hydrology such as wavelet coherence analysis graf et al 2014 fang et al 2015 and the hilbert huang transform rudi et al 2010 on the other hand the least squares wavelet analysis lswa and the least squares cross wavelet analysis lscwa natural extensions of lssa decompose the time series into the time frequency domain and can be directly applied to any type of time series i e the time series do not have to be equally spaced and they can have any time distributions ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 ghaderpour et al 2018a lswa and lscwa can also consider the covariance matrices associated with the time series and provide higher time frequency resolution spectrograms and more accurate amplitude estimation as compared to cwt and xwt see the supplementary materials and ghaderpour 2018 lssa allssa lswa and lscwa are the main tools in the least squares wavelet software lswave 1 1 lswave https www ngs noaa gov gps toolbox lswave htm updates https github com ghaderpour lswave signalprocessing ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2019 describes lswave in detail the athabasca river basin arb one of the major watershed in alberta and widely studied by many researchers bawden et al 2014 eum et al 2017 hwang et al 2018 du et al 2019 is chosen herein to show how lswave can be used to study the streamflow variability over several decades and to show how climate change may have impacted the streamflow the streamflow simulation has successfully been implemented using process based models for example shrestha et al 2017 shrestha and wang 2018 simulated the effects of climate change on streamflow freshwater resources and sediment using the soil and water assessment tool swat in arb also dibike et al 2018 investigated the snow response of the athabasca watershed to projected climate using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model and statistically downscaled future climate data from a selected set of cmip5 global climate models gcms forced with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emissions scenarios the main goal of this research is to highlight the potential of lswave in analyzing climate and hydrological time series as they are provided without any need for pre processing including interpolation gap filling and de spiking the gradual and seasonal changes in streamflow over time are rigorously investigated via lswave applied to the streamflow data acquired at eight major hydrometric stations along the athabasca river from spatiotemporal analysis of climate data and recurring spectral patterns in the spectrograms some projections for blue water resources and climate for the mid century are made and compared with previous results furthermore for the sake of comparisons and completeness other popular and traditional methods such as hydrographs box plots and flow duration curves are also described herein and applied to the climate and streamflow data sets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region arb is a region of approximately 150 000 km2 which covers about 24 of alberta s landmass see fig 1 the athabasca river the longest undammed river in the canadian prairies begins at the columbia glacier in jasper national park and travels the region about 1300 km toward the northeast and flows through the peace athabasca delta into lake athabasca du et al 2019 the range of basin elevation is from 185 m near lake athabasca to about 3700 m above sea level in the mountainous areas near jasper bawden et al 2014 the basin is divided into a series of subbasins as shown in fig 1 the athabasca river passes the towns of jasper hinton whitecourt athabasca and fort mcmurray where there are hydrological stations that have been continuously measuring the streamflow since the 1960s see p1 p5 in fig 1 approximately 82 of the region is forested and 9 5 is agricultural land du et al 2019 forestry agriculture tourism oil and gas extraction coal and oil sand mining are the major activities in this region 2 2 data sets and pre processing the historical climate data i e the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures and daily precipitation since 1960 within alberta are provided by the alberta agriculture and forestry government of alberta 2 2 climate data sets https agriculture alberta ca acis the climate data have a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree in both latitude and longitude townships estimated by a mathematical data interpolation procedure that weighs up to several nearest station observations ruan et al 2016 eum and gupta 2019 generally the climate data are less reliable in the mountainous areas toward the southwest of the basin due to several factors such as sparse observation network topographic complexity and orographic effects eum and gupta 2019 the geographic coordinates of the hydrological stations with their drainage areas and elevations are listed in table 1 the discharge data sets are provided by the government of canada 3 3 streamflow data sets https wateroffice ec gc ca search historical e html herein five primary stations denoted by letter p and three secondary stations denoted by letter s with continuous recorded measurements and relatively large drainage areas are analyzed the discharge time series have many missing values and data gaps in particular for p1 p2 p3 and s3 the data gaps are mostly during the winter period from november to mid april due to several reasons such as ice condition backwater equipment damage and malfunctioning of the recording system kundzewicz and robson 2004 slater and villarini 2016 the spectral and wavelet analyses performed herein leave the data gaps as they are without any need for gap filling 2 3 methods in this section the traditional tools such as box plots hydrographs and flow duration curves are described first then the least squares spectral and wavelet analyses are briefly described and the reader is referred to the supplementary materials for their mathematical details and some quantitative results 2 3 1 box plots box plots are frequently used for demonstrating basic statistics of data sets including their medians quartiles and outliers a box plot conventionally uses five values from a data set upper and lower extremes upper and lower hinges quartiles the box edges and the median inside the box mcgill et al 1978 the outliers are data points located outside the whiskers of the box plot i e data points whose values are beyond the extremes 2 3 2 hydrographs herein hydrographs for a discharge time series are simply obtained as follows 1 for monthly hydrographs over years the monthly minimum mean and maximum of the discharge values are obtained for each year 2 for each day of the year the historical minimum mean and maximum of the discharge values are obtained for that day since 1960 thus three graphs are obtained corresponding to the historical minimum mean and maximum discharge values illustrated in one figure herein 2 3 3 flow duration curve flow duration curve is another popular graphical tool that demonstrates the discharge that equaled or exceeded some percent of the time for a catchment or drainage area foster 1934 vogel and fennessey 1994 the time unit used in calculating a flow duration curve affects its appearance a commonly used time unit is the mean daily discharge li et al 2010 suppose that n is the total number of discharge daily values first sort the daily discharge in descending order and then assign a rank λ 1 λ n to each discharge value starting with 1 for the largest daily discharge value finally calculate the exceedance probability as follows 1 p λ n 1 λ 1 2 n which shows the probability that a given flow will be equaled or exceeded 2 3 4 least squares spectral analysis lssa lssa obtains a frequency spectrum for a given time series which may not be equally spaced vaníček 1969 lomb 1976 the spectrum is obtained by fitting the sinusoids to the entire time series without any need for pre processing of the original measurements including interpolation gap filling de spiking etc craymer 1998 pagiatakis 1999 the anti leakage lssa allssa is an iterative method based on lssa that finds an optimal set of sinusoids that along with the initial constituents e g trends simultaneously fit best the time series ghaderpour et al 2018b allssa compared to lssa especially when the time series is unequally spaced can therefore increase the accuracy of signal estimation as it simultaneously considers the correlation among the constituents of known forms and the sinusoidal functions of different frequencies that can be any real numbers the anti leakage least squares spectrum allss shows the estimated amplitudes of statistically significant signals in the time series ghaderpour et al 2018b 2 3 5 least squares wavelet analysis lswa lswa is a natural extension of lssa in that it decomposes the time series into the time frequency domain rather than into the frequency domain ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 this allows the detection of both short and long duration signals with the variability of frequencies and amplitudes over time in other words the estimated amplitudes and phases of the time series components are localized in time and frequency neighborhoods following the heisenberg uncertainty principle like in cwt mallat 1999 chapter 1 3 lswa segments the time series frequency wise i e as the frequency increases the segment size decreases and vice versa therefore an amplitude and or normalized spectrogram lsws will be obtained which shows how the amplitude and or percentage variance of the time series components change over time and frequency ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 using a gaussian function one may assign higher weights to the observations toward the center of segments and lower weights to the observations toward both ends of the segment to mitigate the spectral leakages and smooth the spectral peaks in the spectrograms ghaderpour 2018 chapter 2 7 this selection for the weights will adapt the sinusoidal basis functions to the morlet wavelet in the least squares sense foster 1996 torrence and compo 1998 2 3 6 least squares cross wavelet analysis lscwa lscwa is a robust method of analyzing two time series together e g discharge and precipitation time series for investigating the coherency and phase differences between the components of both time series in the time frequency domain like xwt grinsted et al 2004 ghaderpour et al 2018a since the time distributions of the time series may not be the same one may choose a common set of times for both time series e g the union of the times in both time series and compute a normalized spectrogram for each time series the least squares cross wavelet spectrogram lscws is defined by the product of the two spectrograms which shows the coherency of the components in percentage variance when multiplied by 100 if the values of lscws are closer to 100 then the components of both series are highly coherent within the corresponding time frequency neighborhoods and they are incoherent for values closer to 0 the phase differences in lscws show how much the components of the second time series lead lag the ones in the first time series like in xwt the phase difference is usually displayed by an arrow on lscws following the trigonometric circle principle thus arrows pointing to the right and left mean the components are in phase and out of phase respectively ghaderpour et al 2018a preferably the arrows can be displayed only for the peaks in lscws whose percentage values are the highest among the values of neighboring peaks the least squares cross spectral analysis lscsa is a special case of lscwa which multiplies the least squares spectra lsss of both time series to obtain a cross spectrum lscs and no windowing strategy is applied therefore lscsa is not suitable for estimating the phase differences of unstable components over time as it averages them out similarly for the signal estimation like lssa vs lswa finally the statistical properties of lscwa and lscsa follow from the normality assumption of time series like in lssa and lswa ghaderpour et al 2018a 2 3 7 trend analysis to investigate gradual changes over decades rather than an overall gradual change for the entire discharge time series the jumps upon spectrum and trend just is also applied herein to find potential jumps in the trend component of the time series ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020a just applies an appropriate windowing segmentation technique to find an optimal set of jump locations in the trend component of the time series herein a window covering approximately a decade of data is selected that translates over time by four year steps within each translating window a linear trend with two pieces will be estimated that minimizes the residual norm see supplementary section 1 following this process an optimal jump location for the linear trend within each window is estimated finally only the jumps will be selected whose locations are closest to the window locations where they were estimated and are at least a decade apart from each other ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020a ghaderpour 2021 describes the just software in detail freely available online in both matlab and python 4 4 just https geodesy noaa gov gps toolbox just htm the estimated daily climate data are used herein for equally spaced grids that are 0 1 degrees apart in both latitude and longitude within arb and alberta s border for each spatial grid the means of time series for the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and annual precipitation are calculated furthermore for each spatial grid and each year since 1960 the average of daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures are calculated to obtain two time series of size sixty each similarly the daily precipitations are added within each year to obtain an annual precipitation time series for each spatial grid then just is applied to each time series of size sixty to estimate the overall linear trend for each of the annual mean of daily maximum and minimum temperature as well as for the annual precipitation time series therefore six sets of spatial data points for the region within alberta s border are obtained where the value of each data point in a set is either the average climate value or the rate of change of climate values since 1960 finally the triangulated irregular network tin interpolation mitas and mitasova 1999 a popular method in geographic information system gis is applied to generate the climate maps for arb in this study 3 results 3 1 climate data analyses figure 2 shows the climate variation results for arb since the southwest part of the region near jasper p1 is by the rocky mountains it is generally colder than the rest of the region with higher average annual precipitation about 700 mm the north part of the region above fort mcmurray is colder than the center of the region and the trend analysis result shows that the north part is getting warmer at a faster rate compared to the central region since 1960 from the six sets of spatial data points before the tin interpolation the maximum and minimum temperatures of 99 and 97 the region have been increasing by 0 029 and 0 034 c a on average respectively moreover the annual precipitation of 91 of the region has been decreasing by 1 56 mm a since 1960 to further investigate the temporal variability of climate data the region within alberta s border is divided into two sub regions namely the southern and northern regions using the red dashed line shown in fig 1 the historical monthly box plots of the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures for the basin within alberta s border and the southern and northern regions are illustrated in fig 3 furthermore the monthly accumulated precipitations are calculated and their corresponding historical box plots are shown in the bottom three panels of fig 3 the blue circles in these panels are the outliers and the red solid lines inside the boxes are the medians of the historical data sets since 1960 from the box plots one can observe that months of january and july are the coldest and warmest months for the region and sub regions the trend spectral and wavelet analyses of the daily maximum daily minimum and daily precipitation time series for the northern region are illustrated in fig 4 for the sake of brevity such climate analyses are shown only for the northern region to show how one may investigate the impact of climate change on the streamflow using theses analyses herein the northern region is chosen to investigate how the precipitation may have affected the flow near fort mcmurray p5 with the highest drainage area 133 000 km2 after the flow is measured at athabasca p4 the estimated linear trends using the simple and simultaneous season trend fit models are shown by the solid red and green lines in the time series panels in fig 4 respectively from table 2 one can see that the estimated intercepts and slopes of the linear trends are approximately the same using both models in these cases the allssa amplitude spectra whose estimated linear trends are shown by the solid green lines are illustrated in the left panels of fig 4 lswss representing the estimated amplitudes are shown under the time series panels from lswss in fig 4a and b both daily maximum and daily minimum temperature time series show almost stable dominant annual components over time see the reddish horizontal band of spectra at one cycle year from fig 4c lsws shows annual and semi annual components and many other short duration higher frequency components with amplitude variability over time for the daily precipitation series 3 2 streamflow analyses the monthly hydrographs of the discharge time series since 1960 are shown in fig 5 from this figure one can observe that the seasonal component of streamflow in arb may be simulated by asymmetric gaussian functions as demonstrated in the supplementary materials the sixty year hydrographs of the discharge time series since 1960 are also illustrated in fig 6 the maximum flows of more than 2000 4000 4500 m3 s are observed in july at stations p3 p4 p5 respectively see fig 6c d and e the least overall streamflow is also observed in fig 6h s3 fig 6d h also show large peaks during april and may for the daily maximum historical discharge figure 7 shows the flow duration curves of the discharge data measured at the eight stations from the left panel in this figure it can be seen that the probability that the flow at the athabasca river below fort mcmurray exceeds 1000 m3 s is 0 2 while at athabasca is 0 1 see the blue solid and black dashed lines the right panel also shows that the probability that the flow at the clearwater river above christina river exceeds 100 m3 s is 0 2 while with the same probability flow exceeds 50 m3 s for the pembina river at jarvie see the blue solid and red dashed lines furthermore the flow in none of the curves in the right panel corresponding to stations p1 s1 s2 and s3 exceeds 1000 m3 s the box plots of the historical discharge data sets for the eight stations are shown in fig 8 the largest and smallest medians are for the discharge data sets corresponding to p5 457 m3 s and s1 14 m3 s respectively the outliers are shown by the blue circles from the box plots one can observe that the discharge values generally increase from p1 to p5 mainly due to flowing water into the athabasca river from other smaller streams and rivers such as the pembina river s1 and clearwater river s2 the daily discharge time series corresponding to each station along with the estimated linear trends using simple and simultaneous season trend fit models are illustrated in blue red and green lines respectively in figs 9 and 10 the estimated intercepts and slopes of the linear trends via each model are listed in table 3 the estimated intercepts and slopes using allssa are more accurate with lower uncertainties errors as compared to the simple model especially for unequally spaced time series considering the errors these results are approximately the same for all the time series except for p3 and s3 see figs 9b and 10d one of the main reasons that the slope difference is significant for p3 is the consistent data gaps during the winter since 1979 where the presumably smaller discharge values are missing making the simple trend fit unrealistic similarly the consistent data gaps from 1967 to 1976 and from 1997 to 2014 during winter for s3 significantly increased the estimated intercept via the simple fit that is less reliable compared to the simultaneous season trend fit see fig 10d and table 3 the gradual temperature increase by about 0 03 c a and annual precipitation decrease by about 1 5 mm a in arb are likely the main factors that have reduced the streamflow gradually since 1960 as listed in table 3 the quadratic trend and seasonal components are also fitted to the discharge time series for p4 and p5 but the results show almost the same decreasing rate in streamflow since 1960 only the linear trend results are shown herein to provide an overall estimate for changing streamflow since 1960 note that the overall decreasing or increasing linear trend since 1960 may not however be a reliable forecast for the mid and late 21st century figures 9 and 10 also show allsss and lswss of each time series from the amplitude spectra and spectrograms one can see that the annual components have the highest amplitudes in all the eight discharge time series the semi annual components followed by the higher frequency components have more amplitude variability over time for all the eight time series fig 9b shows higher amplitude for the semi annual component since 1979 this is mainly due to the presence of consistent data gaps during the winter since 1979 where the presumably lower and flatter discharge values are missing similarly for fig 10d see the supplementary materials for more details slater and villarini 2016 ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020b jumps in the trend component of a hydrological time series may occur due to various events such as floods and drought and human induced changes including urbanization deforestation and water diversions farsi et al 2020 to investigate whether there are any significant jumps in the trend component of the time series just is applied to estimate the jump locations in the trend component of each time series by allowing them to be at least a decade apart the estimated trend results are illustrated in fig 11 the most significant jumps are detected for p4 and p5 in april 1971 may 1989 and april 2011 see the black and blue broken lines as listed in table 3 the estimated trends for the entire time series show gradual reductions in discharge values except for p1 3 3 coherency analysis to see how the flow fluctuation at athabasca p4 impacts the flow below fort mcmurray p5 lscsa and lscwa are applied to their corresponding discharge time series and the results are demonstrated in fig 12 the white arrows displayed on lscwss represent the phase differences between the components of the first p5 and the second p4 time series following the trigonometric circle principle the top lscws shows strong coherency between the annual components of both discharge time series with an overall phase difference of 2 degrees estimated by lscsa which indicates that the amplitude of the annual component for p5 reaches its maximum about two days after the one for p4 the bottom lscs and lscws in fig 12 are obtained by suppressing the annual peaks i e by removing the annual components while considering their removal effects in the residual series note that almost all the arrows displayed on the most coherent components are pointing to the southeast falling in the fourth quadrant meaning that the components of the time series for p4 lead the ones for p5 for the arrows as an example note that an angle of 14 degrees at 10 cycles year is equivalent to an angle of 2 degrees at 1 cycle year when converted to time both means about two days lag lead toward the athabasca river path from athabasca p4 to fort mcmurray p5 many streams in the nearby subbasins flow into the athabasca river and result in an increase in the flow at p5 as compared to p4 one of the main sources of the discrepancy in the discharge values measured at p4 and p5 is the water flowing into the athabasca river from the clearwater river s2 from the bottom left panel in fig 2 the means of the annual precipitation time series are almost the same across the northern region and so the coherency analysis between the discharge time series at p5 and the precipitation time series for the northern region is generally a logical approach figure 13 shows the lscsa and lscwa of these two time series from the cross spectrograms one can observe that the seasonal components are coherent in particular the annual and semi annual components the annual and semi annual components of the precipitation time series generally lead the ones in the discharge time series by a few days from the direction of the arrows the phase differences at the higher frequencies are up to several days for example the single arrow displayed at 11 8 cycles year one month in 2005 in the top lscws has an angle of ψ 94 degrees meaning that the monthly component of the precipitation time series in 2005 leads the one in the discharge time series by about eight days the bottom lscs and lscws are obtained by suppressing the annual peaks from both time series the percentage variances between the annual and semi annual components in fig 13 are less than the ones shown in fig 12 indicating comparatively lower coherency see the maximum of 8 and 4 vs 50 and 25 in the color bars lscwa can also be applied to the discharge and precipitation time series corresponding to each subbasin to investigate the coherency and phase differences more accurately 4 discussion the spectral and wavelet analyses presented herein did not require any interpolation gap filling and de spiking of the original measurements highlighting one of the main advantages of lswave as compared to cwt and xwt ghaderpour et al 2018a the spectrograms showed significantly higher annual and semi annual amplitudes in the early 1970s 1990s and 2010s for all the eight time series in particular for p1 to p5 the high amplitude peaks in the spectrograms shown in figs 9 and 10 may correspond to the historical flood events for example in june 2013 arb experienced a significant and devastating flood event on the hangingstone and clearwater rivers upstream of fort mcmurray mainly as a result of ice jams heavy rainfall and subsequent high flows in the hagingstone river according to the reports by the government of alberta the impact of this flood event on the discharge time series and their corresponding spectrograms can be observed in fig 10c and d see the red arrows and consequently in fig 9d for forecasting purposes one may expect to see similar seasonal amplitudes in the early 2030s provided that other conditions impacting the flow will not drastically change such pattern cannot be observed in lssa or allssa because their results are only in the frequency domain not in the time frequency domain segmentation allows a better fit of harmonics and linear trend to the series especially when the time series has components with variability of frequency and amplitude over time of course quadratic and cubic trends may also be used in just however as a simple estimate for the rate of change of flow over decades the linear trend is considered herein the just results illustrated in fig 11 also showed significant jumps in the trend component of discharge series for p4 and p5 with relatively higher drainage areas around years 1970 1990 and 2010 and so one may expect to observe a significant jump in the early 2030s for the flow at p4 and p5 as well from lscsa and lscwa the precipitation and temperature were found to be two of the main drivers of the streamflow fluctuation for arb unlike the correlation analysis that shows a possible relationship between climate and flow values the coherency analysis shows how the signals are coherent in the frequency or time frequency domain that along with the phase difference information provides a more robust result for example fig 13 showed that the coherent annual semi annual and higher frequency signals of the daily precipitation generally lead the ones in the streamflow providing such phase relationship between the components of both time series is extremely helpful in forestry precision agriculture and streamflow forecasting note that the variances of coherent signals were below 10 that shows other factors such as vegetation and soil moisture may have also significantly impacted the streamflow the results herein showed that the mean temperature of arb has increased by about 2 c since 1960 the mean temperature is projected to increase by approximately 2 c for the mid century 2021 2060 that is consistent with the observations made by leong and donner 2015 and shrestha et al 2017 eum et al 2017 used the ensemble mean of several gcms and reported an increase of 7 10 mean annual precipitation in arb during the mid century therefore due to increased snowmelt as the result of temperature increase one may expect that the blue water increases during the mid century in arb shrestha et al 2017 however this may also decrease the snowpack volume for the spring freshet as for the streamflow simulation one would expect wider left tail for the asymmetric gaussian function demonstrated in supplementary fig 3 from the recurring patterns of spectral peaks in the spectrograms shown in figs 10 and 11 one may deduce that the water resources in arb may increase in 2030s which somewhat agrees with the observations made by shrestha et al 2017 the lower elevated regions of arb e g below fort mcmurray may also experience a substantial increase in spring season blue water yield since about 82 of the region is forested one may investigate the relationships between the precipitation and plant root mechanism and water absorption via coherency analysis of satellite data to get an insight on how much delay is expected for a change to occur in streamflow after precipitation particularly crucial for forecasting and mitigating drought and flood strong and la roi 1983 xu et al 2019 ghaderpour and vujadinovic 2020b inverse modeling methods are not usually related to any control equations such as richards equation richards 1931 streamflow is one of key hydrological parameters which is very complex in nature depending on soil types vegetation topology and weather condition lswa results presented herein have only shown how the seasonal component of the streamflow has changed over time while the lscwa has shown the possible coherency between the components of climate and streamflow time series 5 conclusions in this contribution the sixty year long streamflow temperature and precipitation time series for arb were analyzed using several methods where each method provided certain and useful information although traditional tools such as box plots hydrographs and flow duration curves provide specific information about the hydrological data they cannot clearly show the components of the data and how they change over time for example from the flow duration curves illustrated in fig 7 it is predicted that the probability that streamflow exceeds 1000 m3 s along the athabasca river is less than 0 2 during the mid century furthermore these tools cannot be used to investigate how climate change influences the streamflow because they provide no phase information and no coherency correlation on the other hand wavelet and cross wavelet analyses clearly show how the components of the data change over time and how climate change may impact the streamflow over time the trend analyses showed gradual changes in the time series values the simultaneous season trend fit using the spectral analysis showed more reliable results for estimating the trend component of the discharge time series as compared to the traditional regression method simple fit especially for unequally spaced time series with data gaps the spectral analysis provided the amplitudes and frequencies of the inter and intra annual components while the spectrograms also showed amplitude variability of these components over time all the eight streamflow time series showed statistically significant annual and semi annual components with variability of amplitudes over time as well as other short duration high frequency components that were linked to the climate change via the coherency analyses from the recurring patterns in the spectrograms and trend results it is projected that the blue water resources may increase during the mid century in particular below fort mcmurray therefore it is crucial for hydrological and climate studies to consider seasonal variations along with gradual changes in the ecology and hydrology of watersheds it is expected that such spectral and wavelet analyses can also help to provide more reliable climate and hydrological forecasts as demonstrated in the supplementary materials lswave can estimate the trend and seasonal components more accurately than the traditional regression analysis and cwt without any need for interpolation and repairing the data the tools in the lswave and just software packages can also estimate the signals more accurately by considering the observational uncertainties limitations of this study include 1 the proposed spectral and wavelet methods were only applied to discharge and climate data without considering other factors such as soil profile topology and vegetation and 2 the analyses of discharge time series were shown for only eight hydrometric stations

8193,study region the study area is located at kapunda south australia with a semi arid climate and comprises a fractured rock aquifer established in 1842 kapunda was the first mining town in australia and its open pit mine was a key economic driver for the whole continent the mine was closed in 1879 and the remnant low grade copper was considered sub economic hence the mine has been developed into a tourist attraction with the recent advances in in situ recovery isr the feasibility of recovering the remnant copper is under consideration again study focus a field trial involving lixiviant injection and extraction is under development this study uses a combination of stochastic groundwater modeling and multiple geophysical techniques to investigate 1 the flow paths of injectant and whether it will reach the light river and 2 the injectant residence time in the aquifer new hydrological insights for the region depending on the effective porosity of the aquifer the modeling suggests a probability of 1 5 for the injectant to escape the site there is a large uncertainty in the simulated injectant residence time ranging from 200 to beyond 1000 days these analyses are conservative and do not consider the biodegradability of the injectant which can achieve a 90 degradation over 28 days our modeling shows no evidence that the injectant can reach the light river within this timeframe keywords groundwater model geophysics nuclear magnetic resonance electromagnetics magnetotellurics fractured rock 1 introduction numerical modeling is useful for informing management decisions about groundwater resources hunt and zheng 2012 however its effectiveness is hampered by various sources of uncertainty including data conceptualization and parameterization doherty and simmons 2013 this is partly because spatial continuity of model parameters is generally assumed to support a more straightforward uncertainty analysis while most classical hydrogeological techniques provide point scale information brunner et al 2006 this mismatch can be mitigated by complementing groundwater models with geophysics due to its denser spatial coverage non invasiveness and relatively low cost on an area basis slater 2007 audio frequency magnetotellurics amt and time domain electromagnetics tem are electromagnetic methods that estimate subsurface electrical resistivity which is related to groundwater salinity sediment texture mineralogy and degree of saturation everett 2013 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr a geophysical technique that detects subsurface water directly and provides information on pore size distribution and water content the latter of which is a proxy for porosity in the saturated zone legchenko et al 2002 these geophysical techniques have proven useful in previous studies for constraining important components of groundwater models including conceptualizations geological framework and hydraulic properties for example wagner 2007 used amt to determine the freshwater saltwater transition zone under amchitka island to model the transport of subsurface radioactive materials to the sea floor marker et al 2015 used tem to improve the hydrostratigraphic characterization for a hydrological model to estimate groundwater levels in norsminde denmark boucher et al 2012 used nmr to estimate transmissivity and specific yield for a groundwater model to assess recharge to a sandstone aquifer in niger however these studies only coupled geophysics with groundwater modeling in a deterministic manner where a single best calibrated groundwater model was developed and used to make predictions in addition the uncertainty inherent in geophysical data was rarely quantified and accounted for in groundwater model inversion for groundwater model inversion the gauss levenberg marquardt glm algorithm hanke 1997 is commonly used for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis via programs such as pest doherty et al 1994 pestpp welter et al 2015 and ucode poeter et al 2014 the glm algorithm requires a sensitivity matrix known as the jacobian matrix which is commonly constructed using a finitedifference approach an alternative approach was proposed by white 2018 who implemented the ensemble smoother form of the glm algorithm from chen and oliver 2013 into the pestpp suite referred to as pestpp ies the ensemblesmoother method derives the jacobian matrix empirically from an ensemble of random parameter values white 2018 which has several advantages firstly it produces an ensemble of calibrated models that can be considered to represent the posterior distribution of parameters and predictions which can be readily used for non linear uncertainty analysis and probabilistic predictions in addition observation uncertainty can be expressed as a prior variance and used to form a random observation ensemble allowing the inversion to fit to the observation distribution instead of the observation itself furthermore the ensemble smoother method decouples the number of parameters being estimated from the number of model runs required greatly reducing the computational time needed for highly parameterized models white 2018 the objective of this paper is to couple multiple geophysical techniques of amt tem and nmr with stochastic groundwater modelling using the ensemble smoother framework we demonstrate how this framework can be used as a data assimilation tool to facilitate the flow of information from geophysical and hydrogeological data to the groundwater model prediction of interest we also show how the uncertainty of geophysical data can be expressed in a manner that is relevant for groundwater model inversion this modelling framework was applied in the context of an in situ recovery isr copper mining operation which involves injecting lixiviant into the ground to dissolve and extract minerals through a system of injection and extraction wells sinclair and thompson 2015 the model ensemble was used to predict the regional scale hydrological impact of a hypothetical isr trial operation the results of which are presented in a probabilistic manner 2 methods 2 1 site descriptions the historical kapunda copper mine is located approximately 80 km north east of adelaide south australia fig 1 it has a semi arid climate with a mean annual rainfall of 490 mm y and evaporation of 1800 mm y bureau of meteorology 2020 established in 1842 kapunda was the first mining town in australia and its open pit mine was a key economic driver for the whole continent until its closure in 1879 nirola et al 2016 the remnant low grade copper surrounding the mine was considered to be sub economic and the mine has since been developed into a heritage site and tourist attraction bogenes et al 2003 with the recent advances in isr sinclair and thompson 2015 the feasibility of recovering the remnant copper is under consideration again at the time of writing the proponent is developing a site environmental lixiviant test selt which is a small scale operation using a limited number of injection and extraction wells to test various recovery options the selt operation is planned to be followed by a remediation phase where the remaining injectant is retrieved using the extraction well from a management perspective the key hydrological issues of concern are 1 the flow paths of the injectant and whether it will reach the light river an important environmental asset and 2 the residence time of the injectant in the aquifer this study demonstrates how these questions can be addressed by using a combination of multiple geophysical techniques and stochastic groundwater modeling 2 2 hydrogeological data kapunda is located within the adelaide geosyncline a major geological province in central south australia the local geology is dominated by neoproterozoic aged formations lambert et al 1980 the main geological formations in the study area include the tapley hill formation to the north which covers the hypothetical selt site and the brighton limestone to the south the tapley hill formation primarily consists of blue grey laminated siltstone and slate while the brighton limestone is typically characterized by coarse grained and recrystallized marble units akker and watson 2017 from a hydrogeological perspective these formations behave as an interconnected fractured rock aquifer the hydraulic behavior of which is largely governed by the secondary porosity developed from fracturing jeuken and magarey 2017 a total of 42 observations wells were used in this study fig 1 most of which only have a single groundwater level reading often collected in the 1970s there are no metered groundwater usage data in kapunda as groundwater ec is relatively high in kapunda ranging between 1900 and 22 000 μs cm with a mean of 5800 μs cm 3300 mg l total dissolved solids groundwater usage is assumed to be negligible hydraulic conductivity was estimated from well yield and draw down data using logan approximation logan 1964 by jeuken and magarey 2017 this approach provided 28 estimates of hydraulic conductivity fig 1 ranging between 0 0007 and 0 4 m d with a geometric mean of 0 04 m d the error of this method is likely to be in the order of 50 logan 1964 in addition a 9 hour aquifer test was performed in february 2020 in the northern part of the study area fig 1 and reported a hydraulic conductivity of 0 07 m d effective porosity was estimated to be 1 near the aquifer test site based on fracture logging using a downhole optical scanner to 65 m depth and assuming 50 cementation jeuken and magarey 2017 an initial assessment of groundwater recharge was undertaken using the chloride mass balance method wood 1999 this technique assumes 1d vertical advective flow only and no chloride derived from flow upgradient of the bores the chloride mass balance equation is as follows 1 r e c h a r g e r a i n f a l l c l r a i n f a l l c l g r o u n d w a t e r where cl is chloride concentration mg l in kapunda the average chloride concentration is 9 mg l in rainfall davies and crosbie 2018 and 1100 mg l in groundwater according to the observation well data based on this analysis the long term average recharge rate is 4 mm y which is 0 8 of rainfall note that this method estimates net recharge which already accounts for groundwater evapotranspiration the regional groundwater sink is the light river lamontagne et al 2020 applied various environmental tracers including δd and δ18o of water ec chloride and radon 222 to evaluate the surface water groundwater connectivity of the light river they estimated baseflow to the light river within our study area in 2019 to be in the order of 400 3000 m³ d they also identified a zone of higher groundwater discharge in the eastern part of our study area i e upstream of a in fig 1 2 3 geophysical data 2 3 1 audio frequency magnetotellurics amt is an electromagnetic method that uses naturally occurring passive electromagnetic field sources such as global lightning strikes to map geological structures garcia and jones 2002 timevarying magnetic fields induce electrical currents into the earth that can be measured using grounded dipoles and magnetic field antennas over a wide range of frequencies vozoff 1991 the received signal is used to estimate ground electrical resistivity and the depth of investigation is generally in kilometers spies 1989 as part of this study a broadband audio frequency magnetotellurics amt survey was undertaken in april 2019 on a grid of 87 sites with a nominal spacing of 100 m fig 1 data were recorded at each site for about 20 h using the phoenix mtu 5a systems yielding good quality amt responses in the bandwidth of 1 10 000 hz the collected amt data were inverted in 3d using modem kelbert et al 2014 the model consists of 100 cells in the east west direction and 120 cells in the north south direction with a minimum cell dimension of 12 m the vertical dimension was discretized into 120 layers with a minimum thickness of 5 m increasing at a rate of 2 with depth impedance error floors were set to 7 for all components the inversion included 26 frequencies spread evenly from 0 001 to 100 hz with five estimates per decade the model roughness was set with a tau of 0 1 and no weighting was applied for either horizontal or vertical smoothing the model misfit with the data has a root mean square error rmse of 1 9 the electrical conductivity ec estimates from the 3d inversion at 50 and 100 m depth are shown in fig 2 the 50 m depth slice shows two distinctly different zones in the study area the more conductive zone to the north is interpreted to be related to the tapley hill formation while the more resistive zone to the south is interpreted to be related to the brighton limestone the 100 m depth slice indicates that ec generally decreases with depth in addition phase tensor analysis of the high frequency amt data suggests that the top 100 m of the fractured rock aquifer is electrically isotropic over the survey area possibly due to deep weathering of the existing bedrock fabric the ec estimates from the inverted amt data can also be used to provide information on hydraulic conductivity via the following petrophysical relationship purvance and andricevic 2000 2 e c a k b where k is hydraulic conductivity m d and a and b are empirical constants which were calibrated using data from the aquifer test and the closest amt station with a hydraulic conductivity of 0 07 m d section 2 2 and a geometric ec mean of 520 μs cm it was estimated that a 950 and b 0 23 while there are other non linear petrophysical relationships to relate ec and k slater 2007 a linear log log relationship eq 2 was adopted in this study for reasons of parsimony which has the potential to cause bias in the model predictions the investigation of different petrophysical relationships on the predictive uncertainty however is beyond the scope of this study 2 3 2 time domain electromagnetics tem involves applying a direct current to a transmitter loop and then shutting the current off abruptly everett 2013 this produces a timevarying magnetic field into the earth subsequently generating eddy currents in subsurface conductors such eddy currents create a secondary magnetic field that is measured by a receiver loop the decay rate of the secondary magnetic field is directly related to ground electrical resistivity everett 2013 compared to amt tem generally has a shallower depth of investigation but a finer resolution at the near surface spies 1989 a tem survey was conducted in may 2019 at 85 sites with a nominal spacing of 100 m the tem sites were chosen to be as close to the amt sites as possible the soundings were collected using the zonge engineering nanotem system this system has fast transmitter turn off and sampling rate to collect near surface data down to 80 m depth in our study area a central loop configuration was used where a single turn 5 m 5 m receiver loop was placed at the center of a single turn 20 m 20 m transmitter loop the transmitter was set to 2 amps and powered by a 12 v battery three data stacks were collected at each station using a repetition rate of 64 hz and sampling period of 1 6 μs the collected tem data were processed to remove noisy late time data and then inverted in 1d using aarhusinv auken et al 2015 as a smooth 20 layer model a transect of the inverted tem data is shown in fig 3 the south eastern side of the transect i e near a shows a thin layer with moderate ec near the surface probably representing the unsaturated zone it is then followed by a highly conductive layer possibly indicating the weathered part of the saturated zone with relatively high porosity and groundwater salinity it then gradually transitions into a more resistive layer potentially representing the unweathered part of the saturated zone with low porosity this layering conceptualization is believed to be applicable throughout kapunda although the unweathered layer may extend to greater depths in other parts of the area figs 2 and 3 given the relative shallowness and high salinity of groundwater in the survey area the water table is expected to be detectable in the tem data as an ec high therefore the ec peak of the tem soundings was used as an indicator of water table depth due to a paucity of groundwater level observations for ground truthing a quality assurance process was performed on the water table estimates using a pseudo bayesian approach where our prior knowledge is based on a potentiometric surface developed using groundwater level observations and water levels of the light river given the absence of groundwater affecting activities e g pumping in the survey area the potentiometric surface is assumed to be a reasonable approximation of the system therefore only the groundwater levels derived from tem that are within 2 m of our prior knowledge totaling 23 estimates fig 1 were used in the groundwater model inversion 2 3 3 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr also known as magnetic resonance sounding mrs is a geophysical technique that exploits the quantum physical properties of hydrogen protons in subsurface water to gain hydrogeological information legchenko et al 2002 the initial amplitude of the received signal is directly related to water content which is a proxy for porosity in the saturated zone in addition a decay time constant t2 is estimated from the decay pattern of the received signal which provides information about pore size distribution behroozmand et al 2015 borehole nmr data were collected in the northern part of the study area fig 1 using vista clara s javelin system equipped with a jpy 350 probe 88 9 mm in diameter to 28 m depth the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used carr and purcell 1954 meiboom and gill 1958 the collected nmr data were processed and inverted using vista clara s javelin pro plus program the decay time constant t2 and total water content from the nmr inversion below the water table are shown in fig 4 note that the total water content includes both connected and isolated pores and it is the former that contributes to groundwater flow therefore the total water content was separated into water content in small moderate and large pores using t2 cut off times of 3 and 33 ms behroozmand et al 2015 we assume groundwater flows primarily in larger pores hence the water content in large pores was used as a proxy for effective porosity however the water content in large pores below 17 m depth appears to be affected by some localized fractures the porosity of which may not be regionally representative fig 4 and hence was excluded from the analysis the remaining data indicate a mean effective porosity of 5 6 this is considerably higher than the value of 1 as suggested by optical scanning but is consistent with akker and watson 2017 who reported an effective porosity of 5 for the same tapley hill formation but approximately 80 km south of the study area the uncertainty in effective porosity is explored further in the groundwater model inversion 2 4 groundwater modeling 2 4 1 model development due to the lack of detailed fracture data at a regional scale in kapunda the fractured rock aquifer was simulated using the equivalent porous medium approach long et al 1982 also despite the importance of rapid flow paths in contaminant transport problems a dual porosity scheme was considered beyond the scope of this study and should be acknowledged as a model limitation a 3d regional scale numerical groundwater model was developed using modflowunstructured grid usg panday et al 2017 the model domain is 5 5 km 5 2 km in area and the model edges were set 2 km away from the study area to avoid boundary effects fig 1 the voronoi grid was generated using algomesh merrick 2016 with a nominal cell size of 10 m² in the study area and up to 25 000 m² in the regional area the same grid was applied to two layers resulting in a total of 294 356 cells the top layer of the model represents the more permeable weathered part of the fractured rock aquifer while the bottom layer represents the less permeable unweathered part of the aquifer the top model surface was sourced from the dem that has a resolution of 5 m 5 m the thickness of the weathered layer was estimated using the amt data where the ec sounding at each station was divided into two layers using the k means clustering technique jain 2010 assuming electrical and hydraulic properties are related these thickness estimates were interpolated within the amt survey area and extrapolated to their geometric mean of 100 m outside the survey area a constant thickness of 100 m was applied to the bottom layer allowing all observation wells to be included in the model the light river and other ephemeral creeks were simulated using modflow s riv package panday et al 2017 time varying river depths were used for the light river based on data from the nearest gauging station the local ephemeral creeks are usually dry except for the wetter winter months hence their river depth was set to 0 m i e river stage equals riverbed elevation river bathymetry was sourced from the dem riverbed conductance was mostly set to 0 1 m² d based on the regional hydraulic conductivity section 2 2 except for the eastern part of the light river in the study area where a higher conductance of 10 m² d was applied as this reach was identified to be a zone of higher groundwater discharge lamontagne et al 2020 the historical mine and quarry were represented as groundwater discharge features using modflow s drn package panday et al 2017 the drain elevation was sourced from the dem and the drain conductance was set to 0 1 m² d the regional lateral groundwater inflows from the northern and southern sides were modeled in both layers using modflow s ghb package panday et al 2017 the head values were derived from groundwater level observations and the conductance was set to 0 1 m² d net groundwater recharge was simulated using modflow s rch package panday et al 2017 annually varying rainfall data were incorporated into the model as recharge multipliers which were multiplied with the spatially varying rainfall to recharge ratios a calibration parameter to derive net recharge groundwater evapotranspiration is not explicitly included in the model as it is already accounted for in net recharge given the relatively high groundwater salinity in kapunda section 2 2 groundwater extraction is assumed to be negligible and hence not simulated in the model the model consists of 53 stress periods the first period is steady state and represents the pre 1970 period which was selected based on the observation data availability this stress period provides the initial conditions for the subsequent 50 transient annual stress periods which represent the time period between 1970 and 2019 and were used for history matching the last two stress periods represent the hypothetical selt operation and remediation phase with a duration of two months and three years respectively all transient stress periods have 10 time steps and a time step multiplier of 1 2 the hypothetical selt operation consists of four injection wells separated by 20 m and one extraction well at the center the operation rate is 0 02 l s for each injection well and 0 1 l s for the extraction well during the remediation phase the extraction well continues to operate at the same rate of 0 1 l s while all the injection wells are switched off transport of the injectant was simulated using the particle tracking code mod path3du craig et al 2020 the only transport mechanism modeled is advection while processes such as dispersion chemical reaction and sorption are considered beyond the scope of this study a circle of 12 particles representing the injectant were placed around each injection well and released at the commencement of the selt operation the model was set to extend the tracking time beyond the end of simulation time by using the flow field from the last time step 2 4 2 model inversion groundwater model inversion was performed using the ensemble smoother method via pestppies white 2018 a brief description of the ensemble smoother method is provided here and readers are referred to white 2018 and chen and oliver 2013 for further details the ensemblesmoother method reformulates the glm algorithm by empirically deriving the jacobian matrix from an ensemble of random parameter values chen and oliver 2013 3 δ θ j e m p t σ ε 1 j e m p 1 λ σ θ 1 1 σ θ 1 θ θ 0 j e m p t d s i m d o b s where 4 j e m p σ ε 1 2 δ s i m δ p a r 1 σ θ 1 2 5 δ s i m σ ε 1 2 d s i m d s i m n e 1 6 δ p a r σ θ 1 2 θ θ n e 1 where δ θ is the parameter upgrade matrix j e m p is the empirically derived jacobian matrix σ ε is the observation noise covariance matrix σ θ is the prior parameter covariance matrix λ is the marquardt dampening parameter θ and θ 0 are the current and initial parameter vector respectively d o b s and d s i m are the observation and simulated equivalent ensembles respectively d s i m and θ are the mean of the simulated equivalents to observations and parameters across their respective ensembles respectively n e is the number of realizations and denotes broadcast subtraction in this study the ensemble size was initially set to 105 realizations to account for situations where some realizations may fail to converge the dampening of the parameter upgrade factor is controlled by λ eq 3 where a high value of λ leads to rapid improvement in the objective function while a low value of λ is better at navigating the objective function space the optimal value for λ is automatically estimated for each inversion iteration through a trial and error procedure based on a subset of the parameter ensemble the whole ensemble is not used to reduce computational time in this study the inversion was converged after 9 iterations based on the following termination criteria 1 if the relative decrease in the mean objective function was less than 1 over 3 iterations or 2 if there was no reduction in the mean objective function for 3 iterations the top 100 realizations with the smallest objective function were used to form the final ensemble the inversion workflow in this study is illustrated in fig 5 the modeled hydraulic conductivity was compared with our prior knowledge including the aquifer test and logan approximation estimates in addition to provide more constraints in the study area the modeled hydraulic conductivity was compared with the amt data this was achieved by converting the hydraulic conductivity field to an ec field using eq 2 and the empirical constants estimated in section 2 3 1 the empirical constants are assumed to be spatially uniform due to the limited aquifer test data given the uncertainty in the petrophysical relationship the amt data were aggregated into five zones using the k means clustering technique jain 2010 the ec comparison was only undertaken for the weathered layer as the unweathered layer possesses a different electrical property figs 2 and 3 where the estimated empirical constants may not apply groundwater levels computed by the flow model were compared with groundwater levels from the observation wells and tem in addition the simulated groundwater flux to the light river within the study area in 2019 was compared with the mean of tracer estimates from lamontagne et al 2020 it is worth noting that effective porosity was not included as a calibration parameter while the ensemble smoother method allows the inclusion of all parameters in the history matching procedure as long as there is a covariance matrix to constrain parameter values the prior and posterior probability distribution of effective porosity are expected to be similar due to the lack of inversion targets for particle tracking therefore the inclusion of effective porosity in the history matching procedure is believed to have minimal contribution to the prediction uncertainty quantification as such given the model objective the uncertainty associated with effective porosity was assessed by undertaking two separate particle tracking runs with different uniform effective porosity values of 1 and 5 which are considered to represent the lower and upper bounds respectively pilot points a method for spatial parameterization were used for all parameter groups doherty 2003 given the fractured rock environment pilot points were placed at each observation to capture the local heterogeneity in addition gaps in the pilot point coverage were filled using a maximum separation distance of 25 m in the study area and 250 m elsewhere in the weathered layer and 500 m in the unweathered layer this resulted in 1397 pilot points in the weathered layer and 103 pilot points in the unweathered layer for each corresponding parameter group spatial correlation between the pilot points were defined using an exponential variogram with nugget 0 sill 1 and a 1100 where a describes the decay rate of spatial correlation with distance and was set to 20 of the model extent the calibration parameters are detailed in table 1 all parameters were log transformed during the inversion the prior parameter variance was calculated based on the assumption that the difference between the upper and lower bound of a parameter group is equal to four standard deviations of its prior probability distribution white 2018 based on the amt data horizontal hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be isotropic i e kx ky a similar assumption was adopted for vertical hydraulic conductivity i e khorizontal kvertical the effect of this assumption is expected to be small given the relatively low permeability of the unweathered layer and therefore the already dominant lateral flow hydraulic conductivity of the unweathered layer was forced to be at least an order of magnitude lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the weathered layer it is worth noting that while the potentially connected high hydraulic conductivity pathways are not explicitly represented in the prior these pathways are expected to be reflected in the amt data that were included in the history matching procedure fig 5 the storage parameter settings are based on the aquifer tests in the adjacent barossa region 30 km away that has a similar hydrogeological setting li and cranswick 2016 specific storage was predominately used for the bottom layer which is confined and for simplicity the same values were applied to the top layer vice versa for specific yield the rainfall to recharge ratios vary spatially but were fixed with time for parsimony reasons the observation groups are detailed in table 2 prior observation variance was calculated in a similar fashion to the prior parameter variance the error bounds are assumed to be 0 2 m for groundwater levels from the observation wells rau et al 2019 2 m for groundwater levels derived from tem and 50 for prior knowledge of hydraulic conductivity logan 1964 the bounds for the ec and baseflow observation groups are based on the actual range of the amt data and tracer estimates lamontagne et al 2020 the ec hydraulic conductivity and baseflow observations were log transformed the prior observation variance values were used to derive the random observation ensemble and observation weights the latter were then adjusted using the program pwtadj1 doherty et al 1994 which automatically scales the observation weights so that all observation groups are equally visible in the objective function 3 results 3 1 history matching performance the history matching performance of the model ensemble for all observation groups is shown in fig 6 for groundwater levels from the observation wells the residual map shows some potential conflicts between data where positive residuals are adjacent negative residuals this may be caused by local heterogeneity given the fractured rock environment or simply a measurement error which cannot be resolved with the currently available data the scatter plot shows a reasonable match between the observed and simulated values with the cloud of points being centered around the 1 1 line and a scaled root mean square error srmse calculated as rmse divided by the observation range of 7 3 for groundwater levels derived from tem both the residual map and scatter plot show an overall overestimation by the model this potentially suggests that the peak of ec profile may be a sub optimal indicator of true water table depth it is possible that the top of the saturated zone may have been diluted by mixing with the relatively fresh rainwater or there is a significant capillary zone nevertheless an rmse of 1 3 m is considered to be within the uncertainty bounds of these groundwater level estimates prior knowledge of hydraulic conductivity includes the aquifer test data and logan approximation estimates the prior knowledge functions like regularization in that the objective function is penalized as the modeled values deviate from the prior values it is worth noting that hydraulic conductivity is a model input not an output that requires calculation like groundwater levels and hence is relatively easy to fit the misfit of hydraulic conductivity between the prior and modeled values is a trade off for the inversion to fit other observation groups especially groundwater levels from the observation wells as most of the prior hydraulic conductivity values are located outside the study area the misfit suggests a potential conflict between these two observation groups which may be caused by the heterogeneous nature of the fractured rock aquifer and or errors in the logan approximation estimates and groundwater level observations for the ec observation group the residual map shows two distinct zones an underestimated zone to the north and an overestimated zone to the south which coincide with the location of tapley hill formation and brighton limestone respectively this suggests that using the same petrophysical relationship empirical constants for these two formations is sub optimal the fit may be improved by undertaking an additional aquifer test so that a separate set of empirical constants can be derived for each of these formations the additional aquifer test may also contribute to the improvement of model predictive accuracy the simulated baseflow to the light river within the study area in 2019 ranges between 290 and 780 m³ d with a mean of 560 m³ d which is mostly within the tracer estimate range of 400 3000 m³ d lamontagne et al 2020 albeit on the lower end of the range this discrepancy may be due to the difference in time scale between the tracer and modeled estimates and or the riverbed conductance term used 3 2 posterior parameter distribution and uncertainty the maximum likelihood and logarithmic standard deviation of the posterior distribution for the calibration parameters are shown in fig 7 hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer is higher in the north eastern part and lower in the south western part of the study area regionally there is a substantial permeable zone to the east and a less permeable zone to the west of the study area potentially indicating the differences in the amount of weathering the unweathered layer typically has a lower hydraulic conductivity although there is a relatively permeable zone in the north eastern part of the study area specific storage is generally high except to the east and south east of the study area while specific yield is higher to the north and lower to the south the rainfall to recharge ratio generally follows topography and is higher in the outer elevated areas and lower in the center low lying areas the logarithmic standard deviation in fig 7 was calculated using parameter values from the 100 model realizations on a cell by cell basis and can be used as an indicator of posterior parameter uncertainty which is highest for hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer its uncertainty is relatively high in the study area probably due to the limited physical measurements of groundwater level in this area in contrast the uncertainty is relatively low near the historical mine which is probably due to the abundance of logan approximation estimates in this area fig 1 both hydraulic conductivity in the unweathered layer and specific yield show a relatively high uncertainty in the southern part of the study area while the uncertainty of specific storage is relatively uniform although the uncertainty of rainfall to recharge ratio is considerably high in the regional areas it is relatively low in most part of the study area 3 3 prediction distribution and uncertainty the predicted injectant flow paths for the hypothetical selt operation are shown in fig 8 for an effective porosity of 1 95 out of the 100 model realizations indicate that all of the injectant may be retrieved while 5 realizations show that the injectant has the potential to reach the light river for an effective porosity of 5 99 out of the 100 model realizations suggest complete removal of the injectant and only 1 realization shows the potential for injectant to reach the river as the travel speed of injectant is inversely proportional to effective porosity the injectant travels at a slower speed in the 5 porosity scenario and hence has a higher probability to be completely retrieved the modeling suggests that it would take 9 175 years after the selt commencement for the injectant to reach the river with a median of 35 years it is important to note that these model runs represent the worst case scenario as processes such as degradation and attenuation are not considered in the modeling it is worth noting that the injectant under consideration is highly biodegradable it is expected that 90 of the injectant will degrade completely within 28 days of exposure to groundwater echa 1999 hidalgo et al 2019 2020 our modeling shows no evidence that the injectant can leave the selt site much less reach the light river within this timeframe further analysis was performed on the injectant residence time in the aquifer after the selt commencement fig 9 this analysis assumes that the injectant does not degrade with time for an effective porosity of 1 the results suggest that most of the injectant may be retrieved between 200 and 400 days after the selt commencement this relatively long residence time was unexpected given the small scale of the selt operation and is likely due to the need of some injectant to travel against the regional groundwater flow gradient to reach the extraction well the relatively low extraction rate and permeability compared to sedimentary aquifers may also contribute to this relatively long residence time for an effective porosity of 5 the results indicate that there may still be up to 20 of injectant remaining in the aquifer even after 1000 days potentially suggesting a longer remediation phase and or a higher extraction rate may be needed again it is important to note that these residence time results represent the worst case scenario and do not consider the biodegradability of the injectant 4 discussion there are various levels of coupling geophysics and groundwater modeling ranging from basic manual conceptual interpretation e g harrington et al 2014 to sequential inversion e g christensen et al 2017 to joint inversion e g herckenrath et al 2013 for sequential inversion outputs from geophysical inversion are used for groundwater model inversion while for joint inversion both the geophysical and groundwater models are inverted simultaneously this study performed a relatively complex sequential inversion that uses amt tem and nmr data to constrain stochastic groundwater modeling this method facilitates the flow of information from geophysical and hydrogeological data to the groundwater model prediction of interest the challenge of coupling geophysics with groundwater modeling is that geophysical techniques rarely provide direct information about hydrogeological properties additional methods and assumptions such as petrophysical relationships are often required to bridge this gap potentially increasing the uncertainty of geophysically derived observations as these relationships may vary depending on local site conditions when using these observations as targets in groundwater model inversion it is critical to quantify and account for their uncertainty to avoid incorrectly biasing model outcomes the ensemble smoother method potentially provides a means to achieve this via the prior observation variance table 2 which expresses observation uncertainty as a prior probability distribution for a given observation a random sample is drawn from its prior probability distribution for each realisation forming an ensemble of random observations this allows the inversion to fit to the observation distribution which incorporates the observation uncertainty instead of the observation itself which may be uncertain especially for the geophysically derived observations there are some limitations in the modeling presented in this paper firstly it is worth noting that the ensemble smoother method may not necessarily converge to the global minimum of the objective function space unlike other stochasic methods such as markov chain monte carlo by using the ensemble smoother method a compromise is implicitly made where some accuracy in the posterior parameters and predictions is sacrificed for computational efficiency secondly as with most other bayesian based techniques the ensemble smoother method is dependent on the priors the derivation of which may sometimes be subjective for geophysically derived observations in this study the tem data were used to estimate groundwater levels in the study area which are acknowledged to be uncertain we assumed the error to be 2 m and expressed this uncertainty as a prior observation variance table 2 which was then incoporated into the groundwater model inversion this error bound is a subjective estimation based on our hydrogeological knowledge of the area nevertheless we demonstrated how multiple geophysical techniques can be used to provide a large set of soft data to aid groundwater model development espeically in areas with limited drillhole informatioion and more importantly how the uncertainty in these soft data can be expressed in a transparent and repeatable framework that can be reviewed and adjusted as needed as for site specific limitations there are some areas in the model where the parameters are at their upper bound especially hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer and recharge fig 7 it is hypothesised that the baseflow estimate may be too high forcing these parameters to reach their upper bound this hypothesis can be tested by collecting more field data including baseflow analysis and aquifer tests meanwhile the ec estimates from the amt inversion were used to provide information on hydraulic conductivity via a petrophysical relationship this requires calibrating the empirical constants against field data ideally aquifer test data due to the limited aquifer test data in the study area we assumed the empirical constants to be spatially uniform the model results suggest that this approach may be sub optimal when applied across multiple geological formations with variable electrical properties the model results are likely to be improved if an additional aquifer test was performed so that a separate set of empirical constants could be derived for each of these formations it is worth noting the difference between the predictive scale and data scales spatially the former is mostly between the selt site and the light river i e within the study area in comparison most of the hydrogeological data including groundwater level observations and hydraulic conductivity estimates lie outside the study area fig 1 therefore the model predictions are likely to be influenced more by the geophysically derived groundwater levels and hydraulic conductivity estimates i e nanotem and amt data within the study area there is considerable uncertainty associated with these geophysically derived datasets and it is therefore important to incorporate their uncertainty explicitly in the modelling workflow as demonstrated in this study transport predictions are preferentially sensitive to rapid transport pathways such as along fractures rather than the average media properties provided from an aquifer test the direct use of aquifer test data for improving model predictive accuracy may therefore be limited instead as demonstrated in this study aquifer test data can be used to provide constraints for the petrophysical relationship that relates k and ec which is critical as the ec distribution contains information about the rapid transport pathways 5 conclusions in this study we coupled multiple geophysical techniques with stochastic groundwater modeling to predict the regional scale hydrological impact of a hypothetical isr trial operation for copper recovery in kapunda south australia the geophysical techniques including amt tem and nmr were used to provide constraints on hydraulic conductivity water table depth hydrostratigraphy and porosity in a data sparse region the groundwater model was used as a data assimilation tool to facilitate the flow of information from the geophysical and hydrogeological data to the model prediction of interest this was achieved using the ensemble smoother method via pestpp ies which produced an ensemble of 100 calibrated models with a reasonable history matching performance an average srmse of 7 3 for groundwater level observations these calibrated models can be considered to represent the posterior distribution of parameters and predictions that can be readily used for non linear uncertainty analysis and probabilistic predictions the model ensemble shows no evidence that the injectant can leave the selt site or reach the light river within its biodegradation timeframe the challenge of coupling geophysics with groundwater modeling is that geophysical techniques rarely provide direct quantification of hydrogeological propoerties additional methods such petrophysical relationships are required to bridge this gap potentially increasing the uncertainty of geophysically derived observations when using these observations as targets in groundwater model inversion it is critical to quantify and account for their uncertainty to avoid incorrectly biasing outcomes the ensemble smoother method potentially provides a means to achieve this via the prior observation variance and random observation

8193,study region the study area is located at kapunda south australia with a semi arid climate and comprises a fractured rock aquifer established in 1842 kapunda was the first mining town in australia and its open pit mine was a key economic driver for the whole continent the mine was closed in 1879 and the remnant low grade copper was considered sub economic hence the mine has been developed into a tourist attraction with the recent advances in in situ recovery isr the feasibility of recovering the remnant copper is under consideration again study focus a field trial involving lixiviant injection and extraction is under development this study uses a combination of stochastic groundwater modeling and multiple geophysical techniques to investigate 1 the flow paths of injectant and whether it will reach the light river and 2 the injectant residence time in the aquifer new hydrological insights for the region depending on the effective porosity of the aquifer the modeling suggests a probability of 1 5 for the injectant to escape the site there is a large uncertainty in the simulated injectant residence time ranging from 200 to beyond 1000 days these analyses are conservative and do not consider the biodegradability of the injectant which can achieve a 90 degradation over 28 days our modeling shows no evidence that the injectant can reach the light river within this timeframe keywords groundwater model geophysics nuclear magnetic resonance electromagnetics magnetotellurics fractured rock 1 introduction numerical modeling is useful for informing management decisions about groundwater resources hunt and zheng 2012 however its effectiveness is hampered by various sources of uncertainty including data conceptualization and parameterization doherty and simmons 2013 this is partly because spatial continuity of model parameters is generally assumed to support a more straightforward uncertainty analysis while most classical hydrogeological techniques provide point scale information brunner et al 2006 this mismatch can be mitigated by complementing groundwater models with geophysics due to its denser spatial coverage non invasiveness and relatively low cost on an area basis slater 2007 audio frequency magnetotellurics amt and time domain electromagnetics tem are electromagnetic methods that estimate subsurface electrical resistivity which is related to groundwater salinity sediment texture mineralogy and degree of saturation everett 2013 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr a geophysical technique that detects subsurface water directly and provides information on pore size distribution and water content the latter of which is a proxy for porosity in the saturated zone legchenko et al 2002 these geophysical techniques have proven useful in previous studies for constraining important components of groundwater models including conceptualizations geological framework and hydraulic properties for example wagner 2007 used amt to determine the freshwater saltwater transition zone under amchitka island to model the transport of subsurface radioactive materials to the sea floor marker et al 2015 used tem to improve the hydrostratigraphic characterization for a hydrological model to estimate groundwater levels in norsminde denmark boucher et al 2012 used nmr to estimate transmissivity and specific yield for a groundwater model to assess recharge to a sandstone aquifer in niger however these studies only coupled geophysics with groundwater modeling in a deterministic manner where a single best calibrated groundwater model was developed and used to make predictions in addition the uncertainty inherent in geophysical data was rarely quantified and accounted for in groundwater model inversion for groundwater model inversion the gauss levenberg marquardt glm algorithm hanke 1997 is commonly used for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis via programs such as pest doherty et al 1994 pestpp welter et al 2015 and ucode poeter et al 2014 the glm algorithm requires a sensitivity matrix known as the jacobian matrix which is commonly constructed using a finitedifference approach an alternative approach was proposed by white 2018 who implemented the ensemble smoother form of the glm algorithm from chen and oliver 2013 into the pestpp suite referred to as pestpp ies the ensemblesmoother method derives the jacobian matrix empirically from an ensemble of random parameter values white 2018 which has several advantages firstly it produces an ensemble of calibrated models that can be considered to represent the posterior distribution of parameters and predictions which can be readily used for non linear uncertainty analysis and probabilistic predictions in addition observation uncertainty can be expressed as a prior variance and used to form a random observation ensemble allowing the inversion to fit to the observation distribution instead of the observation itself furthermore the ensemble smoother method decouples the number of parameters being estimated from the number of model runs required greatly reducing the computational time needed for highly parameterized models white 2018 the objective of this paper is to couple multiple geophysical techniques of amt tem and nmr with stochastic groundwater modelling using the ensemble smoother framework we demonstrate how this framework can be used as a data assimilation tool to facilitate the flow of information from geophysical and hydrogeological data to the groundwater model prediction of interest we also show how the uncertainty of geophysical data can be expressed in a manner that is relevant for groundwater model inversion this modelling framework was applied in the context of an in situ recovery isr copper mining operation which involves injecting lixiviant into the ground to dissolve and extract minerals through a system of injection and extraction wells sinclair and thompson 2015 the model ensemble was used to predict the regional scale hydrological impact of a hypothetical isr trial operation the results of which are presented in a probabilistic manner 2 methods 2 1 site descriptions the historical kapunda copper mine is located approximately 80 km north east of adelaide south australia fig 1 it has a semi arid climate with a mean annual rainfall of 490 mm y and evaporation of 1800 mm y bureau of meteorology 2020 established in 1842 kapunda was the first mining town in australia and its open pit mine was a key economic driver for the whole continent until its closure in 1879 nirola et al 2016 the remnant low grade copper surrounding the mine was considered to be sub economic and the mine has since been developed into a heritage site and tourist attraction bogenes et al 2003 with the recent advances in isr sinclair and thompson 2015 the feasibility of recovering the remnant copper is under consideration again at the time of writing the proponent is developing a site environmental lixiviant test selt which is a small scale operation using a limited number of injection and extraction wells to test various recovery options the selt operation is planned to be followed by a remediation phase where the remaining injectant is retrieved using the extraction well from a management perspective the key hydrological issues of concern are 1 the flow paths of the injectant and whether it will reach the light river an important environmental asset and 2 the residence time of the injectant in the aquifer this study demonstrates how these questions can be addressed by using a combination of multiple geophysical techniques and stochastic groundwater modeling 2 2 hydrogeological data kapunda is located within the adelaide geosyncline a major geological province in central south australia the local geology is dominated by neoproterozoic aged formations lambert et al 1980 the main geological formations in the study area include the tapley hill formation to the north which covers the hypothetical selt site and the brighton limestone to the south the tapley hill formation primarily consists of blue grey laminated siltstone and slate while the brighton limestone is typically characterized by coarse grained and recrystallized marble units akker and watson 2017 from a hydrogeological perspective these formations behave as an interconnected fractured rock aquifer the hydraulic behavior of which is largely governed by the secondary porosity developed from fracturing jeuken and magarey 2017 a total of 42 observations wells were used in this study fig 1 most of which only have a single groundwater level reading often collected in the 1970s there are no metered groundwater usage data in kapunda as groundwater ec is relatively high in kapunda ranging between 1900 and 22 000 μs cm with a mean of 5800 μs cm 3300 mg l total dissolved solids groundwater usage is assumed to be negligible hydraulic conductivity was estimated from well yield and draw down data using logan approximation logan 1964 by jeuken and magarey 2017 this approach provided 28 estimates of hydraulic conductivity fig 1 ranging between 0 0007 and 0 4 m d with a geometric mean of 0 04 m d the error of this method is likely to be in the order of 50 logan 1964 in addition a 9 hour aquifer test was performed in february 2020 in the northern part of the study area fig 1 and reported a hydraulic conductivity of 0 07 m d effective porosity was estimated to be 1 near the aquifer test site based on fracture logging using a downhole optical scanner to 65 m depth and assuming 50 cementation jeuken and magarey 2017 an initial assessment of groundwater recharge was undertaken using the chloride mass balance method wood 1999 this technique assumes 1d vertical advective flow only and no chloride derived from flow upgradient of the bores the chloride mass balance equation is as follows 1 r e c h a r g e r a i n f a l l c l r a i n f a l l c l g r o u n d w a t e r where cl is chloride concentration mg l in kapunda the average chloride concentration is 9 mg l in rainfall davies and crosbie 2018 and 1100 mg l in groundwater according to the observation well data based on this analysis the long term average recharge rate is 4 mm y which is 0 8 of rainfall note that this method estimates net recharge which already accounts for groundwater evapotranspiration the regional groundwater sink is the light river lamontagne et al 2020 applied various environmental tracers including δd and δ18o of water ec chloride and radon 222 to evaluate the surface water groundwater connectivity of the light river they estimated baseflow to the light river within our study area in 2019 to be in the order of 400 3000 m³ d they also identified a zone of higher groundwater discharge in the eastern part of our study area i e upstream of a in fig 1 2 3 geophysical data 2 3 1 audio frequency magnetotellurics amt is an electromagnetic method

87 sites with a nominal spacing of 100 m fig 1 data were recorded at each site for about 20 h using the phoenix mtu 5a systems yielding good quality amt responses in the bandwidth of 1 10 000 hz the collected amt data were inverted in 3d using modem kelbert et al 2014 the model consists of 100 cells in the east west direction and 120 cells in the north south direction with a minimum cell dimension of 12 m the vertical dimension was discretized into 120 layers with a minimum thickness of 5 m increasing at a rate of 2 with depth impedance error floors were set to 7 for all components the inversion included 26 frequencies spread evenly from 0 001 to 100 hz with five estimates per decade the model roughness was set with a tau of 0 1 and no weighting was applied for either horizontal or vertical smoothing the model misfit with the data has a root mean square error rmse of 1 9 the electrical conductivity ec estimates from the 3d inversion at 50 and 100 m depth are shown in fig 2 the 50 m depth slice shows two distinctly different zones in the study area the more conductive zone to the north is interpreted to be related to the tapley hill formation while the more resistive zone to the south is interpreted to be related to the brighton limestone the 100 m depth slice indicates that ec generally decreases with depth in addition phase tensor analysis of the high frequency amt data suggests that the top 100 m of the fractured rock aquifer is electrically isotropic over the survey area possibly due to deep weathering of the existing bedrock fabric the ec estimates from the inverted amt data can also be used to provide information on hydraulic conductivity via the following petrophysical relationship purvance and andricevic 2000 2 e c a k b where k is hydraulic conductivity m d and a and b are empirical constants which were calibrated using data from the aquifer test and the closest amt station with a hydraulic conductivity of 0 07 m d section 2 2 and a geometric ec mean of 520 μs cm it was estimated that a 950 and b 0 23 while there are other non linear petrophysical relationships to relate ec and k slater 2007 a linear log log relationship eq 2 was adopted in this study for reasons of parsimony which has the potential to cause bias in the model predictions the investigation of different petrophysical relationships on the predictive uncertainty however is beyond the scope of this study 2 3 2 time domain electromagnetics tem involves applying a direct current to a transmitter loop and then shutting the current off abruptly everett 2013 this produces a timevarying magnetic field into the earth subsequently generating eddy currents in subsurface conductors such eddy currents create a secondary magnetic field that is measured by a receiver loop the decay rate of the secondary magnetic field is directly related to ground electrical resistivity everett 2013 compared to amt tem generally has a shallower depth of investigation but a finer resolution at the near surface spies 1989 a tem survey was conducted in may 2019 at 85 sites with a nominal spacing of 100 m the tem sites were chosen to be as close to the amt sites as possible the soundings were collected using the zonge engineering nanotem system this system has fast transmitter turn off and sampling rate to collect near surface data down to 80 m depth in our study area a central loop configuration was used where a single turn 5 m 5 m receiver loop was placed at the center of a single turn 20 m 20 m transmitter loop the transmitter was set to 2 amps and powered by a 12 v battery three data stacks were collected at each station using a repetition rate of 64 hz and sampling period of 1 6 μs the collected tem data were processed to remove noisy late time data and then inverted in 1d using aarhusinv auken et al 2015 as a smooth 20 layer model a transect of the inverted tem data is shown in fig 3 the south eastern side of the transect i e near a shows a thin layer with moderate ec near the surface probably representing the unsaturated zone it is then followed by a highly conductive layer possibly indicating the weathered part of the saturated zone with relatively high porosity and groundwater salinity it then gradually transitions into a more resistive layer potentially representing the unweathered part of the saturated zone with low porosity this layering conceptualization is believed to be applicable throughout kapunda although the unweathered layer may extend to greater depths in other parts of the area figs 2 and 3 given the relative shallowness and high salinity of groundwater in the survey area the water table is expected to be detectable in the tem data as an ec high therefore the ec peak of the tem soundings was used as an indicator of water table depth due to a paucity of groundwater level observations for ground truthing a quality assurance process was performed on the water table estimates using a pseudo bayesian approach where our prior knowledge is based on a potentiometric surface developed using groundwater level observations and water levels of the light river given the absence of groundwater affecting activities e g pumping in the survey area the potentiometric surface is assumed to be a reasonable approximation of the system therefore only the groundwater levels derived from tem that are within 2 m of our prior knowledge totaling 23 estimates fig 1 were used in the groundwater model inversion 2 3 3 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr also known as magnetic resonance sounding mrs is a geophysical technique that exploits the quantum physical properties of hydrogen protons in subsurface water to gain hydrogeological information legchenko et al 2002 the initial amplitude of the received signal is directly related to water content which is a proxy for porosity in the saturated zone in addition a decay time constant t2 is estimated from the decay pattern of the received signal which provides information about pore size distribution behroozmand et al 2015 borehole nmr data were collected in the northern part of the study area fig 1 using vista clara s javelin system equipped with a jpy 350 probe 88 9 mm in diameter to 28 m depth the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used carr and purcell 1954 meiboom and gill 1958 the collected nmr data were processed and inverted using vista clara s javelin pro plus program the decay time constant t2 and total water content from the nmr inversion below the water table are shown in fig 4 note that the total water content includes both connected and isolated pores and it is the former that contributes to groundwater flow therefore the total water content was separated into water content in small moderate and large pores using t2 cut off times of 3 and 33 ms behroozmand et al 2015 we assume groundwater flows primarily in larger pores hence the water content in large pores was used as a proxy for effective porosity however the water content in large pores below 17 m depth appears to be affected by some localized fractures the porosity of which may not be regionally representative fig 4 and hence was excluded from the analysis the remaining data indicate a mean effective porosity of 5 6 this is considerably higher than the value of 1 as suggested by optical scanning but is consistent with akker and watson 2017 who reported an effective porosity of 5 for the same tapley hill formation but approximately 80 km south of the study area the uncertainty in effective porosity is explored further in the groundwater model inversion 2 4 groundwater modeling 2 4 1 model development due to the lack of detailed fracture data at a regional scale in kapunda the fractured rock aquifer was simulated using the equivalent porous medium approach long et al 1982 also despite the importance of rapid flow paths in contaminant transport problems a dual porosity scheme was considered beyond the scope of this study and should be acknowledged as a model limitation a 3d regional scale numerical groundwater model was developed using modflowunstructured grid usg panday et al 2017 the model domain is 5 5 km 5 2 km in area and the model edges were set 2 km away from the study area to avoid boundary effects fig 1 the voronoi grid was generated using algomesh merrick 2016 with a nominal cell size of 10 m² in the study area and up to 25 000 m² in the regional area the same grid was applied to two layers resulting in a total of 294 356 cells the top layer of the model represents the more permeable weathered part of the fractured rock aquifer while the bottom layer represents the less permeable unweathered part of the aquifer the top model surface was sourced from the dem that has a resolution of 5 m 5 m the thickness of the weathered layer was estimated using the amt data where the ec sounding at each station was divided into two layers using the k means clustering technique jain 2010 assuming electrical and hydraulic properties are related these thickness estimates were interpolated within the amt survey area and extrapolated to their geometric mean of 100 m outside the survey area a constant thickness of 100 m was applied to the bottom layer allowing all observation wells to be included in the model the light river and other ephemeral creeks were simulated using modflow s riv package panday et al 2017 time varying river depths were used for the light river based on data from the nearest gauging station the local ephemeral creeks are usually dry except for the wetter winter months hence their river depth was set to 0 m i e river stage equals riverbed elevation river bathymetry was sourced from the dem riverbed conductance was mostly set to 0 1 m² d based on the regional hydraulic conductivity section 2 2 except for the eastern part of the light river in the study area where a higher conductance of 10 m² d was applied as this reach was identified to be a zone of higher groundwater discharge lamontagne et al 2020 the historical mine and quarry were represented as groundwater discharge features using modflow s drn package panday et al 2017 the drain elevation was sourced from the dem and the drain conductance was set to 0 1 m² d the regional lateral groundwater inflows from the northern and southern sides were modeled in both layers using modflow s ghb package panday et al 2017 the head values were derived from groundwater level observations and the conductance was set to 0 1 m² d net groundwater recharge was simulated using modflow s rch package panday et al 2017 annually varying rainfall data were incorporated into the model as recharge multipliers which were multiplied with the spatially varying rainfall to recharge ratios a calibration parameter to derive net recharge groundwater evapotranspiration is not explicitly included in the model as it is already accounted for in net recharge given the relatively high groundwater salinity in kapunda section 2 2 groundwater extraction is assumed to be negligible and hence not simulated in the model the model consists of 53 stress periods the first period is steady state and represents the pre 1970 period which was selected based on the observation data availability this stress period provides the initial conditions for the subsequent 50 transient annual stress periods which represent the time period between 1970 and 2019 and were used for history matching the last two stress periods represent the hypothetical selt operation and remediation phase with a duration of two months and three years respectively all transient stress periods have 10 time steps and a time step multiplier of 1 2 the hypothetical selt operation consists of four injection wells separated by 20 m and one extraction well at the center the operation rate is 0 02 l s for each injection well and 0 1 l s for the extraction well during the remediation phase the extraction well continues to operate at the same rate of 0 1 l s while all the injection wells are switched off transport of the injectant was simulated using the particle tracking code mod path3du craig et al 2020 the only transport mechanism modeled is advection while processes such as dispersion chemical reaction and sorption are considered beyond the scope of this study a circle of 12 particles representing the injectant were placed around each injection well and released at the commencement of the selt operation the model was set to extend the tracking time beyond the end of simulation time by using the flow field from the last time step 2 4 2 model inversion groundwater model inversion was performed using the ensemble smoother method via pestppies white 2018 a brief description of the ensemble smoother method is provided here and readers are referred to white 2018 and chen and oliver 2013 for further details the ensemblesmoother method reformulates the glm algorithm by empirically deriving the jacobian matrix from an ensemble of random parameter values chen and oliver 2013 3 δ θ j e m p t σ ε 1 j e m p 1 λ σ θ 1 1 σ θ 1 θ θ 0 j e m p t d s i m d o b s where 4 j e m p σ ε 1 2 δ s i m δ p a r 1 σ θ 1 2 5 δ s i m σ ε 1 2 d s i m d s i m n e 1 6 δ p a r σ θ 1 2 θ θ n e 1 where δ θ is the parameter upgrade matrix j e m p is the empirically derived jacobian matrix σ ε is the observation noise covariance matrix σ θ is the prior parameter covariance matrix λ is the marquardt dampening parameter θ and θ 0 are the current and initial parameter vector respectively d o b s and d s i m are the observation and simulated equivalent ensembles respectively d s i m and θ are the mean of the simulated equivalents to observations and parameters across their respective ensembles respectively n e is the number of realizations and denotes broadcast subtraction in this study the ensemble size was initially set to 105 realizations to account for situations where some realizations may fail to converge the dampening of the parameter upgrade factor is controlled by λ eq 3 where a high value of λ leads to rapid improvement in the objective function while a low value of λ is better at navigating the objective function space the optimal value for λ is automatically estimated for each inversion iteration through a trial and error procedure based on a subset of the parameter ensemble the whole ensemble is not used to reduce computational time in this study the inversion was converged after 9 iterations based on the following termination criteria 1 if the relative decrease in the mean objective function was less than 1 over 3 iterations or 2 if there was no reduction in the mean objective function for 3 iterations the top 100 realizations with the smallest objective function were used to form the final ensemble the inversion workflow in this study is illustrated in fig 5 the modeled hydraulic conductivity was compared with our prior knowledge including the aquifer test and logan approximation estimates in addition to provide more constraints in the study area the modeled hydraulic conductivity was compared with the amt data this was achieved by converting the hydraulic conductivity field to an ec field using eq 2 and the empirical constants estimated in section 2 3 1 the empirical constants are assumed to be spatially uniform due to the limited aquifer test data given the uncertainty in the petrophysical relationship the amt data were aggregated into five zones using the k means clustering technique jain 2010 the ec comparison was only undertaken for the weathered layer as the unweathered layer possesses a different electrical property figs 2 and 3 where the estimated empirical constants may not apply groundwater levels computed by the flow model were compared with groundwater levels from the observation wells and tem in addition the simulated groundwater flux to the light river within the study area in 2019 was compared with the mean of tracer estimates from lamontagne et al 2020 it is worth noting that effective porosity was not included as a calibration parameter while the ensemble smoother method allows the inclusion of all parameters in the history matching procedure as long as there is a covariance matrix to constrain parameter values the prior and posterior probability distribution of effective porosity are expected to be similar due to the lack of inversion targets for particle tracking therefore the inclusion of effective porosity in the history matching procedure is believed to have minimal contribution to the prediction uncertainty quantification as such given the model objective the uncertainty associated with effective porosity was assessed by undertaking two separate particle tracking runs with different uniform effective porosity values of 1 and 5 which are considered to represent the lower and upper bounds respectively pilot points a method for spatial parameterization were used for all parameter groups doherty 2003 given the fractured rock environment pilot points were placed at each observation to capture the local heterogeneity in addition gaps in the pilot point coverage were filled using a maximum separation distance of 25 m in the study area and 250 m elsewhere in the weathered layer and 500 m in the unweathered layer this resulted in 1397 pilot points in the weathered layer and 103 pilot points in the unweathered layer for each corresponding parameter group spatial correlation between the pilot points were defined using an exponential variogram with nugget 0 sill 1 and a 1100 where a describes the decay rate of spatial correlation with distance and was set to 20 of the model extent the calibration parameters are detailed in table 1 all parameters were log transformed during the inversion the prior parameter variance was calculated based on the assumption that the difference between the upper and lower bound of a parameter group is equal to four standard deviations of its prior probability distribution white 2018 based on the amt data horizontal hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be isotropic i e kx ky a similar assumption was adopted for vertical hydraulic conductivity i e khorizontal kvertical the effect of this assumption is expected to be small given the relatively low permeability of the unweathered layer and therefore the already dominant lateral flow hydraulic conductivity of the unweathered layer was forced to be at least an order of magnitude lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the weathered layer it is worth noting that while the potentially connected high hydraulic conductivity pathways are not explicitly represented in the prior these pathways are expected to be reflected in the amt data that were included in the history matching procedure fig 5 the storage parameter settings are based on the aquifer tests in the adjacent barossa region 30 km away that has a similar hydrogeological setting li and cranswick 2016 specific storage was predominately used for the bottom layer which is confined and for simplicity the same values were applied to the top layer vice versa for specific yield the rainfall to recharge ratios vary spatially but were fixed with time for parsimony reasons the observation groups are detailed in table 2 prior observation variance was calculated in a similar fashion to the prior parameter variance the error bounds are assumed to be 0 2 m for groundwater levels from the observation wells rau et al 2019 2 m for groundwater levels derived from tem and 50 for prior knowledge of hydraulic conductivity logan 1964 the bounds for the ec and baseflow observation groups are based on the actual range of the amt data and tracer estimates lamontagne et al 2020 the ec hydraulic conductivity and baseflow observations were log transformed the prior observation variance values were used to derive the random observation ensemble and observation weights the latter were then adjusted using the program pwtadj1 doherty et al 1994 which automatically scales the observation weights so that all observation groups are equally visible in the objective function 3 results 3 1 history matching performance the history matching performance of the model ensemble for all observation groups is shown in fig 6 for groundwater levels from the observation wells the residual map shows some potential conflicts between data where positive residuals are adjacent negative residuals this may be caused by local heterogeneity given the fractured rock environment or simply a measurement error which cannot be resolved with the currently available data the scatter plot shows a reasonable match between the observed and simulated values with the cloud of points being centered around the 1 1 line and a scaled root mean square error srmse calculated as rmse divided by the observation range of 7 3 for groundwater levels derived from tem both the residual map and scatter plot show an overall overestimation by the model this potentially suggests that the peak of ec profile may be a sub optimal indicator of true water table depth it is possible that the top of the saturated zone may have been diluted by mixing with the relatively fresh rainwater or there is a significant capillary zone nevertheless an rmse of 1 3 m is considered to be within the uncertainty bounds of these groundwater level estimates prior knowledge of hydraulic conductivity includes the aquifer test data and logan approximation estimates the prior knowledge functions like regularization in that the objective function is penalized as the modeled values deviate from the prior values it is worth noting that hydraulic conductivity is a model input not an output that requires calculation like groundwater levels and hence is relatively easy to fit the misfit of hydraulic conductivity between the prior and modeled values is a trade off for the inversion to fit other observation groups especially groundwater levels from the observation wells as most of the prior hydraulic conductivity values are located outside the study area the misfit suggests a potential conflict between these two observation groups which may be caused by the heterogeneous nature of the fractured rock aquifer and or errors in the logan approximation estimates and groundwater level observations for the ec observation group the residual map shows two distinct zones an underestimated zone to the north and an overestimated zone to the south which coincide with the location of tapley hill formation and brighton limestone respectively this suggests that using the same petrophysical relationship empirical constants for these two formations is sub optimal the fit may be improved by undertaking an additional aquifer test so that a separate set of empirical constants can be derived for each of these formations the additional aquifer test may also contribute to the improvement of model predictive accuracy the simulated baseflow to the light river within the study area in 2019 ranges between 290 and 780 m³ d with a mean of 560 m³ d which is mostly within the tracer estimate range of 400 3000 m³ d lamontagne et al 2020 albeit on the lower end of the range this discrepancy may be due to the difference in time scale between the tracer and modeled estimates and or the riverbed conductance term used 3 2 posterior parameter distribution and uncertainty the maximum likelihood and logarithmic standard deviation of the posterior distribution for the calibration parameters are shown in fig 7 hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer is higher in the north eastern part and lower in the south western part of the study area regionally there is a substantial permeable zone to the east and a less permeable zone to the west of the study area potentially indicating the differences in the amount of weathering the unweathered layer typically has a lower hydraulic conductivity although there is a relatively permeable zone in the north eastern part of the study area specific storage is generally high except to the east and south east of the study area while specific yield is higher to the north and lower to the south the rainfall to recharge ratio generally follows topography and is higher in the outer elevated areas and lower in the center low lying areas the logarithmic standard deviation in fig 7 was calculated using parameter values from the 100 model realizations on a cell by cell basis and can be used as an indicator of posterior parameter uncertainty which is highest for hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer its uncertainty is relatively high in the study area probably due to the limited physical measurements of groundwater level in this area in contrast the uncertainty is relatively low near the historical mine which is probably due to the abundance of logan approximation estimates in this area fig 1 both hydraulic conductivity in the unweathered layer and specific yield show a relatively high uncertainty in the southern part of the study area while the uncertainty of specific storage is relatively uniform although the uncertainty of rainfall to recharge ratio is considerably high in the regional areas it is relatively low in most part of the study area 3 3 prediction distribution and uncertainty the predicted injectant flow paths for the hypothetical selt operation are shown in fig 8 for an effective porosity of 1 95 out of the 100 model realizations indicate that all of the injectant may be retrieved while 5 realizations show that the injectant has the potential to reach the light river for an effective porosity of 5 99 out of the 100 model realizations suggest complete removal of the injectant and only 1 realization shows the potential for injectant to reach the river as the travel speed of injectant is inversely proportional to effective porosity the injectant travels at a slower speed in the 5 porosity scenario and hence has a higher probability to be completely retrieved the modeling suggests that it would take 9 175 years after the selt commencement for the injectant to reach the river with a median of 35 years it is important to note that these model runs represent the worst case scenario as processes such as degradation and attenuation are not considered in the modeling it is worth noting that the injectant under consideration is highly biodegradable it is expected that 90 of the injectant will degrade completely within 28 days of exposure to groundwater echa 1999 hidalgo et al 2019 2020 our modeling shows no evidence that the injectant can leave the selt site much less reach the light river within this timeframe further analysis was performed on the injectant residence time in the aquifer after the selt commencement fig 9 this analysis assumes that the injectant does not degrade with time for an effective porosity of 1 the results suggest that most of the injectant may be retrieved between 200 and 400 days after the selt commencement this relatively long residence time was unexpected given the small scale of the selt operation and is likely due to the need of some injectant to travel against the regional groundwater flow gradient to reach the extraction well the relatively low extraction rate and permeability compared to sedimentary aquifers may also contribute to this relatively long residence time for an effective porosity of 5 the results indicate that there may still be up to 20 of injectant remaining in the aquifer even after 1000 days potentially suggesting a longer remediation phase and or a higher extraction rate may be needed again it is important to note that these residence time results represent the worst case scenario and do not consider the biodegradability of the injectant 4 discussion there are various levels of coupling geophysics and groundwater modeling ranging from basic manual conceptual interpretation e g harrington et al 2014 to sequential inversion e g christensen et al 2017 to joint inversion e g herckenrath et al 2013 for sequential inversion outputs from geophysical inversion are used for groundwater model inversion while for joint inversion both the geophysical and groundwater models are inverted simultaneously this study performed a relatively complex sequential inversion that uses amt tem and nmr data to constrain stochastic groundwater modeling this method facilitates the flow of information from geophysical and hydrogeological data to the groundwater model prediction of interest the challenge of coupling geophysics with groundwater modeling is that geophysical techniques rarely provide direct information about hydrogeological properties additional methods and assumptions such as petrophysical relationships are often required to bridge this gap potentially increasing the uncertainty of geophysically derived observations as these relationships may vary depending on local site conditions when using these observations as targets in groundwater model inversion it is critical to quantify and account for their uncertainty to avoid incorrectly biasing model outcomes the ensemble smoother method potentially provides a means to achieve this via the prior observation variance table 2 which expresses observation uncertainty as a prior probability distribution for a given observation a random sample is drawn from its prior probability distribution for each realisation forming an ensemble of random observations this allows the inversion to fit to the observation distribution which incorporates the observation uncertainty instead of the observation itself which may be uncertain especially for the geophysically derived observations there are some limitations in the modeling presented in this paper firstly it is worth noting that the ensemble smoother method may not necessarily converge to the global minimum of the objective function space unlike other stochasic methods such as markov chain monte carlo by using the ensemble smoother method a compromise is implicitly made where some accuracy in the posterior parameters and predictions is sacrificed for computational efficiency secondly as with most other bayesian based techniques the ensemble smoother method is dependent on the priors the derivation of which may sometimes be subjective for geophysically derived observations in this study the tem data were used to estimate groundwater levels in the study area which are acknowledged to be uncertain we assumed the error to be 2 m and expressed this uncertainty as a prior observation variance table 2 which was then incoporated into the groundwater model inversion this error bound is a subjective estimation based on our hydrogeological knowledge of the area nevertheless we demonstrated how multiple geophysical techniques can be used to provide a large set of soft data to aid groundwater model development espeically in areas with limited drillhole informatioion and more importantly how the uncertainty in these soft data can be expressed in a transparent and repeatable framework that can be reviewed and adjusted as needed as for site specific limitations there are some areas in the model where the parameters are at their upper bound especially hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer and recharge fig 7 it is hypothesised that the baseflow estimate may be too high forcing these parameters to reach their upper bound this hypothesis can be tested by collecting more field data including baseflow analysis and aquifer tests meanwhile the ec estimates from the amt inversion were used to provide information on hydraulic conductivity via a petrophysical relationship this requires calibrating the empirical constants against field data ideally aquifer test data due to the limited aquifer test data in the study area we assumed the empirical constants to be spatially uniform the model results suggest that this approach may be sub optimal when applied across multiple geological formations with variable electrical properties the model results are likely to be improved if an additional aquifer test was performed so that a separate set of empirical constants could be derived for each of these formations it is worth noting the difference between the predictive scale and data scales spatially the former is mostly between the selt site and the light river i e within the study area in comparison most of the hydrogeological data including groundwater level observations and hydraulic conductivity estimates lie outside the study area fig 1 therefore the model predictions are likely to be influenced more by the geophysically derived groundwater levels and hydraulic conductivity estimates i e nanotem and amt data within the study area there is considerable uncertainty associated with these geophysically derived datasets and it is therefore important to incorporate their uncertainty explicitly in the modelling workflow as demonstrated in this study transport predictions are preferentially sensitive to rapid transport pathways such as along fractures rather than the average media properties provided from an aquifer test the direct use of aquifer test data for improving model predictive accuracy may therefore be limited instead as demonstrated in this study aquifer test data can be used to provide constraints for the petrophysical relationship that relates k and ec which is critical as the ec distribution contains information about the rapid transport pathways 5 conclusions in this study we coupled multiple geophysical techniques with stochastic groundwater modeling to predict the regional scale hydrological impact of a hypothetical isr trial operation for copper recovery in kapunda south australia the geophysical techniques including amt tem and nmr were used to provide constraints on hydraulic conductivity water table depth hydrostratigraphy and porosity in a data sparse region the groundwater model was used as a data assimilation tool to facilitate the flow of information from the geophysical and hydrogeological data to the model prediction of interest this was achieved using the ensemble smoother method via pestpp ies which produced an ensemble of 100 calibrated models with a reasonable history matching performance an average srmse of 7 3 for groundwater level observations these calibrated models can be considered to represent the posterior distribution of parameters and predictions that can be readily used for non linear uncertainty analysis and probabilistic predictions the model ensemble shows no evidence that the injectant can leave the selt site or reach the light river within its biodegradation timeframe the challenge of coupling geophysics with groundwater modeling is that geophysical techniques rarely provide direct quantification of hydrogeological propoerties additional methods such petrophysical relationships are required to bridge this gap potentially increasing the uncertainty of geophysically derived observations when using these observations as targets in groundwater model inversion it is critical to quantify and account for their uncertainty to avoid incorrectly biasing outcomes the ensemble smoother method potentially provides a means to achieve this via the prior observation variance and random observation

8194,study region the mountainous catchments in the australian alps are one of the highest water yielding regions within a generally dry continent peatlands are critical water regulating components of these catchments and their response to a changing climate will impact all downstream environments and water availability for human uses study focus mountain peatland ecohydrology and in particular the role of evapotranspiration remains incompletely understood this study focused on evapotranspiration and biogeochemical regulation of alpine sphagnum bogs with a case study at watchbed creek peatland eddy covariance was used to quantify evapotranspiration and combined with penman monteith based evapotranspiration to calculate an ecosystem vegetation coefficient kesv base flow evapotranspiration and analyses of cl na ca2 and mg2 in peatland stream water were used to assess biogeochemical processes new hydrological insights for the region this work demonstrates that evapotranspiration is a major component of the water budget 26 of annual precipitation further we show how kesv calculated from direct measurements at one site may enable evapotranspiration to be modelled for other mountain catchments the seasonally dependent nature of the biogeochemical regulation processes observed in this mountain peatland can be used as a reference to evaluate the condition of peatlands under similar synoptic weather conditions in practice this means that mountain ecosystem restoration can now be informed by a better understanding of the ecohydrology of these critical high mountain catchments

baldocchi 2000 lund et al 2017 it is widely recognized that ec is the most defensible approach to measure fluxes of trace gas and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere baldocchi 2014 ec calculations are premised upon ideal conditions which comprise a flat homogeneous land surface with no obstacles distorting the airflow across the surface of interest to the tower gerling et al 2019 these ideal conditions are rarely encountered in actual ecosystems and there are very few ec measurements in montane peatlands where it is challenging to quantify evapotranspiration fluxes due to constraints of surface slope limited fetch and frequent dew formation on open path sensors gerling et al 2019 ec has been successfully used to explore meteorological and hydrological controls on the energy water and carbon soil atmosphere exchanges in a great number of peatlands in the northern hemisphere especially in the boreal region some tropical peatlands and a few new zealand peatlands runkle et al 2014 gerling et al 2019 kellner 2001 goodbrand et al 2019 alberto et al 2011 goodrich et al 2017 hammerle et al 2007 assessed the validity of ec measurements in steeply sloping mountainous terrain and found that with appropriate and rigorous quality control ec can be used to quantify carbon water and energy fluxes over montane grassland actual evapotranspiration et is influenced by both local climate and land surface conditions including the gradient of water potential and the prevailing aerodynamic and surface resistances xueqin et al 2009 duffková 2013 potential evapotranspiration etp is the maximum theoretical et of a well shaded and actively growing vegetation and assumes a continuous supply of sufficient water pereira et al 1999 pereira et al 2015 the food and agricultural organization fao penman monteith method is recommended as the standard method for calculating reference evapotranspiration eto which explains the evaporating power of the atmosphere at a specific location and time and does not consider the crop vegetation characteristics or soil factors allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient kc is the ratio of etp and eto which is used to parameterize the physiological differences between an ecosystem s plant cover in comparison to the reference vegetation allen et al 1998 as recommended by the fao plant water consumption can be estimated based on eto and quantification of actual et in most ecosystems or cropping systems gerling et al 2019 allen et al 1998 kc can vary with the season due to differences in aerodynamic roughness leaf area and albedo pereira et al 1999 kc values have been reported for various crops marsal et al 2013 piccinni et al 2009 zhao et al 2018 and a few naturally vegetated surfaces hou et al 2010 monteiro et al 2016 including quantification of a modified kc for an ombrotrophic peat bog in germany gerling et al 2019 it is valuable to determine local kc values for more precise modelling for example in regional soil hydrological modelling gerling et al 2019 peatlands are important sites of nutrient cycling and productivity mitsch and gosselink 2007 in the australian context alpine peatlands are located at the top of the nation s highest yielding water catchments and have long been recognised as important as nutrient filters and hydraulic sponges costin 1957a more recent work has shown that nutrient uptake is seasonally variable in these systems and that their role in hydraulic buffering is largely limited to short term storage karis et al 2016 silvester 2009 additionally rather than being rain dependent groundwater is a significant component in headwater catchment and therefore peatland water budgets western et al 2008 that is likely critical in sustaining these ecosystems during extended low rainfall periods the regulation of stream water composition by these peatlands is likely a critical function in the context of downstream aquatic ecosystems maintaining a water quality environment that is within tolerance ranges of aquatic biota shackleton et al 2019 determining et in these ecosystems is essential for quantifying chemical transformation fluxes and developing robust hydrochemical models for biogeochemical processes within these peatlands moreover our understanding of the interaction between et and peat soil saturation i e water table depth provides critical information on the seasonal variations in aerobic and anaerobic microbial processes within the peat profile reddy and delaune 2008 hamilton 2010 the aims of this study were 1 to quantify and describe the diurnal and seasonal changes in and drivers of the energy balance in a sphagnum dominated peatland in the australian alps using the ec technique 2 to analyse the temporal dynamics of the et time series at different timescales 3 to model the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto and apply the fao crop coefficient approach to calculate a peatland specific ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv using measured et data 4 to identify the key factors controlling evapotranspiration and 5 combined with ionic analyses of groundwater and peatland drainage to apply the measured et to further understand peatland biogeochemical regulation processes and the potential uptake or production of ionic components that leads to regulation of stream water quality over seasonal timescales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at a peatland heathy spur 1 hs 1 in the watchbed creek catchment s36 51 882 e147 19 0810 on the bogong high plains near falls creek in the victorian alpine national park fig 1 this peatland is a valley bog at an elevation of the site is 1680 1740 m and has been the subject of previous hydrologic and water quality studies silvester et al 2021 silvester 2009 this region has a sub polar oceanic climate cfc with cool summers and cold snowy winters in accordance with the köppen climate classification beck et al 2018 the vegetation community of the peatlands in this region is dominated by sphagnum moss sphagnum cristatum in addition to candle heath richea continentis alpine baeckea baeckea gunniana and rope rush empodisma minus camac et al 2017 the underlying soil is peaty organosol grover 2001 with peat soils greater than 1 m deep in the lower depressions and shallower peat depths on the valley sides less than 0 3 m this ecosystem type is classified as an endangered ecological community alpine sphagnum bogs and associated fens ecological community as listed by the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation epbc act 1999 beeton 1999 the particular peatland studied in this work is considered to be in very good condition as assessed by a range of floristic and peat soil metrics whinam et al 2003 and therefore serves as a reference system for peatland rehabilitation actions the heathy spur 1 peatland is part of a relatively small headwater catchment 25 8 ha and a particular feature of this site is the accessibility of both groundwater feed into the peatland via one major source and several minor sources or seepages and a gauged outflow at the peatland drainage point the main streamline forms near the middle of the peatland and the gauging point is located within the peatland area with no direct terrestrial run off fig 1d long term monitoring of water quality of the groundwater feed reveals that the composition of this water is essentially constant over decadal time scales year range 2006 2021 ph range 5 25 5 40 electrical conductivity range 6 10 μs cm the relatively low ph of this groundwater is largely due to co2 oversaturation while the low electrical conductivity is a result of the highly weathered regolith of the bogong high plains silvester 2009 the ph in the outflow waters varies annually over a wider range ph range 5 5 6 4 as controlled by biogeochemical processes and co2 evasion electrical conductivity varies over a similar range to groundwater without a clear annual pattern electrical conductivity range 3 7 8 5 the composition of groundwater and stream water outflow is dominated by the major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 hco3 nitrate and sulphate are present at relatively low levels in the groundwater no3 range 0 60 μg n l so4 2 range 55 100 μg s l and are largely removed within the peatland through plant uptake and microbial processes karis et al 2016 silvester 2009 2 2 eddy covariance systems and meteorological sensors an eddy covariance flux tower was installed at this site in april 2017 location 36 51 44 s 147 19 15 e au apl www ozflux org au fig 1 to continuously measure fluxes of co2 water vapour and energy fluxes analysed in this study were measured over the period from june 2017 to may 2019 which represents two complete annual cycles starting from southern hemisphere winter a combined sonic anemometer and an open path infrared gas analyser irgason campbell scientific usa sampled the turbulent environment at 2 4 m above the land surface and frequency of 10 hz with the raw measurements stored in a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific usa the tower was also equipped with a series of meteorological instruments to collect low frequency environmental data air temperature ta and relative humidity were measured using an hmp60 vaisala vantaa finland sensor atmospheric pressure was measured with ptb110 sensor vaisala vantaa finland wind dynamics were measured with cup anemometer and wind vane waa151 vaisala vantaa finland and w200p vector instruments uk incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation were measured using a cnr1 radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands ancillary data were logged on the cr3000 datalogger at 30 min intervals two soil heat flux plates hfp01 l campbell scientific usa were installed at 10 cm depth in hummock and hollow micro topographies with two averaging soil thermocouples tcav l campbell scientific usa at 2 and 6 cm below the ground 2 3 pre processing post processing and footprint analysis surface turbulent fluxes of water vapour were collected at a frequency of 10 hz and 30 min averages were calculated via the eddypro 6 2 0 open source software li cor lincoln ne usa the standard verification measures were applied including linear detrending correction of low pass moncrieff et al 1997 and high pass moncrieff et al 2004 filtering effects covariance maximization and wpl correction for density fluctuation webb et al 1980 coordinate rotation of wind speed was performed using a sector wise planar fit approach wilczak et al 2001 and removed spikes in the high frequency data vickers and mahrt 1997 fluxes were quality flagged using the eddypro flags method according to the steady state test as well as the test for developed turbulent conditions and combined into a 0 1 2 quality system mauder and foken 2004 the resultant 30 min fluxes of energy and h2o were subject to post processing using tovi software li cor lincoln ne usa biometeorological data merge and gap filling were done on a monthly basis with measured meteorological data and external data bom 2021 soil heat flux storage correction was done to improve the energy balance closure and compute the storage of energy between the soil surface and the soil heat flux plate tanner and fuchs 1968 failure to account and correct for heat storage in the soil above the plate can result in large errors that would lead to a subsequent underestimate of the latent heat le and sensible heats h ochsner et al 2006 the ec results were subject to further filtering under conditions of stable stratification and low turbulent mixing primarily during the night and a routine criterion for the friction velocity u was applied on a seasonal basis for two years via the moving point test papale et al 2006 the threshold values for friction velocity were 0 238 sd 0 046 winter 0 177 sd 0 037 spring 0 221 sd 0 04 summer and 0 332 sd 0 068 autumn the footprint or area sampled by the flux tower was determined using the kljun et al 2015 footprint model this estimates the degree to which measured fluxes represent the peatland surface and to what extent they are affected by fluxes from the upwind grassland or other surfaces for each 30 min period the assessment showed that the average contribution distance accounting for 80 of flux was 107 m fig 1b the site evaluation approach described by göckede et al 2008 was adopted to assess the spatial representativeness of the flux measurements using a four group classification this analysis showed that 67 of data exceeded an 80 threshold contribution from the peatland and were therefore categorized as acceptable measurements this approach was also applied to each season wherein we found acceptable measurements occurred 71 of the time in spring 69 summer 75 autumn and 65 of the time in winter fluxes from adjacent non target land covers grassland and woodland were filtered from the data set the marginal distribution sampling mds method was used for gap filling to prevent underestimation of ec based evapotranspiration etec in the subsequent calculation of daily averages and monthly and seasonal sums of evapotranspiration reichstein et al 2005 this method is a moving window average method and considers both the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes 2 4 fluxes and energy balance calculations the 30 min mean fluxes and energy balance calculations are described in supplementary material we follow the euroflux methodology of aubinet et al 1999 2 5 reference evapotranspiration and ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient the etec was used to calculate an ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv using an application of the fao crop coefficient model whereby we modified the initial model such that kesv is the ratio between etec mm h 1 and eto mm h 1 under environmental conditions peatland vegetation may be stressed due to a lack of soil moisture and thus etec can be lower than etp and this would influence the kc hence we use kesv as a combined coefficient that parameterizes evapotranspiration not simply from a single crop species as in the original kc but from the whole ecosystem including soil and multiple species of vegetation in the peatland ecosystem the eto was computed following the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration approach outlined by allen et al 1998 satellite data for the leaf area index lai of the peatland was acquired from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive centre https daac ornl gov lai is a dimensionless parameter defined as the one sided photosynthetically active area in the canopy per unit ground area lai data is available for flux tower sites around the world as the product of modis fixed sites subsetting and visualization tool ornldaac 2018 2 6 peatland hydrology and ionic ratios stream water discharge was measured at 30 minute intervals at a gauging weir 90 v notch 300 mm at the peatland drainage point peatland exit with water height recorded using a trutrack water height logger wt hr 500 trutrack ltd christchurch new zealand the water table depth wtd in the peatland was monitored with 5 piezometers installed into the underlying substrate these piezometers were installed in a transect running between the major groundwater source for this peatland and the gauging weir and spaced at 50 m intervals see karis et al 2016 piezometers comprised perforated 32 mm pvc tubing protecting 1 metre trutrack water height loggers wt hr 1000 all loggers were configured to read at 30 min intervals and data transfer was carried out using omni7 software trutrack ltd christchurch new zealand manual readings of weir stage heights were taken for calibration of logger heights water sampling was conducted at 2 4 monthly intervals over the 2 year study period as part of a long term monitoring program all sampling was conducted under base flow conditions the criteria for which were more than seven days after an event of greater than 25 mm as informed by previous long term patterns and event studies at this site silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 water samples were collected from both the major groundwater source feed and weir overflow exit for quantification of physical parameters as well as a range of dissolved components see silvester 2009 for analytical details included in the long term monitoring program analytes are major cations na k ca2 mg2 and major anions cl no3 so4 2 as well as buffering components hco3 dissolved organic carbon in this work we use only a subset of the major ions cl na ca2 mg2 collected for the long term program the rationale for this selection was i ions that are more commonly used for et measurement e g cl cook and herczeg 2012 and ions that exhibit seasonal patterns in this systems that are consistent with et control ca2 and mg2 silvester 2009 the following equation can describe the water balance in this peatland 1 δv pn gi et so go where δv is the change in water storage in the peatland pn is the net precipitation gi is groundwater inflow et is evapotranspiration so is the surface outflow peatland drainage and go is groundwater outflow under the base flow conditions used here for water sampling both δv and pn are negligible allowing groundwater inflows qfeed gi to be calculated from peatland drainage qexit so and et using the aerial extent of the peatland 5 2 ha provided that the groundwater outflow go is negligible this is a reasonable assumption as permeability is very low in the deeply humified peat zone in this work 5 day running averages for both etec and qexit were used consistent with the base flow criteria for an ionic species controlled by water loss through evapotranspiration i e conservative the composition of peatland drainage water relative to groundwater feed is then given by equation 9 2 i o n e x i t i o n f e e d q f e e d q e x i t the key assumptions of this model are i no ion loss through evapotranspiration and ii that the groundwater composition from the major groundwater source is representative of all groundwater inputs into this peatland deviations from conservative behaviour can be attributed to peatland biogeochemical processes e g dry deposition mineral dissolution plant uptake or microbial nutrient cycling ion ratios above that expected from et water loss indicate net export from the peatland while ion ratios less than that expected from et water loss indicate biogeochemical retention or sequestering mechanisms 2 7 statistical analysis univariate anova was used to analyse the significance of the temporal changes in measured and calculated parameters the degree to which environmental variables controlled evapotranspiration was analysed by stepwise multiple linear regression mlr the parameters of mlr equations were estimated assuming that etec was the dependent variable and the environmental variables were independent variables the two year study period was divided into seasonal blocks to allow inter seasonal comparisons all the statistical analyses were performed on the 24 h average values or daily et values using the spss 25 0 program for windows spss inc illinois usa hydrologic and ionic data were manipulated in r and plotted using ggplot2 rstudio team 2015 3 results 3 1 environmental variables impacting upon et primary meteorological variables were collected from june 2017 to may 2019 providing two years of continuous measurements fig 2 incoming solar radiation was generally consistent year round with the mid day average 10 00 14 00 higher in summer 1426 wm 2 and lower in winter 773 wm 2 fig 2a the annual pattern of incoming and outgoing radiation showed seasonal dynamics with the outgoing solar radiation nearly two times higher in winter than in other seasons due to the high albedo of the snow cover air temperature followed the pattern of incoming solar radiation and the mean annual maximum temperature was 9 5 c while the mean annual minimum temperature was 2 7 c fig 2b total rainfall for the two study years was 1976 mm and 2244 mm respectively bom 2021 the majority of precipitation in the australian alps falls as snow and the major snowfalls occur between june and october fig 2c williams 1987 during the measurement period low wind speeds prevailed with a mean wind speed of 3 53 m s 1 and the maximum wind speed of 13 42 m s 1 fig 2d the highest wind speeds were recorded in winter as a consequence of reduced surface friction due to snow cover the vapour pressure deficit vpd was generally low during winter less than 5 hpa indicating near saturation of the air with water vapour while higher average daily vpds were observed in spring and summer periods summer in particular was characterized by extremely low humidity with several days having very high vpds 3 2 energy fluxes and balances 3 2 1 energy balance closure ebc seasonal assessment of the energy balance closure ebc was used in this study to investigate potential uncertainties in the ec measurements and to understand how these may vary through the year the surface energy balance is fundamental for all atmospheric interactions and balance is a theoretical requirement of the first law of thermodynamics ebc is tested by statistically regressing the sensible and latent heat fluxes against the available surface energy and the ideal ebc would be achieved when the slope of the linear regression is unity li et al 2005 the linear regression relationship between the turbulent fluxes h le and available energy rn gf resulted in an ebc slope of 0 72 0 88 0 83 and 0 56 with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 0 96 0 93 and 0 76 for spring summer autumn and winter fig 3 the most complete ebc was observed in the summer season corresponding to the highest flux period of the year decreasing into spring autumn and winter during low flux times of the year ebc is more variable unpredictable and tends to be smaller our results were within the typical closure achieved for ec which ranges from 70 to 90 for most ecosystems poyda et al 2017 except in winter when snow cover and low flux decreased the ebc to 0 56 3 2 2 seasonal changes in energy fluxes the mean hourly energy fluxes for 24 h periods in each season averaged across both years are commensurate with the site s alpine location within the sub polar oceanic köppen cfc climate zone fig 4 day length is notably longer in summer 14 7 hrs compared to winter 10 1 hrs comparatively the daily global solar exposure has its highest monthly mean in january 25 2 mj m 2 and lowest monthly mean in july 5 4 mj m 2 bom 2021 there is also a much greater range in the incoming solar radiation rn in summer than in winter summer 60 wm 2 to 630 wm 2 winter 30 wm 2 to 100 wm 2 this incoming solar energy drives changes in latent heat le sensible heat h and ground surface temperatures gf the partitioning of which varies by season in summer le h fig 4 and this is reflected in a bowen ratio β h le 1 and evapotranspiration fraction ef le le h 0 5 table 1 indicating a large fraction of available energy was used for evapotranspiration in spring and autumn this pattern is reversed with h le fig 4 β of 1 and ef 0 5 all energy flux components were low and variable in the winter fig 4 and so β and ef for this season should be interpreted with caution diurnal variations in gf are very low albeit 10 fold greater in summer compared to winter fig 4 but at all times gf is a minor component of the overall energy balance 3 3 evapotranspiration and ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient evapotranspiration etec and eto show clear seasonal patterns fig 5 a the overlap between measured and estimated values is excellent except in spring sept oct when eto is often greater than etec and a few days in summer when etec is greater than eto seasonal daily average values of etec were 0 38 1 37 3 29 and 1 32 mm day 1 for winter spring summer and autumn respectively the mean ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv for the peatland which is the ratio between etec and eto was 0 78 with an r2 value of 0 84 fig 5b this strong correlation deviates considerably from 1 at low etec values cumulative et curves fig 5c show that both etec and eto in 2017 18 were lower than in 2018 19 and also confirms the close agreement between measured etec and estimated values 3 4 seasonal changes in the ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient and lai the kesv showed apparent seasonal variation which mirrors the changes in the leaf area index lai of the ecosystem fig 6 kesv values ranged between 0 5 in early spring directly after snowmelt up to a maximum of 1 1 in mid summer similarly lai varied between 2 in early spring and 3 75 in mid summer given that this is a highly seasonal ecosystem with winter snow cover we define three stages of vegetation growth october november early growth season december february peak growth season and march may senescence these growth stages are clearly evident in the lai profiles with distinctly higher values during the peak growth season 3 5 compared to either early growth or senescence 2 0 2 5 both kesv and lai were lower in 2017 18 compared to 2018 19 3 5 water table depth and evapotranspiration the water table depth wtd in the peatland showed a clear annual cycle over the two year study period fig 7 with maximum wtd occurring during spring and soon after snowmelt the yearly range in wtd was 400 mm in 2017 18 and 300 mm in 2018 19 during non snow cover periods oct may short term spikes in wtd of up to 300 mm were observed corresponding to rain events these increases in wtd represent the hydraulic buffering provided by the peatland and decayed to pre event levels over less than one week wtd and etec were effectively out of phase with each other with maximum etec occurring in mid to late summer and corresponding to the period of declining wtd an exceptionally dry period occurred during summer 2017 18 leading to very low wtd see highlighted region feb mar 2018 and corresponding with particularly low values of etec average value 0 6 mm d 1 was recorded for two weeks importantly the estimated fraction of precipitation lost from the peatland through evapotranspiration etec p is 0 25 in 2017 18 and 0 28 in 2018 19 and suggests an exceptionally high transfer of precipitation to run off 3 6 relationship between etec and environmental drivers potential relationships between etec and measured environmental variables were explored by single parameter linear regression and multiple linear regression mlr variables considered in this analysis were net radiation rn air temperature ta vapour pressure deficit vpd and water table depth wtd rn was the environmental variable with the highest single parameter correlation to evapotranspiration r2 0 86 and 0 92 for 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively figure s1a ta and vpd were also strongly predictive of etec ta r2 0 8 and 0 91 for 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively vpd r2 0 80 and 0 77 for 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively figure s1b s1c consistent with single parameter regressions mlr identified rn ta and vpd as strong and significant predictors of etec over the entire two year period table s1 r2 0 8 p 0 01 rn and ta p 0 1 vpd mlr for individual seasons similarly identified these three environmental variables as the best predictors of etec in spring and summer table s1 for the winter periods none of the environmental variables showed a strong correlation with etec likely due to snow cover over the peatland during autumn vpd was not significantly correlated with etec but instead wtd rn and ta were identified as significant driving variables the predictive power of these variables however varied between years and was substantially less in autumn 2018 r2 0 34 compared to autumn 2019 r2 0 76 wtd was a strong and significant predictor of etec only in spring p 0 001 3 7 ion ratio comparison with etec the major ion composition of groundwater peatland feed and stream water peatland exit was measured on a 2 4 monthly frequency over the two years of the study sampling occasions are shown in fig 7 this sampling was always conducted under base flow conditions under which the ratio of ion concentrations in peatland exit water to peatland feed ion exit ion feed should be equal to the inflow and outflow ratio qfeed qexit for ions that behave conservatively solid line in fig 8 here we have used the qexit values from 5 day averaged weir plate logger data which were very similar to manual readings recorded at the time of water sampling consistent with base flow conditions figure s2 both cl and na behaved in similar ways to each other across the two years with a net export of ions during spring and retention during summer and autumn fig 8a b this ion retention was somewhat stronger for cl than na for both ions the winter ion ratio was approximately one as expected for this snow covered period when et is low and is consistent with the assumption that the groundwater source sampled for this work is representative of all groundwater inputs under this condition there are effectively no water loss or peatland regulation processes operating so the ionic compositions of feed and exit waters converge overall the patterns observed for cl and na suggest a post snow melt release of these ions followed by a more extended period of ion retention and generally mirror seasonal behaviours previously observed for these ions in this system silvester 2009 ion ratios for ca2 and mg2 were also similar to each other and distinctly different to cl and na for both ca2 and mg2 net export was observed in all seasons approaching that predicted for a conservative ion at both low and high values of qfeed qexit fig 8c d at low qfeed qexit this could be due to reduced biogeochemical reaction rates during winter snow cover months similar to cl and na the net export of these ions outside of winter months suggests a source of these ions within the peatland such as a mineral dissolution or ion exchange process the similar behaviour of ca2 and mg2 in peatland exit water is consistent with the constant ca mg ratio 1 2 molar ratio previously observed across both seasonal and event timescales silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 4 discussion very few ec flux measurements exist for peatlands in mountainous regions due to a range of challenges in measuring surface atmosphere exchanges under these conditions xu et al 2018b gerling et al 2019 in particular landscape heterogeneity has a substantial influence on the measurement and interpretation of atmospheric data schmid and lloyd 1999 schmid 1997 and peatlands in mountainous regions are typically heterogeneous landscapes since for most tower sites the extent of horizontal variation is 1 km or less the scale of horizontal homogeneity will be exceeded by the fetch of the flux measurements jegede and foken 1999 göckede et al 2008 it is therefore critical that a footprint analysis is performed to test whether the spatial representativeness assumptions in the ec method are valid schuepp et al 1990 horst and weil 1992 schmid 2002 leclerc et al 1997 rannik et al 2000 kljun et al 2004 kljun et al 2015 this study demonstrates that it is feasible to acquire ecosystem level et measurements with the ec approach at this mountainous peatland site even with a restricted fetch and heterogeneous surface characteristics this has been achieved by careful consideration of tower placement including prior knowledge of wind direction low installation height adopting a rigorous footprint analysis performing adequate corrections and following standard filtering the flux tower at this peatland site au apl produced a valid data set for 72 of the two years study period after rigorous qa qc suitable for further investigation of et we demonstrate that in small alpine mountainous peatlands the ec technique provides well validated datasets for further ecohydrological analyses 4 1 seasonality and energy balance a number of individual sites within the fluxnet network use energy balance closure ebc as a standard procedure to assess flux data quality li et al 2005 our study results suggest that the closure of the energy balance was strongly connected with seasonal variations while the energy fluxes measured by the ec system were not completely closed the mean ebc 0 78 of the ec measurements was acceptable spring summer and autumn ebcs 72 88 were consistent with previously reported results ranging from 53 to 99 for fluxnet sites li et al 2015 lower ebc during winter has also been reported in other long term studies using eddy covariance li et al 2015 and seasonal evaluation of et and energy budgets deb burman et al 2019 the low ebc during winter is likely caused by a low signal to noise ratio in flux measurements stannard et al 2013 combined with the effects of melting and freezing which were not considered in energy balance evaluation li et al 2005 however in this study the winter season is considered a non growing season and the winter season energy budget makes a relatively small contribution to the yearly energy balance wu et al 2010 across all seasons ebc values less than one suggests an underestimation of the sensible heat h and or latent heat le fluxes applying the energy balance closure adjustment of de roo et al 2018 section 2 3 corrects the eddy covariance measurements of h and le and improves the overall ec derived et estimation sensible heat flux dominated the energy partitioning during the spring and autumn seasons with less energy directed towards le during summer le was larger than h corresponding with high incoming solar radiation as illustrated by fig 2 consistent with the seasonal variations in energy partitioning between h and le β values varied over a wide range 0 42 to 2 2 over the two year study period a similar seasonal pattern was observed in marshland areas in the central united states lenters et al 2011 and in multi season measurements in wetlands in north eastern china zhou and zhou 2009 gerling et al 2019 showed that the seasonal variation of β is inversely related to the variation in vpd vpd increases exponentially with atmospheric temperature leading to lower β values during summer hirano et al 2016 shimoyama et al 2003 majozi et al 2016 the concurrence in the above studies including this one is that vegetation dynamics play a crucial role in energy partitioning and that in summer with during l vegetation cover le flux is the dominant portion of net radiation 4 2 evapotranspiration and run off our observations over two complete years contribute significantly to the understanding of mountain peatland evapotranspiration characteristics and their response to hydro meteorological changes a hydrological modelling study of the 335 ha watchbed creek catchment that this peatland forms part of suggested that the estimated annual potential et was 558 mm averaged over the years 1940 1986 with the highest values during summer january pet 145 mm and lowest in winter june pet 35 mm western et al 2008 our average annual etec of 556 mm for a peatland in this catchment appears reasonable when compared with other sphagnum dominant peatland ecosystems under similar synoptic weather conditions for example cao et al 2020 observed that the annual et in an alpine wetland ecosystem in qinghai on the tibetan plateau was 644 mm year petrone et al 2001 showed a growing season average et in restored peatlands in quebec of 354 mm wu et al 2010 found the et of boreal peatlands in eastern finland to be 321 mm and hirano et al 2016 measured the et of sarobetsu mire japan to be 372 mm similarly gerling et al 2019 reported a maximum et of 5 6 mm d 1 for an ombrotrophic peat bog in central germany and lafleur et al 2005 recorded maximum et rates at a peatland in ontario canada ranging over 4 5 mm d 1 similar to the summer etec of this study synoptic weather conditions i e air temperature vapour pressure deficit and incoming solar radiation could explain differences in etec among the seasons and between study years table s1 and figure s1 consistent with this our study shows that evapotranspiration is a function of rn ta and vpd while it is inversely proportional and weakly correlated with wtd figure s1 however differences were observed between seasons with spring summer and autumn showing the strongest correlations with these environmental factors cumulative et data fig 5c show that annual et in 2018 19 was higher than in 2017 18 which we attribute to a low rainfall period during february march in 2017 18 resulting in an exceptionally low water table this result is different to that observed by moore et al 2013 where short term water table variation did not control et in a peatland ecosystem very few other studies have characterised interannual variability of et in relation to changes in moisture availability lafleur et al 2005 liljedahl et al 2011 the reduced et at extremely low water table depths may be due to the absence of any mechanism for the transportation of water from deeper in the peat profile the dominant sphagnum moss has no stomata roots or water conducting tissues so vertical water transport may be limited shimoyama et al 2003 the ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv approach applied in this study provides evidence of a strong relationship between etec and eto and this coefficient as determined separately for each season can effectively be used in ecohydrological studies of other mountain peatlands with similar vegetation kesv values determined for each season were 0 68 spring early growing season 1 12 summer peak growing season and 0 88 autumn senescence the kesv obtained for this peatland were in a similar range to that reported for ombrotrophic peat bog odersprungmoor in the harz mountains central germany kc in the range 0 82 0 86 gerling et al 2019 in the australian mountains the spring season is potentially the most sensitive to the difference between etec and eto because some of the available energy in the peatland is likely used to heat the standing water once the standing water in the peatland has heated more of the net radiation rn is directed towards h and le drexler et al 2008 seasonal variation in the effective leaf area coverage and photosynthetic capacity of the vegetation described by lai and which are only relevant outside the snow cover season display a similar trend to the kesv in the early growing season the reduced leaf development after snowmelt coincided with lower kesv while both parameters were highest in mid summer corresponding to the peak growing season the strong seasonal variability in kesv values obtained in this work suggests that the use of a single kesv is not appropriate in mountain peatlands this region experiences high precipitation and our work suggests that the average net evapotranspiration is 26 5 of the precipitation the remaining portion of precipitation is presumably contributing to catchment run off consistent with this western et al 2008 showed through hydrological modelling analysis that the average run off coefficient for the entire watchbed creek catchment 335 ha including this study area was 0 77 further lawrence 1995 proposed that for the watchbed creek catchment 67 of effective precipitation appeared in streams as quick flow for effective precipitation values between 0 9 and 4 5 mm while 40 of effective precipitation appeared in streams as quick flow for effective precipitation values greater than 4 5 mm importantly this suggests that the run off potential is very high in the study area compared to elsewhere in the australian landscape lawrence 1995 precipitation and therefore run off is generally lowest at the end of summer february march which leads to the lowering of the peatland water table during this low rain period the only significant inflows are from groundwater aquifers that provide sustained flow to these alpine aquatic ecosystems mccartney et al 2014 climate change projections for the australian alps forecast decreasing snowpack extent and depth laurance et al 2011 pickering et al 2004 which will likely impact groundwater recharge and affect the future viability of these peatland ecosystems 4 3 evapotranspiration and ion ratios seasonal patterns in nutrient and ion concentrations in peatland drainage water for this peatland have been described previously silvester 2009 this previous work has shown strong uptake of nitrate and sulphate during warmer months and an atypical behaviour for na and cl with apparent uptake of these ions during warmer high productivity periods among the major ions only ca2 and mg2 show annual patterns in stream concentrations consistent with water loss through et here we confirm that strong ion retention uptake and export release mechanisms operate for na and cl while the net export of these ions could be due to a snowmelt flush this effect continues well after snowmelt and does not explain the peatland uptake of these ions other possible explanations are uptake and release associated with biological processes such as plant growth during high productivity periods followed by senescence or microbial uptake e g organochlorine compounds bastviken et al 2007 and release a key issue with both of these mechanisms is that the export of these ions occurs into late spring whereas senescence or microbial die off is more likely an autumn process while we are unaware of similar seasonal uptake release mechanisms for these ions in other wetlands these processes may be more evident in this peatland due to the extremely low salt concentrations in the groundwater silvester 2009 a significant result from the behaviour of na and cl is that the ion ratio approaches a value of one 1 under low et conditions this is consistent with a key assumption of the model that the groundwater composition of the major source is representative of all groundwater sources into this peatland ca2 and mg2 concentrations approach that expected for a conservative ion at both high and low qfeed qexit but are always higher indicating net export under all conditions the approach to conservative behaviour at high qfeed qexit is consistent with previous observations for this system that et calculated from ca2 and mg2 concentrations yield physically reasonable values under high et conditions 1 7 2 5 mm d 1 silvester 2009 silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 the differences between observed and et predicted concentrations indicate additional sources of these ions from the peatland broadly these sources could include dry atmospheric deposition the net loss of stored peat or mineral dissolution exchange processes within the peatland the pronounced seasonality of stream water ca2 and mg2 concentrations is a strong argument against dry deposition the timing and loads of which are unlikely to be annually reproducible the more compelling result is from storm response studies at this site karis et al 2016 which show that both ca2 and mg2 concentrations are unaffected by high intensity rainfall events a significant dilution would be expected if these ions were controlled by dry deposition or peat soil decay a mineral exchange or dissolution mechanism appears the most likely explanation of the observed behaviour where peatland drainage concentrations are controlled by a physical property of the peatland that is seasonally variable e g temperature water table redox potential overall the observed seasonal patterns in uptake and release of ionic components confirm the strong controls on stream water composition water quality provided by these headwater peatlands given that both groundwater and rainfall contribute to the overall water budget the seasonally reproducible regulation of peatland drainage water is likely a key function of these systems in the landscape 4 4 implications for mountain peatland protection and rehabilitation heathy spur 1 hs 1 is an intact alpine sphagnum peatland in the bogong high plains victoria australia that serves as a reference ecosystem for understanding hydrological and biogeochemical functions of peatlands more broadly in this mountain landscape peatlands in the australian alps are highly restricted ecosystems forming in hillside valley floors in close association with groundwater sources mccartney et al 2014 these ecosystems are highly likely to be stressed by future changes in precipitation regime from climate change understanding the water budget of these systems will be critical in predicting future trajectories for these systems and impacts on water yields from the australian alps quantifying the et flux from this peatland and the climate factors that drive et is an important component in developing a more complete water budget and separating the relative contributions of precipitation snowmelt and groundwater in driving these ecosystems consistent with the high water yields from the australian alps our data shows a low evaporation factor for this peatland reflecting an environment with a substantial excess water yield to downstream catchments importantly our results suggest that under extended low rainfall periods et may decrease due to disconnection between the water table and vegetation layer this study provides the first application of ec techniques to measure etec and kesv in australia s mountainous peatland ecosystems peatland restoration requires precise evapotranspiration estimates in order to successfully manage site hydrology holden 2005 however assessing actual evapotranspiration at each site is complex costly and maybe impossible depending on the location budget and time frame howes et al 2015 for example australian alpine sphagnum peatlands occur as a mosaic of many small peatlands within the wider landscape and thus direct measurement of evapotranspiration using ec at many sites is not possible due to landscape heterogeneity and slope this study has determined kesv as a critical element of hydrological function which has the possibility of wider applicability the kesv values calculated in this study can provide a more accurate estimate of et than traditional climate data based approaches for other australian alpine sphagnum peatlands as well as peatlands in other areas with similar climatic conditions furthermore the use of season specific kesv values could contribute to improved accuracy in hydrological models from catchment to regional scales the delivery of large volumes of high quality water is a key ecosystem service provided by the australian alps worboys and good 2011 understanding the chemical regulation processes that occur in all hydrologic components including those processes that occur at the top of catchments in peatland systems is key to the long term protection of this water quality previous work has demonstrated that drainage stream water quality is highly regulated in these peatland systems both on seasonal as well as event timescales silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 since et is a major component in the peatland water balance and a major driver of seasonal variations in drainage water concentration the measurement of et is a critical step in identifying peatland uptake and release processes our results show that these peatland biogeochemical processes show a strong seasonal patterning most likely linked to peatland productivity and the generation of fixed carbon for microbial processes we suggest these seasonal patterns are applicable across the australian alps for intact peatlands under similar synoptic weather conditions and could be used as part of a set of metrics to assess peatland condition and rehabilitation this study will be an effective tool for understanding the response of peatlands to changing climate and land management practices peatlands in this landscape are already in a range of conditions due to past land management practices e g cattle grazing and more recent disturbances e g feral animal weeds that will likely impact resilience to future stressors understanding the hydrology and linked biogeochemistry of these peatlands is integral to establishing favourable conditions for rehabilitation actions petrone et al 2001 5 conclusions four main conclusions are drawn from this study 1 annual evapotranspiration from this peatland was 494 mm in 2017 18 and 618 mm in 2018 19 representing 26 5 of annual precipitation etec increased rapidly after snowmelt and reached maximum values in early summer winter etec was 6 2 of the annual et due to snow cover 2 the kesv varied seasonally between 0 5 spring and autumn and 1 1 summer this study identified three distinct phenological stages in peatland productivity and suggested that the application of a single year round kesv value is not appropriate in mountain peatland ecosystems 3 this study revealed that evapotranspiration dynamics of the peatland are primarily influenced by net radiation air temperature vpd and weakly influenced by water table depth wtd the exception is during severe drought periods when very low water table depth did correspond with reduced et 4 the measurement of et reveals that for cl and na the observed annual cycle is due to ion release and uptake with net export in spring and net uptake in summer autumn for ca2 and mg2 net export occurs at all times of the year and indicates a seasonally dependent mechanism author contributions mg sg es conceptualization mg data curation mg es formal analysis

8194,study region the mountainous catchments in the australian alps are one of the highest water yielding regions within a generally dry continent peatlands are critical water regulating components of these catchments and their response to a changing climate will impact all downstream environments and water availability for human uses study focus mountain peatland ecohydrology and in particular the role of evapotranspiration remains incompletely understood this study focused on evapotranspiration and biogeochemical regulation of alpine sphagnum bogs with a case study at watchbed creek peatland eddy covariance was used to quantify evapotranspiration and combined with penman monteith based evapotranspiration to calculate an ecosystem vegetation coefficient kesv base flow evapotranspiration and analyses of cl na ca2 and mg2 in peatland stream water were used to assess biogeochemical processes new hydrological insights for the region this work demonstrates that evapotranspiration is a major component of the water budget 26 of annual precipitation further we show how kesv calculated from direct measurements at one site may enable evapotranspiration to be modelled for other mountain catchments the seasonally dependent nature of the biogeochemical regulation processes observed in this mountain peatland can be used as a reference to evaluate the condition of peatlands under similar synoptic weather conditions in practice this means that mountain ecosystem restoration can now be informed by a better understanding of the ecohydrology of these critical high mountain catchments

decomposition of plant material ongoing peatland survival and characteristics depend upon the chemical composition and seasonal periodicity of the water supply labadz et al 2010 gorham 1957 previous studies have shown that hydrological conditions are a fundamental determinant of the carbon budget and critical in peatland development and decay berger et al 2019 holden 2005 modelling suggests that hydrology in particular evapotranspiration influences temperature and hence biogeochemical cycling in peatlands weiss et al 2006 however peatland hydrology is still poorly understood with a lack of long term hydrological monitoring data and challenges in scaling up from plot to catchment scale even in areas with extensive peatlands labadz et al 2010 swindles et al 2019 pemberton 2005 evapotranspiration et involves the exchange of water and energy between soil land surface and atmosphere by the processes of transpiration and evaporation liu et al 2019 et is a significant part of the water cycle in terrestrial systems accounting for 60 65 of all precipitation that falls on the terrestrial surface of the earth liu et al 2019 wang and dickinson 2012 accurate and long term information on et from direct measurements is critical to gaining a better understanding of the interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere as well as understanding the underlying ecohydrological processes and addressing climate change questions brubaker and entekhabi 1996 however et is considered the most problematic term in the hydrological budget due to its heterogeneity across the landscape and the range of factors influencing et processes fleischer et al 2015 et can be measured by numerous methods and at various scales continuous estimation of et can be achieved by six different methods namely eddy covariance ec bowen ratio weighable lysimeters scintillometer surface water balance and atmosphere water balance methods wang and dickinson 2012 ec is a commonly adopted technique to measure ecosystem scale surface energy fluxes and et involving the determination of turbulent fluxes of energy and water from the covariance of their respective eddies wilson and baldocchi 2000 lund et al 2017 it is widely recognized that ec is the most defensible approach to measure fluxes of trace gas and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere baldocchi 2014 ec calculations are premised upon ideal conditions which comprise a flat homogeneous land surface with no obstacles distorting the airflow across the surface of interest to the tower gerling et al 2019 these ideal conditions are rarely encountered in actual ecosystems and there are very few ec measurements in montane peatlands where it is challenging to quantify evapotranspiration fluxes due to constraints of surface slope limited fetch and frequent dew formation on open path sensors gerling et al 2019 ec has been successfully used to explore meteorological and hydrological controls on the energy water and carbon soil atmosphere exchanges in a great number of peatlands in the northern hemisphere especially in the boreal region some tropical peatlands and a few new zealand peatlands runkle et al 2014 gerling et al 2019 kellner 2001 goodbrand et al 2019 alberto et al 2011 goodrich et al 2017 hammerle et al 2007 assessed the validity of ec measurements in steeply sloping mountainous terrain and found that with appropriate and rigorous quality control ec can be used to quantify carbon water and energy fluxes over montane grassland actual evapotranspiration et is influenced by both local climate and land surface conditions including the gradient of water potential and the prevailing aerodynamic and surface resistances xueqin et al 2009 duffková 2013 potential evapotranspiration etp is the maximum theoretical et of a well shaded and actively growing vegetation and assumes a continuous supply of sufficient water pereira et al 1999 pereira et al 2015 the food

parameterize the physiological differences between an ecosystem s plant cover in comparison to the reference vegetation allen et al 1998 as recommended by the fao plant water consumption can be estimated based on eto and quantification of actual et in most ecosystems or cropping systems gerling et al 2019 allen et al 1998 kc can vary with the season due to differences in aerodynamic

example in regional soil hydrological modelling gerling et al 2019 peatlands are important sites of nutrient cycling and productivity mitsch and gosselink 2007 in the australian context alpine peatlands are located at the top of the nation s highest yielding water catchments and have long been recognised as important as nutrient filters and hydraulic sponges costin 1957a more recent work has shown that nutrient uptake is seasonally variable in these systems and that their role in hydraulic buffering is largely limited to short term storage karis et al 2016 silvester 2009 additionally rather than being rain dependent groundwater is a significant component in headwater catchment and therefore peatland water budgets western et al 2008 that is likely critical in sustaining these ecosystems during extended low rainfall periods the regulation of stream water composition by these peatlands is likely a critical function in the context of downstream aquatic ecosystems maintaining a water quality environment that is within tolerance ranges of aquatic biota shackleton et al 2019 determining et in these ecosystems is essential for quantifying chemical transformation fluxes and developing robust hydrochemical models for biogeochemical processes within these peatlands moreover our understanding of the interaction between et and peat soil saturation i e water table depth provides critical information on the seasonal variations in aerobic and anaerobic microbial processes within the peat profile reddy and delaune 2008 hamilton 2010 the aims of this study were 1 to quantify and describe the diurnal and seasonal changes in and drivers of the energy balance in a sphagnum dominated peatland in the australian alps using the ec technique 2 to analyse the temporal dynamics of the et time series at different timescales 3 to model the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto and apply the fao crop coefficient approach to calculate a peatland specific ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv using measured et data 4 to identify the key factors controlling evapotranspiration and 5 combined with ionic analyses of groundwater and peatland drainage to apply the measured et to further understand peatland biogeochemical regulation processes and the potential uptake or production of ionic components that leads to regulation of stream water quality over seasonal timescales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at a peatland heathy spur 1 hs 1 in the watchbed creek catchment s36 51 882 e147 19 0810 on the bogong high plains near falls creek in the victorian alpine national park fig 1 this peatland is a valley bog at an elevation of the site is 1680 1740 m and has been the subject of previous hydrologic and water quality studies silvester et al 2021 silvester 2009 this region has a sub polar oceanic climate cfc with cool summers and cold snowy winters in accordance with the köppen climate classification beck et al 2018 the vegetation community of the peatlands in this region is dominated by sphagnum moss sphagnum cristatum in addition to candle heath richea continentis alpine baeckea baeckea gunniana and rope rush empodisma minus camac et al 2017 the underlying soil is peaty organosol grover 2001 with peat soils greater than 1 m deep in the lower depressions and shallower peat depths on the valley sides less than 0 3 m this ecosystem type is classified as an endangered ecological community alpine sphagnum bogs and associated fens ecological community as listed by the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation epbc act 1999 beeton 1999 the particular peatland studied in this work is considered to be in very good condition as assessed by a range of floristic and peat soil metrics whinam et al 2003 and therefore serves as a reference system for peatland rehabilitation actions the heathy spur 1 peatland is part of a relatively small headwater catchment 25 8 ha and a particular feature of this site is the accessibility of both groundwater feed into the peatland via one major source and several minor sources or seepages and a gauged outflow at the peatland drainage point the main streamline forms near the middle of the peatland and the gauging point is located within the peatland area with no direct terrestrial run off fig 1d long term monitoring of water quality of the groundwater feed reveals that the composition of this water is essentially constant over decadal time scales year range 2006 2021 ph range 5 25 5 40 electrical conductivity range 6 10 μs cm the relatively low ph of this groundwater is largely due to co2 oversaturation while the low electrical conductivity is a result of the highly weathered regolith of the bogong high plains silvester 2009 the ph in the outflow waters varies annually over a wider range ph range 5 5 6 4 as controlled by biogeochemical processes and co2 evasion electrical conductivity varies over a similar range to groundwater without a clear annual pattern electrical conductivity range 3 7 8 5 the composition of groundwater and stream water outflow is dominated by the major cations na k ca2 mg2 and

to improve the energy balance closure and compute the storage of energy between the soil surface and the soil heat flux plate tanner and fuchs 1968 failure to account and correct for heat storage in the soil above the plate can result in large errors that would lead to a subsequent underestimate of the latent heat le and sensible heats h ochsner et al 2006 the ec results were subject to further filtering under conditions of stable stratification and low turbulent mixing primarily during the night and a routine criterion for the friction velocity u was applied on a seasonal basis for two years via the moving point test papale et al 2006 the threshold values for friction velocity were 0 238 sd 0 046 winter 0 177 sd 0 037 spring 0 221 sd 0 04 summer and 0 332 sd 0 068 autumn the footprint or area sampled by the flux tower was determined using the kljun et al 2015 footprint model this estimates the degree to which measured fluxes represent the peatland surface and to what extent they are affected by fluxes from the upwind grassland or other surfaces for each 30 min period the assessment showed that the average contribution distance accounting for 80 of flux was 107 m fig 1b the site evaluation approach described by göckede et al 2008 was adopted to assess the spatial representativeness of the flux measurements using a four group classification this analysis showed that 67 of data exceeded an 80 threshold contribution from the peatland and were therefore categorized as acceptable measurements this approach was also applied to each season wherein we found acceptable measurements occurred 71 of the time in spring 69 summer 75 autumn and 65 of the time in winter fluxes from adjacent non target land covers grassland and woodland were filtered from the data set the marginal distribution sampling mds method was used for gap filling to prevent underestimation of ec based evapotranspiration etec in the subsequent calculation of daily averages and monthly and seasonal sums of evapotranspiration reichstein et al 2005 this method is a moving window average method and considers both the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes 2 4 fluxes and energy balance calculations the 30 min mean fluxes and energy balance calculations are described in supplementary material we follow the euroflux methodology of aubinet et al 1999 2 5 reference evapotranspiration and ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient the etec was used to calculate an ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv using an application of the fao crop coefficient model whereby we modified the initial model such that kesv is the ratio between etec mm h 1 and eto mm h 1 under environmental conditions peatland vegetation may be stressed due to a lack of soil moisture and thus etec can be lower than etp and this would influence the kc hence we use kesv as a combined coefficient that parameterizes evapotranspiration not simply from a single crop species as in the original kc but from the whole ecosystem including soil and multiple species of vegetation in the peatland ecosystem the eto was computed following the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration approach outlined by allen et al 1998 satellite data for the leaf area index lai of the peatland was acquired from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive centre https daac ornl gov lai is a dimensionless parameter defined as the one sided photosynthetically active area in the canopy per unit ground area lai data is available

new zealand the water table depth wtd in the peatland was monitored with 5 piezometers installed into the underlying substrate these piezometers were installed in a transect running between the major groundwater source for this peatland and the gauging weir and spaced at 50 m intervals see karis et al 2016 piezometers comprised perforated 32 mm pvc tubing protecting 1 metre trutrack water height loggers wt hr 1000 all loggers were configured to read at 30 min intervals and data transfer was carried out using omni7 software trutrack ltd christchurch new zealand manual readings of weir stage heights were taken for calibration of logger heights water sampling was conducted at 2 4 monthly intervals over the 2 year study period as part of a long term monitoring program all sampling was conducted under base flow conditions the criteria for which were more than seven days after an event of greater than 25 mm as informed by previous long term patterns and event studies at this site silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 water samples were collected from both the major groundwater source feed and weir overflow exit for quantification of physical parameters as well as a range of dissolved components see silvester 2009 for analytical details included in the long term monitoring program analytes are major cations na k ca2 mg2 and major anions cl no3 so4 2 as well as buffering components hco3 dissolved organic carbon in this work we use only a subset of the major ions cl na ca2 mg2 collected for the long term program the rationale for this selection was i ions that are more commonly used for et measurement e g cl cook and herczeg 2012 and ions that exhibit seasonal patterns in this systems that are consistent with et control ca2 and mg2 silvester 2009 the following equation can describe the water balance in this peatland 1 δv pn gi et so go where δv is the change in water storage in the peatland pn is the net precipitation gi is groundwater inflow et is evapotranspiration so is the surface outflow peatland drainage and go is groundwater outflow under the base flow conditions used here for water sampling both δv and pn are negligible allowing groundwater inflows qfeed gi to be calculated from peatland drainage qexit so and et using the aerial extent of the peatland 5 2 ha provided that the groundwater outflow go is negligible this is a reasonable assumption as permeability is very low in the deeply humified peat zone in this work 5 day running averages for both etec and qexit were used consistent with the base flow criteria for an ionic species controlled by water loss through evapotranspiration i e conservative the composition of peatland drainage water relative to groundwater feed is then given by equation 9 2 i o n e x i t i o n f e e d q f e e d q e x i t the key assumptions of this model are i no ion loss through evapotranspiration and ii that the groundwater composition from the major groundwater source is representative of all groundwater inputs into this peatland deviations from conservative behaviour can be attributed to peatland biogeochemical processes e g dry deposition mineral dissolution plant uptake or microbial nutrient cycling ion ratios above that expected from et water loss indicate net export from the peatland while ion ratios less than that expected from et water loss indicate biogeochemical retention or sequestering mechanisms 2 7 statistical analysis univariate anova was used to analyse the significance of the temporal changes in measured and calculated parameters the degree to which environmental variables controlled evapotranspiration was analysed by stepwise multiple linear regression mlr the parameters of mlr equations were estimated assuming that etec was the dependent variable and the environmental variables were independent variables the two year study period was divided into seasonal blocks to allow inter seasonal comparisons all the statistical analyses were performed on the 24 h average values or daily et values using the spss 25 0 program for windows spss inc illinois usa hydrologic and ionic data were manipulated in r and plotted using ggplot2 rstudio team 2015 3 results 3 1 environmental variables impacting upon et primary meteorological variables were collected from june 2017 to may 2019 providing two years of continuous measurements fig 2 incoming solar radiation was generally consistent year round with the mid day average 10 00 14 00 higher in summer 1426 wm 2 and lower in winter 773 wm 2 fig 2a the annual pattern of incoming and outgoing radiation showed seasonal dynamics with the outgoing solar radiation nearly two times higher in winter than in other seasons due to the high albedo of the snow cover air temperature followed the pattern of incoming solar radiation and the mean annual maximum temperature was 9 5 c while the mean annual minimum temperature was 2 7 c fig 2b total rainfall for the two study years was 1976 mm and 2244 mm respectively bom 2021 the majority of precipitation in the australian alps falls as snow and the major snowfalls occur between june and october fig 2c williams 1987 during the measurement period low wind speeds prevailed with a mean wind speed of 3 53 m s 1 and the maximum wind speed of 13 42 m s 1 fig 2d the highest wind speeds were recorded in winter as a consequence of reduced surface friction due to snow cover the vapour pressure deficit vpd was generally low during winter less than 5 hpa indicating near saturation of the air with water vapour while higher average daily vpds were observed in spring and summer periods summer in particular was characterized by extremely low humidity with several days having very high vpds 3 2 energy fluxes and balances 3 2 1 energy balance closure ebc seasonal assessment of the energy balance closure ebc was used in this study to investigate potential uncertainties in the ec measurements and to understand how these may vary through the year the surface energy balance is fundamental for all atmospheric interactions and balance is a theoretical requirement of the first law of thermodynamics ebc is tested by statistically regressing the sensible and latent heat fluxes against the available surface energy and the ideal ebc would be achieved when the slope of the linear regression is unity li et al 2005 the linear regression relationship between the turbulent fluxes h le and available energy rn gf resulted in an ebc slope of 0 72 0 88 0 83 and 0 56 with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 0 96 0 93 and 0 76 for spring summer autumn and winter fig 3 the most complete ebc was observed in the summer season corresponding to the highest flux period of the year decreasing into spring autumn and winter during low flux times of the year ebc is more variable unpredictable and tends to be smaller our results were within the typical closure achieved for ec which ranges from 70 to 90 for most ecosystems poyda et al 2017 except in winter when snow cover and low flux decreased the ebc to 0 56 3 2 2 seasonal changes in energy fluxes the mean hourly energy fluxes for 24 h periods in each season averaged across both years are commensurate with the site s alpine location within the sub polar oceanic köppen cfc climate zone fig 4 day length is notably longer in summer 14 7 hrs compared to winter 10 1 hrs comparatively the daily global solar exposure has its highest monthly mean in january 25 2 mj m 2 and lowest monthly mean in july 5 4 mj m 2 bom 2021 there is also a much greater range in the incoming solar radiation rn in summer than in winter summer 60 wm 2 to 630 wm 2 winter 30 wm 2 to 100 wm 2 this incoming solar energy drives changes in latent heat le sensible heat h and ground surface temperatures gf the partitioning of which varies by season in summer le h fig 4 and this is reflected in a bowen ratio β h le 1 and evapotranspiration fraction ef le le h 0 5 table 1 indicating a large fraction of available energy was used for evapotranspiration in spring and autumn this pattern is reversed with h le fig 4 β of 1 and ef 0 5 all energy flux components were low and variable in the winter fig 4 and so β and ef for this season should be interpreted with caution diurnal variations in gf are very low albeit 10 fold greater in summer compared to winter fig 4 but at all times gf is a minor component of the overall energy balance 3 3 evapotranspiration and ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient evapotranspiration etec and eto show clear seasonal patterns fig 5 a the overlap between measured and estimated values is excellent except in spring sept oct when eto is often greater than etec and a few days in summer when etec is greater than eto seasonal daily average values of etec were 0 38 1 37 3 29 and 1 32 mm day 1 for winter spring summer and autumn respectively the mean ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv for the peatland which is the ratio between etec and eto was 0 78 with an r2 value of 0 84 fig 5b this strong correlation deviates considerably from 1 at low etec values cumulative et curves fig 5c show that both etec and eto in 2017 18 were lower than in 2018 19 and also confirms the close agreement between measured etec and estimated values 3 4 seasonal changes in the ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient and lai the kesv showed apparent seasonal variation which mirrors the changes in the leaf area index lai of the ecosystem fig 6 kesv values ranged between 0 5 in early spring directly after snowmelt up to a maximum of 1 1 in mid summer similarly lai varied between 2 in early spring and 3 75 in mid summer given that this is a highly seasonal ecosystem with winter snow cover we define three stages of vegetation growth october november early growth season december february peak growth season and march may senescence these growth stages are clearly evident in the lai profiles with distinctly higher values during the peak growth season 3 5 compared to either early growth or senescence 2 0 2 5 both kesv and lai were lower in 2017 18 compared to 2018 19 3 5 water table depth and evapotranspiration the water table depth wtd in the peatland showed a clear annual cycle over the two year study period fig 7 with maximum wtd occurring during spring and soon after snowmelt the yearly range in wtd was 400 mm in 2017 18 and 300 mm in 2018 19 during non snow cover periods oct may short term spikes in wtd of up to 300 mm were observed corresponding to rain events these increases in wtd represent the hydraulic buffering provided by the peatland and decayed to pre event levels over less than one week wtd and etec were effectively out of phase with each other with maximum etec occurring in mid to late summer and corresponding to the period of declining wtd an exceptionally dry period occurred during summer 2017 18 leading to very low wtd see highlighted region feb mar 2018 and corresponding with particularly low values of etec average value 0 6 mm d 1 was recorded for two weeks importantly the estimated fraction of precipitation lost from the peatland through evapotranspiration etec p is 0 25 in 2017 18 and 0 28 in 2018 19 and suggests an exceptionally high transfer of precipitation to run off 3 6 relationship between etec and environmental drivers potential relationships between etec and measured environmental variables were explored by single parameter linear regression and multiple linear regression mlr variables considered in this analysis were net radiation rn air temperature ta vapour pressure deficit vpd and water table depth wtd rn was the environmental variable with the highest single parameter correlation to evapotranspiration r2 0 86 and 0 92 for 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively figure s1a ta and vpd were also strongly predictive of etec ta r2 0 8 and 0 91 for 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively vpd r2 0 80 and 0 77 for 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively figure s1b s1c consistent with single parameter regressions mlr identified rn ta and vpd as strong and significant predictors of etec over the entire two year period table s1 r2 0 8 p 0 01 rn and ta p 0 1 vpd mlr for individual seasons similarly identified these three environmental variables as the best predictors of etec in spring and summer table s1 for the winter periods none of the environmental variables showed a strong correlation with etec likely due to snow cover over the peatland during autumn vpd was not significantly correlated with etec but instead wtd rn and ta were identified as significant driving variables the predictive power of these variables however varied between years and was substantially less in autumn 2018 r2 0 34 compared to autumn 2019 r2 0 76 wtd was a strong and significant predictor of etec only in spring p 0 001 3 7 ion ratio comparison with etec the major ion composition of groundwater peatland feed and stream water peatland exit was measured on a 2 4 monthly frequency over the two years of the study sampling occasions are shown in fig 7 this sampling was always conducted under base flow conditions under which the ratio of ion concentrations in peatland exit water to peatland feed ion exit ion feed should be equal to the inflow and outflow ratio qfeed qexit for ions that behave conservatively solid line in fig 8 here we have used the qexit values from 5 day averaged weir plate logger data which were very similar to manual readings recorded at the time of water sampling consistent with base flow conditions figure s2 both cl and na behaved in similar ways to each other across the two years with a net export of ions during spring and retention during summer and autumn fig 8a b this ion retention was somewhat stronger for cl than na for both ions the winter ion ratio was approximately one as expected for this snow covered period when et is low and is consistent with the assumption that the groundwater source sampled for this work is representative of all groundwater inputs under this condition there are effectively no water loss or peatland regulation processes operating so the ionic compositions of feed and exit waters converge overall the patterns observed for cl and na suggest a post snow melt release of these ions followed by a more extended period of ion retention and generally mirror seasonal behaviours previously observed for these ions in this system silvester 2009 ion ratios for ca2 and mg2 were also similar to each other and distinctly different to cl and na for both ca2 and mg2 net export was observed in all seasons approaching that predicted for a conservative ion at both low and high values of qfeed qexit fig 8c d at low qfeed qexit this could be due to reduced biogeochemical reaction rates during winter snow cover months similar to cl and na the net export of these ions outside of winter months suggests a source of these ions within the peatland such as a mineral dissolution or ion exchange process the similar behaviour of ca2 and mg2 in peatland exit water is consistent with the constant ca mg ratio 1 2 molar ratio previously observed across both seasonal and event timescales silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 4 discussion very few ec flux measurements exist for peatlands in mountainous regions due to a range of challenges in measuring surface atmosphere exchanges under these conditions xu et al 2018b gerling et al 2019 in particular landscape heterogeneity has a substantial influence on the measurement and interpretation of atmospheric data schmid and lloyd 1999 schmid 1997 and peatlands in mountainous regions are typically heterogeneous landscapes since for most tower sites the extent of horizontal variation is 1 km or less the scale of horizontal homogeneity will be exceeded by the fetch of the flux measurements jegede and foken 1999 göckede et al 2008 it is therefore critical that a footprint analysis is performed to test whether the spatial representativeness assumptions in the ec method are valid schuepp et al 1990 horst and weil 1992 schmid 2002 leclerc et al 1997 rannik et al 2000 kljun et al 2004 kljun et al 2015 this study demonstrates that it is feasible to acquire ecosystem level et measurements with the ec approach at this mountainous peatland site even with a restricted fetch and heterogeneous surface characteristics this has been achieved by careful consideration of tower placement including prior knowledge of wind direction low installation height adopting a rigorous footprint analysis performing adequate corrections and following standard filtering the flux tower at this peatland site au apl produced a valid data set for 72 of the two years study period after rigorous qa qc suitable for further investigation of et we demonstrate that in small alpine mountainous peatlands the ec technique provides well validated datasets for further ecohydrological analyses 4 1 seasonality and energy balance a number of individual sites within the fluxnet network use energy balance closure ebc as a standard procedure to assess flux data quality li et al 2005 our study results suggest that the closure of the energy balance was strongly connected with seasonal variations while the energy fluxes measured by the ec system were not completely closed the mean ebc 0 78 of the ec measurements was acceptable spring summer and autumn ebcs 72 88 were consistent with previously reported results ranging from 53 to 99 for fluxnet sites li et al 2015 lower ebc during winter has also been reported in other long term studies using eddy covariance li et al 2015 and seasonal evaluation of et and energy budgets deb burman et al 2019 the low ebc during winter is likely caused by a low signal to noise ratio in flux measurements stannard et al 2013 combined with the effects of melting and freezing which were not considered in energy balance evaluation li et al 2005 however in this study the winter season is considered a non growing season and the winter season energy budget makes a relatively small contribution to the yearly energy balance wu et al 2010 across all seasons ebc values less than one suggests an underestimation of the sensible heat h and or latent heat le fluxes applying the energy balance closure adjustment of de roo et al 2018 section 2 3 corrects the eddy covariance measurements of h and le and improves the overall ec derived et estimation sensible heat flux dominated the energy partitioning during the spring and autumn seasons with less energy directed towards le during summer le was larger than h corresponding with high incoming solar radiation as illustrated by fig 2 consistent with the seasonal variations in energy partitioning between h and le β values varied over a wide range 0 42 to 2 2 over the two year study period a similar seasonal pattern was observed in marshland areas in the central united states lenters et al 2011 and in multi season measurements in wetlands in north eastern china zhou and zhou 2009 gerling et al 2019 showed that the seasonal variation of β is inversely related to the variation in vpd vpd increases exponentially with atmospheric temperature leading to lower β values during summer hirano et al 2016 shimoyama et al 2003 majozi et al 2016 the concurrence in the above studies including this one is that vegetation dynamics play a crucial role in energy partitioning and that in summer with during l vegetation cover le flux is the dominant portion of net radiation 4 2 evapotranspiration and run off our observations over two complete years contribute significantly to the understanding of mountain peatland evapotranspiration characteristics and their response to hydro meteorological changes a hydrological modelling study of the 335 ha watchbed creek catchment that this peatland forms part of suggested that the estimated annual potential et was 558 mm averaged over the years 1940 1986 with the highest values during summer january pet 145 mm and lowest in winter june pet 35 mm western et al 2008 our average annual etec of 556 mm for a peatland in this catchment appears reasonable when compared with other sphagnum dominant peatland ecosystems under similar synoptic weather conditions for example cao et al 2020 observed that the annual et in an alpine wetland ecosystem in qinghai on the tibetan plateau was 644 mm year petrone et al 2001 showed a growing season average et in restored peatlands in quebec of 354 mm wu et al 2010 found the et of boreal peatlands in eastern finland to be 321 mm and hirano et al 2016 measured the et of sarobetsu mire japan to be 372 mm similarly gerling et al 2019 reported a maximum et of 5 6 mm d 1 for an ombrotrophic peat bog in central germany and lafleur et al 2005 recorded maximum et rates at a peatland in ontario canada ranging over 4 5 mm d 1 similar to the summer etec of this study synoptic weather conditions i e air temperature vapour pressure deficit and incoming solar radiation could explain differences in etec among the seasons and between study years table s1 and figure s1 consistent with this our study shows that evapotranspiration is a function of rn ta and vpd while it is inversely proportional and weakly correlated with wtd figure s1 however differences were observed between seasons with spring summer and autumn showing the strongest correlations with these environmental factors cumulative et data fig 5c show that annual et in 2018 19 was higher than in 2017 18 which we attribute to a low rainfall period during february march in 2017 18 resulting in an exceptionally low water table this result is different to that observed by moore et al 2013 where short term water table variation did not control et in a peatland ecosystem very few other studies have characterised interannual variability of et in relation to changes in moisture availability lafleur et al 2005 liljedahl et al 2011 the reduced et at extremely low water table depths may be due to the absence of any mechanism for the transportation of water from deeper in the peat profile the dominant sphagnum moss has no stomata roots or water conducting tissues so vertical water transport may be limited shimoyama et al 2003 the ecosystem soil vegetation coefficient kesv approach applied in this study provides evidence of a strong relationship between etec and eto and this coefficient as determined separately for each season can effectively be used in ecohydrological studies of other mountain peatlands with similar vegetation kesv values determined for each season were 0 68 spring early growing season 1 12 summer peak growing season and 0 88 autumn senescence the kesv obtained for this peatland were in a similar range to that reported for ombrotrophic peat bog odersprungmoor in the harz mountains central germany kc in the range 0 82 0 86 gerling et al 2019 in the australian mountains the spring season is potentially the most sensitive to the difference between etec and eto because some of the available energy in the peatland is likely used to heat the standing water once the standing water in the peatland has heated more of the net radiation rn is directed towards h and le drexler et al 2008 seasonal variation in the effective leaf area coverage and photosynthetic capacity of the vegetation described by lai and which are only relevant outside the snow cover season display a similar trend to the kesv in the early growing season the reduced leaf development after snowmelt coincided with lower kesv while both parameters were highest in mid summer corresponding to the peak growing season the strong seasonal variability in kesv values obtained in this work suggests that the use of a single kesv is not appropriate in mountain peatlands this region experiences high precipitation and our work suggests that the average net evapotranspiration is 26 5 of the precipitation the remaining portion of precipitation is presumably contributing to catchment run off consistent with this western et al 2008 showed through hydrological modelling analysis that the average run off coefficient for the entire watchbed creek catchment 335 ha including this study area was 0 77 further lawrence 1995 proposed that for the watchbed creek catchment 67 of effective precipitation appeared in streams as quick flow for effective precipitation values between 0 9 and 4 5 mm while 40 of effective precipitation appeared in streams as quick flow for effective precipitation values greater than 4 5 mm importantly this suggests that the run off potential is very high in the study area compared to elsewhere in the australian landscape lawrence 1995 precipitation and therefore run off is generally lowest at the end of summer february march which leads to the lowering of the peatland water table during this low rain period the only significant inflows are from groundwater aquifers that provide sustained flow to these alpine aquatic ecosystems mccartney et al 2014 climate change projections for the australian alps forecast decreasing snowpack extent and depth laurance et al 2011 pickering et al 2004 which will likely impact groundwater recharge and affect the future viability of these peatland ecosystems 4 3 evapotranspiration and ion ratios seasonal patterns in nutrient and ion concentrations in peatland drainage water for this peatland have been described previously silvester 2009 this previous work has shown strong uptake of nitrate and sulphate during warmer months and an atypical behaviour for na and cl with apparent uptake of these ions during warmer high productivity periods among the major ions only ca2 and mg2 show annual patterns in stream concentrations consistent with water loss through et here we confirm that strong ion retention uptake and export release mechanisms operate for na and cl while the net export of these ions could be due to a snowmelt flush this effect continues well after snowmelt and does not explain the peatland uptake of these ions other possible explanations are uptake and release associated with biological processes such as plant growth during high productivity periods followed by senescence or microbial uptake e g organochlorine compounds bastviken et al 2007 and release a key issue with both of these mechanisms is that the export of these ions occurs into late spring whereas senescence or microbial die off is more likely an autumn process while we are unaware of similar seasonal uptake release mechanisms for these ions in other wetlands these processes may be more evident in this peatland due to the extremely low salt concentrations in the groundwater silvester 2009 a significant result from the behaviour of na and cl is that the ion ratio approaches a value of one 1 under low et conditions this is consistent with a key assumption of the model that the groundwater composition of the major source is representative of all groundwater sources into this peatland ca2 and mg2 concentrations approach that expected for a conservative ion at both high and low qfeed qexit but are always higher indicating net export under all conditions the approach to conservative behaviour at high qfeed qexit is consistent with previous observations for this system that et calculated from ca2 and mg2 concentrations yield physically reasonable values under high et conditions 1 7 2 5 mm d 1 silvester 2009 silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 the differences between observed and et predicted concentrations indicate additional sources of these ions from the peatland broadly these sources could include dry atmospheric deposition the net loss of stored peat or mineral dissolution exchange processes within the peatland the pronounced seasonality of stream water ca2 and mg2 concentrations is a strong argument against dry deposition the timing and loads of which are unlikely to be annually reproducible the more compelling result is from storm response studies at this site karis et al 2016 which show that both ca2 and mg2 concentrations are unaffected by high intensity rainfall events a significant dilution would be expected if these ions were controlled by dry deposition or peat soil decay a mineral exchange or dissolution mechanism appears the most likely explanation of the observed behaviour where peatland drainage concentrations are controlled by a physical property of the peatland that is seasonally variable e g temperature water table redox potential overall the observed seasonal patterns in uptake and release of ionic components confirm the strong controls on stream water composition water quality provided by these headwater peatlands given that both groundwater and rainfall contribute to the overall water budget the seasonally reproducible regulation of peatland drainage water is likely a key function of these systems in the landscape 4 4 implications for mountain peatland protection and rehabilitation heathy spur 1 hs 1 is an intact alpine sphagnum peatland in the bogong high plains victoria australia that serves as a reference ecosystem for understanding hydrological and biogeochemical functions of peatlands more broadly in this mountain landscape peatlands in the australian alps are highly restricted ecosystems forming in hillside valley floors in close association with groundwater sources mccartney et al 2014 these ecosystems are highly likely to be stressed by future changes in precipitation regime from climate change understanding the water budget of these systems will be critical in predicting future trajectories for these systems and impacts on water yields from the australian alps quantifying the et flux from this peatland and the climate factors that drive et is an important component in developing a more complete water budget and separating the relative contributions of precipitation snowmelt and groundwater in driving these ecosystems consistent with the high water yields from the australian alps our data shows a low evaporation factor for this peatland reflecting an environment with a substantial excess water yield to downstream catchments importantly our results suggest that under extended low rainfall periods et may decrease due to disconnection between the water table and vegetation layer this study provides the first application of ec techniques to measure etec and kesv in australia s mountainous peatland ecosystems peatland restoration requires precise evapotranspiration estimates in order to successfully manage site hydrology holden 2005 however assessing actual evapotranspiration at each site is complex costly and maybe impossible depending on the location budget and time frame howes et al 2015 for example australian alpine sphagnum peatlands occur as a mosaic of many small peatlands within the wider landscape and thus direct measurement of evapotranspiration using ec at many sites is not possible due to landscape heterogeneity and slope this study has determined kesv as a critical element of hydrological function which has the possibility of wider applicability the kesv values calculated in this study can provide a more accurate estimate of et than traditional climate data based approaches for other australian alpine sphagnum peatlands as well as peatlands in other areas with similar climatic conditions furthermore the use of season specific kesv values could contribute to improved accuracy in hydrological models from catchment to regional scales the delivery of large volumes of high quality water is a key ecosystem service provided by the australian alps worboys and good 2011 understanding the chemical regulation processes that occur in all hydrologic components including those processes that occur at the top of catchments in peatland systems is key to the long term protection of this water quality previous work has demonstrated that drainage stream water quality is highly regulated in these peatland systems both on seasonal as well as event timescales silvester 2009 karis et al 2016 since et is a major component in the peatland water balance and a major driver of seasonal variations in drainage water concentration the measurement of et is a critical step in identifying peatland uptake and release processes our results show that these peatland biogeochemical processes show a strong seasonal patterning most likely linked to peatland productivity and the generation of fixed carbon for microbial processes we suggest these seasonal patterns are applicable across the australian alps for intact peatlands under similar synoptic weather conditions and could be used as part of a set of metrics to assess peatland condition and rehabilitation this study will be an effective tool for understanding the response of peatlands to changing climate and land management practices peatlands in this landscape are already in a range of conditions due to past land management practices e g cattle grazing and more recent disturbances e g feral animal weeds that will likely impact resilience to future stressors understanding the hydrology and linked biogeochemistry of these peatlands is integral to establishing favourable conditions for rehabilitation actions petrone et al 2001 5 conclusions four main conclusions are drawn from this study 1 annual evapotranspiration from this peatland was 494 mm in 2017 18 and 618 mm in 2018 19 representing 26 5 of annual precipitation etec increased rapidly after snowmelt and reached maximum values in early summer winter etec was 6 2 of the annual et due to snow cover 2 the kesv varied seasonally between 0 5 spring and autumn and 1 1 summer this study identified three distinct phenological stages in peatland productivity and suggested that the application of a single year round kesv value is not appropriate in mountain peatland ecosystems 3 this study revealed that evapotranspiration dynamics of the peatland are primarily influenced by net radiation air temperature vpd and weakly influenced by water table depth wtd the exception is during severe drought periods when very low water table depth did correspond with reduced et 4 the measurement of et reveals that for cl and na the observed annual cycle is due to ion release and uptake with net export in spring and net uptake in summer autumn for ca2 and mg2 net export occurs at all times of the year and indicates a seasonally dependent mechanism author contributions mg sg es conceptualization mg data curation mg es formal analysis
