7815,study region this is study of the rio conchos watershed chihuahua mexico study focus this study provides assessment of climate variability from analysis of instrumental climate and reservoir operations data plus nearby tree ring indices in chihuahua mexico water demand include international treaty deliveries growing agricultural land use and intensified crop production analysis of climate cycles includes frequency analysis of local multidecadal instrumental hydrologic time series and multi century tree ring indices in addition tree ring indices were compared with 14c content in tree rings to assess the presence of the millennial solar cycle new hydrological insights for the region most of the climate variability within inter annual to interdecadal periods are aligned with pacific decadal oscillation pdo like climate cycles new multi century climate cycles were discovered from tree ring indices that have a profound impact on sustainability of food and water security historical droughts of 8 year average duration within pdo like cycles that span longer 12 43 year periods were newly identified which are longer than the 5 year delivery cycles used in the 1944 international treaty of the rivers mega droughts were discovered to occur within multi century climate cycles multi century cycles identified in tree ring indices were likely driven by solar luminosity changes from the millennial solar cycle and not just recent anthropogenic climate change climate variability and temperature increases will further amplify cycles of supply and demand and exacerbate sustainability mitigation and management strategies conjunctive use combined with reservoir operations will broaden sustainability portfolio of options reducing demand effects as well as enhance supply options and replenishment effects keywords climate variability climate change sustainability conjunctive water use water demand international treaty deliveries land use surface water management 1 introduction the overreaching problem is that mega droughts and multidecadal wetter and drier periods occur within multidecadal driven by amo and pdo cycles and within multi century cycles influenced by changes in solar radiation from the millennial climate oscillation mco enc 2021 that need to be considered along with anthropogenic climate change acc to prepare for sustainability alignment of management cycles with local climate cycles and related global climate drivers is fundamental to successful development of sustainability and mitigation strategies to steward the water resources and help achieve both sustainability and adaptability resource management systems need to be able to assess climate change and variability linkages at different time scales that include operations uses seasonal to multi year governance management seasonal to inter decadal and capital improvement projects infrastructure inter annual to multi century climate cycles that drive the supply and demand for water are largely unknown for transboundary watersheds and aquifers and remain relatively unknown along the us mexico border reaches of the rio grande river such as the rio conchos river watershed fig 1 climate change combined with growing human demand for water and evolving land use is amplifying a crisis in demand relative to the supply of water resources along with related issues of food and land use security hanson et al 2012 vörösmarty et al 2000 climate change encompasses nonperiodic changes in global or regional climate patterns in particular a change apparent from the mid 20th century onwards and is attributed largely to increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced from fossil fuel use climate variability is driven by both oceanic and atmospheric forcings which are also potentially influenced by cycles of change in solar luminosity at millennial scale clemens 2005 this solar cycle estimated at 1 470 years has been the possible contributor to glacial climate cycles braun 2005 and climate variability driven by millennial scale solar variability through the holocene zhao et al 2021 climate variability includes all the quasi periodic climate variations lasting longer than individual weather events with periods from interannual and decadal to multiple century duration and consequently is a critical factor influencing water supply and demand sustained dry periods spanning two or more decades are referred to as mega droughts these extreme climate events now identified as part of the ongoing anthropogenic climate change hegerl et al 2007 also were common in the past resulting in the rise fall and migration of many civilizations over the past 10 000 years fagan 2008 the major periodic climate forcings juxtaposed in the study area include the pacific north american oscillation pna 1 4 year cycle el niño southern oscillation enso 2 7 years the north american monsoon system nams 7 10 years hanson et al 2006 gutzler 2004 adams and comrie 1997 the pacific decadal oscillation pdo 11 30 years mantua et al 1997 mantua and hare 2002 and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo 30 80 years kuss and gurdak 2017 velasco et al 2014 gurdak et al 2009 deser 2010 the interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo henley et al 2015 and north atlantic oscillation nao may also contribute to climate variability but are largely aligned with these other oceanic indices deser 2010 previous continental scale studies addressed relations of decadal scale variability cayan et al 1998 in relation to enso cycles mccabe and dettinger 1999 related sea surface temperature variability deser et al 2010 relations of megadroughts and monsoon variability to pdo cycles parsons et al 2018 henley et al 2015 newman et al 2003 2016 meehl and hu 2006 and to amo cycles hu and feng 2012 nigam et al 2011 that also may drive global scale variability young min et al 2020 both pacific and atlantic oceans influence multidecadal drought frequency mccabe et al 2004 through influence on atmospheric dynamics erb et al 2020 the collapse of northern hemisphere monsoons over multidecadal to multi century scales super droughts may be related to north atlantic sea surface temperatures amo cycles and northern hemisphere temperatures over the last millennium based on speleothem data asmerom et al 2013 however eastoe and dettman 2016 cast doubt on the interpretation of speleothem isotope data in terms of precipitation amount the mechanisms of decadal drought variability encompass these phenomena an adequate understanding of which may lead to the predictability of drought beyond seasonal to interannual timescales seager and ting 2017 the medieval warm period and little ice age may be climate responses to longer term natural cycles of solar radiative forcing mann et al 2009 while water resource and climate analysis methods have advanced in recent decades there still remain many areas where the relationship between supply and demand of water resources remains unknown and not considered in the context of historical or future climate variability cycles of climate variability affect the sustainability of transboundary water resources as well as related management and governance nevertheless no comprehensive analysis of climate variability spanning decades to centuries exists for the us mexico transboundary region additionally climate cycles that drive the supply and demand for water are unknown for transboundary watersheds and aquifers and remain relatively unknown along the us mexico border reaches of the grande river mega droughts and their potential relationship to long term climate cycles and known periodic climate drivers has not been previously analyzed in this part of transboundary northern mexico while williams et al 2020 consider the period 2000 2019 as a modern mega drought the relation of this to historical mega droughts remains uncertain climate variability and related supply and demand drivers within regional transboundary watersheds like the rio conchos in chihuahua mexico need to be re assessed in the context of conjunctive use with due attention to both surface water reservoir operations and potential use of aquifer storage as well as the long term factors that control them while some studies have analyzed hydrologic time series and tree ring indices for regional drought woodhouse et al 2012 the combined analysis of these data was lacking and needed to answer some fundamental management and sustainability questions what are the major drivers of climate cycles and how do they affect transboundary water resources as well as related management and governance within climate change and variability are the mega droughts and multidecadal wetter and drier periods occurring within multi century cycles influneced by solar radiation within the millenial solar cycle this study estimates climate cycles over multiple time scales from new data and novel estimations of hydrologic and climate variability analysis through a analysis of the instrumental records assessment at three man made surface water reservoirs in the transboundary rio conchos watershed tree ring indices from nearby sites in chihuahua mexico fig 1 and global data for 14c in biomass as a proxy for solar luminosity b a new broader approach to assessing attributes of climate variability with implications for conjunctive use operations of man made reservoirs in the rio conchos watershed and c a re evaluation of the cycles of surface water deliveries from mexico required under the 1944 treaty of the rivers usa mexico 1944 these cycles are used to estimate the range of historical drought their potential relation to known climate indices and their potential relationship to international treaty water delivery obligations in turn this will help understand how climate variability affects transboundary water supply related reservoir operations and transboundary governance within the rio conchos watershed and support future hydrologic model and sustainability frameworks for management and governance of water and land in this us mexico transboundary region of the rio grande river 1 1 previous studies the mexican drought atlas mxda documents a history of droughts over the past 600 years 1400 2012 from tree ring reconstructions stahle et al 2016 but does not relate this history to climate indices droughts affecting all of mexico have been rare over the past 600 years and their frequency has not increased though selected droughts occurred stahle et al 2016 fig 2 extreme wet year periods also have occurred as documented in california for the central valley delta from tree ring index reconstruction malamud roam et al 2006 and for the rio colorado woodhouse and lukas 2006 since 1900 several exceptional wet periods have occurred in western north america including 1905 07 1917 1939 42 1957 1969 1978 1983 86 1998 and 2011 prolonged periods of drought or wet climate may include shorter wet or dry events as shown for dry periods of 10 45 years duration in coastal ventura california over the interval 1770 1995 ce hanson et al 2003 analysis of long term aridity in the western united states indicates that the current mega drought is more severe than previous events estimated from the historical record cook et al 2004 and the past holds insights for future climate alley 2003 environmental sustainability has been afffected by recent extreme drought which threatens to limit the allocation of water resources in the western usa and mexico for example the rio grande river at elephant butte reservoir is at 4 of capacity https www usbr gov newsroom news release 3958 in august 2021 and there is a call for a shortage declaration for 2022 on lake meade on the lower colorado river http crc nv gov index php p info s drought at 34 of capacity in october 2021 https www usbr gov lc region g4000 weekly pdf future climate variability is expected to lead to repeated water supply crises in the rio grande basin mu and ziolkowska 2018 the rio conchos is one of the largest contributors of surface water from mexico to the rio grande as well as to local irrigation and urban water supply cervera gómez 2008 operation of the three major reservoirs in rio conchos watershed is affected by the treaty of the rivers between the usa and mexico usa mexico 1944 mumme 2019 with an earlier treaty usa mexico 1906 contributions from six tributaries within mexico including the rio conchos are required to provide deliveries from mexico to the rio grande rio bravo dry periods occurred on the rio conchos in 1940 1948 1950 51 1956 57 1959 1969 1982 1985 1994 95 and 1997 98 and wet river climate conditions occurred in 1938 1941 42 1958 1966 1968 1978 1981 1984 1986 and 1991 cervera gómez 2008 more recently the reconstruction of streamflows from tree rings for the rio conchos martínez sifuentes et al 2020 estimated extreme hydroclimate events and identified several 10 year droughts over the past 243 years similarly woodhouse et al 2012 identified regional droughts across the entire rio grande and rio conchos watersheds over the past four centuries in the 1770 s 1890 s and 1950 s such extreme periods have affected local water use and treaty delivery obligations with the national commission of water conagua recently implementing modifications to reservoir operations enciso 2020 relations between drought land use native riparian vegetation and soil salinity were identified from 10 years of remote sensing images gutierrez et al 2004 that highlighted additional issues of conjunctive use in the rio conchos basin this watershed is also undergoing transitions in types of agriculture and growth of other water uses walsh 2009 the 1950 s and 1990 s droughts in the rio conchos basin were compared and contrasted in terms of changes in the mean and variability of stream inflows and implications for delivery obligations to the rio grande under the 1944 treaty over five year periods cervera gómez 2008 the 1944 treaty considers extraordinary drought but there is no metric or threshold that delineates this condition or specifies contingent responses instead the treaty simply reassigns any deficit in delivery to the next five year period this assessment of droughts in the rio conchos basin was based on the palmer standardized drought index pdsi for ojinaga texas from 1895 2000 cervera gómez 2008 however the pdsi is an indicator of soil moisture normalized to average conditions during the period of observation and therfore may not identify longer droughts that might emerge from more extended periods of observation using a drought threshold of pdsi 0 5 the 1950 s drought lasted seven years 86 months and between 1992 and 1998 7 4 years 89 months including four years 45 months of intense drought these two droughts showed differences in stream inflow for the two upstream reservoirs in the rio conchos watershed the most recent modification to the 1944 treaty minute 325 ibwc cila 2020 provides for supplemented deliveries in light of deficits from 2015 to 2020 however this action does not mitigate long term water management issues or provide guidance for future crises arising from climate variability and prolonged droughts climate forcing has been recognized through empircal analysis as a driving mechanism of change in hydrologic systems hanson 2003 dickinson et al 2004 hanson et al 2004 2006 2009 2020 gurdak et al 2009 hanson 2015 velasco et al 2017 periodic forcings collectively contribute to wet and dry periods that control water supply and demand variations at local and regional scale wet and dry periods result from the interaction of multiple climate cycles and related climate drivers climate cycles operate at different frequencies and amplitudes and their effects in southwestern north america vary as they move into and out of phase with each other hanson et al 2006 2020 climate variability in numerous other watersheds of southwestern north america has been studied with frequency analysis in california these include central valley faunt et al 2009 mojave river basin hanson et al 2004 pajaro valley hanson 2003 santa clara calleguas basin hanson et al 2003 coastal southern california hanson et al 2009 and the santa clara valley hanson 2015 as well as in arizona in tucson basin and san pedro valley hanson et al 2006 and the transboundary region of the lower rio grande hanson et al 2020 in texas and new mexico usa and conejos medanos chihuahua mexico frequency analysis also was used to explore the principal aquifers across the usa kuss and gurdak 2014 multi century cycles are evaluated with tree ring indices and 14c data changes in the production rate of 14c in the upper atmosphere provide a proxy for changes in solar luminosity provided lag and attenuation arising from the properties of atmospheric biomass and oceanic reservoirs of 14c are taken into account beer et al 2012 the 14c content of the near surface carbon reservoir lower atmosphere plus biomass is the integrated result of changes in 14c production over thousands of years changes in production rate for cycles of 1000 100 and 10 years appear as inflections of biomass 14c content with lags of about 125 10 and 2 years respectively beer et al 2012 fig 13 5 3 2 2 2 methodlogy 2 1 study area the study area in the middle and lower areas of the rio conchos watershed of southeastern chihuahua mexico of 74 372 km2 covers 61 of the watershed fig 1 including three reservoirs in this arid region where rainfall does not exceed 400 mm year rains are abundant in the summer june october annual temperatures range between 18 and 20 c and maximum temperatures are up to 40 c inegi 2017 of the six tributaries that flow into the lower rio grande from mexico the rio conchos is the largest contributor to the treaty s mexican delivery obligation and its watershed makes up about half of the rio grande watershed in mexico cervera gómez 2008 three reservoirs support local uses of water for agriculture water supply recreation power production ecological flows and flood control lago toronto la boquilla and luis l león el granero reservoirs are on the rio conchos the francisco i madero fim reservoir is located on rio conchos tributary san pedro river la boquilla and fim reservoirs store water for the largest irrigation district dr 005 in delicias and el granero reservoir supplies water for the irrigation district 090 in bajo río conchos the dr 005 covers 67 275 ha with more than 8 113 water users while the dr 090 covers 4 077 ha with 955 water users sina conagua 2018 irrigation consumes 95 of available water siap 2020 the combined utility capacity of the three reservoirs is 3 370 mm3 with 82 in la boquilla and 8 and 10 in fim and el granero respectively tree ring analyses were completed just northwest of the reservoir watersheds cook et al 2020 stahle et al 2016 fig 1 tree ring indices from sites near casas grandes about 300 km northwest of the rio conchos and san pedro watersheds provides the longest record 733 2010 ce casas grandes paquimé located in an arid plain bounded on the west by the sierra madre occidental was built about 1130 c e in the middle of the medieval warm period 900 1300 ce it relied on irrigation for agriculture from the casas grandes or san miguel rivers it was one of few pre columbian civilisations with a water well and sewer systems indicating a long history of conjunctive use in this region colonial settlers also started irrigation systems as early as the 1580 s that included conjunctive use saldaña 2012 casas grandes burned in 1340 and slowly declined from 1350 to 1450 fig 2 the tutuaca 1534 2012 ce and tabacote tomochi 1583 1993 ce tree ring data provide shorter records from the sierra madre occidental to the southwest of casas grandes in the temosachi and guerrero municipalities respectively while the analysis of climate variability with frequency methods is similar to other studies worldwide this study also incorporates analysis of climate indices and tree ring indices for longer time periods relevant to alignment with cycles of management and governance as well as multi decade infrastructure projects 2 2 sources and processing of data analysis of climate cycles for this study includes frequency analysis of local multidecadal instrumental hydrologic time series and multi century tree ring indices instrumental data include monthly precipitation july minimum temperature and temperature differences and reservoir attributes including storage releases and evaporation conagua 2020a central water and sanitation board jcas 2013 from these data seasonal to decadal variability has been determined for 1950 2019 with seasons representing the seasons of a calendar year climate indices used for additional correlation analysis in this study included the amo for 1856 2020 noaa amo 2020 pdo for 1854 2020 noaa pdo 2020 and enso34 for 1871 2020 noaa enso 2020 while climate indices for nams were developed based on precipitation gutzler 2004 and vapor movement hanson et al 2006 no nams index was used for analysis in this study instead the range of years for nams periodicity is used for comparison with frequency analysis decadal to millennial climate variability has been determined from tree ring indices for casas grandes cook et al 2020 stahle et al 2016 tabacote tomochi stahle et al 2002 and villanueva tutuaca stahle et al 2016 in addition tree ring indices are compared with 14c content in tree rings spanning the interval 733 1953 ce compiled by eastoe et al 2019 the spectral analysis of hydrologic variability is statistically compared with reported climate cycle intervals and time series and range of cycles of climate indices amo pdo nams enso to assess the similarity and provide statisitical inference between variability in hydrologic time series and known climate cycle drivers hanson et al 2004 2006 all time series are first converted to cumulative departure curves which embeds serial correlation and provides a surrogate for the interannual climate variability rate i e first derivative cumulative departure time series are analogous to time series representing changes as hydrologic accumulation or depletion such as groundwater levels for changes in groundwater storage reservoir stage for changes in reservoir storage and the accumulation of 14c in biomass the cumulative departure curves are detrended with a low order polynomial because most time series encompasses fragments of even larger cycles as the method was originally described by hanson et al 2004 the cumulative departure time series and the residuals from 4th order polynomial detrending are analyzed using singular spectral analysis ssa to estimate the periodic frequencies that can be summed to represent the historical cumulative departure residual time series all frequency analysis used the established methods of the united states geological survey s hydroclimate toolkit dickinson et al 2014 this toolkit facilitates climate variability analysis methods developed by hanson et al 2004 including the singular spectral analysis methods dettinger et al 1995 all frequency analyses were significant with respect to red noise climate change and the amplification of climate variability within climate change can potentially result in more extreme events as well as nonstationarity of the mean and variance of climate parameters milly et al 2008 2015 however weak stationarity appears to persists in frequency analysis of historical and future climate cycles hanson et al 2004 2006 2012 the estimated cycles are compared with the typical cycles of climate indices of known climate drivers amo pdo nams and enso enso has two modes el niño and la niña that differ from other climate drivers in their patterns and teleconnections gurdak et al 2009 previous frequency analysis shows that pdo also has two modes with periods of about 10 15 years and 24 30 years while others have studied surrogates for soil moisture using the normalized pdsi these studies did not collectively address natural and anthropogenic variability on multiple time scales needed for water resource management additionally pdsi is not a reliable indicator for longer periods or for conjunctive use in agricultural lands where soil moisture is typically well managed through irrigation data from the three reservoirs were analyzed to provide an integral depiction of their recent historical condition and sustainability under variable climate analysis of reservoir operations in the context of historical performance relative to climate leaves certain issues unaddressed it includes the operation of the reservoirs in response to multiple types of demand governed by a hierarchy of operating rules that attempt to mitigate disparities between supply and demand while taking account of diverse requirements such as irrigation recreation power generation and flood safety strategies for mitigating risk maximizing reliability and optimizing storage as climate changes reaffirms the important role of reservoir capacitance under increased stress from climate change plus human demand ehsani et al 2017 for a series of transboundary reservoirs in the northeastern united states reservoir operations become even more critical in arid northern mexico and the entire usa mexico transboundary region for example drought has curtailed releases from elephant butte and caballo reservoirs on the rio grande resulting in major increases of groundwater use to supplement surface water irrigation and treaty deliveries hanson et al 2020 ferguson and llewellyn 2015 as both supply and demand contribute to the balance of sustainbility recent changes in agricultural demand are also competing with treaty deliveries obligations from mexico to the rio grande finally the estimated hydrologic cycles are compared with known cycles from climate indices and to requirements of 5 year treaty surface water delivery periods from mexico tree ring indices as regional indicators of changing precipitation and temperature allow climate variability analysis over centuries across southwestern north america salzer and kipfmueller 2005 such analyses not only provide longer time periods hanson et al 2004 but also indicators of tree and forest health subject to drought and climate variability anderegg et al 2013 while the twentieth century reanalysis project 20cr compiled global atmospheric data compo et al 2011 since 1871 for improving and comparing the skill of climate models they did not include ice core tree ring or solar luminosity proxy data such information may provide constraints on climate change and climate variability over decadal to millennial scale periods it could be used to drive and constrain models and better understand the longer cycles of climate variability and now climate change too speleothem data provide similar information on longer term climate variability asmerom et al 2013 suggested a positive correlation between nams and amo in the context of multidecadal to multi century collapse of northern hemisphere monsoons like nams the speleothem record indicates that pdo cycles modulate the nams across southwestern north america and those super droughts coincided with the medieval climate anomaly warm period and the little ice age fig 2 this illustrates how droughts occur within longer wetter and drier cycles these longer multi century cycles may be related to the millennial sun cycle called the eddy cycle zhao et al 2021 with the most recent cycle embedding the medieval warm period and little ice age fig 2 the analysis of tree rings and 14c data from tree rings was performed to identify correlations between overlapping datasets for the casas grandes tree rings 733 2010 ce compared with 14 c content in tree rings spanning the interval 733 1953 ce compiled by eastoe et al 2019 in order to examine whether solar luminosity influences the tree ring index time series for periods on the order of 100 and 1000 years both datasets are filtered using moving averages and detrended using fitted 3rd order polynomials to enhance the graphical depiction of cycles at each time scale the 14c dataset includes high precision measurements on the cellulose fraction of dendrochronologically dated wood by liquid scintillation counting 998 1953 at laboratories in tucson eastoe et al 2019 and seattle usa stuiver et al 1998 and by accelerator mass spectrometry prior to 998 in nagoya japan miyahara et al 2004 miyake et al 2012 2013 the 14c data are plotted as δ14c stuiver and polach 1977 a parameter that accounts for mass dependent fractionation and radioactive decay of 14c the production of 14c in the upper atmosphere is a proxy for solar luminescence provided lag and attenuation arising from the properties of atmospheric biomass and oceanic reservoirs of 14c are taken into account beer et al 2012 a 14c dataset from tree rings in the western usa and japan eastoe et al 2019 overlaps most of the casas grandes tree ring index data set and incorporates data from stuiver et al 1998 miyahara et al 2004 and miyake et al 2012 2013 for the purposes of this study periods of a century scale and shorter length were filtered out by calculating 200 year running means for both the 14c and casas grande cumulative departure cgcd time series century scale events were investigated using decadal means detrended for longer period variation with third order polynomial expressions the 14c data are plotted as δ14c stuiver and polach 1977 a parameter that accounts for mass dependent fractionation and the radioactive decay of 14c 3 results 3 1 local climate cycles analyses of local instrumental data include precipitation and reservoir releases and storage that represent cycles of water supply and temperature temperature differences and evaporation at reservoirs that represent cycles of water demand the relatively short length of instrumental records precludes assessment of effects from the larger amo cycles but correlations are estimated for their period of record relative to cumulative departure time series for comparable windows of amo pdo and enso34 indices with instrumental records 3 1 1 precipitation annual and seasonal cumulative departure of precipitation at fim la boquilla and el granero fig 3 indicate the largest variability occurs during the rainy season summer months summer 61 69 and spring 16 17 precipitation dominating the distribution of annual precipitation these preciptation cycles are largely coincident with pdo and enso enso pna like climate cycles fig sm 1 table sm 1 historical winter precipitation cycles are dominated by pdo like 48 83 and enso enso pna like 10 35 cycles indicating that climate variability from pdo is more important than enso like cycles while pdo like cycles still contribute between 49 and 78 of the variance in spring summer and fall these seasons also include 10 31 variability from cycles coincident with enso and enso pna there is also a contribution from cycles coincident with nams for summer 10 and fall 30 at la boquilla fig sm 1 aggregate series from cumulative departures of precipitation and climate patterns show negative correlations with amo 0 77 at fim p value 0 05 negative and positive correlations with pdo 0 41 at la boquilla and 0 30 at fim p value 0 05 and enso 0 38 at la boquilla 0 41 at fim and 0 4 at el granero p value 0 05 long intervals of predominantly dry years occurred during 1950 64 and 1992 2001 at la boquilla at fim wet and dry year periods were different wet 1968 92 2002 10 and dry 1950 67 1993 2001 the shorter record at el granero shows more interannual variability with shorter wet and dry year periods wet 1972 74 1977 81 1984 87 1990 91 and 2003 2017 and dry 1965 71 1975 76 1982 83 1988 89 and a longer period 1992 2002 3 1 2 temperature increases in minimum temperature as well as increases and more variability of monthly average temperature differences are indicators of climate change at fim the rainy season month of july indicates the minimum temperature time series includes cycles with pdo like periods of 37 5 and 25 years 69 of total cyclic variance with a 7 5 year nams like cycle 22 and enso and enso pna like cycles accounting for the remaining 9 of the variance table sm 1 the average july temperature difference shows a 25 year pdo like cycle 91 8 3 year nams like cycle 4 7 and enso and enso pna like cycles 2 7 account for the rest of the variance table sm 1 average july minimum temperature and differences at fim reservoir indicate that in the middle of the rainy season july there is an apparent increase in variability between the periods 1945 1984 and 1986 2019 fig 4a b this partitioning overlaps the 1982 88 period which is a series of el niño and la niña enso events over the 75 year period the average minimum temperature at fim increased by about 1 5 c which exceeds the standard deviation of the earlier period and is comparable to the more recent period the average july temperature difference also increased by about 0 4 c between these two historical periods the temperature difference standard deviation for the more recent period is 1 4 times greater than the earlier period this suggests increased minimum temperature temperature difference and more variable temperature difference this is potentially consistent with climate change and increased climate variability within climate change 3 2 reservoir cycles the cycles summarized from reservoir operations are related to analysis of supply from reservoir releases and storage and of demand from evaporation these reservoir use attributes are reviewed in the context of climate variability sustainability of surface water supplies and treaty delivery requirements a detailed summary analysis of these cycles is included in the supplementary material variability of reservoir releases is aligned with climate cycles that control runoff but lags precipitation based climate cycles as with precipitation the releases are predominantly coincident with pdo like cycles with a lesser contribution from enso like cycles fig sm 2 the time series of reservoir releases shows pdo like cycles of period ranging from 17 3 to 35 years and representing 78 fim to 97 la boqilla of the cyclic variability with enso and enso pna like cycles providing the remainder of the variability table sm 1 without additional inflows average historical releases relative to utility capacity have total periods of delivery ranging from 3 3 years for la boquilla 1 5 years for fim and 0 4 years for el granero which are all less than the 5 year window of delivery obligations required under the 1944 treaty cumulative departures of releases and climate indices fig sm 2 show some relation to increasing pdo index and decreasing amo index releases show negative correlations with amo 0 87 at la boquilla 0 49 at fim and 0 83 at el granero p value 0 05 positive correlations with pdo 0 76 at la boquilla and 0 57 at el granero p value 0 05 and negative correlations with enso 0 50 at la boquilla p value 0 05 correlation between changes in storage and climate indices show negative correlations with amo 0 57 at la boquilla and 0 90 at el granero p value 0 05 positive and negative correlations with pdo 0 48 at fim and 0 50 at el granero p value 0 05 and negative correlations with enso 0 59 at fim p value 0 05 thus storage and releases are both correlated with climate indices and appear sensitive to shorter and longer climate cycles that are longer than their utility capacity periods of delivery reservoir evaporation is a surrogate indicator for water demand and the effects of temperature on water supply evaporation shows positive correlations with amo 0 90 at fim and 0 28 at el granero p value 0 05 and negative correlations with pdo 0 28 at la boquilla 0 63 at fim and 0 59 at el granero p value 0 05 and with enso 0 33 at la boquilla 0 43 at fim and 0 65 at el granero p value 0 05 thus evaporation as a demand on water resources shows generally opposite climate based behavior to the supply components of storage and releases and is largest during the spring season at all three reservoirs 3 3 decadal to century scale climate cycles analysis of cumulative departure of tree ring indices that span 1278 years 733 2010 ce from nearby casas grandes cgcd chihuahua mexico figs 2 and 5 cook et al 2020 show multiple wet and dry periods superimposed on a much longer wet dry cycle of about 639 years it includes a predominantly 300 year drier period 1181 1483 followed by a protracted 477 year wetter period 1470 1947 with the mega drought of the late 1500 s embedded in this longer wetter cycle cumulative departures in tree ring and climate indices show small but significant correlations p value 0 05 for casas grandes r 0 2 and tutuaca r 0 3 with amo for casas grandes r 0 4 and tabacote tomochi r 0 5 with pdo and minor correlations with enso for casas grandes r 0 2 tabacote tomochi r 0 3 and tutuaca r 0 2 the longer climate forcings of the multi century cycles amo may be related to millennial zhao et al 2021 geel et al 1999 and centennial clemens 2005 solar cycles and are addressed below frequency analysis of the cgcd indicates longer cycles amo and amo are present as significant contributions to decadal wet and dry periods table sm 1 frequency analysis indicated multiple cycles that include longer term amo like 91 8 107 426 and 639 years amo like 6 5 35 75 years pdo like 1 4 10 5 32 8 years nams like 0 2 7 0 10 years enso like 0 1 4 0 6 8 years and enso pna like 0 1 2 4 years the cumulative departure series from tree ring indices represent composites of these cycles with decadal dry periods that are not always strictly coincident with the recent pdo cycles overall the groups of dry years range from 12 to 43 years in duration over the past 1 2 millennia fig 5 using a 15 year window moving average based on the median cycle length of 15 years from pdo like cyles yielded an average number of dry years of about 8 years based on the casas grandes series thus the 5 year delivery cycles established for the 1944 treaty of the rivers does not reflect the average or range of dry year periods typical for this region over the past millennium tree ring indices from nearby tabacote tomochi fig 5 also indicate amo like 51 5 137 years amo like 29 8 58 7 years pdo like 16 8 14 7 27 4 years nams like 0 9 7 4 10 8 years and enso plus enso pna like 0 5 2 6 years table sm 1 tree ring indices from nearby tutuaca fig 5 also indicate cycles of amo like 86 4 120 240 years amo like 7 7 53 2 years pdo like 5 2 11 7 and 30 years nams like 0 3 7 5 and 9 6 years and0 5 of enso plus enso pna like cycles while the series from these three sites are similar only two show the mega drought of the late 1500 s the tabacote tomochi trees show a different response to some of the longer cycles such as the dry period from 1700 to 1735 as well as different amplitude that may reflect larger climate variability similarly the tutuaca index does not show the mega drought of the late 1500 s and responds differently to the wetter periods of 1152 1568 1829 1860 and the more recent wet period that includes the period earlier warm pdo cycle 1925 46 like tabacote tomochi it has a different response to the recent warm pdo cycle of 1977 99 however many periods of drier conditions are common in all three series these differences may be partly due to differences in location higher elevation or orographic effects that may potentially contribute to localized microclimates fig 1 3 4 solar forcing and the millennial cycle time series filtered by calculation of 200 year moving

luminosity changes slc by about 125 years beer et al 2012 fig 13 5 3 2 2 two major inflection points indicate that the 14c inflection points lag the cgcd inflection points by a few decades the cgcd inflection points lag the slc by about 90 and 75 years fig 6a 3 5 solar forcing and century scale cycles the cgcd and δ14c time series are used for correlation analysis in the form of decadal means fig 6a in order to filter out short period variations such as schwabe and related cycles each curve is detrended for analysis of millennial cycles using a third order polynomial departures above and below the polynomial curves are compared for periods of 100 200 years fig 6b some departures correspond for both cgcd and δ14c e g near 1200 1500 and 1800 ce but there is no consistent correspondence observed scatter plots of the detrended decadal means cgcd vs δ14c show no relationship except for a weak but significant correlation r2 0 51 p value 0 05 between 1700 and 1950 ce this relation may be coincident with other factors such as the onset and growth of co2 emissions with increased hydrocarbon use for energy production starting with the industrial era 4 discussion this study has identified and evaluated the historical hydrologic cycles that have controlled recent supply from precipitation and reservoir operations and demand through temperature and evaporation the study has also identified longer cycles that also must be considered for sustainability management and governance this study has identified that mega droughts and multidecadal wetter and drier periods occurr within multidecadal to multi century cycles influenced by cycles of solar radiation from the millenial climate oscillation mco that need to be considered along with anthropogenic climate change acc to prepare for sustainability as well as treaty obligations of surface water deliveries from the rio conchos watershed 4 1 climate variability variability of precipitation in the rio conchos watershed is associated mainly with the phases of pdo which modulates precipitation in winter more than in summer the seasonality of precipitation also varies depending on the el niño la niña influence and its phase relationship with pdo and amo cycles with positive correlation with pdo and negative correlation with amo over different cyclic periods as shown with tree ring indices fig 7 the shorter supply periods from precipitation are similar to the time frames of the capacity of the reservoirs thus these reservoirs respond in a lagged fashion to local climate variability and related runoff the precipitation records from these reservoir sites do not appear to show the potential effects of the 2000 2019 mega drought williams et al 2020 but instead show interaction with the composite of the climate cycles that appear to create long periods of predominantly wet years 1965 81 2002 04 and 2005 19 indicated as increasing cumulative departure of annual and summer precipitation fig 3a the drier year periods observed in la boquilla and fim are similar to those identified in forests to southwest of chihuahua but with oscillations of different magnitude and duration driven by climate variability návar and lizárraga mendiola 2013 many of these periods differ from known wet and dry year periods from the southwestern united states such as the severe droughts of 1976 77 and 1987 92 hanson 2003 even in an area as close as las cruces new mexico that showed predominantly dry years from 2003 to 2014 this collectively may suggest that nams events along with enso events and east pacific tropical storms may provide localized relief from the regional mega drought identified by broader regional assessments williams et al 2020 woodhouse et al 2012 modulation of winter precipitation is likely to affect long term groundwater storage and recharge in chihuahua city fig 1 winter precipitation for 1962 1988 made up only 22 of the annual total and had seasonal weighted mean isotope composition between winter and summer precipitation fig 8 iaea 2021 groundwater isotope data for nearby chihuahua city mahlknecht et al 2008 form a broad evaporation trend of the slope near 5 originating almost entirely in winter precipitation and probably only from large precipitation events fig 8 recharge therefore occurs mostly in winter despite the small annual fraction of winter precipitation radiocarbon data from this same study also suggests that winter recharge has dominated for much of the holocene at least in the area near chihuahua city groundwater storage and recharge are likely to change in response to the pdo related modulation of winter precipitation summer recharge may be present locally as in the transboundary upper san pedro basin of arizona where recharge in a mountain block includes 35 25 summer precipitation wahi et al 2008 segregation of groundwater recharge estimates using a summer and winter ratios of mountain system recharge ajami et al 2011 have been assessed for nearby transboundary upper san pedro basin in arizona but this approach does not account for the additional climate variability from forcings such as pdo that were found to dominate in the rio conchos and across the southwest hanson et al 2004 2006 dickinson et al 2004 the minimum monthly temperature and temperature differences are increasing with increased climate variability the average minimum temperature at fim increased by about 1 5 c over the 75 year period which exceeds the standard deviation of the earlier period and is comparable to the more recent period fig 4a average july temperature difference also increased by about 0 4 c between the two historical periods fig 4b with the temperature difference standard deviation for the more recent period 1 4 times greater than the earlier period global climate model estimates of tmin indicate similar increases from the ipcc the sixth assessment report ipcc interactive atlas ipcc 2021 for regions coincident with the rio conchos basin using the cmip6 model projection rcp 2 6 with warming 1 5 c conditions these models allow subregional assessment of change of tmin based on the historical period 1850 1900 for the north american monsoon region northern central america and the rio grande basin in the monsoon region tmin increased from 0 39 to 1 7 c above the average global tmin from 1980 to 2020 with an average estimated increase of 1 6 c for the entire region in the northern central america region the tmin increased from 0 28 to 1 5 c for the same period average estimated increment of 1 2 c furthermore in the rio grande basin region tmin increased from 0 19 to 1 6 c for the same period with an average estimated increase of 1 4 c these similar modeled and instrumental estimates of increased minimum temperature are influenced by a combination of the variable climate patterns presented here and increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmoshpere the mexican drought altas stahle et al 2016 indicated that the enso signal has a stronger and more time stable correlation with drought across northern mexico than either the amo or pdo yet the present study clealy shows negative correlations with amo and positive correlations with pdo and lesser correlations with enso indices this is similar to the recent analysis of reconstructed streamflow from tree ring indices also showed similar relations with amo and pdo martínez sifuentes et al 2020 the 70 year instrumental records analyzed here show pdo 83 41 was the largest contributors to climate variability for annual and seasonal periods for interannual to interdecadal periods and lesser conributions from enso 58 15 table sm 1 fig sm 1 longer time intervals from tree ring indices show much larger and longer cycles that control multidecadal to multi century wet and dry periods tree ring indices and summer soil moisture reconstruction williams et al 2020 indicated that 2000 2019 mega drought is additionally driven by almost half 47 by anthropogenic climate change due to co2 emissions this analysis suggests that 2000 2019 mega drought may be the worst drought since the late 1500 ce mega drought 1569 1607 across the entire sourthwest of north america including northern mexico the tree ring records from casas grandes and tutuaca overlap the recent dry periods and the cold negative pdo cycle 1947 1976 and 2000 2014 fig 5 and appear to be driven by the combination of these climate forcings however the precipitation analysis fig 2 indicates wetter conditions relative to the previous protracted dry period 1992 2001 which is consistent with analysis from the lower rio grande hanson et al 2020 together these observations indicate that the present drought is not pervasive in this part of the us mexico transboundary region in contrast the current drought advisory conagua 2020a 2020b indicates that severe drought is not developing in northern mexico yet their analysis does not include subregional analysis or this longer context of droughts within climate variability and climate change in this part of northern mexico multidecadal droughts have occurred such as the mega drought of the late 1500 s ce 1569 1607 and more recently a protracted dry period in the 20th century 1943 1982 that are separated by about 350 years there are multidecadal droughts with some embedded in longer cycles of increasing wetter conditions or sustained drought for example there is a 477 year wetter period from 1470 to 1947 that encompasses the late 1500 mega drought along with a few shorter droughts this pattern is also similar to the gcm projections under the previous gcm a2 scenario business as usual co2 emissions analyzed for the central valley california which also showed the potential of several multidecadal droughts ocurring in the later part of the 21st century hanson et al 2012 4 2 conjunctive use and sustainability many transboundary conflicts focus on sharing of surface water and do not address climate variability and conjunctive use with all water sources including groundwater rivera and hanson 2021 sanchez et al 2021 under the isarm international shared aquifer resources management program https en unesco org themes water security hydrology programmes isarm unesco and oas recently included transboundary groundwater management rivera 2015 hanson et al 2015 as an integral part of management of all transboundary water resources the national program against drought rubio gutiérrez 2017 was proposed as a framework for the national drought policy federman et al 2014 developed with the mexican insitute of water technology cortés et al 2016 and implemented by the national commission of water conagua however this framework shares the shortcomings of the united states nidis program as it does not address conjunctive use and replenishment of water or a more comprehensive strategy for dealing with changes in supply and demand cycles in response to long term climate changes this type of planning can minimize the effects of drought support longer term sustainability and development of infrastructure and related governance drought and sustainability of water resources are best viewed in the context of both supply and demand and conjunctive use in this arid region climate variability has driven variable supply during the period of historical record during which the margin between supply and demand has narrowed as water consumption increases as in many of the watersheds in the usa mx transboundary regions about 90 of surface water and 84 of pumped groundwater are used for irrigation in the state of chihuahua conagua 2020b water resource management must therefore be approached from an integral perspective taking longer and shorter climate cycles into account conjunctive use in the rio conchos is a combination of groundwater and surface water use that largely represents agriculture sustainability is driven by demand from irrigation that has grown with increased land use and changed from seasonal to permanent crops that hardened demand and intensified agricultural production that rely even more on both surface water and groundwater supply drought combined with agricultural intensification and hardening of demand contributed to reduced availability of surface water stored in local reservoirs for example drought conditions in 1994 1995 resulted in the closure of la boquilla and fim reservoirs to irrigation releases ortega gaucin et al 2009 lack of surface water was then compensated by installation of about 280 wells which accelerated aquifer depletion and further reduced conveyance of surface water on the rio conchos for irrigation and treaty deliveries adaptation to climate varaiblility not only affects large scale agricultur but also small scale farmers in rural mexico campos et al 2014 reduced supply was combined with increased demand as local farmers kept the most profitable crops increased irrigation demand has resulted from hardened demand from orchard crops longer growing periods more et and intensification of crop production through more density of cultivation this evolution of supply and demand is similar to that developing in the lower rio grande where growth of irrigation demand is driven mainly by the hardening of demand as seasonal crops such as alfalfa and cotton are supplanted by permanent crops such as pecan orchards hanson et al 2020 the mexican institute of water technology imta estimated runoff for replenishing reservoirs in the conchos river basin will decrease by 10 12 based on future scenarios of co2 emissions imta 2013 therefore agricultural lands will have less surface water for irrigation which will rely more on groundwater that will further interefere with obligated surface water treaty deliveries similar to ongoing water conflicts of lower rio grande hanson et al 2020 these projections also show wet periods with an increase in median temperature of around 2 with a proposal to establish resource contingency plans that should be developed and implemented as soon as possible currently competition for water resources in the region has increased yet there are no comprehensive water management strategies in the region that account for the climate variability delineated in this study resulting in conflicts over local allocation of surface water for irrigation and other uses as well as binational treaty obligations modifications to reservoir operations in chihuahua mexico are controversial among farmers and local governments in mexico the two main demands are transboundary water deliveries and irrigation within the rio conchos watershed the former are treaty obligations usa mexico 1944 and are tracked on a sliding scale of 5 year cycles with an additional 5 years for any remaining deficits rio conchos provides a large percentage of the treaty deliveries from mexico the 35 cycles of delivery since 1953 are generally coincident with the wet and dry year periods from precipitation data at la boquilla reservoir if the total delivery for a 5 year period is achieved early within the period then a new 5 year period begins immediately for deliveries from mexico eight of the 35 cycles required the entire 5 years and six of the eight full 5 year cycles still had a deficit delivery 10 1953 9 1968 6 1982 6 1987 9 1992 9 2007 and 10 2010 10 2015 consequently the contribution from the rio conchos is relatively largest during dry year periods the rio grande treaty deliveries from the usa are sustained by regional climate and snowmelt from the southern rocky mountains in the colorado headwaters of the rio grande yet deliveries for agriculture and the treaty from the rio conchos are dependent on local runoff from rainfall and related climate cycles figs 2 and 3 to align the deliveries with the climate cycles the delivery cycles from mexico should be 8 15 years in length based on the moving window analysis of casas grandes tree ring data as opposed to periods of 5 years or less less when a reset occurs after delivery completion in less than 5 years used by the current treaty overall 25 of the 35 cycles 71 were less than 5 years and 23 cycles less than 2 years 66 a more dynamic range of delivery periods would consider the likelihood of such short cycles but could also take account of longer dry periods possibly with a threshold of 5 dry years in the casa grandes cumulative departure tree ring time series figs 5 6 23 of the historical dry periods lasted 5 years or less this threshold could potentially trigger a drought contigency for amounts and or time periods of deliveries the drought contingency strategy also could be similar to what is used by the usbr to reduce deliveries during drought periods for the lower rio grande project and the related 1906 treaty usbr 2016 2017 usa mexico 1906 4 3 long term solar forcing of climate both groundwater and near surface 14c are replenished by continuous small additions from the atmosphere to larger reservoirs the sizes of the near surface reservoirs therefore reflect long histories of replenishment at changing rates e g for 14c beer et al 2012 cumulative departures of tree ring indices from long term average values as indicators of climate variation might thus be more closely related than simple departures to time series such as δ14c in biomass and groundwater volumes the similarity of the 200 year moving average curves fig 6a shows that this is the case at millennial time scale in the rio conchos region of northern mexico the similarity also indicates a strong relationship between solar luminosity and tree ring indices and by extension to variations in climate at millennial time scales whether the climate variations involve changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration a connection between solar luminosity and surface water and groundwater accumulation emerges at century time scales other factors in addition to solar luminosity are likely operating based on the analysis presented here solar forcing does not appear to be consistent across the entire span of data and where present and accounts for half at most of observed variance thus additional research may be needed to better understand all of the forcings that control climate at century to millenial time periods in this region the lag between slc and climate recorded in casas grande tree rings constitutes a third example of lag between millennial scale slc and corresponding climate responses at earth s surface the lags reported here about 90 and 75 years can be compared with a 100 year lag reported by helama et al 2010 on the basis of tree ring widths in scandinavia and 125 175 years reported by eastoe et al 2019 from a comparison of δ14c and δ13c timeseries in sequoia tree rings in california lags may differ with time and locality but it is likely that the climatic effects of an approaching or contemporary millennial maximum in solar activity will not be felt until about 100 years after the solar maximum the three studies demonstrate that the climatic response is sufficient to affect widths or δ13c of tree rings 4 4 time scales this study shows cycles of drier and wetter climate at a variety of time scales combining tree ring data and instrumental records indicates the importance of pdo like cycles shorter cycles are indicated in the historical and recent instrumental records these correspond to phase relationships between amo pdo and enso construction of reservoirs attempts to mitigate the effects of the shorter cycles and the timing disparity between supply and demand at interannual time periods local tree ring data indicate cycles at 100 to 1000 year time scales and global 14c data provide evidence of solar forcing at the millennial scale long climate cycles of the past operating without human mitigation may have contributed to the rise and fall of pre columbian civilizations in the region fig 2 the reservoirs reflect more recent development of water resource infrastructure to enhance reliability and sustain water food security besides the mega drought of 1569 1607 39 years additional dry year periods occurred for the periods of 1666 1688 23 years 1695 1735 41 years 1798 1809 12 years 1853 1868 16 years 1875 1917 43 years 1952 1991 40 years and 1999 2012 14 years fig 7 which are all within the range of the two modes of the pdo like cycles thus in the recent past of instrumental data and over recent centuries the cycles are similar to the pdo like cycles however the amo and enso like cycles may also be significantly contributing to the overall variation as shown in the past two centuries as the cycles come into and out of phase with each other fig 7 and collectively contribute to decadal drought periods of 12 43 years figs 5 and 7 5 conclusions and future work this study has provided a new data and novel assessment of climate variability in the rio conchos watershed over multiple time scales and its potential effects on water supply and demand through analysis of climate instrumental data historical reservoir operations changes in 14c concentrations and tree ring indices multiple levels of climate variability occur from interannual and interdecadal to multi century and millenial periods unlike some previous studies of this region at multi decade scales estimated climate cycles are predominantly pdo like cycles with additional but lesser contributions by amo and enso like cycles mega droughts and periodic multidecadal droughts occur within climate cycles at 100 to 1000 year time scales climate variability including mco now combined with climate change acc will dictate future cycles of supply and demand that will require mitigation and management to achieve sustainability and reliability in turn sustainability will require conjunctive use to not only reduce the effects of demand but also to enhance the effects of supply and related replenishment during periodic wet periods the 5 year cycle of transboundary water deliveries under the 1944 treaty of the rivers is inadequate for management of the rio conchos watershed where droughts average about 8 years within the median 15 year window of pdo like cycles and longer dry periods span 12 43 years the delivery agreement of the treaty may also benefit from an additional drought contingency and some kind of threshold metric that initiates a drought contingency for protracted or severe droughts reservoir operation strategies reflecting the longer climate cycles may serve local and national communities better than strategies at present required by the 1944 treaty improved strategies are required as competition for water increases because of changes in land use and shifts to more profitable perennial crops this study has identified frequencies and correlations of climate variability over a broad spectrum of time periods while correlation does not constitute causation these analysis provide a basis for understanding the context of climate variability by using a wide variety of data types and time periods and provides higher order observations that can help develop integrated modeling of the processes that control the use and movement of water resources future holisitc analysis of adaptation and mitigation strategies taking account of climate variability will require an integrated hydrologic model boyce et al 2020 that can simulate and assess the conjunctive use and movement of water at the multiple time scales of climate cycles identified in this work this could be similar to the analysis and modeling of the lower rio grande operating agreement by usbr usbr 2008 performed to evaluate deliveries under historical climate variability hanson et al 2020 and potential future climate change usbr 2016 2017 ferguson and llewellyn 2015 while some analysis has been performed locally dof 2011 future work will need to develop an integrated hydrologic model that can replicate these climate cycles use and movement of water and related changes in land use and simulate the related physical processes of supply and demand this will provide a neutral and comprehensive avenue of analysis and management and assess the proportions and timing of supply and demand components that includes reservoir operations this in turn will provide a vehicle for combined analysis of sustainable allocation of surface water and groundwater across the watershed as well as possible framework for adjustments in management and governance of all water

overreaching problem is that mega droughts and multidecadal wetter and drier periods occur within multidecadal driven by amo and pdo cycles and within multi century cycles influenced by changes in solar radiation from the millennial climate oscillation mco enc 2021 that need to be considered along with anthropogenic climate change acc to prepare for sustainability alignment of management cycles with local climate cycles and related global climate drivers is fundamental to successful development of sustainability and mitigation strategies to steward the water resources and help achieve both sustainability and adaptability resource management systems need to be able to assess climate change and variability linkages at different time scales that include operations uses seasonal to multi year governance management seasonal to inter decadal and capital improvement projects infrastructure inter annual to multi century climate cycles that drive the supply and demand for water are largely unknown for transboundary watersheds and aquifers and remain relatively unknown along the us mexico border reaches of the rio grande river such as the rio conchos river watershed fig 1 climate change combined with growing human demand for water and evolving land use is amplifying a crisis in demand relative to the supply of water resources along with related issues of food and land use security hanson et al 2012 vörösmarty et al 2000 climate change encompasses nonperiodic changes in global or regional climate patterns in particular a change apparent from the mid 20th century onwards and is attributed largely to increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced from fossil fuel use climate variability is driven by both oceanic and atmospheric forcings which are also potentially influenced by cycles of change in solar luminosity at millennial scale clemens 2005 this solar cycle estimated at 1 470 years has been the possible contributor to glacial climate cycles braun 2005 and climate variability driven by millennial scale solar variability through the holocene zhao et al 2021 climate variability includes all the quasi periodic climate variations lasting longer than individual weather events with periods from interannual and decadal to multiple century duration and consequently is a critical factor influencing water supply and demand sustained dry periods spanning two or more decades are referred to as mega droughts these extreme climate events now identified as part of the ongoing anthropogenic climate change hegerl et al 2007 also were common in the past resulting in the rise fall and migration of many civilizations over the past 10 000 years fagan 2008 the major periodic climate forcings juxtaposed in the study area include the pacific north

atmospheric dynamics erb et al 2020 the collapse of northern hemisphere monsoons over multidecadal to multi century scales super droughts may be related to north atlantic sea surface temperatures amo cycles and northern hemisphere temperatures over the last millennium based on speleothem data asmerom et al 2013 however eastoe and dettman 2016 cast doubt on the interpretation of speleothem isotope data in terms of precipitation amount the mechanisms of decadal drought variability encompass these phenomena an adequate understanding of which may lead to the predictability of drought beyond seasonal to interannual timescales seager and ting 2017 the medieval warm period and little ice age may be climate responses to longer term natural cycles of solar radiative forcing mann et al 2009 while water resource and climate analysis methods have advanced in recent decades there still remain many areas where the relationship between supply and demand of water resources remains unknown and not considered in the context of historical or future climate variability cycles of climate variability affect the sustainability of transboundary water resources as well as related management and governance nevertheless no comprehensive analysis of climate variability spanning decades to centuries exists for the us mexico transboundary region additionally climate cycles that drive the supply and demand for water are unknown for transboundary watersheds and aquifers and remain relatively unknown along the us mexico border reaches of the grande river mega droughts and their potential relationship to long term climate cycles and known periodic climate drivers has not been previously analyzed in this part of transboundary northern mexico while williams et al 2020 consider the period 2000 2019 as a modern mega drought the relation of this to historical mega droughts remains uncertain climate variability and related supply and demand drivers within regional transboundary watersheds like the rio conchos in chihuahua mexico need to be re assessed in the context of conjunctive use with due attention to both surface water reservoir operations and potential use of aquifer storage as well as the long term factors that control them while some studies have analyzed hydrologic time series and tree ring indices for regional drought woodhouse et al 2012 the combined analysis of these data was lacking and needed to answer some fundamental management and sustainability questions what are the major drivers of climate cycles and how do they affect transboundary water resources as well as related management and governance within climate change and variability are the mega droughts and multidecadal wetter and drier periods occurring within multi century cycles influneced by solar radiation within the millenial solar cycle this study estimates climate cycles over multiple time scales from new data and novel estimations of hydrologic and climate variability analysis through a analysis of the instrumental records assessment at three man made surface water reservoirs in the transboundary rio conchos watershed tree ring indices from nearby sites in chihuahua mexico fig 1 and global data for 14c in biomass as a proxy for solar luminosity b a new broader approach to assessing attributes of climate variability with implications for conjunctive use operations of man made reservoirs in the rio conchos watershed and c a re evaluation of the cycles of surface water deliveries from mexico required under the 1944 treaty of the rivers usa mexico 1944 these cycles are used to estimate the range of historical drought their potential relation to known climate indices and their potential relationship to international treaty water delivery obligations in turn this will help understand how climate variability affects transboundary water supply related reservoir operations and transboundary governance within the rio conchos watershed and support future hydrologic model and sustainability frameworks for management and governance of water and land in this us mexico transboundary region of the rio grande river 1 1 previous studies the mexican drought atlas mxda documents a history of droughts over the past 600 years 1400 2012 from tree ring reconstructions stahle et al 2016 but does not relate this history to climate indices droughts affecting all of mexico have been rare over the past 600 years and their frequency has not increased though selected droughts occurred stahle et al 2016 fig 2 extreme wet year periods also have occurred as documented in california for the central valley delta from tree ring index reconstruction malamud roam et al 2006 and for the rio colorado woodhouse and lukas 2006 since 1900 several exceptional wet periods have occurred in western north america including 1905 07 1917 1939 42 1957 1969 1978 1983 86 1998 and 2011 prolonged periods of drought or wet climate may include shorter wet or dry events as shown for dry periods of 10 45 years duration in coastal ventura california over the interval 1770 1995 ce hanson et al 2003 analysis of long term aridity in the western united states indicates that the current mega drought is more severe than previous events estimated from the historical record cook et al 2004 and the past holds insights for future climate alley 2003 environmental sustainability has been afffected by recent extreme drought which threatens to limit the allocation of water resources in the western usa and mexico for example the rio grande river at elephant butte reservoir is at 4 of capacity https

2018 the rio conchos is one of the largest contributors of surface water from mexico to the rio grande as well as to local irrigation and urban water supply cervera gómez 2008 operation of the three major reservoirs in rio conchos watershed is affected by the treaty of the rivers between the usa and mexico usa mexico 1944 mumme 2019 with an earlier treaty usa mexico 1906 contributions from six tributaries within mexico including the rio conchos are required to provide deliveries from mexico to the rio grande rio bravo dry periods occurred on the rio conchos in 1940 1948 1950 51 1956 57 1959 1969 1982 1985 1994 95 and 1997 98 and wet river climate conditions occurred in 1938 1941 42 1958 1966 1968 1978 1981 1984 1986 and 1991 cervera gómez 2008 more recently the reconstruction of streamflows from tree rings for the rio conchos martínez sifuentes et al 2020 estimated extreme hydroclimate events and identified several 10 year droughts over the past 243 years similarly woodhouse et al 2012 identified regional droughts across the entire rio grande and rio conchos watersheds over the past four centuries in the 1770 s 1890 s and 1950 s such extreme periods have affected local water use and treaty delivery obligations with the national commission of water conagua recently implementing modifications to reservoir operations enciso 2020 relations between drought land use native riparian vegetation and soil salinity were identified from 10 years of remote sensing images gutierrez et al 2004 that highlighted additional issues of conjunctive use in the rio conchos basin this watershed is also undergoing transitions in types of agriculture and growth of other water uses walsh 2009 the 1950 s and 1990 s droughts in the rio conchos basin were compared and contrasted in terms of changes in the mean and variability of stream inflows and implications for delivery obligations to the rio grande under the 1944 treaty over five year periods cervera gómez 2008 the 1944 treaty considers extraordinary drought but there is no metric or threshold that delineates this condition or specifies contingent responses instead the treaty simply reassigns any deficit in delivery to the next five year period this assessment of droughts in the rio conchos basin was based on the palmer standardized drought index pdsi for ojinaga texas from 1895 2000 cervera gómez 2008 however the pdsi is an indicator of soil moisture normalized to average conditions during the period of observation and therfore may not identify longer droughts that might emerge from more extended periods of observation using a drought threshold of pdsi 0 5 the 1950 s drought lasted seven years 86 months and between 1992 and 1998 7 4 years 89 months including four years 45 months of intense drought these two droughts showed differences in stream inflow for the two upstream reservoirs in the rio conchos watershed the most recent modification to the 1944 treaty minute 325 ibwc cila 2020 provides for supplemented deliveries in light of deficits from 2015 to 2020 however this action does not mitigate long term water management issues or provide guidance for future crises arising from climate variability and prolonged droughts climate forcing has been recognized through empircal analysis as a driving mechanism of change in hydrologic systems hanson 2003 dickinson et al 2004 hanson et al 2004 2006 2009 2020 gurdak et al 2009 hanson 2015 velasco et al 2017 periodic forcings collectively contribute to wet and dry periods that control water supply and demand variations at local and regional scale wet and dry periods result from the interaction of multiple climate cycles and related climate drivers climate cycles operate at different frequencies and amplitudes and their effects in southwestern north america vary as they move into and out of phase with each other hanson et al 2006 2020 climate variability in numerous other watersheds of southwestern north america has been studied with frequency analysis in california these include central valley faunt et al 2009 mojave river basin hanson et al 2004 pajaro valley hanson 2003 santa clara calleguas basin hanson et al 2003 coastal southern california hanson et al 2009 and the santa clara valley hanson 2015 as well as in arizona in tucson basin and san pedro valley hanson et al 2006 and the transboundary region of the lower rio grande hanson et al 2020 in texas and new mexico usa and conejos medanos chihuahua mexico frequency analysis also was used to explore the principal aquifers across the usa kuss and gurdak 2014 multi century cycles are evaluated with tree ring indices and 14c data changes in the production rate of 14c in the upper atmosphere provide a proxy for changes in solar luminosity provided lag and attenuation arising from the properties of atmospheric biomass and oceanic reservoirs of 14c are taken into account beer et al 2012 the 14c content of the near surface carbon reservoir lower atmosphere plus biomass is the integrated result of changes in 14c production over thousands of years changes in production rate for cycles of 1000 100 and 10 years appear as inflections of biomass 14c content with lags of about 125 10 and 2 years respectively beer et al 2012 fig 13 5 3 2 2 2 methodlogy 2 1 study area the study area in the middle and lower areas of the rio conchos watershed of southeastern chihuahua mexico of 74 372 km2 covers 61 of the watershed fig 1 including three reservoirs in this arid region where rainfall does not exceed 400 mm year rains are abundant in the summer june october annual temperatures range between 18 and 20 c and maximum temperatures are up to 40 c inegi 2017 of the six tributaries that flow into the lower rio grande from mexico the rio conchos is the largest contributor to the treaty s mexican delivery obligation and its watershed makes up about half of the rio grande watershed in mexico cervera gómez 2008 three reservoirs support local uses of water for agriculture water supply recreation power production ecological flows and flood control lago toronto la boquilla and luis l león el granero reservoirs are on the rio conchos the francisco i madero fim reservoir is located on rio conchos tributary san pedro river la boquilla and fim reservoirs store water for the largest irrigation district dr 005 in delicias and el granero reservoir supplies water for the irrigation district 090 in bajo río conchos the dr 005 covers 67 275 ha with more than 8 113 water users while the dr 090 covers 4 077 ha with 955 water users sina conagua 2018 irrigation consumes 95 of available water siap 2020 the combined utility capacity of the three reservoirs is 3 370 mm3 with 82 in la boquilla and 8 and 10 in fim and el granero respectively tree ring analyses were completed just northwest of the reservoir watersheds cook et al 2020 stahle et al 2016 fig 1 tree ring indices from sites near casas grandes about 300 km northwest of the rio conchos and san pedro watersheds provides the longest record 733 2010 ce casas grandes paquimé located in an arid plain bounded on the west by the sierra madre occidental was built about 1130 c e in the middle of the medieval warm period 900 1300 ce it relied on irrigation for agriculture from the casas grandes or san miguel rivers it was one of few pre columbian civilisations with a water well and sewer systems indicating a long history of conjunctive use in this region colonial settlers also started irrigation systems as early as the 1580 s that included conjunctive use saldaña 2012 casas grandes burned in 1340 and slowly declined from 1350 to 1450 fig 2 the tutuaca 1534 2012 ce and tabacote tomochi 1583 1993 ce tree ring data provide shorter records from the sierra madre occidental to the southwest of casas grandes in the temosachi and guerrero municipalities respectively while the analysis of climate variability with frequency methods is similar to other studies worldwide this study also incorporates analysis of climate indices and tree ring indices for longer time periods relevant to alignment with cycles of management and governance as well as multi decade infrastructure projects 2 2 sources and processing of data analysis of climate cycles for this study includes frequency analysis of local multidecadal instrumental hydrologic time series and multi century tree ring indices instrumental data include monthly precipitation july minimum temperature and temperature differences and reservoir attributes including storage releases and evaporation conagua 2020a central water and sanitation board jcas 2013 from these data seasonal to decadal variability has been determined for 1950 2019 with seasons representing the seasons of a calendar year climate indices used for additional correlation analysis in this study included the amo for 1856 2020 noaa amo 2020 pdo for 1854 2020 noaa pdo 2020 and enso34 for 1871 2020 noaa enso 2020 while climate indices for nams were developed based on precipitation gutzler 2004 and vapor movement hanson et al 2006 no nams index was used for analysis in this study instead the range of years for nams periodicity is used for comparison with frequency analysis decadal to millennial climate variability has been determined from tree ring indices for casas grandes cook et al 2020 stahle et al 2016 tabacote tomochi stahle et al 2002 and villanueva tutuaca stahle et al 2016 in addition tree ring indices are compared with 14c content in tree rings spanning the interval 733 1953 ce compiled by eastoe et al 2019 the spectral analysis of hydrologic variability is statistically compared with reported climate cycle intervals and time series and range of cycles of climate indices amo pdo nams enso to assess the similarity and provide statisitical inference between variability in hydrologic time series and known climate cycle drivers hanson et al 2004 2006 all time series are first converted to cumulative departure curves which embeds serial correlation and provides a surrogate for the interannual climate variability rate i e first derivative cumulative departure time series are analogous to time series representing changes as hydrologic accumulation or depletion such as groundwater levels for changes in groundwater storage reservoir stage for changes in reservoir storage and the accumulation of 14c in biomass the cumulative departure curves are detrended with a low order polynomial because most time series encompasses fragments of even larger cycles as the method was originally described by hanson et al 2004 the cumulative departure time series and the residuals from 4th order polynomial detrending are analyzed using singular spectral analysis ssa to estimate the periodic frequencies that can be summed to represent the historical cumulative departure residual time series all frequency analysis used the established methods of the united states geological survey s hydroclimate toolkit dickinson et al 2014 this toolkit facilitates climate variability analysis methods developed by hanson et al 2004 including the singular spectral analysis methods dettinger et al 1995 all frequency analyses were significant with respect to red noise climate change and the amplification of climate variability within climate change can potentially result in more extreme events as well as nonstationarity of the mean and variance of climate parameters milly et al 2008 2015 however weak stationarity appears to persists in frequency analysis of historical and future climate cycles hanson et al 2004 2006 2012 the estimated cycles are compared with the typical cycles of climate indices of known climate drivers amo pdo nams and enso enso has two modes el niño and la niña that differ from other climate drivers in their patterns and teleconnections gurdak et al 2009 previous frequency analysis shows that pdo also has two modes with periods of about 10 15 years and 24 30 years while others have studied surrogates for soil moisture using the normalized pdsi these studies did not collectively address natural and anthropogenic variability on multiple time scales needed for water resource management additionally pdsi is not a reliable indicator for longer periods or for conjunctive use in agricultural lands where soil moisture is typically well managed through irrigation data from the three reservoirs were analyzed to provide an integral depiction of their recent historical condition and sustainability under variable climate analysis of reservoir operations in the context of historical performance relative to climate leaves certain issues unaddressed it includes the operation of the reservoirs in response to multiple types of demand governed by a hierarchy of operating rules that attempt to mitigate disparities between supply and demand while taking account of diverse requirements such as irrigation recreation power generation and flood safety strategies for mitigating risk maximizing reliability and optimizing storage as climate changes reaffirms the important role of reservoir capacitance under increased stress from climate change plus human demand ehsani et al 2017 for a series of transboundary reservoirs in the northeastern united states reservoir operations become even more critical in arid northern mexico and the entire usa mexico transboundary region for example drought has curtailed releases from elephant butte and caballo reservoirs on the rio grande resulting in major increases of groundwater use to supplement surface water irrigation and treaty deliveries hanson et al 2020 ferguson and llewellyn 2015 as both supply and demand contribute to the balance of sustainbility recent changes in agricultural demand are also competing with treaty deliveries obligations from mexico to the rio grande finally the estimated hydrologic cycles are compared with known cycles from climate indices and to requirements of 5 year treaty surface water delivery periods from mexico tree ring indices as regional indicators of changing precipitation and temperature allow climate variability analysis over centuries across southwestern north america salzer and kipfmueller 2005 such analyses not only provide longer time periods hanson et al 2004 but also indicators of tree and forest health subject to drought and climate variability anderegg et al 2013 while the twentieth century reanalysis project 20cr compiled global atmospheric data compo et al 2011 since 1871 for improving and comparing the skill of climate models they did not include ice core tree ring or solar luminosity proxy data such information may provide constraints on climate change and climate variability over decadal to millennial scale periods it could be used to drive and constrain models and better understand the longer cycles of climate variability and now climate change too speleothem data provide similar information on longer term climate variability asmerom et al 2013 suggested a positive correlation between nams and amo in the context of multidecadal to multi century collapse of northern hemisphere monsoons like nams the speleothem record indicates that pdo cycles modulate the nams across southwestern north america and those super droughts coincided with the medieval climate anomaly warm period and the little ice age fig 2 this illustrates how droughts occur within longer wetter and drier cycles these longer multi century cycles may be related to the millennial sun cycle called the eddy cycle zhao et al 2021 with the most recent cycle embedding the medieval warm period and little ice age fig 2 the analysis of tree rings and 14c data from tree rings was performed to identify correlations between overlapping datasets for the casas grandes tree rings 733 2010 ce compared with 14 c content in tree rings spanning the interval 733 1953 ce compiled by eastoe et al 2019 in order to examine whether solar luminosity influences the tree ring index time series for periods on the order of 100 and 1000 years both datasets are filtered using moving averages and detrended using fitted 3rd order polynomials to enhance the graphical depiction of cycles at each time scale the 14c dataset includes high precision measurements on the cellulose fraction of dendrochronologically dated wood by liquid scintillation counting 998 1953 at laboratories in tucson eastoe et al 2019 and seattle usa stuiver et al 1998 and by accelerator mass spectrometry prior to 998 in nagoya japan miyahara et al 2004 miyake et al 2012 2013 the 14c data are plotted as δ14c stuiver and polach 1977 a parameter that accounts for mass dependent fractionation and radioactive decay of 14c the production of 14c in the upper atmosphere is a proxy for solar luminescence provided lag and attenuation arising from the properties of atmospheric biomass and oceanic reservoirs of 14c are taken into account beer et al 2012 a 14c dataset from tree rings in the western usa and japan eastoe et al 2019 overlaps most of the casas grandes tree ring index data set and incorporates data from stuiver et al 1998 miyahara et al 2004 and miyake et al 2012 2013 for the purposes of this study periods of a century scale and shorter length were filtered out by calculating 200 year running means for both the 14c and casas grande cumulative departure cgcd time series century scale events were investigated using decadal means detrended for longer period variation with third order polynomial expressions the 14c data are plotted as δ14c stuiver and polach 1977 a parameter that accounts for mass dependent fractionation and the radioactive decay of 14c 3 results 3 1 local climate cycles analyses of local instrumental data include precipitation and reservoir releases and storage that represent cycles of water supply and temperature temperature differences and evaporation at reservoirs that represent cycles of water demand the relatively short length of instrumental records precludes assessment of effects from the larger amo cycles but correlations are estimated for their period of record relative to cumulative departure time series for comparable windows of amo pdo and enso34 indices with instrumental records 3 1 1 precipitation annual and seasonal cumulative departure of precipitation at fim la boquilla and el granero fig 3 indicate the largest variability occurs during the rainy season summer months summer 61 69 and spring 16 17 precipitation dominating the distribution of annual precipitation these preciptation cycles are largely coincident with pdo and enso enso pna like climate cycles fig sm 1 table sm 1 historical winter precipitation cycles are dominated by pdo like 48 83 and enso enso pna like 10 35 cycles indicating that climate variability from pdo is more important than enso like cycles while pdo like cycles still contribute between 49 and 78 of the variance in spring summer and fall these seasons also include 10 31 variability from cycles coincident with enso and enso pna there is also a contribution from cycles coincident with nams for summer 10 and fall 30 at la boquilla fig sm 1 aggregate series from cumulative departures of precipitation and climate patterns show negative correlations with amo 0 77 at fim p value 0 05 negative and positive correlations with pdo 0 41 at la boquilla and 0 30 at fim p value 0 05 and enso 0 38 at la boquilla 0 41 at fim and 0 4 at el granero p value 0 05 long intervals of predominantly dry years occurred during 1950 64 and 1992 2001 at la boquilla at fim wet and dry year periods were different wet 1968 92 2002 10 and dry 1950 67 1993 2001 the shorter record at el granero shows more interannual variability with shorter wet and dry year periods wet 1972 74 1977 81 1984 87 1990 91 and 2003 2017 and dry 1965 71 1975 76 1982 83 1988 89 and a longer period 1992 2002 3 1 2 temperature increases in minimum temperature as well as increases and more variability of monthly average temperature differences are indicators of climate change at fim the rainy season month of july indicates the minimum temperature time series includes cycles with pdo like periods of 37 5 and 25 years 69 of total cyclic variance with a 7 5 year nams like cycle 22 and enso and enso pna like cycles accounting for the remaining 9 of the variance table sm 1 the average july temperature difference shows a 25 year pdo like cycle 91 8 3 year nams like cycle 4 7 and enso and enso pna like cycles 2 7 account for the rest of the variance table sm 1 average july minimum temperature and differences at fim reservoir indicate that in the middle of the rainy season july there is an apparent increase in variability between the periods 1945 1984 and 1986 2019 fig 4a b this partitioning overlaps the 1982 88 period which is a series of el niño and la niña enso events over the 75 year period the average minimum temperature at fim increased by about 1 5 c which exceeds the standard deviation of the earlier period and is comparable to the more recent period the average july temperature difference also increased by about 0 4 c between these two historical periods the temperature difference standard deviation for the more recent period is 1 4 times greater than the earlier period this suggests increased minimum temperature temperature difference and more variable temperature difference this is potentially consistent with climate change and increased climate variability within climate change 3 2 reservoir cycles the cycles summarized from reservoir operations are related to analysis of supply from reservoir releases and storage and of demand from evaporation these reservoir use attributes are reviewed in the context of climate variability sustainability of surface water supplies and treaty delivery requirements a detailed summary analysis of these cycles is included in the supplementary material variability of reservoir releases is aligned with climate cycles that control runoff but lags precipitation based climate cycles as with precipitation the releases are predominantly coincident with pdo like cycles with a lesser contribution from enso like cycles fig sm 2 the time series of reservoir releases shows pdo like cycles of period ranging from 17 3 to 35 years and representing 78 fim to 97 la boqilla of the cyclic variability with enso and enso pna like cycles providing the remainder of the variability table sm 1 without additional inflows average historical releases relative to utility capacity have total periods of delivery ranging from 3 3 years for la boquilla 1 5 years for fim and 0 4 years for el granero which are all less than the 5 year window of delivery obligations required under the 1944 treaty cumulative departures of releases and climate indices fig sm 2 show some relation to increasing pdo index and decreasing amo index releases show negative correlations with amo 0 87 at la boquilla 0 49 at fim and 0 83 at el granero p value 0 05 positive correlations with pdo 0 76 at la boquilla and 0 57 at el granero p value 0 05 and negative correlations with enso 0 50 at la boquilla p value 0 05 correlation between changes in storage and climate indices show negative correlations with amo 0 57 at la boquilla and 0 90 at el granero p value 0 05 positive and negative correlations with pdo 0 48 at fim and 0 50 at el granero p value 0 05 and negative correlations with enso 0 59 at fim p value 0 05 thus storage and releases are both correlated with climate indices and appear sensitive to shorter and longer climate cycles that are longer than their utility capacity periods of delivery reservoir evaporation is a surrogate indicator for water demand and the effects of temperature on water supply evaporation shows positive correlations with amo 0 90 at fim and 0 28 at el granero p value 0 05 and negative correlations with pdo 0 28 at la boquilla 0 63 at fim and 0 59 at el granero p value 0 05 and with enso 0 33 at la boquilla 0 43 at fim and 0 65 at el granero p value 0 05 thus evaporation as a demand on water resources shows generally opposite climate based behavior to the supply components of storage and releases and is largest during the spring season at all three reservoirs 3 3 decadal to century scale climate cycles analysis of cumulative departure of tree ring indices that span 1278 years 733 2010 ce from nearby casas grandes cgcd chihuahua mexico figs 2 and 5 cook et al 2020 show multiple wet and dry periods superimposed on a much longer wet dry cycle of about 639 years it includes a predominantly 300 year drier period 1181 1483 followed by a protracted 477 year wetter period 1470 1947 with the mega drought of the late 1500 s embedded in this longer wetter cycle cumulative departures in tree ring and climate indices show small but significant correlations p value 0 05 for casas grandes r 0 2 and tutuaca r 0 3 with amo for casas grandes r 0 4 and tabacote tomochi r 0 5 with pdo and minor correlations with enso for casas grandes r 0 2 tabacote tomochi r 0 3 and tutuaca r 0 2 the longer climate forcings of the multi century cycles amo may be related to millennial zhao et al 2021 geel et al 1999 and centennial clemens 2005 solar cycles and are addressed below frequency analysis of the cgcd indicates longer cycles amo and amo are present as significant contributions to decadal wet and dry periods table sm 1 frequency analysis indicated multiple cycles that include longer term amo like 91 8 107 426 and 639 years amo like 6 5 35 75 years pdo like 1 4 10 5 32 8 years nams like 0 2 7 0 10 years enso like 0 1 4 0 6 8 years and enso pna like 0 1 2 4 years the cumulative departure series from tree ring indices represent composites of these cycles with decadal dry periods that are not always strictly coincident with the recent pdo cycles overall the groups of dry years range from 12 to 43 years in duration over the past 1 2 millennia fig 5 using a 15 year window moving average based on the median cycle length of 15 years from pdo like cyles yielded an average number of dry years of about 8 years based on the casas grandes series thus the 5 year delivery cycles established for the 1944 treaty of the rivers does not reflect the average or range of dry year periods typical for this region over the past millennium tree ring indices from nearby tabacote tomochi fig 5 also indicate amo like 51 5 137 years amo like 29 8 58 7 years pdo like 16 8 14 7 27 4 years nams like 0 9 7 4 10 8 years and enso plus enso pna like 0 5 2 6 years table sm 1 tree ring indices from nearby tutuaca fig 5 also indicate cycles of amo like 86 4 120 240 years amo like 7 7 53 2 years pdo like 5 2 11 7 and 30 years nams like 0 3 7 5 and 9 6 years and0 5 of enso plus enso pna like cycles while the series from these three sites are similar only two show the mega drought of the late 1500 s the tabacote tomochi trees show a different response to some of the longer cycles such as the dry period from 1700 to 1735 as well as different amplitude that may reflect larger climate variability similarly the tutuaca index does not show the mega drought of the late 1500 s and responds differently to the wetter periods of 1152 1568 1829 1860 and the more recent wet period that includes the period earlier warm pdo cycle 1925 46 like tabacote tomochi it has a different response to the recent warm pdo cycle of 1977 99 however many periods of drier conditions are common in all three series these differences may be partly due to differences in location higher elevation or orographic effects that may potentially contribute to localized microclimates fig 1 3 4 solar forcing and the millennial cycle time series filtered by calculation of 200 year moving average yield curves from cgcd and δ14c that resemble each other closely fig 6a and show cyclic variation with a period of about 1000 years changes in 14c in near surface reservoirs lag solar luminosity changes slc by about 125 years beer et al 2012 fig 13 5 3 2 2 two major inflection points indicate that the 14c inflection points lag the cgcd inflection points by a few decades the cgcd inflection points lag the slc by about 90 and 75 years fig 6a 3 5 solar forcing and century scale cycles the cgcd and δ14c time series are used for correlation analysis in the form of decadal means fig 6a in order to filter out short period variations such as schwabe and related cycles each curve is detrended for analysis of millennial cycles using a third order polynomial departures above and below the polynomial curves are compared for periods of 100 200 years fig 6b some departures correspond for both cgcd and δ14c e g near 1200 1500 and 1800 ce but there is no consistent correspondence observed scatter plots of the detrended decadal means cgcd vs δ14c show no relationship except for a weak but significant correlation r2 0 51 p value 0 05 between 1700 and 1950 ce this relation may be coincident with other factors such as the onset and growth of co2 emissions with increased hydrocarbon use for energy production starting with the industrial era 4 discussion this study has identified and evaluated the historical hydrologic cycles that have controlled recent supply from precipitation and reservoir operations and demand through temperature and evaporation the study has also identified longer cycles that also must be considered for sustainability management and governance this study has identified that mega droughts and multidecadal wetter and drier periods occurr within multidecadal to multi century cycles influenced by cycles of solar radiation from the millenial climate oscillation mco that need to be considered along with anthropogenic climate change acc to prepare for sustainability as well as treaty obligations of surface water deliveries from the rio conchos watershed 4 1 climate variability variability of precipitation in the rio conchos watershed is associated mainly with the phases of pdo which modulates precipitation in winter more than in summer the seasonality of precipitation also varies depending on the el niño la niña influence and its phase relationship with pdo and amo cycles with positive correlation with pdo and negative correlation with amo over different cyclic periods as shown with tree ring indices fig 7 the shorter supply periods from precipitation are similar to the time frames of the capacity of the reservoirs thus these reservoirs respond in a lagged fashion to local climate variability and related runoff the precipitation records from these reservoir sites do not appear to show the potential effects of the 2000 2019 mega drought williams et al 2020 but instead show interaction with the composite of the climate cycles that appear to create long periods of predominantly wet years 1965 81 2002 04 and 2005 19 indicated as increasing cumulative departure of annual and summer precipitation fig 3a the drier year periods observed in la boquilla and fim are similar to those identified in forests to southwest of chihuahua but with oscillations of different magnitude and duration driven by climate variability návar and lizárraga mendiola 2013 many of these periods differ from known wet and dry year periods from the southwestern united states such as the severe droughts of 1976 77 and 1987 92 hanson 2003 even in an area as close as las cruces new mexico that showed predominantly dry years from 2003 to 2014 this collectively may suggest that nams events along with enso events and east pacific tropical storms may provide localized relief from the regional mega drought identified by broader regional assessments williams et al 2020 woodhouse et al 2012 modulation of winter precipitation is likely to affect long term groundwater storage and recharge in chihuahua city fig 1 winter precipitation for 1962 1988 made up only 22 of the annual total and had seasonal weighted mean isotope composition between winter and summer precipitation fig 8 iaea 2021 groundwater isotope data for nearby chihuahua city mahlknecht et al 2008 form a broad evaporation trend of the slope near 5 originating almost entirely in winter precipitation and probably only from large precipitation events fig 8 recharge therefore occurs mostly in winter despite the small annual fraction of winter precipitation radiocarbon data from this same study also suggests that winter recharge has dominated for much of the holocene at least in the area near chihuahua city groundwater storage and recharge are likely to change in response to the pdo related modulation of winter precipitation summer recharge may be present locally as in the transboundary upper san pedro basin of arizona where recharge in a mountain block includes 35 25 summer precipitation wahi et al 2008 segregation of groundwater recharge estimates using a summer and winter ratios of mountain system recharge ajami et al 2011 have been assessed for nearby transboundary upper san pedro basin in arizona but this approach does not account for the additional climate variability from forcings such as pdo that were found to dominate in the rio conchos and across the southwest hanson et al 2004 2006 dickinson et al 2004 the minimum monthly temperature and temperature differences are increasing with increased climate variability the average minimum temperature at fim increased by about 1 5 c over the 75 year period which exceeds the standard deviation of the earlier period and is comparable to the more recent period fig 4a average july temperature difference also increased by about 0 4 c between the two historical periods fig 4b with the temperature difference standard deviation for the more recent period 1 4 times greater than the earlier period global climate model estimates of tmin indicate similar increases from the ipcc the sixth assessment report ipcc interactive atlas ipcc 2021 for regions coincident with the rio conchos basin using the cmip6 model projection rcp 2 6 with warming 1 5 c conditions these models allow subregional assessment of change of tmin based on the historical period 1850 1900 for the north american monsoon region northern central america and the rio grande basin in the monsoon region tmin increased from 0 39 to 1 7 c above the average global tmin from 1980 to 2020 with an average estimated increase of 1 6 c for the entire region in the northern central america region the tmin increased from 0 28 to 1 5 c for the same period average estimated increment of 1 2 c furthermore in the rio grande basin region tmin increased from 0 19 to 1 6 c for the same period with an average estimated increase of 1 4 c these similar modeled and instrumental estimates of increased minimum temperature are influenced by a combination of the variable climate patterns presented here and increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmoshpere the mexican drought altas stahle et al 2016 indicated that the enso signal has a stronger and more time stable correlation with drought across northern mexico than either the amo or pdo yet the present study clealy shows negative correlations with amo and positive correlations with pdo and lesser correlations with enso indices this is similar to the recent analysis of reconstructed streamflow from tree ring indices also showed similar relations with amo and pdo martínez sifuentes et al 2020 the 70 year instrumental records analyzed here show pdo 83 41 was the largest contributors to climate variability for annual and seasonal periods for interannual to interdecadal periods and lesser conributions from enso 58 15 table sm 1 fig sm 1 longer time intervals from tree ring indices show much larger and longer cycles that control multidecadal to multi century wet and dry periods tree ring indices and summer soil moisture reconstruction williams et al 2020 indicated that 2000 2019 mega drought is additionally driven by almost half 47 by anthropogenic climate change due to co2 emissions this analysis suggests that 2000 2019 mega drought may be the worst drought since the late 1500 ce mega drought 1569 1607 across the entire sourthwest of north america including northern mexico the tree ring records from casas grandes and tutuaca overlap the recent dry periods and the cold negative pdo cycle 1947 1976 and 2000 2014 fig 5 and appear to be driven by the combination of these climate forcings however the precipitation analysis fig 2 indicates wetter conditions relative to the previous protracted dry period 1992 2001 which is consistent with analysis from the lower rio grande hanson et al 2020 together these observations indicate that the present drought is not pervasive in this part of the us mexico transboundary region in contrast the current drought advisory conagua 2020a 2020b indicates that severe drought is not developing in northern mexico yet their analysis does not include subregional analysis or this longer context of droughts within climate variability and climate change in this part of northern mexico multidecadal droughts have occurred such as the mega drought of the late 1500 s ce 1569 1607 and more recently a protracted dry period in the 20th century 1943 1982 that are separated by about 350 years there are multidecadal droughts with some embedded in longer cycles of increasing wetter conditions or sustained drought for example there is a 477 year wetter period from 1470 to 1947 that encompasses the late 1500 mega drought along with a few shorter droughts this pattern is also similar to the gcm projections under the previous gcm a2 scenario business as usual co2 emissions analyzed for the central valley california which also showed the potential of several multidecadal droughts ocurring in the later part of the 21st century hanson et al 2012 4 2 conjunctive use and sustainability many transboundary conflicts focus on sharing of surface water and do not address climate variability and conjunctive use with all water sources including groundwater rivera and hanson 2021 sanchez et al 2021 under the isarm international shared aquifer resources management program https en unesco org themes water security hydrology programmes isarm unesco and oas recently included transboundary groundwater management rivera 2015 hanson et al 2015 as an integral part of management of all transboundary water resources the national program against drought rubio gutiérrez 2017 was proposed as a framework for the national drought policy federman et al 2014 developed with the mexican insitute of water technology cortés et al 2016 and implemented by the national commission of water conagua however this framework shares the shortcomings of the united states nidis program as it does not address conjunctive use and replenishment of water or a more comprehensive strategy for dealing with changes in supply and demand cycles in response to long term climate changes this type of planning can minimize the effects of drought support longer term sustainability and development of infrastructure and related governance drought and sustainability of water resources are best viewed in the context of both supply and demand and conjunctive use in this arid region climate variability has driven variable supply during the period of historical record during which the margin between supply and demand has narrowed as water consumption increases as in many of the watersheds in the usa mx transboundary regions about 90 of surface water and 84 of pumped groundwater are used for irrigation in the state of chihuahua conagua 2020b water resource management must therefore be approached from an integral perspective taking longer and shorter climate cycles into account conjunctive use in the rio conchos is a combination of groundwater and surface water use that largely represents agriculture sustainability is driven by demand from irrigation that has grown with increased land use and changed from seasonal to permanent crops that hardened demand and intensified agricultural production that rely even more on both surface water and groundwater supply drought combined with agricultural intensification and hardening of demand contributed to reduced availability of surface water stored in local reservoirs for example drought conditions in 1994 1995 resulted in the closure of la boquilla and fim reservoirs to irrigation releases ortega gaucin et al 2009 lack of surface water was then compensated by installation of about 280 wells which accelerated aquifer depletion and further reduced conveyance of surface water on the rio conchos for irrigation and treaty deliveries adaptation to climate varaiblility not only affects large scale agricultur but also small scale farmers in rural mexico campos et al 2014 reduced supply was combined with increased demand as local farmers kept the most profitable crops increased irrigation demand has resulted from hardened demand from orchard crops longer growing periods more et and intensification of crop production through more density of cultivation this evolution of supply and demand is similar to that developing in the lower rio grande where growth of irrigation demand is driven mainly by the hardening of demand as seasonal crops such as alfalfa and cotton are supplanted by permanent crops such as pecan orchards hanson et al 2020 the mexican institute of water technology imta estimated runoff for replenishing reservoirs in the conchos river basin will decrease by 10 12 based on future scenarios of co2 emissions imta 2013 therefore agricultural lands will have less surface water for irrigation which will rely more on groundwater that will further interefere with obligated surface water treaty deliveries similar to ongoing water conflicts of lower rio grande hanson et al 2020 these projections also show wet periods with an increase in median temperature of around 2 with a proposal to establish resource contingency plans that should be developed and implemented as soon as possible currently competition for water resources in the region has increased yet there are no comprehensive water management strategies in the region that account for the climate variability delineated in this study resulting in conflicts over local allocation of surface water for irrigation and other uses as well as binational treaty obligations modifications to reservoir operations in chihuahua mexico are controversial among farmers and local governments in mexico the two main demands are transboundary water deliveries and irrigation within the rio conchos watershed the former are treaty obligations usa mexico 1944 and are tracked on a sliding scale of 5 year cycles with an additional 5 years for any remaining deficits rio conchos provides a large percentage of the treaty deliveries from mexico the 35 cycles of delivery since 1953 are generally coincident with the wet and dry year periods from precipitation data at la boquilla reservoir if the total delivery for a 5 year period is achieved early within the period then a new 5 year period begins immediately for deliveries from mexico eight of the 35 cycles required the entire 5 years and six of the eight full 5 year cycles still had a deficit delivery 10 1953 9 1968 6 1982 6 1987 9 1992 9 2007 and 10 2010 10 2015 consequently the contribution from the rio conchos is relatively largest during dry year periods the rio grande treaty deliveries from the usa are sustained by regional climate and snowmelt from the southern rocky mountains in the colorado headwaters of the rio grande yet deliveries for agriculture and the treaty from the rio conchos are dependent on local runoff from rainfall and related climate cycles figs 2 and 3 to align the deliveries with the climate cycles the delivery cycles from mexico should be 8 15 years in length based on the moving window analysis of casas grandes tree ring data as opposed to periods of 5 years or less less when a reset occurs after delivery completion in less than 5 years used by the current treaty overall 25 of the 35 cycles 71 were less than 5 years and 23 cycles less than 2 years 66 a more dynamic range of delivery periods would consider the likelihood of such short cycles but could also take account of longer dry periods possibly with a threshold of 5 dry years in the casa grandes cumulative departure tree ring time series figs 5 6 23 of the historical dry periods lasted 5 years or less this threshold could potentially trigger a drought contigency for amounts and or time periods of deliveries the drought contingency strategy also could be similar to what is used by the usbr to reduce deliveries during drought periods for the lower rio grande project and the related 1906 treaty usbr 2016 2017 usa mexico 1906 4 3 long term solar forcing of climate both groundwater and near surface 14c are replenished by continuous small additions from the atmosphere to larger reservoirs the sizes of the near surface reservoirs therefore reflect long histories of replenishment at changing rates e g for 14c beer et al 2012 cumulative departures of tree ring indices from long term average values as indicators of climate variation might thus be more closely related than simple departures to time series such as δ14c in biomass and groundwater volumes the similarity of the 200 year moving average curves fig 6a shows that this is the case at millennial time scale in the rio conchos region of northern mexico the similarity also indicates a strong relationship between solar luminosity and tree ring indices and by extension to variations in climate at millennial time scales whether the climate variations involve changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration a connection between solar luminosity and surface water and groundwater accumulation emerges at century time scales other factors in addition to solar luminosity are likely operating based on the analysis presented here solar forcing does not appear to be consistent across the entire span of data and where present and accounts for half at most of observed variance thus additional research may be needed to better understand all of the forcings that control climate at century to millenial time periods in this region the lag between slc and climate recorded in casas grande tree rings constitutes a third example of lag between millennial scale slc and corresponding climate responses at earth s surface the lags reported here about 90 and 75 years can be compared with a 100 year lag reported by helama et al 2010 on the basis of tree ring widths in scandinavia and 125 175 years reported by eastoe et al 2019 from a comparison of δ14c and δ13c timeseries in sequoia tree rings in california lags may differ with time and locality but it is likely that the climatic effects of an approaching or contemporary millennial maximum in solar activity will not be felt until about 100 years after the solar maximum the three studies demonstrate that the climatic response is sufficient to affect widths or δ13c of tree rings 4 4 time scales this study shows cycles of drier and wetter climate at a variety of time scales combining tree ring data and instrumental records indicates the importance of pdo like cycles shorter cycles are indicated in the historical and recent instrumental records these correspond to phase relationships between amo pdo and enso construction of reservoirs attempts to mitigate the effects of the shorter cycles and the timing disparity between supply and demand at interannual time periods local tree ring data indicate cycles at 100 to 1000 year time scales and global 14c data provide evidence of solar forcing at the millennial scale long climate cycles of the past operating without human mitigation may have contributed to the rise and fall of pre columbian civilizations in the region fig 2 the reservoirs reflect more recent development of water resource infrastructure to enhance reliability and sustain water food security besides the mega drought of 1569 1607 39 years additional dry year periods occurred for the periods of 1666 1688 23 years 1695 1735 41 years 1798 1809 12 years 1853 1868 16 years 1875 1917 43 years 1952 1991 40 years and 1999 2012 14 years fig 7 which are all within the range of the two modes of the pdo like cycles thus in the recent past of instrumental data and over recent centuries the cycles are similar to the pdo like cycles however the amo and enso like cycles may also be significantly contributing to the overall variation as shown in the past two centuries as the cycles come into and out of phase with each other fig 7 and collectively contribute to decadal drought periods of 12 43 years figs 5 and 7 5 conclusions and future work this study has provided a new data and novel assessment of climate variability in the rio conchos watershed over multiple time scales and its potential effects on water supply and demand through analysis of climate instrumental data historical reservoir operations changes in 14c concentrations and tree ring indices multiple levels of climate variability occur from interannual and interdecadal to multi century and millenial periods unlike some previous studies of this region at multi decade scales estimated climate cycles are predominantly pdo like cycles with additional but lesser contributions by amo and enso like cycles mega droughts and periodic multidecadal droughts occur within climate cycles at 100 to 1000 year time scales climate variability including mco now combined with climate change acc will dictate future cycles of supply and demand that will require mitigation and management to achieve sustainability and reliability in turn sustainability will require conjunctive use to not only reduce the effects of demand but also to enhance the effects of supply and related replenishment during periodic wet periods the 5 year cycle of transboundary water deliveries under the 1944 treaty of the rivers is inadequate for management of the rio conchos watershed where droughts average about 8 years within the median 15 year window of pdo like cycles and longer dry periods span 12 43 years the delivery agreement of the treaty may also benefit from an additional drought contingency and some kind of threshold metric that initiates a drought contingency for protracted or severe droughts reservoir operation strategies reflecting the longer climate cycles may serve local and national communities better than strategies at present required by the 1944 treaty improved strategies are required as competition for water increases because of changes in land use and shifts to more profitable perennial crops this study has identified frequencies and correlations of climate variability over a broad spectrum of time periods while correlation does not constitute causation these analysis provide a basis for understanding the context of climate variability by using a wide variety of data types and time periods and provides higher order observations that can help develop integrated modeling of the processes that control the use and movement of water resources future holisitc analysis of adaptation and mitigation strategies taking account of climate variability will require an integrated hydrologic model boyce et al 2020 that can simulate and assess the conjunctive use and movement of water at the multiple time scales of climate cycles identified in this work this could be similar to the analysis and modeling of the lower rio grande operating agreement by usbr usbr 2008 performed to evaluate deliveries under historical climate variability hanson et al 2020 and potential future climate change usbr 2016 2017 ferguson and llewellyn 2015 while some analysis has been performed locally dof 2011 future work will need to develop an integrated hydrologic model that can replicate these climate cycles use and movement of water and related changes in land use and simulate the related physical processes of supply and demand this will provide a neutral and comprehensive avenue of analysis and management and assess the proportions and timing of supply and demand components that includes reservoir operations this in turn will provide a vehicle for combined analysis of sustainable allocation of surface water and groundwater across the watershed as well as possible framework for adjustments in management and governance of all water

7816,study region the study area was the cangzhou area in the central eastern north china plain ncp study focus compaction of the aquifer system leads to a change in hydraulic parameters including the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity this further reduces its groundwater storage and supply capacity this study aimed to evaluate the non linear variation in hydraulic parameters and feedback to the aquifer system during land subsidence the aquifer system in cangzhou has suffered severe land subsidence caused by groundwater overexploitation and was chosen to demonstrate this effect a one dimensional non linear compaction and water drainage model was developed considering the changes in the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity new hydrological insights based on the physical characteristics of the cangzhou aquifer system a compaction model was applied to establish a quantitative relationship between deep groundwater abstraction hydraulic parameter change groundwater storage and supply capacity change during land subsidence results show that the inelastic storage coefficient was reduced by 0 005 0 032 for the deep aquifer system in the subsiding area this represents a reduction of 220 million m3 of groundwater that can be exploited per meter decline in the confined water level the permanent loss of groundwater storage capacity is estimated to be 9 41 billion m3 these research results have important reference significance for the scientific evaluation of aquifer water supply capacity change in subsiding regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords land subsidence storage coefficient non linear compaction groundwater supply capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the development and utilization of water resources through human production activities have seriously disrupted the global water cycle as the most reliable water resource particularly in arid areas groundwater supports local social and economic development more than 43 of the world s agricultural irrigation water comes from groundwater siebert et al 2010 because of the lack of surface water resources groundwater resources have been overexploited for nearly 30 years causing acute land subsidence problems in some arid and semi arid areas such as california and the north china plain ncp longuevergne et al 2010 herrera garcia et al 2021a 2021b land subsidence severely restricts the sustainable development of the social economy and has a feedback effect on the groundwater system and water cycle bai et al 2022 the harm of land subsidence caused by the overexploitation of groundwater to infrastructure facilities and buildings has been well documented however no known studies have been conducted on the influence of land subsidence on groundwater flow and resources by changing hydraulic parameters and affecting the storage and supply capacity of the aquifer system the common research is to evaluate the available water resources of regional groundwater by setting land subsidence as constraint condition pang et al 2022 compaction of the aquifer system especially the aquitard and increases in effective pore pressure due to water level decline are the main causes of land subsidence the magnitude of storage coefficients and hydraulic conductivities depends on porosity and generally decreases with aquifer depth as sediment loading reduces porosity leake and galloway 2010 soil compaction leads to a reduction in porosity and changes in relevant hydraulic parameters among which the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity are the two key parameters in aquifer characterization burbey 2006 zhou et al 2013 when using kinetic models such as geotechnical or groundwater flow models to simulate land subsidence neglecting the variations in the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity can significantly overestimate the simulated land subsidence dassargues 1995 in an aquifer system composed of multiple aquifers and aquitards the vertical permeability of the system is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitards and the storage coefficient constitutes the elastic and inelastic storage coefficients neuman and witherspoon 1969 a decrease in the storage coefficient will further reduce the volume of water that can be stored in the aquifer or the aquifer storage capacity loáiciga 2008 and therefore will affect the water supply capacity of an aquifer system however these parameters are generally treated as constant values in groundwater resource assessments even though significant land subsidence has occurred the simulation of a subsiding aquifer system physically coupled with changes in hydraulic parameters has become a great challenge in hydrogeological research several studies have been conducted to analyze the variations in groundwater hydraulic parameters through laboratory geotechnical compression experiments rudolph and frind 1991 burbey 2006 kim 2007 a common discovery is that the void ratio storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity decrease gradually with compaction however the loading and pressure ranges applied in laboratory tests cannot accurately reflect the in situ field situation and complicated groundwater dynamics in a real world aquifer system to our knowledge few studies have been conducted to evaluate the changes in aquifer storage capacity and the risk to groundwater supply by applying dynamic stress strain theory the storage change in a compacted aquifer system can be attributed to recoverable and irrecoverable components a large proportion of the groundwater abstraction comes from the aquitard drainage which is inelastic irrecoverable because the inelastic storage coefficient can be several orders of magnitude larger than the elastic one therefore inelastic aquitard drainage is a one time consumption causing a permanent loss of deep groundwater storage resources konikow et al 2005 2007 wada et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 smith et al 2017 béjar pizarro et al 2017 groundwater storage changes caused by groundwater abstraction have attracted considerable attention as a global groundwater depletion issue e g condon and maxwell 2019 at present there are two primary types of methods for evaluating regional groundwater storage changes estimation using traditional groundwater level monitoring or through a groundwater flow numerical model calibrated based on groundwater level measurements e g cao et al 2013 and the grace gravity satellite inversion method e g moiwo et al 2009 however it is difficult to distinguish between the recoverable and irrecoverable portions of groundwater storage changes if land subsidence is not explicitly simulated hydraulic parameter inversion and storage component separation were performed using insar data smith et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 this method also requires high resolution groundwater level and detailed hydrogeological data to perform parameter inversion which may limit its wide application the irreversible decrease in groundwater storage due to land subsidence represents a permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity and may also affect the groundwater recovery potential when conducting groundwater depletion control therefore the reduction in the storage capacity of the aquifer system after long term overexploitation has a significant impact on groundwater security and is a critical factor that should be considered in groundwater management the objective of this study was to quantitatively investigate the extent to which compacted drainage of the aquifer system can affect the groundwater hydraulic parameters the reduction in the water storage capacity of the aquifer system and the relevant permanent storage loss for this purpose a non linear compaction and drainage model coupled with varied parameters was constructed based on the one dimensional effective stress principle of terzaghi terzaghi 1925 the hydraulic conditions and representative parameter set were selected from the cangzhou area in the ncp which has been suffering from pumping resulting in land subsidence for approximately 100 years the simulation results were then used to evaluate their impact on the management of regional groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation of the dynamic response of the multi layer aquifer system to pumping we used a synthetic multilayer aquifer system fig 1 with following assumptions 1 groundwater abstraction from the deep groundwater was mainly composed of water released from the compacted confined aquifer compacted aquitard and leakage from the upper phreatic aquifer to the deep aquifer system without considering lateral flow 2 compaction release of the confined aquifer was mainly from elastic compaction and inelastic compaction was considered to be negligible 3 compaction release of the aquitard was mainly from inelastic compaction and elastic compaction was considered to be negligible 4 the deformation of the soil layer was uniform 5 the time lag of compaction of the aquitard was not considered and 6 the compression of porous media in the aquifer system was not considered based on the above model assumptions groundwater abstraction from the confined aquifer v z consists of three components groundwater flow from the elastic drainage of confined aquifer storage v e inelastic drainage of aquitard storage v v and leakage from the phreatic aquifer to the confined aquifer v y 1 v z v e v v v y the variations in the three components with time are of the greatest concern while the total pumping rate is constant these three components were calculated as the groundwater volume per unit area in a time step δt because the confined aquifer is mainly composed of sandy soil with low compressibility the deformation of the confined aquifer is mainly elastic when the effective stress is reduced to an initial value deformation can be restored in contrast the main component of aquitards is clay which has high compressibility when the effective stress increases inelastic or plastic deformation occurs which is large and mostly irrecoverable burbey 2006 hoffmann et al 2003a this permanent component of aquitard deformation was the focus of this study the storage removal from the aquitard can be simulated by the widely used aquitard drainage model e g helm 1976 leake and galloway 2007 based on the effective stress principle proposed by k terzaghi terzaghi 1925 the effective stress principle can be expressed as 2 σ σ μ where σ is the total stress applied on any plane of the saturated soil σ is the effective stress acting on the soil particle skeleton and μ is the pore water pressure the confined water head or pore water pressure decreased after the deep groundwater abstraction assuming a constant total stress the decrease in the pore water pressure is balanced by an increase in the effective stress on the soil skeleton the porous medium is then compressed which causes compaction of the aquitard and confined aquifer associated with water drainage the change in effective stress is the change in interstitial water pressure as shown in the following formulas 3 σ γ w h where γ w is the volume weight of water kn m3 h is the change in the confined water head m and σ is the change in effective stress kn m2 because aquitard compaction is assumed to be inelastic the changes between elastic and inelastic specific storage leake 1990 can be neglected therefore the inelastic aquitard drainage component is equal to the thickness change in magnitude during δt and can be calculated using the inelastic storage coefficient riley 1969 leake 1990 hoffmann et al 2003b as 4 v v b s kv h 5 s kv s skv b where s kv is the inelastic storage coefficient of the aquitard dimensionless s skv is the inelastic specific storage 1 m b is the thickness of the aquitard m and b is the change in the aquitard thickness during δt m the relationship between the inelastic specific storage and effective stress may be described according to leake and galloway 2007 as 6 s skv 0 434 c c r w σ 1 e where c c is the inelastic compression index dimensionless and e is the void ratio of clay soil in the aquitard the ratio b 1 e remained constant and the storage coefficient decreased as the effective stress increased the elastic confined aquifer drainage can be calculated by replacing the elastic storage coefficient in eq 5 with the inelastic storage coefficient as follows 7 v e d s ke h 8 s ke s ske d where s ke is the elastic storage coefficient dimensionless s ske is the elastic specific storage 1 m d is the thickness of the confined aquifer and d and δh are the changes in the aquifer thickness and hydraulic head during δt m respectively the relationship between the elastic specific storage and effective stress was described by leake and galloway 2007 as 9 s ske 0 434 c r γ w σ 1 e where c r is the elastic compression index dimensionless and e is the void ratio of the confined aquifer during each time step the change in aquifer aquitard thickness and water released from storage were calculated using the storage coefficient in the previous time step the storage coefficients were updated at the end of each time step using the updated effective stress the leakage from the phreatic aquifer to the deep aquifer system can be calculated assuming an equilibrium hydraulic gradient as follows 10 v y k t h u h c b hydraulic conductivity is determined by the void ratio taylor 1948 11 k c e n 1 e where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard m d h u and h c are the groundwater levels in the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifer respectively m c is a permeability parameter related to the plasticity index or shrinkage index of the soil m d and the exponent n is an empirical number generally set at 5 in thick aquitards leakage across the aquitard is generally delayed behind the decline in hydraulic head in adjacent aquifers the alternation of hydraulic heads gradually diffuses in the aquitard and leakage occurs until the change in head gradually affects the entire aquitard decreases in hydraulic diffusivity the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to specific storage due to consolidation can make this transient response period longer rudolph and frind 1991 for the modeling case in this study the aquitard has a discontinuous distribution with many thin interbeds and the time lag in each interbed can be very small in fact based on the thickness and typical storage coefficients of the aquitard in the ncp the case study area in section 2 2 the lag time was estimated to be approximately 3 5 years zuo and wan 2006 which is shorter than the time scale simulated in this study therefore the delayed drainage process was not simulated in the compaction model the altered flow conditions were not within the scope of this study 2 2 study area the cangzhou area is in the central and eastern portion of the ncp fig 2 on the eastern part of the eurasian plate and has an area of 14 000 km2 the climate is a typical semi arid continental monsoon type with four distinct seasons and concentrated rain in summer the annual average precipitation is 573 5 mm and the annual average pan evaporation is 1692 mm approximately three times the amount of precipitation the topography of cangzhou is flat and generally slightly higher in the southwest than in the northeast with elevations ranging from 2 to 20 m above sea level the quaternary strata in cangzhou fig 3 are rich in unconsolidated clay sized particles with a thickness of 400 500 m and can be divided into four water bearing layers from top to bottom zhang et al 2009 there are approximately 40 300 m thick saline brackish aquifers overlying freshwater aquifers in the aquifer system bai et al 2022 groundwater was mainly pumped from freshwater aquifers above the bottom of aquifer group iii which is poorly permeable and has weak lateral runoff recharge surface water and shallow freshwater resources are scarce in the cangzhou area with the development of the social economy deep groundwater must be exploited to support the rapidly increasing water demand from industry domestic and especially the agriculture sectors herrera garcia et al 2021a 2021b the cumulative exploitation of deep groundwater from 1970 to 2015 was approximately 18 billion m3 in this region with an average annual exploitation of 400 million m3 which has caused serious land subsidence by the end of 2015 the cangzhou area was one of the most critical subsidence areas in the ncp with a maximum cumulative subsidence exceeding 2000 mm and a cumulative settlement volume of 10 billion m3 the center of land subsidence accumulated subsidence of more than 2000 mm is in the urban area of cangzhou with a subsiding area of 3 14 km2 and a maximum cumulative subsidence of 2600 mm yunlong and xisheng 2019 2 3 model boundary conditions and parameters model parameters and boundary conditions were determined according to the hydrogeological setting in the cangzhou land subsidence center where acute land subsidence had occurred large scale development and utilization of deep groundwater began in approximately 1970 in the cangzhou area since then deep groundwater has been extracted with high intensity resulting in a continuous decline in the confined water head since 2015 the exploitation of deep groundwater has been gradually controlled and the groundwater level has stopped falling and rebounded with the water source replacement effect of the south to north water transfer project and the implementation of relevant measures for the comprehensive treatment of overexploitation therefore the simulation period was set to 1970 2015 to reduce the influence of various subjective factors and analyze the natural change process of parameters in the process of land subsidence more clearly and intuitively some parameters in the study area were idealized in the experimental process such as the uniform treatment of groundwater abstraction intensity according to the statistics of groundwater withdrawal and water use published by local government departments the average pumping intensity of deep groundwater was 9 3 104 m3 a km2 or 2 5 10 4 m3 d m2 in the subsiding center the cangzhou city area from 1970 to 2015 to more accurately simulate the parameter change process and account for the computer operation rate the simulation used a uniform time step t of 4 d and the deep groundwater abstraction was taken as the control variable at a constant rate the amount of pumping at each time step vz which is represented by the pure water height can thus be calculated as 0 001 m the model parameters were fixed or variable as described in table 1 before groundwater was exploited and utilized the hydraulic head difference between the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifer was 0 h u h c and no leakage occurred in the first time step δh was calculated using v z and the initial values of the storage coefficients assuming no leakage the parameters were then updated using δh and entered in the next simulation step coefficient c in eq 11 was estimated using the initial values of the hydraulic conductivity and void ratio of the clay layer and assumed to be constant in the simulation the interannual variation in the phreatic water level can be divided into two stages in the cangzhou city area from 1970 to 2005 the average annual decline rate of the phreatic water level was about 0 18 m a and from 2005 to 2015 the interannual variation in the phreatic water level was very small and stable fig 4 3 results of model identification 3 1 decreases in hydraulic parameters during the 45 years of land subsidence simulation the confined aquifer was compressed by 0 70 m with a thickness decrease of approximately 1 the void ratio decreased by 1 8 from 0 6 to 0 589 and the elastic storage coefficient decreased by 39 from 0 022 to 0 013 in addition the reduction rate of the thickness void ratio and elastic storage coefficient decreased fig 5 because the compaction of a confined aquifer is dominated by elastic deformation the thickness void ratio and elastic storage coefficient can be restored when the confined water level is recovered by seasonal replenishment the changes in the thickness b void ratio e and the related hydraulic parameters of the aquitard including the inelastic storage coefficient s kv and hydraulic conductivity k during the 44 years of compaction are as follows fig 6 the aquitard was compressed by 2 12 m and the thickness decreased by approximately 2 8 the void ratio decreased by 5 1 from 1 3 to 1 234 the inelastic storage coefficient decreased by 39 from 0 069 to 0 042 and the vertical hydraulic conductivity decreased by 20 4 from 0 0003 to 0 00023 m d during aquitard compaction the reduction rates of thickness void ratio inelastic storage coefficient and vertical hydraulic conductivity coefficient decreased because aquitard compaction was mainly unrecoverable inelastic deformation even if the confined water level is restored the related hydraulic parameters of the aquitard cannot be restored which represents permanent damage to the aquifer system a comparison of the simulation results of the confined aquifer and aquitard showed that the changes in the aquitard were much larger than those in the confined aquifer table 2 3 2 changes in pumping components although the exploitation rate was set to remain uniform during the simulation the three components of deep groundwater abstraction changed owing to hydraulic parameter changes this effect was analyzed with respect to the changes in the pumping rate and cumulative amount of pumping during the simulation v e and v v gradually decreased and v y gradually increased fig 7 at the end of the simulation v e and v v decreased by 54 and v y increased from approximately 0 to 0 0005 m the percentage of elastic confined aquifer drainage p e decreased from 24 2 to 11 2 and the percentage of inelastic aquitard drainage groundwater abstraction was composed primarily of the water released from aquifer compaction with the compacted deformation of the aquifer system the elastic and inelastic drainage gradually decreased at a slowing rate which coincides with the variation law of the elastic and inelastic storage coefficients mentioned above however the leakage recharge water clearly increased which is opposite to the variation law of the vertical hydraulic conductivity this is because the decrease in hydraulic conductivity was very small while the head difference between the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifer increased thus the leakage recharge increased gradually the variation trends of the cumulative amount of elastic confined aquifer drainage v e sum inelastic aquitard drainage v v sum and leakage v y sum which constitute the cumulative groundwater abstraction quantity v z sum also show clear changing trends as shown in fig 8 with the exploitation of deep groundwater v e sum v v sum and v y sum increased gradually with v e sum and v v sum increasing at a slower rate however v y sum increased at an accelerating rate the proportion of cumulative elastic confined aquifer drainage to the cumulative groundwater abstraction quantity p e sum decreased from 24 2 to 17 1 the proportion of cumulative inelastic aquitard drainage p v sum decreased from 75 8 to 53 5 and the proportion of cumulative leakage recharge p y sum increased from 0 to 29 4 the simulation results reveal that inelastic aquitard drainage was the main component of the deep groundwater abstraction in the study area during the historical period followed by leakage from the phreatic aquifer therefore the inelastic storage coefficient was the most important parameter and can be used to characterize the water supply capacity of aquifer system after land subsidence the reduction in the inelastic storage coefficient could not be restored this means that even if the groundwater level can recover to some extent aquifer storage loss due to inelastic compaction cannot recover and the water supply capacity is permanently reduced the reliability of the study results can be verified as follows the simulated compacted deformation of the aquifer system was comparable to the monitored land subsidence in the cangzhou land subsidence center the actual monitoring value of the accumulated land subsidence was 2000 2600 mm while the simulated results showed that the inelastic compacted deformation was 2120 mm and the elastic compacted deformation was 680 mm the proportion of deep groundwater abstraction calculated by previous researchers according to the water balance and other methods was used to verify the simulated proportion of groundwater abstraction based on previous research using empirical values of hydraulic parameters elastic confined aquifer drainage accounts for 10 25 of the total exploitation inelastic water release accounts for 35 45 and leakage recharge accounts for 30 50 in cangzhou zhu and guo 2014 zhang et al 2009 according to this simulation from 1972 to 2015 the cumulative elastic confined aquifer drainage accounted for 17 1 inelastic aquitard drainage accounted for 53 5 and leakage recharge accounted for 29 4 in the cangzhou subsidence center 4 implications for the regional aquifer system 4 1 spatial decrease of aquitard storage parameter the inelastic storage coefficient of the aquitards s kv is an important parameter for characterizing the water storage capacity and water supply capacity of the aquifer system concurrently this parameter changes irreversibly with land subsidence therefore monitoring changes in the inelastic water release coefficient is particularly important for groundwater resource management and water resource security the inelastic storage coefficient of aquitards can be obtained by laboratory tests strain stress analysis of in situ measured deformation and hydraulic pressure and the parameter inversion technique however it is difficult and costly to investigate the dynamic changes in the inelastic storage coefficient owing to a lack of historical records because changes in the inelastic storage coefficient depend on the compaction of the aquitard their relationship can be established as a very complex mathematical equation based on physical mechanisms as this equation involves some variation parameters it is difficult to directly monitor the variation in the inelastic storage coefficient in this study a simple fitted equation based on the simulation results was substituted for the complex mathematical equation the relationship curve between the loss of the inelastic storage coefficient s kv and land subsidence b was represented using power linear and polynomial regression models fig 9 all three regression models obtained a correlation coefficient r of 0 99 however visually inspecting the linear and power regression curves shows an overestimation of s kv near the two ends of the curve but an underestimation in the middle the polynomial relationship between s kv and b is 13 s kv 0 0012 b 2 0 0151 b 0 0004 the coefficients of the relationship function should be determined solely based on the geomechanical properties therefore this polynomial regression model can be used to estimate the regional distribution of skv assuming no significant changes in geomechanical properties the differences in hydrogeological bars are small across the cangzhou region fig 3 therefore the polynomial regression model for the cangzhou urban area can be extended to the entire region based on the spatially monitored accumulative land subsidence in the cangzhou area fig 1 the spatial distribution of s kv was estimated to range from 0 005 to 0 032 fig 10 the value of s kv is large in the central and western regions ranging from 0 015 to 0 032 and small in the east ranging from 0 005 to 0 011 4 2 permanent reduction of deep groundwater supply capacity a decrease in the storage coefficient indicates a reduction in the water supply capacity of the aquifer system the reduction in the inelastic storage of the aquitard or the reduction in the groundwater supply capacity can be calculated as 14 q s kv a h where q is the change in the inelastic aquitard storage s kv is the change in the inelastic storage coefficient a is the subsiding area and h is the groundwater level decline the area weighted average of s kv was 0 0158 over the cangzhou area according to the eq 14 this means that the volume of water that can be pumped per 1 m decline of groundwater level decreased by 0 2 billion m3 compared with the rate that could be achieved 45 years ago this loss of supply capacity cannot be restored even if the groundwater level can be restored to its initial condition in the future therefore the water supply capacity of the aquifer system was permanently reduced under the same water level drop conditions 4 3 permanent loss of deep groundwater storage resources the contribution of the inelastic storage loss to pumping was estimated using a synthetic model based on this estimation and groundwater abstraction information the variation in the inelastic aquitard drainage can be determined for different periods fig 11 by 2015 the cumulative amount of inelastic aquitard drainage was 9 41 billion m3 in the cangzhou area this inelastic aquitard drainage caused a permanent loss of groundwater storage resources because the proportion of inelastic aquitard drainage in the total abstraction at the land subsidence center was smaller than in other subsiding regions 9 41 billion m3 may underestimate for the actual case the aquitard drainage in eastern cangzhou was estimated to be approximately 6 50 billion m3 from 1965 to 2010 based on insar derived land subsidence jiang et al 2018 the subsiding volume estimated based on leveling measurements was approximately 10 07 billion m3 in the cangzhou area from 1970 to 2010 zhu and guo 2014 the estimates of permanent storage loss using several methods are comparable in magnitude indicating that permanent loss in groundwater storage has become a critical issue in this region a compressed aquifer system can neither absorb nor release as much water as it did originally therefore the loss of water storage capacity in aquitards acutely affects the security of regional water resources by 1 reducing the storage capacity of the aquifer system and increasing the risk of flooding and 2 reducing the emergency water supply security capacity of the underground aquifer system which may further increase the risk of ground subsidence when drought intensifies over the past century land subsidence due to groundwater depletion occurred at 200 locations in 34 countries based on incomplete data this includes the united states china japan mexico indonesia the netherlands italy and other countries herrera garcia et al 2021a 2021b in china the main sedimentary basins such as the yangtze river delta region ncp and fenwei basin are the primary areas affected by land subsidence the maximum cumulative land subsidence in cities such as tianjin and xi an exceeded 3000 mm and was more severe than that in cangzhou in north america intense groundwater pumping has triggered subsidence from california s central valley to the us atlantic and gulf coastal plain with up to 9000 mm of subsidence in the past century in cangzhou land subsidence caused a permanent loss of 9 41 billion m3 of water storage capacity on just 14 000 km2 of land it is clear that the global impact of land subsidence on the water storage capacity of aquifer systems is very serious land subsidence poses a significant threat to global water security 5 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to quantify the variations in parameters during compression and the permanent loss of groundwater storage resources and storage capacity caused by land subsidence this had not been fully investigated in groundwater management although the method proposed in this study has several limitations it can be used to quantify the non linear compaction process and provide an effective tool for evaluating its effects on groundwater management based on the physical mechanism of water release from aquifer system compaction a one dimensional non linear soil compaction model was constructed the model coupled the changes in the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity and was applied to a typical subsiding region the law of non linear variation of hydraulic parameters and loss of water supply capacity caused by land subsidence with deep groundwater overexploitation were explored the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the simulation results show that the void ratio storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity gradually decreased but the rate of decrease was slowing in the cangzhou subsidence center the inelastic storage coefficient decreased by 39 with a land subsidence of approximately 2 m in the entire cangzhou area the decrease of inelastic storage coefficient was approximately 0 005 0 032 which resulted in a reduction of 0 2 billion m3 of deep groundwater supply capacity per 1 m of further water level decline 2 when the exploitation intensity of deep groundwater remains constant water release from aquitard inelastic compaction and confined aquifer elastic compaction gradually decrease but leakage from the phreatic aquifer gradually increases from 1970 2015 the proportion of aquitard drainage decreased from 76 to 35 and cumulative aquitard drainage accounted for 54 of total deep groundwater production in the cangzhou subsidence center concurrently according to the proportion of aquitard drainage and the cumulative deep groundwater abstraction the permanent loss of groundwater storage resources is estimated to be 9 41 billion m3 for the entire cangzhou area 3 although the simulation study is based only on the specific cangzhou area the observed reduction in deep groundwater supply capacity and groundwater storage resources caused by land subsidence is a common phenomenon in areas with serious land subsidence the impacts of these decreases in aquifer storage capacity are serious and long lasting therefore in addition to the geological hazards caused by land subsidence managers and scholars should carefully consider these issues which were previously ignored credit authorship

7816,study region the study area was the cangzhou area in the central eastern north china plain ncp study focus compaction of the aquifer system leads to a change in hydraulic parameters including the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity this further reduces its groundwater storage and supply capacity this study aimed to evaluate the non linear variation in hydraulic parameters and feedback to the aquifer system during land subsidence the aquifer system in cangzhou has suffered severe land subsidence caused by groundwater overexploitation and was chosen to demonstrate this effect a one dimensional non linear compaction and water drainage model was developed considering the changes in the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity new hydrological insights based on the physical characteristics of the cangzhou aquifer system a compaction model was applied to establish a quantitative relationship between deep groundwater abstraction hydraulic parameter change groundwater storage and supply capacity change during land subsidence results show that the inelastic storage coefficient was reduced by 0 005 0 032 for the deep aquifer system in the subsiding area this represents a reduction of 220 million m3 of groundwater that can be exploited per meter decline in the confined water level the permanent loss of groundwater storage capacity is estimated to be 9 41 billion m3 these research results have important reference significance for the scientific evaluation of aquifer water supply capacity change in subsiding regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords land subsidence storage coefficient non linear compaction groundwater supply capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the development and utilization of water resources through human production activities have seriously disrupted the global water cycle as the most reliable water resource particularly in arid areas groundwater supports local social and economic development more than 43 of the world s agricultural irrigation water comes from groundwater siebert et al 2010 because of the lack of surface water resources groundwater resources have been overexploited for nearly 30 years causing acute land subsidence problems in some arid and semi arid areas such as california and the north china plain ncp longuevergne et al 2010 herrera garcia et al 2021a 2021b land subsidence severely restricts the sustainable development of the social economy and has a feedback effect on the groundwater system and water cycle bai et al 2022 the harm of land subsidence caused by the overexploitation of groundwater to infrastructure facilities and buildings has been well documented however no known studies have been conducted on the influence of land subsidence on groundwater flow and resources by changing hydraulic parameters and affecting the storage and supply capacity of the aquifer system the common research is to evaluate the available water resources of regional groundwater by setting land subsidence as constraint condition pang et al 2022 compaction of the aquifer system especially the aquitard and increases in effective pore pressure due to water level decline are the main causes of land subsidence the magnitude of storage coefficients and hydraulic conductivities depends on porosity and generally decreases with aquifer depth as sediment loading reduces porosity leake and galloway 2010 soil compaction leads to a reduction in porosity and changes in relevant hydraulic parameters among which the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity are the two key parameters in aquifer characterization burbey 2006 zhou et al 2013 when using kinetic models such as geotechnical or groundwater flow models to simulate land subsidence neglecting the variations in the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity can significantly overestimate the simulated land subsidence dassargues 1995 in an aquifer system composed of multiple aquifers and aquitards the vertical permeability of the system is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitards and the storage coefficient constitutes the elastic and inelastic storage coefficients neuman and witherspoon 1969 a decrease in the storage coefficient will further reduce the volume of water that can be stored in the aquifer or the aquifer storage capacity loáiciga 2008 and therefore will affect the water supply capacity of an aquifer system however these parameters are generally treated as constant values in groundwater resource assessments even though significant land subsidence has occurred the simulation of a subsiding aquifer system physically coupled with changes in hydraulic parameters has become a great challenge in hydrogeological research several studies have been conducted to analyze the variations in groundwater hydraulic parameters through laboratory geotechnical compression experiments rudolph and frind 1991 burbey 2006 kim 2007 a common discovery is that the void ratio storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity decrease gradually with compaction however the loading and pressure ranges applied in laboratory tests cannot accurately reflect the in situ field situation and complicated groundwater dynamics in a real world aquifer system to our knowledge few studies have been conducted to evaluate the changes in aquifer storage capacity and the risk to groundwater supply by applying dynamic stress strain theory the storage change in a compacted aquifer system can be attributed to recoverable and irrecoverable components a large proportion of the groundwater abstraction comes from the aquitard drainage which is inelastic irrecoverable because the inelastic storage coefficient can be several orders of magnitude larger than the elastic one therefore inelastic aquitard drainage is a one time consumption causing a permanent loss of deep groundwater storage resources konikow et al 2005 2007 wada et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 smith et al 2017 béjar pizarro et al 2017 groundwater storage changes caused by groundwater abstraction have attracted considerable attention as a global groundwater depletion issue e g condon and maxwell 2019 at present there are two primary types of methods for evaluating regional groundwater storage changes estimation using traditional groundwater level monitoring or through a groundwater flow numerical model calibrated based on groundwater level measurements e g cao et al 2013 and the grace gravity satellite inversion method e g moiwo et al 2009 however it is difficult to distinguish between the recoverable and irrecoverable portions of groundwater storage changes if land subsidence is not explicitly simulated hydraulic parameter inversion and storage component separation were performed using insar data smith et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 this method also requires high resolution groundwater level and detailed hydrogeological data to perform parameter inversion which may limit its wide application the irreversible decrease in groundwater storage due to land subsidence represents a permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity and may also affect the groundwater recovery potential when conducting groundwater depletion control therefore the reduction in the storage capacity of the aquifer system after long term overexploitation has a significant impact on groundwater security and is a critical factor that should be considered in groundwater management the objective of this study was to quantitatively investigate the extent to which compacted drainage of the aquifer system can affect the groundwater hydraulic parameters the reduction in the water storage capacity of the aquifer system and the relevant permanent storage loss for this purpose a non linear compaction and drainage model coupled with varied parameters was constructed based on the one dimensional effective stress principle of terzaghi terzaghi 1925 the hydraulic conditions and representative parameter set were selected from the cangzhou area in the ncp which has been suffering from pumping resulting in land subsidence for approximately 100 years the simulation results were then used to evaluate their impact on the management of regional groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation of the dynamic response of the multi layer aquifer system to pumping we used a synthetic multilayer aquifer system fig 1 with following assumptions 1 groundwater abstraction from the deep groundwater was mainly composed of water released from the compacted confined aquifer compacted aquitard and leakage from the upper phreatic aquifer to the deep aquifer system without considering lateral flow 2 compaction release of the confined aquifer was mainly from elastic compaction and inelastic compaction was considered to be negligible 3 compaction release of the aquitard was mainly from inelastic compaction and elastic compaction was considered to be negligible 4 the deformation of the soil layer was uniform 5 the time lag of compaction of the aquitard was not considered and 6 the compression of porous media in the aquifer system was not considered based on the above model assumptions groundwater abstraction from the confined aquifer v z consists of three components groundwater flow from the elastic drainage of confined aquifer storage v e inelastic drainage of aquitard storage v v and leakage from the phreatic aquifer to the confined aquifer v y 1 v z v e v v v y the variations in the three components with time are of the greatest concern while the total pumping rate is constant these three components were calculated as the groundwater volume per unit area in a time step δt because the confined aquifer is mainly composed of sandy soil with low compressibility the deformation of the confined aquifer is mainly elastic when the effective stress is reduced to an initial value deformation can be restored in contrast the main component of aquitards is clay which has high compressibility when the effective stress increases inelastic or plastic deformation occurs which is large and mostly irrecoverable burbey 2006 hoffmann et al 2003a this permanent component of aquitard deformation was the focus of this study the storage removal from the aquitard can be simulated by the widely used aquitard drainage model e g helm 1976 leake and galloway 2007 based on the effective stress principle proposed by k terzaghi terzaghi 1925 the effective stress principle can be expressed as 2 σ σ μ where σ is the total stress applied on any plane of the saturated soil σ is the effective stress acting on the soil particle skeleton and μ is the pore water pressure the confined water head or pore water pressure decreased after the deep groundwater abstraction assuming a constant total stress the decrease in the pore water pressure is balanced by an increase in the effective stress on the soil skeleton the porous medium is then compressed which causes compaction of the aquitard and confined aquifer associated with water drainage the change in effective stress is the change in interstitial water pressure as shown in the following formulas 3 σ γ w h where γ w is the volume weight of water kn m3 h is the change in the confined water head m and σ is the change in effective stress kn m2 because aquitard compaction is assumed to be inelastic the changes between elastic and inelastic specific storage leake 1990 can be neglected therefore the inelastic aquitard drainage component is equal to the thickness change in magnitude during δt and can be calculated using the inelastic storage coefficient riley 1969 leake 1990 hoffmann et al 2003b as 4 v v b s kv h 5 s kv s skv b where s kv is the inelastic storage coefficient of the aquitard dimensionless s skv is the inelastic specific storage 1 m b is the thickness of the aquitard m and b is the change in the aquitard thickness during δt m the relationship between the inelastic specific storage and effective stress may be described according to leake and galloway 2007 as 6 s skv 0 434 c c r w σ 1 e where c c is the inelastic compression index dimensionless and e is the void ratio of clay soil in the aquitard the ratio b 1 e remained constant and the storage coefficient decreased as the effective stress increased the elastic confined aquifer drainage can be calculated by replacing the elastic storage coefficient in eq 5 with the inelastic storage coefficient as follows 7 v e d s ke h 8 s ke s ske d where s ke is the elastic storage coefficient dimensionless s ske is the elastic specific storage 1 m d is the thickness of the confined aquifer and d and δh are the changes in the aquifer thickness and hydraulic head during δt m respectively the relationship between the elastic specific storage and effective stress was described by leake and galloway 2007 as 9 s ske 0 434 c r γ w σ 1 e where c r is the elastic compression index dimensionless and e is the void ratio of the confined aquifer during each time step the change in aquifer aquitard thickness and water released from storage were calculated using the storage coefficient in the previous time step the storage coefficients were updated at the end of each time step using the updated effective stress the leakage from the phreatic aquifer to the deep aquifer system can be calculated assuming an equilibrium hydraulic gradient as follows 10 v y k t h u h c b hydraulic conductivity is determined by the void ratio taylor 1948 11 k c e n 1 e where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard m d h u and h c are the groundwater levels in the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifer respectively m c is a permeability parameter related to the plasticity index or shrinkage index of the soil m d and the exponent n is an empirical number generally set at 5 in thick aquitards leakage across the aquitard is generally delayed behind the decline in hydraulic head in adjacent aquifers the alternation of hydraulic heads gradually diffuses in the aquitard and leakage occurs until the change in head gradually affects the entire aquitard decreases in hydraulic diffusivity the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to specific storage due to consolidation can make this transient response period longer rudolph and frind 1991 for the modeling case in this study the aquitard has a discontinuous distribution with many thin interbeds and the time lag in each interbed can be very small in fact based on the thickness and typical storage coefficients of the aquitard in the ncp the case study area in section 2 2 the lag time was estimated to be approximately 3 5 years zuo and wan 2006 which is shorter than the time scale simulated in this study therefore the delayed drainage process was not simulated in the compaction model the altered flow conditions were not within the scope of this study 2 2 study area the cangzhou area is in the central and eastern portion of the ncp fig 2 on the eastern part of the eurasian plate and has an area of 14 000 km2 the climate is a typical semi arid continental monsoon type with four distinct seasons and concentrated rain in summer the annual average precipitation is 573 5 mm and the annual average pan evaporation is 1692 mm approximately three times the amount of precipitation the topography of cangzhou is flat and generally slightly higher in the southwest than in the northeast with elevations ranging from 2 to 20 m above sea level the quaternary strata in cangzhou fig 3 are rich in unconsolidated clay sized particles with a thickness of 400 500 m and can be divided into four water bearing layers from top to bottom zhang et al 2009 there are approximately 40 300 m thick saline brackish aquifers overlying freshwater aquifers in the aquifer system bai et al 2022 groundwater was mainly pumped from freshwater aquifers above the bottom of aquifer group iii which is poorly permeable and has weak lateral runoff recharge surface water and shallow freshwater resources are scarce in the cangzhou area with the development of the social economy deep groundwater must be exploited to support the rapidly increasing water demand from industry domestic and especially the agriculture sectors herrera garcia et al 2021a 2021b the cumulative exploitation of deep groundwater from 1970 to 2015 was approximately 18 billion m3 in this region with an average annual exploitation of 400 million m3 which has caused serious land subsidence by the end of 2015 the cangzhou area was one of the most critical subsidence areas in the ncp with a maximum cumulative subsidence exceeding 2000 mm and a cumulative settlement volume of 10 billion m3 the center of land subsidence accumulated subsidence of more than 2000 mm is in the urban area of cangzhou with a subsiding area of 3 14 km2 and a maximum cumulative subsidence of 2600 mm yunlong and xisheng 2019 2 3 model boundary conditions and parameters model parameters and boundary conditions were determined according to the hydrogeological setting in the cangzhou land subsidence center where acute land subsidence had occurred large scale development and utilization of deep groundwater began in approximately 1970 in the cangzhou area since then deep groundwater has been extracted with high intensity resulting in a continuous decline in the confined water head since 2015 the exploitation of deep groundwater has been gradually controlled and the groundwater level has stopped falling and rebounded with the water source replacement effect of the south to north water transfer project and the implementation of relevant measures for the comprehensive treatment of overexploitation therefore the simulation period was set to 1970 2015 to reduce the influence of various subjective factors and analyze the natural change process of parameters in the process of land subsidence more clearly and intuitively some parameters in the study area were idealized in the experimental process such as the uniform treatment of groundwater abstraction intensity according to the statistics of groundwater withdrawal and water use published by local government departments the average pumping intensity of deep groundwater was 9 3 104 m3 a km2 or 2 5 10 4 m3 d m2 in the subsiding center the cangzhou city area from 1970 to 2015 to more accurately simulate the parameter change process and account for the computer operation rate the simulation used a uniform time step t of 4 d and the deep groundwater abstraction was taken as the control variable at a constant rate the amount of pumping at each time step vz which is represented by the pure water height can thus be calculated as 0 001 m the model parameters were fixed or variable as described in table 1 before groundwater was exploited and utilized the hydraulic head difference between the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifer was 0 h u h c and no leakage occurred in the first time step δh was calculated using v z and the initial values of the storage coefficients assuming no leakage the parameters were then updated using δh and entered in the next simulation step coefficient c in eq 11 was estimated using the initial values of the hydraulic conductivity and void ratio of the clay layer and assumed to be constant in the simulation the interannual variation in the phreatic water level can be divided into two stages in the cangzhou city area from 1970 to 2005 the average annual decline rate of the phreatic water level was about 0 18 m a and from 2005 to 2015 the interannual variation in the phreatic water level was very small and stable fig 4 3 results of model identification 3 1 decreases in hydraulic parameters during the 45 years of land subsidence simulation the confined aquifer was compressed by 0 70 m with a thickness decrease of approximately 1 the void ratio decreased by 1 8 from 0 6 to 0 589 and the elastic storage coefficient decreased by 39 from 0 022 to 0 013 in addition the reduction rate of the thickness void ratio and elastic storage coefficient decreased fig 5 because the compaction of a confined aquifer is dominated by elastic deformation the thickness void ratio and elastic storage coefficient can be restored when the confined water level is recovered by seasonal replenishment the changes in the thickness b void ratio e and the related hydraulic parameters of the aquitard including the inelastic storage coefficient s kv and hydraulic conductivity k during the 44 years of compaction are as follows fig 6 the aquitard was compressed by 2 12 m and the thickness decreased by approximately 2 8 the void ratio decreased by 5 1 from 1 3 to 1 234 the inelastic storage coefficient decreased by 39 from 0 069 to 0 042 and the vertical hydraulic conductivity decreased by 20 4 from 0 0003 to 0 00023 m d during aquitard compaction the reduction rates of thickness void ratio inelastic storage coefficient and vertical hydraulic conductivity coefficient decreased because aquitard compaction was mainly unrecoverable inelastic deformation even if the confined water level is restored the related hydraulic parameters of the aquitard cannot be restored which represents permanent damage to the aquifer system a comparison of the simulation results of the confined aquifer and aquitard showed that the changes in the aquitard were much larger than those in the confined aquifer table 2 3 2 changes in pumping components although the exploitation rate was set to remain uniform during the simulation the three components of deep groundwater abstraction changed owing to hydraulic parameter changes this effect was analyzed with respect to the changes in the pumping rate and cumulative amount of pumping during the simulation v e and v v gradually decreased and v y gradually increased fig 7 at the end of the simulation v e and v v decreased by 54 and v y increased from approximately 0 to 0 0005 m the percentage of elastic confined aquifer drainage p e decreased from 24 2 to 11 2 and the percentage of inelastic aquitard drainage groundwater abstraction was composed primarily of the water released from aquifer compaction with the compacted deformation of the aquifer system the elastic and inelastic drainage gradually decreased at a slowing rate which coincides with the variation law of the elastic and inelastic storage coefficients mentioned above however the leakage recharge water clearly increased which is opposite to the variation law of the vertical hydraulic conductivity this is because the decrease in hydraulic conductivity was very small while the head difference between the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifer increased thus the leakage recharge increased gradually the variation trends of the cumulative amount of elastic confined aquifer drainage v e sum inelastic aquitard drainage v v sum and leakage v y sum which constitute the cumulative groundwater abstraction quantity v z sum also show clear changing trends as shown in fig 8 with the exploitation of deep groundwater v e sum v v sum and v y sum increased gradually with v e sum and v v sum increasing at a slower rate however v y sum increased at an accelerating rate the proportion of cumulative elastic confined aquifer drainage to the cumulative groundwater abstraction quantity p e sum decreased from 24 2 to 17 1 the proportion of cumulative inelastic aquitard drainage p v sum decreased from 75 8 to 53 5 and the proportion of cumulative leakage recharge p y sum increased from 0 to 29 4 the simulation results reveal that inelastic aquitard drainage was the main component of the deep groundwater abstraction in the study area during the historical period followed by leakage from the phreatic aquifer therefore the inelastic storage coefficient was the most important parameter and can be used to characterize the water supply capacity of aquifer system after land subsidence the reduction in the inelastic storage coefficient could not be restored this means that even if the groundwater level can recover to some extent aquifer storage loss due to inelastic compaction cannot recover and the water supply capacity is permanently reduced the reliability of the study results can be verified as follows the simulated compacted deformation of the aquifer system was comparable to the monitored land subsidence in the cangzhou land subsidence center the actual monitoring value of the accumulated land subsidence was 2000 2600 mm while the simulated results showed that the inelastic compacted deformation was 2120 mm and the elastic compacted deformation was 680 mm the proportion of deep groundwater abstraction calculated by previous researchers according to the water balance and other methods was used to verify the simulated proportion of groundwater abstraction based on previous research using empirical values of hydraulic parameters elastic confined aquifer drainage accounts for 10 25 of the total exploitation inelastic water release accounts for 35 45 and leakage recharge accounts for 30 50 in cangzhou zhu and guo 2014 zhang et al 2009 according to this simulation from 1972 to 2015 the cumulative elastic confined aquifer drainage accounted for 17 1 inelastic aquitard drainage accounted for 53 5 and leakage recharge accounted for 29 4 in the cangzhou subsidence center 4 implications for the regional aquifer system 4 1 spatial decrease of aquitard storage parameter the inelastic storage coefficient of the aquitards s kv is an important parameter for characterizing the water storage capacity and water supply capacity of the aquifer system concurrently this parameter changes irreversibly with land subsidence therefore monitoring changes in the inelastic water release coefficient is particularly important for groundwater resource management and water resource security the inelastic storage coefficient of aquitards can be obtained by laboratory tests strain stress analysis of in situ measured deformation and hydraulic pressure and the parameter inversion technique however it is difficult and costly to investigate the dynamic changes in the inelastic storage coefficient owing to a lack of historical records because changes in the inelastic storage coefficient depend on the compaction of the aquitard their relationship can be established as a very complex mathematical equation based on physical mechanisms as this equation involves some variation parameters it is difficult to directly monitor the variation in the inelastic storage coefficient in this study a simple fitted equation based on the simulation results was substituted for the complex mathematical equation the relationship curve between the loss of the inelastic storage coefficient s kv and land subsidence b was represented using power linear and polynomial regression models fig 9 all three regression models obtained a correlation coefficient r of 0 99 however visually inspecting the linear and power regression curves shows an overestimation of s kv near the two ends of the curve but an underestimation in the middle the polynomial relationship between s kv and b is 13 s kv 0 0012 b 2 0 0151 b 0 0004 the coefficients of the relationship function should be determined solely based on the geomechanical properties therefore this polynomial regression model can be used to estimate the regional distribution of skv assuming no significant changes in geomechanical properties the differences in hydrogeological bars are small across the cangzhou region fig 3 therefore the polynomial regression model for the cangzhou urban area can be extended to the entire region based on the spatially monitored accumulative land subsidence in the cangzhou area fig 1 the spatial distribution of s kv was estimated to range from 0 005 to 0 032 fig 10 the value of s kv is large in the central and western regions ranging from 0 015 to 0 032 and small in the east ranging from 0 005 to 0 011 4 2 permanent reduction of deep groundwater supply capacity a decrease in the storage coefficient indicates a reduction in the water supply capacity of the aquifer system the reduction in the inelastic storage of the aquitard or the reduction in the groundwater supply capacity can be calculated as 14 q s kv a h where q is the change in the inelastic aquitard storage s kv is the change in the inelastic storage coefficient a is the subsiding area and h is the groundwater level decline the area weighted average of s kv was 0 0158 over the cangzhou area according to the eq 14 this means that the volume of water that can be pumped per 1 m decline of groundwater level decreased by 0 2 billion m3 compared with the rate that could be achieved 45 years ago this loss of supply capacity cannot be restored even if the groundwater level can be restored to its initial condition in the future therefore the water supply capacity of the aquifer system was permanently reduced under the same water level drop conditions 4 3 permanent loss of deep groundwater storage resources the contribution of the inelastic storage loss to pumping was estimated using a synthetic model based on this estimation and groundwater abstraction information the variation in the inelastic aquitard drainage can be determined for different periods fig 11 by 2015 the cumulative amount of inelastic aquitard drainage was 9 41 billion m3 in the cangzhou area this inelastic aquitard drainage caused a permanent loss of groundwater storage resources because the proportion of inelastic aquitard drainage in the total abstraction at the land subsidence center was smaller than in other subsiding regions 9 41 billion m3 may underestimate for the actual case the aquitard drainage in eastern cangzhou was estimated to be approximately 6 50 billion m3 from 1965 to 2010 based on insar derived land subsidence jiang et al 2018 the subsiding volume estimated based on leveling measurements was approximately 10 07 billion m3 in the cangzhou area from 1970 to 2010 zhu and guo 2014 the estimates of permanent storage loss using several methods are comparable in magnitude indicating that permanent loss in groundwater storage has become a critical issue in this region a compressed aquifer system can neither absorb nor release as much water as it did originally therefore the loss of water storage capacity in aquitards acutely affects the security of regional water resources by 1 reducing the storage capacity of the aquifer system and increasing the risk of flooding and 2 reducing the emergency water supply security capacity of the underground aquifer system which may further increase the risk of ground subsidence when drought intensifies over the past century land subsidence due to groundwater depletion occurred at 200 locations in 34 countries based on incomplete data this includes the united states china japan mexico indonesia the netherlands italy and other countries herrera garcia et al 2021a 2021b in china the main sedimentary basins such as the yangtze river delta region ncp and fenwei basin are the primary areas affected by land subsidence the maximum cumulative land subsidence in cities such as tianjin and xi an exceeded 3000 mm and was more severe than that in cangzhou in north america intense groundwater pumping has triggered subsidence from california s central valley to the us atlantic and gulf coastal plain with up to 9000 mm of subsidence in the past century in cangzhou land subsidence caused a permanent loss of 9 41 billion m3 of water storage capacity on just 14 000 km2 of land it is clear that the global impact of land subsidence on the water storage capacity of aquifer systems is very serious land subsidence poses a significant threat to global water security 5 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to quantify the variations in parameters during compression and the permanent loss of groundwater storage resources and storage capacity caused by land subsidence this had not been fully investigated in groundwater management although the method proposed in this study has several limitations it can be used to quantify the non linear compaction process and provide an effective tool for evaluating its effects on groundwater management based on the physical mechanism of water release from aquifer system compaction a one dimensional non linear soil compaction model was constructed the model coupled the changes in the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity and was applied to a typical subsiding region the law of non linear variation of hydraulic parameters and loss of water supply capacity caused by land subsidence with deep groundwater overexploitation were explored the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the simulation results show that the void ratio storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity gradually decreased but the rate of decrease was slowing in the cangzhou subsidence center the inelastic storage coefficient decreased by 39 with a land subsidence of approximately 2 m in the entire cangzhou area the decrease of inelastic storage coefficient was approximately 0 005 0 032 which resulted in a reduction of 0 2 billion m3 of deep groundwater supply capacity per 1 m of further water level decline 2 when the exploitation intensity of deep groundwater remains constant water release from aquitard inelastic compaction and confined aquifer elastic compaction gradually decrease but leakage from the phreatic aquifer gradually increases from 1970 2015 the proportion of aquitard drainage decreased from 76 to 35 and cumulative aquitard drainage accounted for 54 of total deep groundwater production in the cangzhou subsidence center concurrently according to the proportion of aquitard drainage and the cumulative deep groundwater abstraction the permanent loss of groundwater storage resources is estimated to be 9 41 billion m3 for the entire cangzhou area 3 although the simulation study is based only on the specific cangzhou area the observed reduction in deep groundwater supply capacity and groundwater storage resources caused by land subsidence is a common phenomenon in areas with serious land subsidence the impacts of these decreases in aquifer storage capacity are serious and long lasting therefore in addition to the geological hazards caused by land subsidence managers and scholars should carefully consider these issues which were previously ignored credit authorship

7817,study region this study focuses on three data limited inland river basins in the arid hexi corridor northwest china study focus the lack of ground based observation data for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet usually limits the streamflow simulation this study explored the feasibility of using three gridded pet datasets gldas gleam and era5 to force the hydrologic model the hydrologic performance of these pet datasets was investigated using the hbv light model new hydrological insights for the region the results show that gleam performs best in estimating pet on both a daily and monthly scale gldas generally captures the seasonal variations and patterns well but shows a higher estimation in magnitude for the hydrological simulation all three pet datasets can be used as forcing data to drive the hbv light model as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values are greater than 0 64 during the validation period for the three pet inputs in the three basins the magnitude and temporal signal of pet forcing data do not significantly affect streamflow simulations of the hbv light the model mainly adjusts the water content of the soil box wcs to eliminate the efficiency loss caused by the pet magnitude difference to achieve the best simulation results graphical abstract ga1 keywords gridded potential evapotranspiration datasets accuracy evaluation hydrological applicability the hbv light data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction potential evapotranspiration pet determines the maximum evapotranspiration that can be achieved when the water supply is not limited under certain meteorological conditions it is an important forcing data for hydrological modeling bai et al 2016 the accurate estimation of pet is crucial for the calculation of the water balance in the basin and the simulation of hydrological processes vicente serrano et al 2014 in practice a lysimeter can be used to measure evapotranspiration directly liu et al 2013 however this method relies on time consuming and costly field observations jamshidi et al 2019b the distribution of evapotranspiration measurement stations is uneven and sparse resulting in the lack of representativeness of regional pet estimation ochege et al 2021 poor data availability limits the research and simulation of water cycle elements at the basin scale for some ungauged areas therefore some indirect methods such as penman monteith pm priestly taylor pt and hargreaves ha equations are widely used in many studies to calculate evapotranspiration sheffield et al 2012 however these methods are also limited by data availability such as pm requires multiple meteorological factors as the input data the acquisition of continuous climate data is challenging in many watersheds sörensson and ruscica 2018 with the development of satellite technology evapotranspiration can be obtained from satellite or reanalysis products indirect estimation of evapotranspiration based on different retrieval algorithms or models has been widely used in practice allam et al 2016 chao et al 2021 moshir panahi et al 2021 these products address the problem of determining the amount of evapotranspiration in areas where field observations are sparse their high spatial coverage with multiple time scales provides good feasibility for the use required for diverse purposes it should be noted that due to the use of different model algorithms and data sources there is a certain deviation between the gridded evapotranspiration product and the real value papadavid et al 2013 moreover the accuracy of different products in various hydro climate zones is also quite different hu et al 2015 jamshidi et al 2019a when applied to specific hydrological simulations the comparison is required to reduce the uncertainty of evapotranspiration products therefore it is essential to compare the differences between gridded pet datasets and their hydrological applications for specific regions especially for arid inland river basins where evapotranspiration is the main outgoing water flux to simulate streamflow more accurately some studies have investigated the effect of pet calculated by various methods on hydrological simulation seiller and anctil 2016 there is no consensus on which gridded pet dataset performs best in streamflow simulations several researchers have reported that the impact of pet inputs on the performance of rainfall runoff models seemed to be comparable samain and pauwels 2013 vazquez and feyen 2003 however some conflicting results have also been reported regarding the effects of pet input data on hydrological simulation it has also been shown that even though the pet calculated by different methods has a large deviation there is no noticeable efficiency loss in the streamflow modeling driven by different pet inputs aouissi et al 2016 geshnigani et al 2021 similar model performances were achieved when the pet input was calculated using different pet estimation methods jayathilake and smith 2021 moshir panahi et al 2021 as for pet inputs at different time scales oudin et al 2005 found that there is no significant difference between streamflow simulation driven by long term average pet and streamflow simulation driven by time varying pet estimates further it has been claimed that the effects of pet inputs on hydrological simulations show different patterns in water limited and energy limited areas jayathilake and smith 2021 for specific hydrometeorological regions the influence of pet inputs on model efficiency and parameterization needs to be further explored the hexi corridor is an important food production base and ecological barrier in northwest china with three main inland river basins namely the shiyang river basin syrb heihe river basin hhrb and shule river basin slrb accurate hydrological modeling is critical to the management of the region s water resources and pet is a key component in the watershed hydrologic cycle under the impact of different climate systems the response of streamflow to meteorological elements differs in the three watersheds therefore we selected the three typical representative watersheds for the integrity study of streamflow simulation in the hexi inland river basins the feasibility of gridded pet datasets over the three watersheds where meteorological stations are sparse needs to be assessed before performing the hydrological simulations the differences between various pet datasets at the basin scale were first evaluated due to the lack of reliable benchmarks the triple collocation analysis tca approach was used for estimating the error pattern of pet datasets the method could characterize the uncertainties of various land surface fields without reference data and has shown its robustness in assessing the performance of satellite soil moisture sm precipitation and terrestrial evapotranspiration datasets cao et al 2022 ochege et al 2021 the objectives of this study are to figure out the following questions firstly if there are significant differences between the gridded pet datasets for estimating pet in hexi inland river basins three widely used gridded pet products gldas era5 and gleam were selected the tca method was used in the evaluation of the three products to gain comparable results secondly whether different gridded pet datasets can be used to obtain satisfactory hydrological simulation results the hbv light hydrological model was driven by the three datasets to explore the hydrological applicability of these pet inputs the differences between the model performances for the three gridded pet datasets on daily and monthly time scales were assessed the proposed research was carried out in the three inland river basins located in the arid hexi corridor northwest china using the hbv light model over ten consecutive years 2006 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the upper reaches of the three inland river basins in the hexi corridor which are the dominant runoff formation area it extends from 36 30 n to 39 30 n and from 93 30 e to 103 00 e the three main inland river basins syrb hhrb slrb are distributed from east to west in the northern qilian mountains the rivers extend from their origin in qilian mountains to the downstream oases and farmlands the region is dominated by an arid continental climate with the annual precipitation increasing from west to east wang et al 2020 mean annual precipitation is approximately 235 2 mm in the upper reach of the slrb wu et al 2021 414 mm in the upper reach of the hhrb li et al 2014 and ranges from 300 to 600 mm in the upper reach of the syrb ma et al 2013 most of the precipitation occurs from june to september the annual mean temperature of the study area ranges from 5 8 to 9 3 c zhang et al 2015 there are complex landforms such as mountains snow cover glaciers and valleys in the three inland river basins forming a unique water cycle system in the arid regions evaporation is a key hydrological process in the inland water cycle and a large amount of water participates in the hydrological process through the water surface groundwater and surface evaporation in addition plant roots can absorb a certain amount of water from the soil and lose a large amount of water through transpiration 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 in situ input data the daily meteorological data recorded and released by the national meteorological information center nmic http data cma cn were collected from the three meteorological stations menyuan yeniugou and tuole the precipitation and air temperature of the menyuan yeniugou and tuole stations were used as the forcing data of the hbv light for streamflow simulation in the syrb the hhrb and the slrb respectively the upstream control stations of the syrb the hhrb and the slrb are jiutiaoling 37 52 n 102 03 e yingluoxia 38 14 n 100 11 e and changmabao 39 39 n 96 51 e respectively the daily streamflow series 2006 2015 from the three hydrological stations were derived from the water resources department of gansu province geographic data including digital elevation model dem data

stations in the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 2 gridded pet datasets three gridded pet datasets were evaluated in this study 1 the global land data assimilation system 2 1 gldas 2 1 product 2 the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 2b gleam v3 2b product 3 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5 era5 product the gleam is a process based model that independently estimates the different components of land evaporation forcing datasets of the gleam are mainly derived from satellite observations including precipitation surface soil moisture vegetation optical depth surface net radiation near surface air temperature and snow water equivalent data compared with other evapotranspiration products it uses only satellite based data and has easier data availability martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 the priestley taylor method is applied in the model to compute cover dependent pet in this study the latest version gleam v3 2b was derived from the website https www gleam eu with daily temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 degrees spatial resolution the gldas data has been produced by the cooperation of different institutes it estimates the weather data more accurately by combining satellite and ground based measurements such as the air temperature humidity precipitation surface pressure downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation and wind speed rodell et al 2004 the land surface states and fluxes were simulated using four widely used land surface models including noah mosaic vic variable infiltration capacity and clm community land model in this study the pet data of gldas noah025 3h with 0 25 0 25 degrees spatial resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution was used and obtained from the goddard earth science data and information service center ges disc website http disc sci gsfc nasa gov to be consistent with the time scale of other datasets the daily scale data were transformed from 3 hour interval data era5 is developed by the ecmwf and is the latest generation of european reanalysis using advanced modeling and data assimilation methods it uses higher quality near surface meteorological data and modern parameterizations of earth processes to accurately describe the climate albergel et al 2018 in this study the era5 land dataset that belongs to the era5 reanalysis was applied the publicly available era5 land dataset describes the processes of water and energy cycling on land through the downscaled atmospheric forcing data compared with satellite and ground based reference datasets the consistency of variables generated by era5 land makes it robust in many hydrological studies munoz sabater et al 2021 the pet data of era5 land was downloaded at the hourly temporal scale and with a spatial resolution of 0 1 degrees 2 3 methods 2 3 1 hbv light model the hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hbv model is a semi distributed hydrological model developed by bergström 1976 the hbv light model has an extended glacier routine based on the principle of the hbv model and has been extensively applied in many studies and projects seibert et al 2018 the hbv light model was selected because it only requires precipitation temperature and pet as input data which has a relatively low demand for model forcing data in ungauged areas the flexibility and robustness of the model in hydrological research have been reported in a wide range of physiographic and climatological regions gao et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2022 rientjes et al 2013 in the model a basin is divided into many specific zones according to the slope aspect and vegetation types of different elevation zones hydrological processes are simulated in each specific zone by considering the differences in snowmelt underlying surface and spatial distribution of precipitation the three inland river basins are divided into elevation bands at vertical intervals of 200 m in spatial and two vegetation classes glacier and non glacial areas in each elevation zone the hbv light model consists of four routines snow soil moisture response and river routing the snow routine simulates the snow water equivalent and glacial melt based on a degree day factor the soil moisture routine simulates the groundwater recharge and actual evapotranspiration and runoff formation is controlled by the water storage in two groundwater reservoirs in this routine the response routine redirects excess water from the soil layer to outflow to each sub basin using three linear reservoir equations computed discharge is determined by a triangular weighting function in the routing routine more detail about the description of the hbv light can be referred to seibert 1997 the model was calibrated using the monte carlo method with the nse being adopted as the objective function as the research focused on the impact of different gridded pet datasets on the streamflow simulation performance the same parameter ranges were used for each model run in the calibration period for different gridded pet products and watersheds the hbv light was first calibrated using 10000 randomly generated parameter combinations then the parameter set corresponding to the highest nse was chosen to simulate the streamflow the year 2006 was selected as the model warm up period the model was then calibrated in the period 2007 2011 and was validated in the period 2012 2015 the range of the model parameters applied is shown in table 1 the initial range of two sensitive parameters threshold temperature tt and degree day factor cfmax is determined based on chen et al 2014 and zhang et al 2019 respectively who have conducted relevant research in the study area the initial range of the remaining model parameters is determined based on the existing studies finger et al 2015 seibert et al 2000 seibert and vis 2012 2 3 2 triple collocation approach the triple collocation method can assess the random errors of three unbiased datasets the principle of tca is based on a linear error model which can be expressed by the following equation 1 x i α i β i t ε i where x i is the ith pet dataset for i 1 2 3 t donates the true value of pet α i and β i represent the regression coefficients between the ith dataset and the true value ε i represents the random error the error ε i in eq 1 is estimated by finding the covariance between the datasets the application of the tca requires the following underlying assumptions to be met the mean value of the error of each dataset should be zero e ε i 0 the errors of the three data sets are independent of the true values cov ε i t 0 and the errors of the three data sets are independent of each other cov ε i ε j 0 when i j therefore the covariance between each two pet data sets q ij can be calculated as 2 q i j c o v x i x j β i β j σ 2 t q i i σ 2 x i β i 2 σ 2 t σ 2 ε i by solving eq 2 the error variance of the three pet datasets can be calculated as 3 σ 2 ε 1 q 11 q 12 q 13 q 23 σ 2 ε 2 q 22 q 12 q 23 q 13 σ 2 ε 3 q 33 q 13 q 23 q 12 2 3 3 evaluation criteria in this study to compare the difference and consistency of the daily and monthly pet datasets the evaluation statistic pearson correlation coefficient cc was adopted the cc reflects the degree of fit the optimal value is 1 the statistic is calculated as eq 4 4 c c i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the ith pet dataset for i 1 2 3 x is the mean of the pet dataset y i is the pet from the three gridded pet datasets y is the mean of pet from the three gridded pet datasets n is the number of observations to evaluate the performance of the hbv light model using different gridded pet products as model inputs we selected the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r 2 and percent bias pbias as objective functions nse measures the model s overall fitting degree between the modeled and observed datasets which is sensitive to extreme values of series to be evaluated the range of values for nse is between and 1 a value of 1 represents the highest fitting degree of the two series according to the performance ratings proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the simulation results are satisfactory when 0 5 nse 0 65 and the model performs well when nse 0 65 the pbias measures the mean tendency of the simulation results to be overestimated or underestimated compared with the observed counterparts a value of 0 donates a perfect match r 2 donates the agreement between the simulation results and observations and the optimum value is 1 the corresponding eqs 5 7 are shown as follows 5 n s e 1 i 1 n q o b s q s i m 2 i 1 n q o b s q o b s 2 6 p b i a s i 1 n q s i m q o b s i 1 n o o b s 100 7 r 2 i 1 n q o b s q o b s q s

simulated streamflow and n is the total number of days 3 results 3 1 comparison of the three pet datasets the comparison was conducted at the watershed scale by extracting the basin averaged daily and monthly pet values from the era5 gleam and gldas datasets to investigate the magnitude and temporal variation of different pet datasets a time series of pet from different datasets was compared in the three inland river basins from 2006 to 2015 the pet values from the three datasets were plotted against the day of the year doy fig 2 it can be observed that the daily average values of the three pet datasets in the three inland river basins show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the year in the three inland river basins the average annual pet values estimated by the era5 gleam and gldas datasets are 695 720 536 825 and 1363 1588 mm respectively gldas produces the highest pet values compared with the other two datasets in each watershed among the three datasets the era5 and gleam exhibit relatively better agreement in magnitude to further investigate the differences between the three pet datasets we also compared the behavior of pet datasets on a monthly scale comparative graphs were plotted for the three basins in fig 3 it can be observed that the interannual variability of monthly pet derived from the three pet datasets is consistent the pet values are high during summer and low in winter the performance of three pet datasets in different months shows a similar pattern with the daily time scale the pet starts to increase in january and reaches maximum values in july after the peak period pet decreases until reaching a minimum at the end of december compared with the gleam and era5 the gldas shows the highest pet values each month tca relies on the datasets being linearly related to test this the scatterplot of the three pet datasets is plotted to investigate the correlation between different datasets on a daily time scale fig 4 the cc values of the three datasets are equal to or higher than 0 88 indicating good coherence between the three pet datasets the cc between the era5 and gleam is relatively higher on a monthly time scale fig 5 the cc between different pet datasets each month is all greater than 0 94 indicating that the three pet datasets are in good agreement with each other it demonstrated that although gldas yields higher pet compared with era5 and gleam datasets in magnitude the trend and variability are particularly well captured triple collocation errors were calculated using the three pet datasets to evaluate the accuracy of estimating pet the daily and monthly estimates acquired from 2006 to 2015 were used to build the model as shown in table 2 the estimated errors in the era5 gleam and gldas on a daily time scale were 0 40 0 56 0 34 0 41 and 0 39 0 57 respectively and the corresponding values for the monthly datasets were 7 18 11 91 2 97 4 38 and 6 08 9 48 respectively the errors in the era5 and gldas were greater than that of the gleam dataset either based on daily values or monthly values thus the gleam dataset better estimated the pet spatially the mean error for the daily datasets is 0 38 for the slrb 0 44 for the hhrb and 0 51 for the syrb and the corresponding values for the monthly datasets were 5 72 7 29 and 7 80 respectively the slrb is characterized by a relatively low error based on the tca method followed by the hhrb and the syrb overall the gleam achieves good accuracy in estimating pet based on the tca the pet values estimated by gldas are greater than the gleam and the era5 however the cc between the gldas and the other two datasets is relatively high indicating that the three datasets are consistent in capturing the seasonal variation for pet in the three watersheds 3 2 effects of pet inputs on streamflow simulation to investigate the most suitable pet dataset for rainfall runoff modeling the three pet datasets obtained gldas gleam and era5 were used as the input of the hbv light model to reproduce streamflow the hydrographs and model efficiency during the calibration and validation period using the three daily pet datasets for the three basins were presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it can be observed that the hbv light hydrological model presents good performances in streamflow simulations for all used pet datasets the magnitude and temporal variation of predicted daily streamflow forced by the three pet datasets closely match with observed streamflow values these results indicate that the hbv light can be used for streamflow simulation in the arid hexi corridor the model presents satisfactory goodness of fit with high values of nse ranging from 0 65 to 0 76 in the three basins gldas and gleam have the lowest nse in the syrb with the nse value of 0 65 while era5 obtains the highest performance in slrb with the nse value of 0 76 the r 2 between the observed and modeled hydrographs is greater than 0 68 in three basins gleam performs worst in the syrb with an r 2 value of 0 68 while gldas and gleam achieve the highest value of 0 82 in the hhrb with respect to the pbias the three pet datasets show relatively high underestimations in hhrb with the pbias ranging from 32 21 to 22 59 while slightly overestimating the total streamflow volume in slrb and syrb during the validation period with the pbias ranging from 0 03 to 16 55 the pbias of era5 in three basins is the lowest 3 13 22 59 and 0 03 in slrb hhrb and syrb respectively during the validation period for the three different watersheds the performance of era5 is slightly better than the other two gridded pet datasets with higher nse and lower pbias in the three inland river basins in general the model obtains better performances in simulating the streamflow in the slrb and hhrb than in the syrb during the validation period within the same watershed the hbv light model shows a similar pattern driven by the three pet datasets the difference in nse between the best simulation results and the worst is 0 04 0 05 and 0 04 in the slrb hhrb and syrb respectively indicating that differences in pet datasets did not significantly influence the results of the streamflow simulations we also used the long term mean monthly pet of the three datasets to drive the model to investigate whether the time scale of pet inputs has an impact on the simulation results the simulated and observed hydrographs and the model efficiency for all datasets in the three basins during the calibration and validation period are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively as shown in the figures the streamflow simulations driven by monthly pet also achieve good performance in the three basins the model performs well in the validation period with the nse ranging from 0 64 to 0 77 in the three basins gleam driven simulations perform best in the syrb while gldas driven simulations perform best in the slrb and era5 driven simulations obtain the best performance in the hhrb in terms of r 2 the lowest value in the three watersheds is 0 68 achieved by the era5 and gldas in the syrb with respect to pbias the three pet datasets show a relatively high underestimation in hhrb with the pbias ranging from 26 21 to 16 30 while presents overestimation in slrb with the pbias ranging from 4 59 to 12 09 in the syrb the era5 shows a slight overestimation with the pbias value of 2 28 while the remaining two datasets all present underestimations with the pbias ranging from 2 27 to 1 97 in contrast there is no significant difference between the streamflow forced by the era5 and the observed streamflow compared with the results of the streamflow simulation driven by daily pet the nse values of monthly pet driven simulations for era5 gldas and gleam change by 0 07 0 05 and 0 01 during the validation period in the slrb respectively the nse values change by 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 in the hhrb respectively and change by 0 05 0 04 and 0 03 in the syrb respectively the values of r 2 also have less variation the differences ranging from 0 03 to 0 03 in the three watersheds with respect to pbias the overestimation and underestimation showed by each dataset in slrb and hhrb are relatively consistent and all datasets show overestimation in slrb and underestimation in hhrb overall similar model performances are achieved when the streamflow simulations are driven by daily pet and monthly pet indicating that the time scale of pet inputs does not affect the model performance of the hbv light 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of pet datasets at the watershed scale actual evapotranspiration aet is calculated based on pet by considering soil moisture and land use xu and singh 2000 this paper compared the accuracy of three pet datasets gldas gleam era5 based on the tca method the results presented provide an important reference for the estimation of pet for the three inland river basins in the arid hexi corridor because errors in pet estimates are known to vary across climatic regions liu et al 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 zeng and cai 2016 the evaluation was conducted based on the estimated errors the results demonstrated that the pet values estimated by gldas are much higher than the gleam and era5 on a daily and monthly scale according to the tca method the estimated errors of gldas and era5 are greater than the gleam indicating that the gleam performs better in estimating pet it should be noted that the cc between gldas and the remaining two datasets is greater than 0 88 on both daily and monthly time scales indicating the three datasets are consistent in characterizing the variation of pet time series it implies that although the gldas yielded much higher pet compared with era5 and gleam in magnitude the trend and variability are particularly well captured some studies have also reported a similar overestimation of pet by gldas in china bai and liu 2018 the reasons for the uncertainty of the pet estimates may be due to differences in the accuracy of the forcing data and the model algorithms imbach et al 2010 ma et al 2015 westerhoff 2015 the three pet datasets used in this study are produced by different institutions and use different data sources the more accurate estimation of pet by gleam than by gldas may be due to the better precipitation employed by the gleam which matches well with the gauged measurements bai and liu 2018 moreover the jarvis based stomatal conduction equation is applied in the generation of gldas to parameterize the canopy conduction which is greatly affected by the soil water stress factor jarvis 1976 however the gldas uses the vapor pressure deficit vpd to reflect soil water stress for transpiration this may lead to large uncertainty in arid areas the default parameter settings of gldas are to achieve optimal simulations of multiple surface states and fluxes and pet is merely one of those variables this may cause the gldas product to have the largest discrepancy with the era5 and gleam these results confirm that different pet datasets perform inconsistently in the three inland river basins of the arid hexi corridor among which the gleam can be used as reliable data sources for pet estimation in hexi inland river basins with limited observations or sparse monitoring networks 4 2 impact of pet inputs on streamflow simulation pet plays an important role in water balance calculations for watersheds testing different pet datasets as model forcing data may provide insight into the significance of pet dynamics for streamflow predictions in the region to obtain more accurate streamflow simulations it is essential to examine simulated streamflow for different pet inputs the usefulness of gldas gleam and era5 as inputs for hydrological applications in the three inland river basins was investigated here results from the hydrological evaluation indicate that the selected pet datasets have good potential for hydrological modeling it is not necessary to use the complex pet estimated method when applying the hbv light for streamflow simulation which requires observations of multiple meteorological variables this is mainly due to the model presenting satisfactory goodness of fit with high values of nse ranging from 0 65 to 0 76 during the validation period in the three basins the era5 performs slightly better than the remaining two datasets with high nse and low pbias in the three basins it is worth mentioning that the pet value estimated by gldas is much higher on a daily scale while the pbias of streamflow simulations driven by daily gldas is between 30 32 16 55 the difference in magnitude between the three datasets did not lead to poor streamflow simulations in the three watersheds this demonstrates that the magnitude of the pet inputs does not significantly affect the streamflow simulations in order to explore the impact of the time scale of the pet forcing data on the model performance the simulations driven by the monthly pet of the three datasets were also conducted the results show that simulations driven by daily pet do not present significant differences compared with the results driven by monthly pet data satisfactory streamflow simulation results are obtained with the nse ranging from 0 64 to 0 77 during the validation period in the three basins when forced by the monthly pet it demonstrates that the temporal signal does not significantly influence the model performances of the hbv light these results are consistent with those of others fowler 2002 oudin et al 2005 spies et al 2015 who found that temporally varying pet forcing data do not certainly achieve better performances than long term mean pet inputs there are no significant improvements in model performance when replacing long term mean pet with temporally varying pet as inputs given different model structures andreassian et al 2004 the long term mean pet for a certain day of the year can be obtained from the temperature and its long term mean in the hbv light the daily pet series generated by the interpolation may have less difference from the daily pet within the identical watershed the nse and r 2 values of the streamflow simulations for the three datasets are relatively similar indicating the selection of the pet dataset does not significantly influence the simulated streamflow the pet input with higher accuracy does not necessarily improve the model efficiency this finding is in line with the studies of andersson 1992 and liden and harlin 2000 who reported that the hydrological model is insensitive to pet forcing data bai et al 2016 proposed that the streamflow simulations are not sensitive to pet inputs with significant differences may be attributed to two reasons 1 pet inputs themselves do not affect the model efficiency of streamflow simulations and 2 pet inputs affect streamflow simulations but the loss of model efficiency caused by pet inputs is eliminated in the process of parameter calibration so that the model performance was maximized it has been found that the pet data can greatly affect the streamflow simulation while the rainfall runoff model compensates for the loss of streamflow simulation efficiency caused by different pet inputs by model calibration here we also performed model experiments to explore the effect of input data and model parameters on the results of streamflow simulations the model parameters were first calibrated using the three pet inputs nine sets of optimal parameter combinations were obtained for the three datasets and the three watersheds then we substituted different pet inputs into the calibrated models and thus 27 hydrological simulations were performed in the three watersheds fig 10 shows the model efficiency of the model experiments during the calibration and validation periods the nse is chosen as the evaluation criterion to quantify the accuracy of the simulation results when the model parameters calibrated by the era5 dataset are fixed the nse obtained using the era5 gleam and gldas datasets as model inputs in the validation period are 0 76 0 52 and 0 68 in the slrb 0 75 0 75 and 0 39 in the hhrb and 0 69 0 69 and 0 60 in the syrb respectively when the model parameters calibrated by the gleam dataset are fixed the nse obtained using the era5 gleam and gldas datasets as model inputs in the validation period are 0 75 0 75 and 0 64 in the slrb 0 68 0 70 and 0 05 in the hhrb and 0 63 0 65 and 0 66 in the syrb respectively when the model parameters calibrated by the gldas dataset are fixed the nse obtained using the era5 gleam and gldas datasets as model inputs in the validation period are 0 47 0 23 and 0 72 in the slrb 0 67 0 65 and 0 71 in the hhrb and 0 33 0 44 and 0 65 in the syrb respectively the model efficiency obtained from different pet forcing data with the same set of parameters varies significantly the highest nse is achieved by the original pet dataset the results confirm the conclusion made by bai et al 2016 which is that the magnitude of pet forcing data has a significant effect on model performance while the hydrologic model compensates for the efficiency loss in the streamflow simulations resulting from the three pet inputs by model calibration it has been found that the sensitivity of hydrological simulations is related to the main hydrological processes nandakumar and mein 1997 we further explored the impacts of model calibration on the simulation of water balance components including the water content of the soil box wcs and actual evapotranspiration aet the time series of wcs and aet simulated by the three pet datasets on daily and monthly time scales in the three inland river basins are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively for the three basins with different pet inputs the simulations yielded similar aet both in magnitude and variability while large differences exist in the simulated values of wcs the wcs obtained using the gldas dataset as model input is lower than that obtained using the era5 and gleam datasets in all basins the parameter calibration may offset the impact of different pet inputs on streamflow simulations by adjusting the wcs 5 conclusions this study strives to investigate the accuracy and hydrological applicability of three gridded pet datasets for streamflow simulations in the three hexi inland river basins to fulfill this objective we first performed a comparison of the three pet products gldas gleam era5 to identify their consistencies and discrepancies in pet estimation then the three pet datasets were evaluated in predicting daily streamflow to investigate if the pet inputs affect the performance of streamflow simulation we reached the following conclusions 1 the gleam dataset has the best accuracy with relatively low estimated errors on both daily and monthly time scales according to the tca the glads estimates higher pet in magnitude but is consistent with era5 and gleam in characterizing the temporal variability of pet in the three watersheds 2 the three gridded pet datasets can be used as the pet input of the hbv light model when no meteorological observations are available to derive indirect pet estimates this finding confirms the feasibility of gridded pet datasets for streamflow simulations in ungauged areas 3 the hydrological modeling of the hbv light is less impacted by the magnitude of the pet input as the gldas with higher estimated errors did not lead to poor streamflow simulation in the three watersheds similar hydrological simulation results are obtained when using the temporally varying and long term mean pet datasets as the forcing data the temporal signal of the pet input also has little effect on the hydrological simulation of the hbv light 4 the simulations driven by different pet datasets exhibit the similar patterns the hbv light is not sensitive to the three pet inputs in the hexi inland river basins the parameter calibration of the model can make different pet inputs have a limited effect on the streamflow simulations to yield the same results for the pet datasets obtained from different sources the parameter calibration may eliminate model efficiency losses by adjusting the wcs credit authorship contribution statement chunlin wang methodology writing original draft visualization formal analysis

7817,study region this study focuses on three data limited inland river basins in the arid hexi corridor northwest china study focus the lack of ground based observation data for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet usually limits the streamflow simulation this study explored the feasibility of using three gridded pet datasets gldas gleam and era5 to force the hydrologic model the hydrologic performance of these pet datasets was investigated using the hbv light model new hydrological insights for the region the results show that gleam performs best in estimating pet on both a daily and monthly scale gldas generally captures the seasonal variations and patterns well but shows a higher estimation in magnitude for the hydrological simulation all three pet datasets can be used as forcing data to drive the hbv light model as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values are greater than 0 64 during the validation period for the three pet inputs in the three basins the magnitude and temporal signal of pet forcing data do not significantly affect streamflow simulations of the hbv light the model mainly adjusts the water content of the soil box wcs to eliminate the efficiency loss caused by the pet magnitude difference to achieve the best simulation results graphical abstract ga1 keywords gridded potential evapotranspiration datasets accuracy evaluation hydrological applicability the hbv light data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction potential evapotranspiration pet determines the maximum evapotranspiration that can be achieved when the water supply is not limited under certain meteorological conditions it is an important forcing data for hydrological modeling bai et al 2016 the accurate estimation of pet is crucial for the calculation of the water balance in the basin and the simulation of hydrological processes vicente serrano et al 2014 in practice a lysimeter can be used to measure evapotranspiration directly liu et al 2013 however this method relies on time consuming and costly field observations jamshidi et al 2019b the distribution of evapotranspiration measurement stations is uneven and sparse resulting in the lack of representativeness of regional pet estimation ochege et al 2021 poor data availability limits the research and simulation of water cycle elements at the basin scale for some ungauged areas therefore some indirect methods such as penman monteith pm priestly taylor pt and hargreaves ha equations are widely used in many studies to calculate evapotranspiration sheffield et al 2012 however these methods are also limited by data availability such as pm requires multiple meteorological factors as the input data the acquisition of continuous climate data is challenging in many watersheds sörensson and ruscica 2018 with the development of satellite technology evapotranspiration can be obtained from satellite or reanalysis products indirect estimation of evapotranspiration based on different retrieval algorithms or models has been widely used in practice allam et al 2016 chao et al 2021 moshir panahi et al 2021 these products address the problem of determining the amount of evapotranspiration in areas where field observations are sparse their high spatial coverage with multiple time scales provides good feasibility for the use required for diverse purposes it should be noted that due to the use of different model algorithms and data sources there is a certain deviation between the gridded evapotranspiration product and the real value papadavid et al 2013 moreover the accuracy of different products in various hydro climate zones is also quite different hu et al 2015 jamshidi et al 2019a when applied to specific hydrological simulations the comparison is required to reduce the uncertainty of evapotranspiration products therefore it is essential to compare the differences between gridded pet datasets and their hydrological applications for specific regions especially for arid inland river basins where evapotranspiration is the main outgoing water flux to simulate streamflow more accurately some studies have investigated the effect of pet calculated by various methods on hydrological simulation seiller and anctil 2016 there is no consensus on which gridded pet dataset performs best in streamflow simulations several researchers have reported that the impact of pet inputs on the performance of rainfall runoff models seemed to be comparable samain and pauwels 2013 vazquez and feyen 2003 however some conflicting results have also been reported regarding the effects of pet input data on hydrological simulation it has also been shown that even though the pet calculated by different methods has a large deviation there is no noticeable efficiency loss in the streamflow modeling driven by different pet inputs aouissi et al 2016 geshnigani et al 2021 similar model performances were achieved when the pet input was calculated using different pet estimation methods jayathilake and smith 2021 moshir panahi et al 2021 as for pet inputs at different time scales oudin et al 2005 found that there is no significant difference between streamflow simulation driven by long term average pet and streamflow simulation driven by time varying pet estimates further it has been claimed that the effects of pet inputs on hydrological simulations show different patterns in water limited and energy limited areas jayathilake and smith 2021 for specific hydrometeorological regions the influence of pet inputs on model efficiency and parameterization needs to be further explored the hexi corridor is an important food production base and ecological barrier in northwest china with three main inland river basins namely the shiyang river basin syrb heihe river basin hhrb and shule river basin slrb accurate hydrological modeling is critical to the management of the region s water resources and pet is a key component in the watershed hydrologic cycle under the impact of different climate systems the response of streamflow to meteorological elements differs in the three watersheds therefore we selected the three typical representative watersheds for the integrity study of streamflow simulation in the hexi inland river basins the feasibility of gridded pet datasets over the three watersheds where meteorological stations are sparse needs to be assessed before performing the hydrological simulations the differences between various pet datasets at the basin scale were first evaluated due to the lack of reliable benchmarks the triple collocation analysis tca approach was used for estimating the error pattern of pet datasets the method could characterize the uncertainties of various land surface fields without reference data and has shown its robustness in assessing the performance of satellite soil moisture sm precipitation and terrestrial evapotranspiration datasets cao et al 2022 ochege et al 2021 the objectives of this study are to figure out the following questions firstly if there are significant differences between the gridded pet datasets for estimating pet in hexi inland river basins three widely used gridded pet products gldas era5 and gleam were selected the tca method was used in the evaluation of the three products to gain comparable results secondly whether different gridded pet datasets can be used to obtain satisfactory hydrological simulation results the hbv light hydrological model was driven by the three datasets to explore the hydrological applicability of these pet inputs the differences between the model performances for the three gridded pet datasets on daily and monthly time scales were assessed the proposed research was carried out in the three inland river basins located in the arid hexi corridor northwest china using the hbv light model over ten consecutive years 2006 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the upper reaches of the three inland river basins in the hexi corridor which are the dominant runoff formation area it extends from 36 30 n to 39 30 n and from 93 30 e to 103 00 e the three main inland river basins syrb hhrb slrb are distributed from east to west in the northern qilian mountains the rivers extend from their origin in qilian mountains to the downstream oases and farmlands the region is dominated by an arid continental climate with the annual precipitation increasing from west to east wang et al 2020 mean annual precipitation is approximately 235 2 mm in the upper reach of the slrb wu et al 2021 414 mm in the upper reach of the hhrb li et al 2014 and ranges from 300 to 600 mm in the upper reach of the syrb ma et al 2013 most of the precipitation occurs from june to september the annual mean temperature of the study area ranges from 5 8 to 9 3 c zhang et al 2015 there are complex landforms such as mountains snow cover glaciers and valleys in the three inland river basins forming a unique water cycle system in the arid regions evaporation is a key hydrological process in the inland water cycle and a large amount of water participates in the hydrological process through the water surface groundwater and surface evaporation in addition plant roots can absorb a certain amount of water from the soil and lose a large amount of water through transpiration 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 in situ input data the daily meteorological data recorded and released by the national meteorological information center nmic http data cma cn were collected from the three meteorological stations menyuan yeniugou and tuole the precipitation and air temperature of the menyuan yeniugou and tuole stations were used as the forcing data of the hbv light for streamflow simulation in the syrb the hhrb and the slrb respectively the upstream control stations of the syrb the hhrb and the slrb are jiutiaoling 37 52 n 102 03 e yingluoxia 38 14 n 100 11 e and changmabao 39 39 n 96 51 e respectively the daily streamflow series 2006 2015 from the three hydrological stations were derived from the water resources department of gansu province geographic data including digital elevation model dem data

stations in the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 2 gridded pet datasets three gridded pet datasets were evaluated in this study 1 the global land data assimilation system 2 1 gldas 2 1 product 2 the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 2b gleam v3 2b product 3 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5 era5 product the gleam is a process based model that independently estimates the different components of land evaporation forcing datasets of the gleam are mainly derived from satellite observations including precipitation surface soil moisture vegetation optical depth surface net radiation near surface air temperature and snow water equivalent data compared with other evapotranspiration products it uses only satellite based data and has easier data availability martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 the priestley taylor method is applied in the model to compute cover dependent pet in this study the latest version gleam v3 2b was derived from the website https www gleam eu with daily temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 degrees spatial resolution the gldas data has been produced by the cooperation of different institutes it estimates the weather data more accurately by combining satellite and ground based measurements such as the air temperature humidity precipitation surface pressure downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation and wind speed rodell et al 2004 the land surface states and fluxes were simulated using four widely used land surface models including noah mosaic vic variable infiltration capacity and clm community land model in this study the pet data of gldas noah025 3h with 0 25 0 25 degrees spatial resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution was used and obtained from the goddard earth science data and information service center ges disc website http disc sci gsfc nasa gov to be consistent with the time scale of other datasets the daily scale data were transformed from 3 hour interval data era5 is developed by the ecmwf and is the latest generation of european reanalysis using advanced modeling and data assimilation methods it uses higher quality near surface meteorological data and modern parameterizations of earth processes to accurately describe the climate albergel et al 2018 in this study the era5 land dataset that belongs to the era5 reanalysis was applied the publicly available era5 land dataset describes the processes of water and energy cycling on land through the downscaled atmospheric forcing data compared with satellite and ground based reference datasets the consistency of variables generated by era5 land makes it robust in many hydrological studies munoz sabater et al 2021 the pet data of era5 land was downloaded at the hourly temporal scale and with a spatial resolution of 0 1 degrees 2 3 methods 2 3 1 hbv light model the hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hbv model is a semi distributed hydrological model developed by bergström 1976 the hbv light model has an extended glacier routine based on the principle of the hbv model and has been extensively applied in many studies and projects seibert et al 2018 the hbv light model was selected because it only requires precipitation temperature and pet as input data which has a relatively low demand for model forcing data in ungauged areas the flexibility and robustness of the model in hydrological research have been reported in a wide range of physiographic and climatological regions gao et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2022 rientjes et al 2013 in the model a basin is divided into many specific zones according to the slope aspect and vegetation types of different elevation zones hydrological processes are simulated in each specific zone by considering the differences in snowmelt underlying surface and spatial distribution of precipitation the three inland river basins are divided into elevation bands at vertical intervals of 200 m in spatial and two vegetation classes glacier and non glacial areas in each elevation zone the hbv light model consists of four routines snow soil moisture response and river routing the snow routine simulates the snow water equivalent and glacial melt based on a degree day factor the soil moisture routine simulates the groundwater recharge and actual evapotranspiration and runoff formation is controlled by the water storage in two groundwater reservoirs in this routine the response routine redirects excess water from the soil layer to outflow to each sub basin using three linear reservoir equations computed discharge is determined by a triangular weighting function in the routing routine more detail about the description of the hbv light can be referred to seibert 1997 the model was calibrated using the monte carlo method with the nse being adopted as the objective function as the research focused on the impact of different gridded pet datasets on the streamflow simulation performance the same parameter ranges were used for each model run in the calibration period for different gridded pet products and watersheds the hbv light was first calibrated using 10000 randomly generated parameter combinations then the parameter set corresponding to the highest nse was chosen to simulate the streamflow the year 2006 was selected as the model warm up period the model was then calibrated in the period 2007 2011 and was validated in the period 2012 2015 the range of the model parameters applied is shown in table 1 the initial range of two sensitive parameters threshold temperature tt and degree day factor cfmax is determined based on chen et al 2014 and zhang et al 2019 respectively who have conducted relevant research in the study area the initial range of the remaining model parameters is determined based on the existing studies finger et al 2015 seibert et al 2000 seibert and vis 2012 2 3 2 triple collocation approach the triple collocation method can assess the random errors of three unbiased datasets the principle of tca is based on a linear error model which can be expressed by the following equation 1 x i α i β i t ε i where x i is the ith pet dataset for i 1 2 3 t donates the true value of pet α i and β i represent the regression coefficients between the ith dataset and the true value ε i represents the random error the error ε i in eq 1 is estimated by finding the covariance between the datasets the application of the tca requires the following underlying assumptions to be met the mean value of the error of each dataset should be zero e ε i 0 the errors of the three data sets are independent of the true values cov ε i t 0 and the errors of the three data sets are independent of each other cov ε i ε j 0 when i j therefore the covariance between each two pet data sets q ij can be calculated as 2 q i j c o v x i x j β i β j σ 2 t q i i σ 2 x i β i 2 σ 2 t σ 2 ε i by solving eq 2 the error variance of the three pet datasets can be calculated as 3 σ 2 ε 1 q 11 q 12 q 13 q 23 σ 2 ε 2 q 22 q 12 q 23 q 13 σ 2 ε 3 q 33 q 13 q 23 q 12 2 3 3 evaluation criteria in this study to compare the difference and consistency of the daily and monthly pet datasets the evaluation statistic pearson correlation coefficient cc was adopted the cc reflects the degree of fit the optimal value is 1 the statistic is calculated as eq 4 4 c c i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the ith pet dataset for i 1 2 3 x is the mean of the pet dataset y i is the pet from the three gridded pet datasets y is the mean of pet from the three gridded pet datasets n is the number of observations to evaluate the performance of the hbv light model using different gridded pet products as model inputs we selected the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r 2 and percent bias pbias as objective functions nse measures the model s overall fitting degree between the modeled and observed datasets which is sensitive to extreme values of series to be evaluated the range of values for nse is between and 1 a value of 1 represents the highest fitting degree of the two series according to the performance ratings proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the simulation results are satisfactory when 0 5 nse 0 65 and the model performs well when nse 0 65 the pbias measures the mean tendency of the simulation results to be overestimated or underestimated compared with the observed counterparts a value of 0 donates a perfect match r 2 donates the agreement between the simulation results and observations and the optimum value is 1 the corresponding eqs 5 7 are shown as follows 5 n s e 1 i 1 n q o b s q s i m 2 i 1 n q o b s q o b s 2 6 p b i a s i 1 n q s i m q o b s i 1 n o o b s 100 7 r 2 i 1 n q o b s q o b s q s

simulated streamflow and n is the total number of days 3 results 3 1 comparison of the three pet datasets the comparison was conducted at the watershed scale by extracting the basin averaged daily and monthly pet values from the era5 gleam and gldas datasets to investigate the magnitude and temporal variation of different pet datasets a time series of pet from different datasets was compared in the three inland river basins from 2006 to 2015 the pet values from the three datasets were plotted against the day of the year doy fig 2 it can be observed that the daily average values of the three pet datasets in the three inland river basins show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the year in the three inland river basins the average annual pet values estimated by the era5 gleam and gldas datasets are 695 720 536 825 and 1363 1588 mm respectively gldas produces the highest pet values compared with the other two datasets in each watershed among the three datasets the era5 and gleam exhibit relatively better agreement in magnitude to further investigate the differences between the three pet datasets we also compared the behavior of pet datasets on a monthly scale comparative graphs were plotted for the three basins in fig 3 it can be observed that the interannual variability of monthly pet derived from the three pet datasets is consistent the pet values are high during summer and low in winter the performance of three pet datasets in different months shows a similar pattern with the daily time scale the pet starts to increase in january and reaches maximum values in july after the peak period pet decreases until reaching a minimum at the end of december compared with the gleam and era5 the gldas shows the highest pet values each month tca relies on the datasets being linearly related to test this the scatterplot of the three pet datasets is plotted to investigate the correlation between different datasets on a daily time scale fig 4 the cc values of the three datasets are equal to or higher than 0 88 indicating good coherence between the three pet datasets the cc between the era5 and gleam is relatively higher on a monthly time scale fig 5 the cc between different pet datasets each month is all greater than 0 94 indicating that the three pet datasets are in good agreement with each other it demonstrated that although gldas yields higher pet compared with era5 and gleam datasets in magnitude the trend and variability are particularly well captured triple collocation errors were calculated using the three pet datasets to evaluate the accuracy of estimating pet the daily and monthly estimates acquired from 2006 to 2015 were used to build the model as shown in table 2 the estimated errors in the era5 gleam and gldas on a daily time scale were 0 40 0 56 0 34 0 41 and 0 39 0 57 respectively and the corresponding values for the monthly datasets were 7 18 11 91 2 97 4 38 and 6 08 9 48 respectively the errors in the era5 and gldas were greater than that of the gleam dataset either based on daily values or monthly values thus the gleam dataset better estimated the pet spatially the mean error for the daily datasets is 0 38 for the slrb 0 44 for the hhrb and 0 51 for the syrb and the corresponding values for the monthly datasets were 5 72 7 29 and 7 80 respectively the slrb is characterized by a relatively low error based on the tca method followed by the hhrb and the syrb overall the gleam achieves good accuracy in estimating pet based on the tca the pet values estimated by gldas are greater than the gleam and the era5 however the cc between the gldas and the other two datasets is relatively high indicating that the three datasets are consistent in capturing the seasonal variation for pet in the three watersheds 3 2 effects of pet inputs on streamflow simulation to investigate the most suitable pet dataset for rainfall runoff modeling the three pet datasets obtained gldas gleam and era5 were used as the input of the hbv light model to reproduce streamflow the hydrographs and model efficiency during the calibration and validation period using the three daily pet datasets for the three basins were presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it can be observed that the hbv light hydrological model presents good performances in streamflow simulations for all used pet datasets the magnitude and temporal variation of predicted daily streamflow forced by the three pet datasets closely match with observed streamflow values these results indicate that the hbv light can be used for streamflow simulation in the arid hexi corridor the model presents satisfactory goodness of fit with high values of nse ranging from 0 65 to 0 76 in the three basins gldas and gleam have the lowest nse in the syrb with the nse value of 0 65 while era5 obtains the highest performance in slrb with the nse value of 0 76 the r 2 between the observed and modeled hydrographs is greater than 0 68 in three basins gleam performs worst in the syrb with an r 2 value of 0 68 while gldas and gleam achieve the highest value of 0 82 in the hhrb with respect to the pbias the three pet datasets show relatively high underestimations in hhrb with the pbias ranging from 32 21 to 22 59 while slightly overestimating the total streamflow volume in slrb and syrb during the validation period with the pbias ranging from 0 03 to 16 55 the pbias of era5 in three basins is the lowest 3 13 22 59 and 0 03 in slrb hhrb and syrb respectively during the validation period for the three different watersheds the performance of era5 is slightly better than the other two gridded pet datasets with higher nse and lower pbias in the three inland river basins in general the model obtains better performances in simulating the streamflow in the slrb and hhrb than in the syrb during the validation period within the same watershed the hbv light model shows a similar pattern driven by the three pet datasets the difference in nse between the best simulation results and the worst is 0 04 0 05 and 0 04 in the slrb hhrb and syrb respectively indicating that differences in pet datasets did not significantly influence the results of the streamflow simulations we also used the long term mean monthly pet of the three datasets to drive the model to investigate whether the time scale of pet inputs has an impact on the simulation results the simulated and observed hydrographs and the model efficiency for all datasets in the three basins during the calibration and validation period are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively as shown in the figures the streamflow simulations driven by monthly pet also achieve good performance in the three basins the model performs well in the validation period with the nse ranging from 0 64 to 0 77 in the three basins gleam driven simulations perform best in the syrb while gldas driven simulations perform best in the slrb and era5 driven simulations obtain the best performance in the hhrb in terms of r 2 the lowest value in the three watersheds is 0 68 achieved by the era5 and gldas in the syrb with respect to pbias the three pet datasets show a relatively high underestimation in hhrb with the pbias ranging from 26 21 to 16 30 while presents overestimation in slrb with the pbias ranging from 4 59 to 12 09 in the syrb the era5 shows a slight overestimation with the pbias value of 2 28 while the remaining two datasets all present underestimations with the pbias ranging from 2 27 to 1 97 in contrast there is no significant difference between the streamflow forced by the era5 and the observed streamflow compared with the results of the streamflow simulation driven by daily pet the nse values of monthly pet driven simulations for era5 gldas and gleam change by 0 07 0 05 and 0 01 during the validation period in the slrb respectively the nse values change by 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 in the hhrb respectively and change by 0 05 0 04 and 0 03 in the syrb respectively the values of r 2 also have less variation the differences ranging from 0 03 to 0 03 in the three watersheds with respect to pbias the overestimation and underestimation showed by each dataset in slrb and hhrb are relatively consistent and all datasets show overestimation in slrb and underestimation in hhrb overall similar model performances are achieved when the streamflow simulations are driven by daily pet and monthly pet indicating that the time scale of pet inputs does not affect the model performance of the hbv light 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of pet datasets at the watershed scale actual evapotranspiration aet is calculated based on pet by considering soil moisture and land use xu and singh 2000 this paper compared the accuracy of three pet datasets gldas gleam era5 based on the tca method the results presented provide an important reference for the estimation of pet for the three inland river basins in the arid hexi corridor because errors in pet estimates are known to vary across climatic regions liu et al 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 zeng and cai 2016 the evaluation was conducted based on the estimated errors the results demonstrated that the pet values estimated by gldas are much higher than the gleam and era5 on a daily and monthly scale according to the tca method the estimated errors of gldas and era5 are greater than the gleam indicating that the gleam performs better in estimating pet it should be noted that the cc between gldas and the remaining two datasets is greater than 0 88 on both daily and monthly time scales indicating the three datasets are consistent in characterizing the variation of pet time series it implies that although the gldas yielded much higher pet compared with era5 and gleam in magnitude the trend and variability are particularly well captured some studies have also reported a similar overestimation of pet by gldas in china bai and liu 2018 the reasons for the uncertainty of the pet estimates may be due to differences in the accuracy of the forcing data and the model algorithms imbach et al 2010 ma et al 2015 westerhoff 2015 the three pet datasets used in this study are produced by different institutions and use different data sources the more accurate estimation of pet by gleam than by gldas may be due to the better precipitation employed by the gleam which matches well with the gauged measurements bai and liu 2018 moreover the jarvis based stomatal conduction equation is applied in the generation of gldas to parameterize the canopy conduction which is greatly affected by the soil water stress factor jarvis 1976 however the gldas uses the vapor pressure deficit vpd to reflect soil water stress for transpiration this may lead to large uncertainty in arid areas the default parameter settings of gldas are to achieve optimal simulations of multiple surface states and fluxes and pet is merely one of those variables this may cause the gldas product to have the largest discrepancy with the era5 and gleam these results confirm that different pet datasets perform inconsistently in the three inland river basins of the arid hexi corridor among which the gleam can be used as reliable data sources for pet estimation in hexi inland river basins with limited observations or sparse monitoring networks 4 2 impact of pet inputs on streamflow simulation pet plays an important role in water balance calculations for watersheds testing different pet datasets as model forcing data may provide insight into the significance of pet dynamics for streamflow predictions in the region to obtain more accurate streamflow simulations it is essential to examine simulated streamflow for different pet inputs the usefulness of gldas gleam and era5 as inputs for hydrological applications in the three inland river basins was investigated here results from the hydrological evaluation indicate that the selected pet datasets have good potential for hydrological modeling it is not necessary to use the complex pet estimated method when applying the hbv light for streamflow simulation which requires observations of multiple meteorological variables this is mainly due to the model presenting satisfactory goodness of fit with high values of nse ranging from 0 65 to 0 76 during the validation period in the three basins the era5 performs slightly better than the remaining two datasets with high nse and low pbias in the three basins it is worth mentioning that the pet value estimated by gldas is much higher on a daily scale while the pbias of streamflow simulations driven by daily gldas is between 30 32 16 55 the difference in magnitude between the three datasets did not lead to poor streamflow simulations in the three watersheds this demonstrates that the magnitude of the pet inputs does not significantly affect the streamflow simulations in order to explore the impact of the time scale of the pet forcing data on the model performance the simulations driven by the monthly pet of the three datasets were also conducted the results show that simulations driven by daily pet do not present significant differences compared with the results driven by monthly pet data satisfactory streamflow simulation results are obtained with the nse ranging from 0 64 to 0 77 during the validation period in the three basins when forced by the monthly pet it demonstrates that the temporal signal does not significantly influence the model performances of the hbv light these results are consistent with those of others fowler 2002 oudin et al 2005 spies et al 2015 who found that temporally varying pet forcing data do not certainly achieve better performances than long term mean pet inputs there are no significant improvements in model performance when replacing long term mean pet with temporally varying pet as inputs given different model structures andreassian et al 2004 the long term mean pet for a certain day of the year can be obtained from the temperature and its long term mean in the hbv light the daily pet series generated by the interpolation may have less difference from the daily pet within the identical watershed the nse and r 2 values of the streamflow simulations for the three datasets are relatively similar indicating the selection of the pet dataset does not significantly influence the simulated streamflow the pet input with higher accuracy does not necessarily improve the model efficiency this finding is in line with the studies of andersson 1992 and liden and harlin 2000 who reported that the hydrological model is insensitive to pet forcing data bai et al 2016 proposed that the streamflow simulations are not sensitive to pet inputs with significant differences may be attributed to two reasons 1 pet inputs themselves do not affect the model efficiency of streamflow simulations and 2 pet inputs affect streamflow simulations but the loss of model efficiency caused by pet inputs is eliminated in the process of parameter calibration so that the model performance was maximized it has been found that the pet data can greatly affect the streamflow simulation while the rainfall runoff model compensates for the loss of streamflow simulation efficiency caused by different pet inputs by model calibration here we also performed model experiments to explore the effect of input data and model parameters on the results of streamflow simulations the model parameters were first calibrated using the three pet inputs nine sets of optimal parameter combinations were obtained for the three datasets and the three watersheds then we substituted different pet inputs into the calibrated models and thus 27 hydrological simulations were performed in the three watersheds fig 10 shows the model efficiency of the model experiments during the calibration and validation periods the nse is chosen as the evaluation criterion to quantify the accuracy of the simulation results when the model parameters calibrated by the era5 dataset are fixed the nse obtained using the era5 gleam and gldas datasets as model inputs in the validation period are 0 76 0 52 and 0 68 in the slrb 0 75 0 75 and 0 39 in the hhrb and 0 69 0 69 and 0 60 in the syrb respectively when the model parameters calibrated by the gleam dataset are fixed the nse obtained using the era5 gleam and gldas datasets as model inputs in the validation period are 0 75 0 75 and 0 64 in the slrb 0 68 0 70 and 0 05 in the hhrb and 0 63 0 65 and 0 66 in the syrb respectively when the model parameters calibrated by the gldas dataset are fixed the nse obtained using the era5 gleam and gldas datasets as model inputs in the validation period are 0 47 0 23 and 0 72 in the slrb 0 67 0 65 and 0 71 in the hhrb and 0 33 0 44 and 0 65 in the syrb respectively the model efficiency obtained from different pet forcing data with the same set of parameters varies significantly the highest nse is achieved by the original pet dataset the results confirm the conclusion made by bai et al 2016 which is that the magnitude of pet forcing data has a significant effect on model performance while the hydrologic model compensates for the efficiency loss in the streamflow simulations resulting from the three pet inputs by model calibration it has been found that the sensitivity of hydrological simulations is related to the main hydrological processes nandakumar and mein 1997 we further explored the impacts of model calibration on the simulation of water balance components including the water content of the soil box wcs and actual evapotranspiration aet the time series of wcs and aet simulated by the three pet datasets on daily and monthly time scales in the three inland river basins are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively for the three basins with different pet inputs the simulations yielded similar aet both in magnitude and variability while large differences exist in the simulated values of wcs the wcs obtained using the gldas dataset as model input is lower than that obtained using the era5 and gleam datasets in all basins the parameter calibration may offset the impact of different pet inputs on streamflow simulations by adjusting the wcs 5 conclusions this study strives to investigate the accuracy and hydrological applicability of three gridded pet datasets for streamflow simulations in the three hexi inland river basins to fulfill this objective we first performed a comparison of the three pet products gldas gleam era5 to identify their consistencies and discrepancies in pet estimation then the three pet datasets were evaluated in predicting daily streamflow to investigate if the pet inputs affect the performance of streamflow simulation we reached the following conclusions 1 the gleam dataset has the best accuracy with relatively low estimated errors on both daily and monthly time scales according to the tca the glads estimates higher pet in magnitude but is consistent with era5 and gleam in characterizing the temporal variability of pet in the three watersheds 2 the three gridded pet datasets can be used as the pet input of the hbv light model when no meteorological observations are available to derive indirect pet estimates this finding confirms the feasibility of gridded pet datasets for streamflow simulations in ungauged areas 3 the hydrological modeling of the hbv light is less impacted by the magnitude of the pet input as the gldas with higher estimated errors did not lead to poor streamflow simulation in the three watersheds similar hydrological simulation results are obtained when using the temporally varying and long term mean pet datasets as the forcing data the temporal signal of the pet input also has little effect on the hydrological simulation of the hbv light 4 the simulations driven by different pet datasets exhibit the similar patterns the hbv light is not sensitive to the three pet inputs in the hexi inland river basins the parameter calibration of the model can make different pet inputs have a limited effect on the streamflow simulations to yield the same results for the pet datasets obtained from different sources the parameter calibration may eliminate model efficiency losses by adjusting the wcs credit authorship contribution statement chunlin wang methodology writing original draft visualization formal analysis

7818,study region nechako reservoir british columbia canada study focus hydrological regulation affect both hydrological and thermal conditions in the reservoir and downstream reach subsequently disrupting fish habitats this paper aims at developing an integrated model simulating physical processes that govern the quantity and quality of inflow reservoir and outflow water of the nechako reservoir such a model would help stakeholders understand the response of in reservoir water temperature stratification and downstream water temperature to changes in inflow and reservoir operation under future climate change new hydrological insights for the region the model was calibrated against historical reservoir levels and in reservoir and outlet water temperature field data the integrated model simulated accurately the wide variation of reservoir levels as well as the in reservoir water temperature at kenney dam and the outlet temperature sensitivity analysis shows that reservoir water temperature particularly the epilimnion is sensitive to changes in both meteorological and hydrological forcing forcing the model with different outflow scenarios shows the weak sensitivity of temperature of water released to outflow rates given epilimnion water releases at the spillway the summer temperature management program could be inefficient to provide cool water in the nechako river during the critical period of salmon migration in a warming climate however colder water remains available at depth at kenney dam to potentially mitigate and better control

regulation affects reservoir hydrological and thermal dynamics by altering water levels heat exchange yang et al 2022 thermal structure ice formation and breakup huokuna et al 2022 specifically dams alter air water temperature interactions particularly in cases where hypolimnion releases can increase the time lag between air and water temperatures and significantly change water temperature

depending on the in take water temperature through epilimnetic or hypolimnetic bottom release reservoirs are likely to release water that is either too warm or too cold for the downstream aquatic environment olden and naiman 2010 in a changing climate warming air temperature can exacerbate the impact of flow regulation on both the reservoir and the downstream river reach a number of studies have evaluated the impact of climate change on reservoir water surface temperature and thermal stratification e g obregon et al 2011 lee et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 morales marin et al 2021 paulsson

zhong et al 2020 xu et al 2022 the impact of climate change on inflow volume water demand and water temperature are often evaluated separately however majority of reservoirs serve different purposes and managers need to consider trade offs between hydropower generation and environmental needs such as minimum flow or downstream water temperature requirements for fish habitats therefore a holistic approach that considers both changes in inflow cycle and subsequent changes in reservoir thermal stratification is critical to understand how water control could affect reservoir performance and its influence on downstream river water temperature numerical hydrodynamic models are widely used to capture both the reservoir balance and thermal stratification e g glm hipsey et al 2019 ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 elcom hodges et al 2000 these models rely on equations for heat transport inflow transport and outflow transport according to the reservoir geometry flow rates and climatic conditions to simulate water temperature a number of studies have used these models to evaluate the response of reservoir thermal stratification to changes in air temperature and precipitation e g obregon et al 2011 prats et al 2017 lee et al 2018 azadi et al 2021 morales marin et al 2021 yaghouti et al 2022 however to also assess the impact of climate on reservoir inflow generally requires a hydrological

temperature within the nechako reservoir itself or the temperature of water released from the reservoir these studies were focused on the capacity of a proposed release facility at kenney dam to provide cold water to the nechako river to ensure favorable downstream conditions for salmon species and were limited to the area immediately upstream of the dam to our knowledge there is no study that has taken an integrated view of the entire nechako reservoir including inflow from the upstream drainage area accordingly the intent of the proposed modelling system is to provide a prognostic prediction of the temperature of reservoir outflows which is intended to serve as an upstream boundary condition for future thermal modelling scenarios the model could also be linked to a reservoir operation model to manage and regulate temperature of water released using the nechako reservoir as a case study the main objectives of this paper are to 1 demonstrate the accuracy of our combined modelling system in describing reservoir hydrology hydrodynamics and temperature and then to use the developed model to explore 2 the sensitivity of the reservoir thermal structure to surface forcing air temperature wind speed longwave radiation and solar radiation and 3 the impact of flow regulation on reservoir thermal stratification and outflow water temperature 2 study area the nechako reservoir located in the upper nechako river was created in the early 1950 s by the construction of the kenney dam and nine additional saddle dams which flooded and linked the rivers and lakes ootsa intata whitesail chelaslie tetachuk tahtsa and natalkuz into a single reservoir fig 1 the names of the original lakes are still used as the names of the various reaches of the reservoir the kenney dam impounds approximately 14 020 km2 of the upper portion of the nechako river basin and the reservoir itself is composed of two main branches that extend 200 km east west and 57 km north south the northern branch is composed of whitesail tahtsa and ootsa lakes fig 1b and in the southern branch of the reservoir the unregulated eutsuk lake drains into tetachuk lake and water then flows to natalkuz and knewstub lakes the latter is directly upstream of the kenney dam which consists of two perpendicular basins knewstubb and big ben arms extending east west and knewstubb mid reach extending north south imam et al 2013 kenney dam was built 90 km southwest of vanderhoof at the outlet of knewtsubb lake fig 1a it eliminated flows into the nechako river at this point and backed water westward via knewstubb and natalkuz lake into ootsa lake swain and girard 1987 reservoir levels in the nechako reservoir are affected by discharge at its two outlet locations most outflow is used for power production and diverted to the kemano powerhouse from the west end of the reservoir in tahtsa lake via a 16 km tunnel drilled through the coast mountains nhc 2003 any surplus water is released midway along the reservoir from ootsa lake through a spillway into skins lake which is 75 km west of the kenney dam the spillway redirects water through the cheslatta river to rejoin the nechako river downstream of kenney dam bypassing approximately 9 km of the original channel course spillway flows provide water for downstream fish habitat and other uses the reservoir regulation significantly influenced water quantity and quality in the nechako river macdonald et al 2012 to provide adequate spawning and migration conditions to salmonid species a summer temperature management program stmp was adopted in 1983 the aim of the stmp is to decrease the frequency of water temperature 20 c between july 20th and august 20th critical period for salmon migration at finmoore the thermal constraint location shown in fig 1a by increasing water release at the skins lake spillway 3 data and methods to develop a modelling framework that provides an integrated view of the nechako

is presented in section 3 5 section 3 6 describes the sensitivity analysis methodology to evaluate the impact of surface meteorology and outflow regulation on the reservoir thermal stratification and temperature of water released at the skins lake spillway 3 1 meteorological forcing the selected modelling framework see fig 2 requires gridded meteorological forcing data of air temperature precipitation dewpoint temperature wind speed and direction incoming solar and longwave radiation atmospheric density and atmospheric pressure at a 3 hour timestep the data are for 1945 2018 to cover the period for which both discharge and water temperature observations are available for reservoir model calibration and validation the requisite data was produced by merging two datasets pnwnamet werner et al 2019 and era5 reanalysis copernicus climate change service c3s c3s c3s 2017 pnwnamet provides gridded observations of daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation at a spatial resolution of 0 0625 6 km for the period 1945 2012 sub daily values of precipitation and temperature and the additional required meteorological variables were estimated using the mt clim algorithm bohn et al 2013 the era5 dataset provides temperature precipitation dew point temperature surface pressure shortwave and longwave radiation as well as northward and eastward wind components at a 0 28125 31 km spatial resolution for the period 1980 2019 vapour pressure was estimated as a function of dew point temperature whereas atmospheric density was estimated from air temperature and surface pressure wind speed and wind direction were estimated from northward and eastward wind components the era5 data were disaggregated from 0 28125 spatial resolution to the pnwnamet data resolution using a second order conservative interpolation procedure remapcon2 schulzweida 2019 a temporally consistent dataset spanning 1945 2018 was created by merging variables from both datasets except for wind direction which is only available from 1980 onward as air temperature and precipitation from pnwnamet is considered more accurate than era5 we used the pnwnamet based data for 1945 2012 and extended the data by concatenating era5 air temperature and precipitation for 2013 2018 conversely incoming shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed air pressure vapor pressure and atmospheric density from era5 are deemed more accurate than those estimated from pnwnamet using mtclim therefore we used era5 based data from 1980 through 2018 and only used pnwnamet based data for the earlier period of 1945 1979 the procedure for generating the forcing data is described in detail in the accompanying supplementary material 3 2 water quantity and quality dataset 3 2 1 tributary inflow and inflow water temperature daily discharge data for all the major tributaries see fig 1b and table 1 to the nechako reservoir were obtained from water survey canada wsc discharge data for the whitesail reach white and tahtsa river tahol tributaries are seasonal and only available prior to reservoir construction 1930 1955 the record period for the remaining stations is between 1992 and 1996 except eutsu and laven where the records extend to 2013 and 2018 respectively see table 1 river water temperature records were provided by triton environmental consultants triton 1994 these data derive from studies that investigate the potential for a cold water release facility at kenney dam water temperature measurements were collected at the wsc gauging sites at the outlets of the eutsu entia cheda and chela sub basins plus to two additional locations coles and laven shown in fig 1b from june 7 9 until 12 13 october 1994 depending on location note that water temperature data is not available for white and tahol the data were recorded at 10 minute intervals and averaged to an hourly timestep for model calibration and validation the temperature data was further averaged to the daily mean over the period of record a maximum water temperature of 20 9 c was observed at chela whereas a minimum water temperature of 1 5 c was observed at the laven station the stations chela cheda entia have a similar daily water temperature regime with values around 11 c in early june reaching maxima around 19 c in july then dropping to 7 5 c in late september early october at these stations the mean water temperature for the period of record is around 13 3 c for chela and entia and 12 5 c for cheda water temperature at eutsu located on the south arm of the reservoir is warmer in comparison with a mean value of 15 c water temperature at the laven station did not exceed 11 c during the period of record with a mean value of 7 c 3 2 2 reservoir level inflow and outflow outflows at the spillway and the powerhouse diversion which provide the downstream boundary conditions of the model domain were provided by rio tinto daily powerhouse outflows are available from january 1 1955 and daily outflows at the spillway are available from june 15 1955 in addition rio tinto has estimated daily total reservoir inflow for the same record period the total net inflows were reconstructed using a water balance approach and estimated as the change in storage using observations of surface level change plus total outflow on a daily basis formally daily inflows qinflow are obtained as the sum of reservoir volume difference over a day ds dt water release at the spillway qsls and powerhouse intake qph i e qinflow ds dt qsls qph therefore the inflow estimates are potentially biased by the net difference between precipitation and evaporation over the reservoir surface area using mean annual precipitation from pnwnamet 475 mm and mean annual lake evaporation estimates 500 700 mm from the hydrological atlas of canada canadian national committee for the international hydrological decade 1978 the annual inflow bias is estimated to be very small ranging between 1 3 of average annual inflow about 60 of inflow is diverted to the powerhouse and the remaining 40 is released through the spillway in times of high inflows the percentage of water released at the spillway is increased to maintain the reservoir surface below its maximum operating level historic reservoir water level records from 1955 to 2019 were also provided by rio tinto on average the surface elevation is maintained at levels between 850 7 m in april and 852 5 m in july the inter annual variation of nechako water surface elevation is between 0 98 m and 3 92 m 3 2 3 water temperature profiles and temperature of outflow water temperature profiles collected during summer 1994 at kenney dam and natalkuz lake were provided by triton environmental consultants triton 1994 the records were measured every 10 min and averaged to an hourly timestep measurements were taken every 2 m beginning at a depth of 1 m below the surface to a depth of 57 m and 45 m at kenney dam and natalkuz lake respectively observations of the temperature of water released at the skins lake spillway were provided by rio tinto these data were recorded during the summers of 2016 and 2017 the water temperature data was recorded approximately 300 m below the spillway during summer 2016 however this station was subject to large variations in stage flow and turbulence and water temperature recordings were relocated to a site 1 km downstream during summer 2017 these data were recorded every 10 min and averaged to an hourly timestep 3 3 vic gl and rbm implementation the volume and temperature of reservoir inflow is simulated using the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 1996 coupled to the one dimensional stream temperature river basin model rbm yearsley 2009 2012 vic is a spatially distributed land surface model that simulates both water and energy balances in this study vic gl a version of the vic model upgraded at pcic that accounts for glacier processes is used schnorbus 2018 rbm is a gridded stream temperature model that uses a one dimensional mixed eulerian lagrangian approach water temperature is simulated by tracing water parcels and their flow characteristics i e speed along the channel network for a specific segment of the channel network water temperature is calculated from the local air water surface heat exchange and from heat advected from upstream and tributary inflow van vliet et al 2012 vic gl and rbm require meteorological forcing data that includes air temperature total precipitation wind speed atmospheric pressure solar radiation and atmospheric density both vic gl and rbm operate on a spatial grid of 1 16 and provide output at a daily temporal resolution base vic and rbm are described in detail in cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 yearsley 2009 2012 and van vliet et al 2012 the modification of vic into vic gl is described in schnorbus 2018 the daily modelling vic gl rbm framework is configured to model inflow volume and temperature from the six main tributaries that supply the nechako reservoir see fig 1 table 1 as identified according to wsc stations these six sub basins account for 70 of the upstream drainage area and using precipitation distribution as a proxy approximately 80 of the total inflow volume the remaining area is mainly covered by the reservoir and many small tributaries of insignificant size the hydrologic model was separately calibrated at each major tributary using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nse of log streamflow lnse to account for both low and high flows the sub basins white and tahol were calibrated using a multi site calibration that consist of constraining the model with the outlet i e tahol and white stations as well as the upstream stations laven and coles as only seasonal data are available for white and tahol the objective function included only the nse for these stations whereas both the nse and lnse of simulated flows were used at laven and coles stations the calibration period for cheda chela entia and coles is the same as the flow record period table 1 the calibration for eutsu station is 1993 1995 and the period from 2004 to 2012 is used for validation note that flow for the period between 1995 and 2004 are not available for this station the calibration period for white and tahol stations is 1946 1952 the calibration period for laven is 1977 1994 because of insufficient data the model was validated for eutsu station only due to uncertainties caused by meteorological forcing and calibration data among other factors hydrologic model outputs are often biased bias also results due to our deliberate choice to model only major inflow tributaries the bias often appears as an underestimation of the variance of streamflow and inaccurate representation of the tails of the streamflow distribution particularly in the extreme high flows e g farmer and vogel 2016 farmer et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 because the w2 model is highly sensitive to inflow data post processing of the simulated inflows is performed to correct any model deficiencies bias correction is applied using a quantile mapping approach which is widely used and extensively described in the literature e g teutschbein and seibert 2012 maraun 2013 spellman et al 2018 this method consists of matching the model s simulated inflow distribution to the distribution of observed inflow magnitude bias correction is applied to the total simulated inflows using observed total inflows because they are available for sufficiently long period to derive the inflow distribution unlike observed local streamflow the total simulated inflow is computed as the sum of the streamflow at the 6 major tributaries after the bias correction of the total simulated inflows bias corrected inflow at each tributary is estimated according to the mean contribution of each tributary to the total inflow as follows 1 q ˆ i t ω i q ˆ t t where q ˆ t t is the bias corrected total inflow at timestep t and ω i is the climatological contribution of tributary i to the total inflow defined as ω i q i q t where q i is the average flow at tributary i and q t is the average total inflow the rbm model is calibrated independently for each sub basin by minimizing the mean absolute error mae of daily average water temperature from june to october 1994 at each individual water temperature station shown in fig 1b note that because of insufficient water temperature data rbm could not be validated 3 4 ce qual w2 implementation in this study the ce qual w2 model w2 is chosen as it is a 2 dimensional longitudinal and vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model that simulates water surface elevation and temperature as well as several other water quality variables the 2 dimensional nature of the model is well suited for relatively narrow and long waterbodies such the nechako reservoir cole and wells 2018 other relevant features include the ability to simulate the onset growth and breakup of ice cover and the use of selective withdrawal calculations based on outlet geometry outflow and density this model is open source and maintained by portland state university usa for windows environment this study uses a linux version of the w2 model bornstein et al 2022 which is available on an open source github project https github com wqdss ce qual w2 linux details of ce qual w2 model can be found in cole and wells 2018 and only a short overview is presented here the w2 model is based on 2 d hydrodynamic time dependent differential equations that require initial and boundary conditions to start a w2 simulation the user must specify initial conditions of water surface elevation and water quality variables only water temperature in this case the degree to which the initial conditions affect the accuracy of the w2 model simulation depends upon the reservoir residence time and the duration of the simulation debele et al 2008 the impact of initial conditions diminishes with decreasing residence time and or longer simulation periods in this study the period between 1985 and 2017 is set as the simulation period the initial water surface elevation is set to the observed reservoir level at the beginning of the simulation whereas initial water temperature is set to 0 c given that the nechako reservoir is mostly a shallow system and the simulation period is long the effect of the initial conditions on simulated water temperature will be negligible boundary conditions required by w2 are surface boundary conditions inflow and outflow the surface boundary conditions affect the water atmosphere processes at the reservoir surface and include heat exchange solar radiation absorption and wind stress therefore the model requires meteorological forcing data that includes air temperature dew point temperature wind speed and direction and cloud cover see fig 2 precipitation is an optional meteorological input and is considered as an inflow that is supplied for each branch as vic gl is calibrated against reconstructed inflows see section 3 4 that already account for reservoir evaporation and precipitation w2 is run with evaporation and precipitation excluded from the water budget the model uses cloud cover to calculate both shortwave radiation from sun angle relationship and longwave radiation the model can use measured shortwave radiation by activating this option in the configuration file as cloud cover data are not available modifications were made such that longwave radiation is read from the meteorological file instead of calculating this flux from cloud cover for each waterbody of the nechako reservoir timeseries of the required meteorological forcing data see fig 2 are extracted from the gridded pnwanmet era5 data and supplied to the model at 3 hourly timestep note that the requirement for wind direction means that w2 can only be operated from 1980 to 2018 the w2 model allows different types of inflow boundary conditions inflows can be supplied as upstream inflow i e branch inflow or as point or non point sources called tributary and distributed tributary inflows four major tributaries feed the southern branch of the nechako reservoir see fig 1c daily inflows are supplied as tributary inflow at the corresponding locations except for the eutsuk river which is supplied as branch inflow sub basins in the northern branch of the nechako reservoir include whitesail lake basin and tahtsa lake and tahtsa reach see fig 1 discharge at the outlet of these basins is supplied to the w2 model as distributed tributaries for branch 1 representing the whitesail lake and branch 5 representing tahtsa lake and tahtsa reach the corresponding inflow water temperature at each tributary must also be supplied outflow can be specified as a lateral withdrawal or as a downstream release from the reservoir through spillways gates pumps etc lateral withdrawals are outflows that can be specified for any active cell of any w2 segment whereas the downstream outflows can only occur at the downstream segment of a branch in this study both water release at the skins lake spillway and water withdrawal at the west end of the reservoir are identified as lateral withdrawals in the model the outlet of the nechako reservoir at the skins lake spillway consists of two gates which are opened at different water levels however the outflow data is only available as the total from both gates therefore outflow was modelled using a single gate configured as a withdrawal with the w2 selective withdrawal algorithm used to determine the reservoir source layers the selective withdrawal algorithm determines the vertical zone limits based on the outflow outlet geometry and in pool densities cole and wells 2018 then it assigns flow for each layer within the identified withdrawal zone this algorithm requires setting upper and lower boundary layers from which outflows do not occur in this case an upper layer limit was set as the surface layer and a bottom layer limit was adjusted to equal the observed water temperature of the outlet the w2 model allow inputs at different timesteps hence meteorological forcing is supplied at 3 hourly timestep whereas hydrological inputs inflow inflow water temperature and outflows are supplied at daily timestep according to the literature the w2 model is relatively insensitive to hydraulic parameters dispersion coefficients and bottom friction parameters for the chezy friction model and default values were used cole and wells 2018 3 5 bathymetry and w2 computational grid bathymetry is a key element in the development of the computational grid for the w2 model three different data sources were used to estimate nechako reservoir bathymetry the first data set consisted of depth measurements taken in tahtsa lake in 2016 and a small area upstream of the skins lake spillway in 2019 which were provided by rio tinto a second data set consisted of bathymetry contours that were reconstructed from aerial photos collected before impoundment of the reservoir made available by triton environmental as such the bathymetry contours are only available for the reservoir volume located between the current and pre impoundment lake surfaces it does not provide bathymetry for lakes and river volume that existed prior to impoundment lastly the bottom elevations for the pre existing lakes were constrained using pre impoundment spot measurements taken from hand drafted bathymetry maps produced in 1951 52 by the bc department of recreation and conservation scanned copies are available via http a100 gov bc ca pub fidq viewbathymetricmaps do a digital elevation model of reservoir bathymetry was estimated using ordinary kriging on the combined elevation data sets the w2 model is configured onto a computational grid by discretizing the reservoir along the longitudinal and vertical dimensions whereby the longitudinal dimension is divided into segments and each segment is divided into vertical layers each grid cell is therefore characterized by its longitudinal location i e segment depth and cross sectional width the w2 allows for a variable grid and the segment spacing is fixed to 1 km for most grid cells however at lake connections the segment spacing was increased to ensure that branches only flow into a single segment and the segment spacing upstream of the spillway is decreased to between 300 and 500 m the depth and cross section width of the computational grids were determined using reservoir bathymetry for most layers the vertical grid spacing was fixed at 2 2 m however whitesail and tahtsa lakes are much deeper than the other lakes in the nechako reservoir resulting in many inactive layers within the computational grid therefore vertical layers lower than an elevation of 777 m which is the bottom elevation at kenney dam were spaced every 4 4 m the cross sectional width for each grid cell was estimated using the qgis plugin ce qual w2 bathymetry https plugins qgis org plugins create bathymetry according to the estimated bathymetry the final model grid has 425 segments and 86 layers w2 allows modelling a system with multiple waterbodies where each waterbody has its own water quality parameters and meteorological forcing to account for climate variability the nechako reservoir is modeled as 6 waterbodies and 18 branches according to the pre existing lakes see fig 1c bathymetry data is a key constraint on the accuracy of water surface elevation and water temperature simulations in the w2 model alcantra et al 2010 xie et al 2017 hence the accuracy of the bathymetry was evaluated by forcing w2 with observed total inflows and observed meteorological data and comparing the simulated to the observed water surface elevation for the period spanning 1986 2017 the resulting model simulation shows good agreement with the observed water surface elevation with a mean error of 0 11 m and a rmse of 0 13 m see fig 3b although this is not a strict validation of the estimated bathymetry errors are also introduced via model parametrization and the meteorological data it suggests that to a first order the volume of the reservoir is represented with reasonable accuracy 3 6 sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of water temperature to surface meteorology a 20 increase is applied individually to each of the following input forcings incoming longwave radiation incoming shortwave radiation air temperature and wind speed the impact of air temperature is evaluated by increasing air temperature by 2 c the reservoir water temperature is simulated repeatedly by increasing one forcing element each time and vertical temperature profiles are evaluated at the two key locations of kenney dam and the skins lake spillway flow regulation at the nechako reservoir has altered both downstream streamflow volume and seasonality average water release is approximately 32 m3 s at skins lake spillway during fall and winter to support chinook salmon see fig 4a the water release is increased during summer in response to warming trends to support sockeye salmon migration during the stmp period the increased flow release during summer has created an unnatural peak flow in late july as opposed to the natural peak flow occurring in june to assess the impact of flow regulation on the outflow thermograph we evaluate the response of water temperature to changes in outflow seasonality and volume at the spillway to do so we consider two scenarios for outflow at the skins lake spillway 1 a combined regulated scenario where water release at the spillway is the total of the historical spillway and powerhouse intake flows qsls qph and 2 a natural outflow scenario where water release at the spillway is equal to net inflow see fig 4a the first scenario evaluates changes to outflow volume at the spillway but where flow seasonality remains regulated and the second scenario mimics a natural outflow regime where outflow is unregulated in each scenario diversion to the powerhouse is set to zero 4 results 4 1 model performance 4 1 1 inflow and inflow water temperature table 3 presents the performance of vic gl model to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the main tributaries of the nechako reservoir during the calibration period whereas fig 5 presents observed and simulated time series at these locations the performance of vic gl varies by location with nse ranging from 0 42 entia and 0 78 eutsu and a bias between 4 and 16 low flows are relatively well produced with a lnse ranging from 0 46 cheda and 0 8 eutsu lnse is not reported for tahol and white because the data are seasonal at these stations hence these values would not be representative of the model performance reproducing low flows the total simulated inflows are evaluated for the period 1979 2017 despite the good performance of vic gl at the station scale the volume and timing of the total simulated inflows at the major tributaries do not adequately match the total historical inflow the model annual bias is variable and substantially underestimates inflow during the high inflow years see fig 3a the model bias is caused by the underestimation of peak flows during high years and runoff from creeks and small tributaries that is not considered in the model the model bias is 16 whereas the nse is 0 53 given the tendency of vic gl to underestimate inflows bias correction is applied to the simulated total inflows via quantile mapping as described in section 3 3 fig 3a compares observed and corrected simulated annual mean inflows the corrected mean annual inflows show good agreement with the observed net inflows and the nse of the corrected net inflow timeseries is 0 76 with a bias of 0 65 the model simulations from 1979 to 2017 are used to estimate the climatological contribution of each tributary to the total inflow the eutsu and tahol sub basins are the major tributaries that feed the reservoir with 35 and 33 of total inflow respectively the white tributary contributes 16 to the total inflow whereas the sub basins entia and cheda contribute 5 and 2 respectively the chela tributary contributes 9 to the total inflow these estimated contributions are applied to the total bias corrected inflow to estimate bias corrected inflow at each tributary using eq 1 fig 6 compares observed and rbm simulated daily water temperature of all tributaries from june to october 1994 in addition the observed daily maximum and minimum water temperature extracted from the hourly data are used to evaluate the model s ability to simulate daily water temperature between these ranges the mae values for daily mean temperature range from 0 86 c at laven station to 1 58 c at cheda station the model does well in representing the seasonal variability of stream temperatures the daily variability of water temperature is well represented at the north west stations laven and coles and chela but it is over estimated in the southern stations cheda and entia the observed daily variability of water temperature at eutsu is very low and overestimated in the simulation note that this station is located at the outlet of eutsuk lake which is not explicitly modelled likely explaining the poor performance of vic gl rbm at this station nevertheless the overall performance of rbm seems satisfactory due to the short length of water temperature observations one summer only it is not possible to evaluate the model under different climatic conditions 4 1 2 reservoir level and thermal conditions using the simulated bias corrected inflow and observed spillway and powerhouse outflows we evaluate the accuracy of w2 in representing the water surface elevation for the period 1986 2017 the initial water surface elevation is fixed to the observed reservoir level at the beginning of the simulation period then we evaluate model performance to simulate the wide variation of water surface elevation as suggested by cole and wells 2018 over the entire period comparisons of simulated and observed reservoir levels using corrected modelled inflow are depicted in fig 3b the w2 model simulates reservoir levels well for the entire simulation period 1986 2017 fig 3 with a rmse of 0 63 m and mean error of 0 42 m however there is an increased bias following 2003 which can be due a remaining inflow bias note that bias correction aims at matching distribution of inflows and year to year simulated and observed inflows do not necessarily match since actual records of spillway discharge and powerhouse intake are used to simulate surface elevation the bias in timing of inflow might explain the increased bias water temperature profiles are evaluated at an hourly timestep at kenney dam and natalkuz lake for the summer of 1994 w2 accurately simulates water temperature at the kenny dam at all depths with a mae of 0 59 c and rmse of 0 72 c for the entire evaluation period the mae of the timeseries at natalkuz lake is approximately 1 52 c and the rmse is 1 83 c the low performance at this location is due the poor model performance in reproducing extreme surface temperature for the period spanning july 12 to july 15 hourly simulated and observed water temperature profiles are depicted in fig 7 for selected dates the entire timeseries of temperature profiles are supplied in the supplementary material w2 does well in representing the seasonal progression of surface temperature which is approximately 15 c at end june reaches a maximum of 22 c during late july then decreases throughout september to october the main features in the seasonal progression of the water temperature profiles are also captured well by w2 including the deepening of the thermocline and epilimnion in june and july and again from august to october as well as the development of strong stratification from mid august to mid october in both the observations and simulations the top of the hypolimnion remains at a depth of approximately 30 m and has a water temperature of around 5 c for the entire evaluation period performance of the w2 model to simulate temperature of water released at the spillway is evaluated by comparing model simulation to water temperature recorded over summer 2016 and 2017 the mae of water temperature released at the spillway is 0 21 c for the period between june to october 2016 and 0 44 c for the period june to early november 2017 note that during summer 2017 water temperature was recorded 1 3 km below the spillway whereas during summer 2016 water temperature was recorded 300 m below the spillway therefore summer 2016 observations are likely more representative of the temperature of spilled water than are those collected in summer 2017 which may reflect additional warming in the channel below the spillway overall the model has small bias during summer but underestimates water temperature during autumn 4 2 meteorological and outflow sensitivity to reduce computational time the period 1986 1998 forms the basis for the meteorological sensitivity analysis and outflow scenarios we evaluate the thermal sensitivity to a 20 increase in each of the forcing data separately at kenney dam and skins lake spillway fig 8 the water temperature profile is most sensitive to changes in incoming longwave or shortwave radiation a 20 increase in longwave radiation leads to a surface temperature increase of 1 65 c at kenney dam and 1 71 c at the spillway and an increase in shortwave radiation leads to a surface temperature increase of 1 14 c at the spillway and 1 12 c at kenney dam increasing air temperature by 2 c leads to a 0 30 c increase in surface water temperature increasing the wind speed by 20 increases evaporative heat loss which decreases the temperature at the water surface by 0 4 c at both the kenney dam and the skins lake spillway locations increased air temperature longwave radiation and solar radiation increases the temperature of the water column up to 30 m below surface level at the skins lake spillway and kenney dam increased wind speed decreases water temperature until about 10 m below surface level and slightly increases water temperature between 10 m and 27 m below surface level in deeper layers i e below 40 m the water temperature is insensitive to changes in meteorological input at both locations diverting all outflow to the skins lake spillway has a strong impact on the water temperature profile surface temperature is only slightly elevated and a much weaker temperature gradient develops as compared to the reference simulation fig 8 consequently the largest water temperature increase occurs at approximately 20 m below the surface and water temperature remains elevated throughout the profile at skins lake and to a depth of approximately 45 m at kenney dam the result is similar for both outflow scenarios although the natural flow regime generates the weaker temperature gradient i e largest temperature increase at depth as mentioned the surface temperature response is small being almost negligible at skins lake and less than 0 5 c at kenney dam at kenney dam water temperature below roughly 45 m is generally insensitive to changes in the outflow regime fig 4 compares the outflow hydrographs and thermographs at the skins lake spillway for the historical outflow scenario plus the two hypothetical scenarios in the combined regulated scenario qsls qph although the volume of spillway outflow is increased the seasonality is still highly regulated with large baseflow 150 175 m3 s throughout much of the year and a large outflow pulse over the stmp period this contrasts with the natural qsls net inflow scenario with lower baseflow in fall and winter followed by a large freshet that peaks in june releasing outflow by restoring a more natural regime at the spillway leads to releasing cooler surface water during spring and early summer i e during the snowmelt freshet but warmer water during fall compared to the current water release conditions outflow water temperature in the combined regulated scenario adheres more closely to historical release conditions during spring but is warmer in the fall and early winter during the summer particularly the stmp period outflow water temperature for the scenarios does not depart markedly from what transpired under historical outflow conditions results for the meteorological and outflow sensitivity are further synthesized in fig 9 which shows the mean variation of water temperature by depth up to 33 m below the surface over the year at the spillway with respect to the reference simulation increases in the meteorological forcings are most pronounced near the surface whereas changing the outflow regime has a larger effect on water temperature throughout the profile 5 discussion the nechako reservoir is a large multi basin reservoir with narrow southern and northern arcs implementing a detailed hydrologic model that captures all streams that feeds the reservoir is challenging due to the complex geometry of the reservoir itself and limited data representing the spatial variability of reservoir hydrology to constrain such model in this paper the hydrologic model vic gl was implemented to the six major tributaries feeding the reservoir the developed model was able to simulate both the spatial variability of discharge and the overall total volume of inflow however the model failed to reproduce the inter annual variability and high flow years inaccuracy of representing high streamflow extreme and streamflow variability may be caused by a precipitation bias it is likely that the gridded precipitation dataset used here underestimate extreme precipitation and inter annual precipitation variability which resulted in poor hydrologic model performance to simulate high inflow years in our case modelling only the six major tributaries also contributed to model bias which manifested as underestimation of actual inflows the area of the watershed that is not modelled may contribute more inflow during high flow years which could have exacerbated the model bias during high flow years in addition inaccuracy of representing high streamflow extreme and streamflow variability is a common issue in hydrological modelling farmer and vogel 2016 farmer et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 when simulated streamflow are routed through a reservoir model inflow bias may severely affect water resources decisions farmer et al 2018 hence bias correction of hydrological model outputs is a necessary step when used as an upstream boundary condition for a hydrodynamic model due to limited records of water temperature of tributaries temperature of water release and water column in the reservoir the model was calibrated only to summer temperatures the model simulates accurately the temperature of the water column and temperature of water released at the spillway during the warmer months of july and august but underestimates water temperature from mid september to early october with a bias of 1 26 c additional water temperature measurements extending beyond summer would be necessary to improve the model performance during fall and early spring nevertheless retrospective simulation shows that the model is able to simulate the wide variation of water surface elevations fig 3 and the seasonality of evaporation flux water surface temperature and ice cover see fig 10 the onset if the ice thaw is around late january and ice break up occurs around early april day 97 the freeze back occurs around late november to early december day 330 at tahtsa lake and day 339 at kenney dam although we have no direct observations of lake ice phenology for the reservoir these dates are generally consistent with regional estimates for instance the hydrological atlas of canada estimates freeze over lake completely ice covered to occur between november 15th and december 1st and ice free conditions to occur between april 15th and may 1st allen 1978 using data from the global lake and river ice phenology database benson et al 2000 for nine regional lakes anahim burns hourglass kathlyn lakelse nukko one eye stuart and williston we obtain a mean freeze over date of november 27 day 331 and a mean ice off date of april 30th day 120 the variation of ice cover is affected by the location and temperature of inflows and outflows evaporative wind variations over the ice surface and effects of water movements on the ice to water exchange cole and wells 2018 the evaporation flux is also spatially variable over the lake fig 10d the lower evaporation heat flux at northwestern part of the reservoir i e tahtsa lake coincides with cooler surface water as compared to the other locations fig 10b spatial variability of evaporation due to spatial differences in surface water temperature was observed in other lakes in the region e g spence and hedstrom 2015 the sensitivity analysis shows that radiation is the dominant heat source to the reservoir increased air temperature also warms the epilimnion whereas increased wind speed cools the epilimnion temperature these results suggest that reservoir surface temperature is most vulnerable to possible future increases in solar and longwave radiations however projected changes in solar radiation over the coming century are uncertain predominantly due to variation in the treatment of cloud cover and aerosols in global and regional climate models bartók et al 2017 chen 2021 although no literature on projected changes in longwave radiation could be found rising air temperatures and the associated increase in water vapor would presumably see an increase in downwelling longwave radiation our analysis indicates that air temperature is not as dominant a factor in surface heat exchange and suggests that reservoir water temperature will be less vulnerable to increasing air temperature modifying the outflow rate at the spillway changes the thermal stratification of the reservoir fig 9 but has less overall impact on water temperature at the surface although adopting a more natural outflow regime at the spillway would potentially reduce the surface water temperature in the spring such a regulatory change would be ineffective at reducing the outflow temperature during the critical stmp period in july and august overall the results of the reference simulation and the two outflow scenarios indicate that outflow temperature at the spillway during the stmp is insensitive to any plausible outflow regime these results agree with the findings of triton 2021 in that total volume of water released during the stmp does not correlate with the number of exceedances of water temperature above 20 c at the downstream thermal constraint historically the stmp was efficient at maintaining water temperature in the nechako river below 20 c macdonald et al 2012 fraser basin council 2015 however this may not be the case under rising air temperatures for example summer 2013 saw a record of twenty two days out of the thirty day control period july 20th to august 20th with water temperature exceeding 20 c downstream due to channel warming below the reservoir as a result of extreme high air temperatures despite a record volume of water released from the spillway during the stmp period triton 2021 this suggest that the efficiency of stmp to provide cool water during the sockeye salmon migration could be limited in a warming climate where no management options currently exists to reduce outflow water temperature water withdrawal from the hypolimnion at kenney dam could potentially help regulate water temperature in the nechako river for consideration of a cold water release facility at kenney dam it has been suggested that a temperature of 10 c would be necessary to reduce the occurrence of water temperature above 20 c in the nechako river above the stuart confluence during the stmp period lawrence and pieters 2005 retrospective simulation shows that the thermocline layer lies between 10 and 30 m and water temperatures below 10 c are available on average at depths below 20 m during the stmp period this is consistent with the findings of triton 1994 where the depth of the 10 c isotherm was observed to be between 17 m and 21 m from june through august currently there is no water release at kenny dam the proposed model would be useful to provide insight on how different selective water withdrawal scenarios at kenny dam could impact downstream water temperature requirements in the same context the model could also be used to regulate reservoir thermal stratification and water release temperature through reservoir operations he et al 2022 to do so the model should be linked with a reservoir operation model i e decision making model in this study the vic gl and rbm models were used to provide upstream boundary conditions of the ce qual w2 model whereas historical outflows were provided as downstream boundary conditions to develop adaptation strategies or for climate change impact assessment coupling this modelling framework with a reservoir operation model forced with simulated streamflow is critical using a reservoir operation model based on a dynamic approach aiming at designing operations to accommodate water use trade offs forced with inflow scenarios is an efficient way to anticipate the reservoir adaptation strategies giudici et al 2021 6 conclusion motivated by the need to understand and manage reservoir impacts on water temperature in the nechako river under future climates a modelling system able to provide prognostic estimates of in reservoir water temperature and outflow temperature of the nechako reservoir has been developed simulation of the nechako reservoir system is undertaken by coupling hydrologic stream water temperature and hydrodynamic models vic gl rbm and ce qual w2 the vic gl and rbm models are used to simulate inflow volume and temperature from the surrounding drainage area and the ce qual w2 model is used to simulate processes controlling reservoir water level and temperature vic gl performance is reasonable although bias correction of the model output was necessary given the sensitivity of ce qual w2 to the inflow data bias the limited records of the stream water temperature only one summer and station discharge did not permit calibration and evaluation of vic gl and rbm under different climatic conditions the ce qual w2 model was evaluated by modelling the entire period of simulation continuously instead of calibrating and validating on two independent periods the model is able to simulate the wide variation of water surface elevations it is also capable of simulating the in reservoir and outlet water temperature accurately during the warmer months of july and august however additional data are required to improve the model performance during fall sensitivity analysis of the ce qual w2 model was conducted using perturbations of surface forcing solar and longwave radiation air temperature and wind speed the modifications result in changes in both the surface temperature and the temperature gradient with depth with the model showing the greatest sensitivity to perturbations in incoming solar and longwave radiation forcing the model with different outflow scenarios the results show that outflow water temperature is weakly sensitive to outflow volume during the summer temperature management program stmp period i e july 20th to august 20th a time which is critical for salmon migration these findings suggest that the efficiency of stmp to provide cool water downstream would be limited during extreme high air temperatures however the direct relationship between water temperature at the spillway and the number of exceedances of water temperature above 20 c at finmoore constraint location will be the subject of future study the integrated model was applied in this paper to simulate the nechako reservoir under historical operations of water withdrawal at the powerhouse in take and water release at the skins lake spillway it has been demonstrated that the modelling system is able to realistically simulate the volume and thermal dynamics of the nechako reservoir system in future work this model will be used to explore the reservoir response to future

7818,study region nechako reservoir british columbia canada study focus hydrological regulation affect both hydrological and thermal conditions in the reservoir and downstream reach subsequently disrupting fish habitats this paper aims at developing an integrated model simulating physical processes that govern the quantity and quality of inflow reservoir and outflow water of the nechako reservoir such a model would help stakeholders understand the response of in reservoir water temperature stratification and downstream water temperature to changes in inflow and reservoir operation under future climate change new hydrological insights for the region the model was calibrated against historical reservoir levels and in reservoir and outlet water temperature field data the integrated model simulated accurately the wide variation of reservoir levels as well as the in reservoir water temperature at kenney dam and the outlet temperature sensitivity analysis shows that reservoir water temperature particularly the epilimnion is sensitive to changes in both meteorological and hydrological forcing forcing the model with different outflow scenarios shows the weak sensitivity of temperature of water released to outflow rates given epilimnion water releases at the spillway the summer temperature management program could be inefficient to provide cool water in the nechako river during the critical period of salmon migration in a warming climate however colder water remains available at depth at kenney dam to potentially mitigate and better control

regulation affects reservoir hydrological and thermal dynamics by altering water levels heat exchange yang et al 2022 thermal structure ice formation and breakup huokuna et al 2022 specifically dams alter air water temperature interactions particularly in cases where hypolimnion releases can increase the time lag between air and water temperatures and significantly change water temperature dynamics downstream kędra and wiejaczka 2016 these changes in downstream flow and thermal dynamics subsequently affects the river ecosystem particularly fish movement and survival moore et al 2022 depending on the in take water temperature through epilimnetic or hypolimnetic bottom release reservoirs are likely to release water that is either too warm or too cold for the downstream aquatic environment olden and naiman 2010 in a changing climate warming air temperature can exacerbate the impact of flow regulation on both the reservoir and the downstream river reach a number of studies have evaluated the impact of climate change on reservoir water surface temperature and thermal stratification e g obregon et al 2011 lee et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 morales marin et al 2021 paulsson and widerlund 2022 soares et al 2021 yaghouti et al 2022 and reservoir performance and hydropower generation e g raje and mujumdar 2010 ashofteh et al 2013 jahandideh tehrani et al 2015 qin et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 xu et al 2022 the impact of climate change on inflow volume water demand and water temperature are often evaluated separately however majority of reservoirs serve different purposes and managers need to consider trade offs between hydropower generation and environmental needs such as minimum flow or downstream water temperature requirements for fish habitats therefore a holistic approach that considers both changes in inflow cycle and subsequent changes in reservoir thermal stratification is critical to understand how water control could affect reservoir performance and its influence on downstream river water temperature numerical hydrodynamic models are widely used to capture both the reservoir balance and thermal stratification e g glm hipsey et al 2019 ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 elcom hodges et al 2000 these models rely on equations for heat transport inflow transport and outflow transport according to the reservoir geometry flow rates and climatic conditions to simulate water temperature a number of studies have used these models to evaluate the response of reservoir thermal stratification to changes in air temperature and precipitation e g obregon et al 2011 prats et al 2017 lee et al 2018 azadi et al 2021 morales marin et al 2021 yaghouti et al 2022 however to also assess the impact of climate on reservoir inflow generally requires a hydrological model forced with outputs of general circulation models olsson et al 2016 linking hydrodynamic models with hydrological models enables reservoir stakeholders to design reliable water management

fraser basin council 2015 levy and nicklin 2018 numerous studies have examined the impact of the reservoir regulation on the water quantity and quality of the nechako river since 1978 e g kellerhals et al 1979 blachut 1988 hartman 1995 mitchell et al 1995 rood and hamilton 1995 french and chambers 1997 macdonald et al 2007 albers et al 2016 however only few studies have addressed water temperature within the nechako reservoir itself or the temperature of water released from the reservoir these studies were focused on the capacity of a proposed release facility at kenney dam to provide cold water to the nechako river to ensure favorable downstream conditions for salmon species and were limited to the area immediately upstream of the dam to our knowledge there is no study that has taken an integrated view of the entire nechako reservoir including inflow from the upstream drainage area accordingly the intent of the proposed modelling system is to provide a prognostic prediction of the temperature of reservoir outflows which is intended to serve as an upstream boundary condition for future thermal modelling scenarios the model could also be linked to a reservoir operation model to manage and regulate temperature of water released using the nechako reservoir as a case study the main objectives of this paper are to 1 demonstrate the accuracy of our combined modelling system in describing reservoir hydrology hydrodynamics and temperature and then to use the developed model to explore 2 the sensitivity of the reservoir thermal structure to surface forcing air temperature wind speed longwave radiation and solar radiation and 3 the impact of flow regulation on reservoir thermal stratification and outflow water temperature 2 study area the nechako reservoir located in the upper nechako river was created in the early 1950 s by the construction of the kenney dam and nine additional saddle dams which flooded and linked the rivers and lakes ootsa intata whitesail chelaslie tetachuk tahtsa and natalkuz into a single reservoir fig 1 the names of the original lakes are still used as the names of the various reaches of the reservoir the kenney dam impounds approximately 14 020 km2 of the upper portion of the nechako river basin and the reservoir itself is composed of two main branches that extend 200 km east west and 57 km north south the northern branch is composed of whitesail tahtsa and ootsa lakes fig 1b and in the southern branch of the reservoir the unregulated eutsuk lake drains into tetachuk lake and water then flows to natalkuz and knewstub lakes the latter is directly upstream of the kenney dam which consists of two perpendicular basins knewstubb and big ben arms extending east west and knewstubb mid reach extending north south imam et al 2013 kenney dam was built 90 km southwest of vanderhoof at the outlet of knewtsubb lake fig 1a it eliminated flows into the nechako river at this point and backed water westward via knewstubb and natalkuz lake into ootsa lake swain and girard 1987 reservoir levels in the nechako reservoir are affected by discharge at its two outlet locations most outflow is used for power production and diverted to the kemano powerhouse from the west end of the reservoir in tahtsa lake via a 16 km tunnel drilled through the coast mountains nhc 2003 any surplus water is released midway along the reservoir from ootsa lake through a spillway into skins lake which is 75 km west of the kenney dam the spillway redirects water through the cheslatta river to rejoin the nechako river downstream of kenney dam bypassing approximately 9 km of the original channel course spillway flows provide water for downstream fish habitat and other uses the reservoir regulation significantly influenced water quantity and quality in the nechako river macdonald et al 2012 to provide adequate spawning and migration conditions to salmonid species a summer temperature management program stmp was adopted in 1983 the aim of the stmp is to decrease the frequency of water temperature 20 c between july 20th and august 20th critical period for salmon migration at finmoore the thermal constraint location shown in fig 1a by increasing water release at the skins lake spillway 3 data and methods to develop a modelling framework that provides an integrated view of the nechako reservoir from the inflow feeding the reservoir the in reservoir dynamics to water leaving the system through regulation different models are linked see fig 2 the 2 dimensional longitudinal and vertical ce qual w2 henceforth w2 hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the hydrodynamic regime of the reservoir this model requires upstream boundary conditions i e inflow and inflow water

component vic gl rbm and ce qual w2 of the modelling chain this section describes the data requirements for this modeling framework as well the implementation of each component model section 3 1 presents the meteorological data necessary to drive the models water quantity and quality data required to calibrate the models are described in section 3 2 these datasets include discharge and water

implementation of vic gl and rbm section 3 4 describes the implementation of the w2 model and the bathymetry required to describe the reservoir geometry and develop the computational grid of w2 model is presented in section 3 5 section 3 6 describes the sensitivity analysis methodology to evaluate the impact of surface meteorology and outflow regulation on the reservoir thermal stratification and temperature of water released at the skins lake spillway 3 1 meteorological forcing the selected modelling framework see fig 2 requires gridded meteorological forcing data of air temperature precipitation dewpoint temperature wind speed and direction incoming solar and longwave radiation atmospheric density and atmospheric pressure at a 3 hour timestep the data are for 1945 2018 to cover the period for which both discharge and water temperature observations are available for reservoir model calibration and validation the requisite data was produced by merging two datasets pnwnamet werner et al 2019 and era5 reanalysis copernicus climate change service c3s c3s c3s 2017 pnwnamet provides gridded observations of daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation at a spatial resolution of 0 0625 6 km for the period 1945 2012 sub daily values of precipitation and temperature and the additional required meteorological variables were estimated using the mt clim algorithm bohn et al 2013 the era5 dataset provides temperature precipitation dew point temperature surface pressure shortwave and longwave radiation as well as northward and eastward wind components at a 0 28125 31 km spatial resolution for the period 1980 2019 vapour pressure was estimated as a function of dew point temperature whereas atmospheric density was estimated from air temperature and surface pressure wind speed and wind direction were estimated from northward and eastward wind components the era5 data were disaggregated from 0 28125 spatial resolution to the pnwnamet data resolution using a second order conservative interpolation procedure remapcon2 schulzweida 2019 a temporally consistent dataset spanning 1945 2018 was created by merging variables from both datasets except for wind direction which is only available from 1980 onward as air temperature and precipitation from pnwnamet is considered more accurate than era5 we used the pnwnamet based data for 1945 2012 and extended the data by concatenating era5 air temperature and precipitation for 2013 2018 conversely incoming shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed air pressure vapor pressure and atmospheric density from era5 are deemed more accurate than those estimated from pnwnamet using mtclim therefore we used era5 based data from 1980 through 2018 and only used pnwnamet based data for the earlier period of 1945 1979 the procedure for generating the forcing data is described in detail in the accompanying supplementary material 3 2 water quantity and quality dataset 3 2 1 tributary inflow and inflow water temperature daily discharge data for all the major tributaries see fig 1b and table 1 to the nechako reservoir were obtained from water survey canada wsc discharge data for the whitesail reach white and tahtsa river tahol tributaries are seasonal and only available prior to reservoir construction 1930 1955 the record period for the remaining stations is between 1992 and 1996 except eutsu and laven where the records extend to 2013 and 2018 respectively see table 1 river water temperature records were provided by triton environmental consultants triton 1994 these data derive from studies that investigate the potential for a cold water release facility at kenney dam water temperature measurements were collected at the wsc gauging sites at the outlets of the eutsu entia cheda and chela sub basins plus to two additional locations coles and laven shown in fig 1b from june 7 9 until 12 13 october 1994 depending on location note that water temperature data is not available for white and tahol the data were recorded at 10 minute intervals and averaged to an hourly timestep for model calibration and validation the temperature data was further averaged to the daily mean over the period of record a maximum water temperature of 20 9 c was observed at chela whereas a minimum water temperature of 1 5 c was observed at the laven station the stations chela cheda entia have a similar daily water temperature regime with values around 11 c in early june reaching maxima around 19 c in july then dropping to 7 5 c in late september early october at these stations the mean water temperature for the period of record is around 13 3 c for chela and entia and 12 5 c for cheda water temperature at eutsu located on the south arm of the reservoir is warmer in comparison with a mean value of 15 c water temperature at the laven station did not exceed 11 c during the period of record with a mean value of 7 c 3 2 2 reservoir level inflow and outflow outflows at the spillway and the powerhouse diversion which provide the downstream boundary conditions of the model domain were provided by rio tinto daily powerhouse outflows are available from january 1 1955 and daily outflows at the spillway are available from june 15 1955 in addition rio tinto has estimated daily total reservoir inflow for the same record period the total net inflows were reconstructed using a water balance approach and estimated as the change in storage using observations of surface level change plus total outflow on a daily basis formally daily inflows qinflow are obtained as the sum of reservoir volume difference over a day ds dt water release at the spillway qsls and powerhouse intake qph i e qinflow ds dt qsls qph therefore the inflow estimates are potentially biased by the net difference between precipitation and evaporation over the reservoir surface area using mean annual precipitation from pnwnamet 475 mm and mean annual lake evaporation estimates 500 700 mm from the hydrological atlas of canada canadian national committee for the international hydrological decade 1978 the annual inflow bias is estimated to be very small ranging between 1 3 of average annual inflow about 60 of inflow is diverted to the powerhouse and the remaining 40 is released through the spillway in times of high inflows the percentage of water released at the spillway is increased to maintain the reservoir surface below its maximum operating level historic reservoir water level records from 1955 to 2019 were also provided by rio tinto on average the surface elevation is maintained at levels between 850 7 m in april and 852 5 m in july the inter annual variation of nechako water surface elevation is between 0 98 m and 3 92 m 3 2 3 water temperature profiles and temperature of outflow water temperature profiles collected during summer 1994 at kenney dam and natalkuz lake were provided by triton environmental consultants triton 1994 the records were measured every 10 min and averaged to an hourly timestep measurements were taken every 2 m beginning at a depth of 1 m below the surface to a depth of 57 m and 45 m at kenney dam and natalkuz lake respectively observations of the temperature of water released at the skins lake spillway were provided by rio tinto these data were recorded during the summers of 2016 and 2017 the water temperature data was recorded approximately 300 m below the spillway during summer 2016 however this station was subject to large variations in stage flow and turbulence and water temperature recordings were relocated to a site 1 km downstream during summer 2017 these data were recorded every 10 min and averaged to an hourly timestep 3 3 vic gl and rbm implementation the volume and temperature of reservoir inflow is simulated using the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 1996 coupled to the one dimensional stream temperature river basin model rbm yearsley 2009 2012 vic is a spatially distributed land surface model that simulates both water and energy balances in this study vic gl a version of the vic model upgraded at pcic that accounts for glacier processes is used schnorbus 2018 rbm is a gridded stream temperature model that uses a one dimensional mixed eulerian lagrangian approach water temperature is simulated by tracing water parcels and their flow characteristics i e speed along the channel network for a specific segment of the channel network water temperature is calculated from the local air water surface heat exchange and from heat advected from upstream and tributary inflow van vliet et al 2012 vic gl and rbm require meteorological forcing data that includes air temperature total precipitation wind speed atmospheric pressure solar radiation and atmospheric density both vic gl and rbm operate on a spatial grid of 1 16 and provide output at a daily temporal resolution base vic and rbm are described in detail in cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 yearsley 2009 2012 and van vliet et al 2012 the modification of vic into vic gl is described in schnorbus 2018 the daily modelling vic gl rbm framework is configured to model inflow volume and temperature from the six main tributaries that supply the nechako reservoir see fig 1 table 1 as identified according to wsc stations these six sub basins account for 70 of the upstream drainage area and using precipitation distribution as a proxy approximately 80 of the total inflow volume the remaining area is mainly covered by the reservoir and many small tributaries of insignificant size the hydrologic model was separately calibrated at each major tributary using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nse of log streamflow lnse to account for both low and high flows the sub basins white and tahol were calibrated using a multi site calibration that consist of constraining the model with the outlet i e tahol and white stations as well as the upstream stations laven and coles as only seasonal data are available for white and tahol the objective function included only the nse for these stations whereas both the nse and lnse of simulated flows were used at laven and coles stations the calibration period for cheda chela entia and coles is the same as the flow record period table 1 the calibration for eutsu station is 1993 1995 and the period from 2004 to 2012 is used for validation note that flow for the period between 1995 and 2004 are not available for this station the calibration period for white and tahol stations is 1946 1952 the calibration period for laven is 1977 1994 because of insufficient data the model was validated for eutsu station only due to uncertainties caused by meteorological forcing and calibration data among other factors hydrologic model outputs are often biased bias also results due to our deliberate choice to model only major inflow tributaries the bias often appears as an underestimation of the variance of streamflow and inaccurate representation of the tails of the streamflow distribution particularly in the extreme high flows e g farmer and vogel 2016 farmer et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 because the w2 model is highly sensitive to inflow data post processing of the simulated inflows is performed to correct any model deficiencies bias correction is applied using a quantile mapping approach which is widely used and extensively described in the literature e g teutschbein and seibert 2012 maraun 2013 spellman et al 2018 this method consists of matching the model s simulated inflow distribution to the distribution of observed inflow magnitude bias correction is applied to the total simulated inflows using observed total inflows because they are available for sufficiently long period to derive the inflow distribution unlike observed local streamflow the total simulated inflow is computed as the sum of the streamflow at the 6 major tributaries after the bias correction of the total simulated inflows bias corrected inflow at each tributary is estimated according to the mean contribution of each tributary to the total inflow as follows 1 q ˆ i t ω i q ˆ t t where q ˆ t t is the bias corrected total inflow at timestep t and ω i is the climatological contribution of tributary i to the total inflow defined as ω i q i q t where q i is the average flow at tributary i and q t is the average total inflow the rbm model is calibrated independently for each sub basin by minimizing the mean absolute error mae of daily average water temperature from june to october 1994 at each individual water temperature station shown in fig 1b note that because of insufficient water temperature data rbm could not be validated 3 4 ce qual w2 implementation in this study the ce qual w2 model w2 is chosen as it is a 2 dimensional longitudinal and vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model that simulates water surface elevation and temperature as well as several other water quality variables the 2 dimensional nature of the model is well suited for relatively narrow and long waterbodies such the nechako reservoir cole and wells 2018 other relevant features include the ability to simulate the onset growth and breakup of ice cover and the use of selective withdrawal calculations based on outlet geometry outflow and density this model is open source and maintained by portland state university usa for windows environment this study uses a linux version of the w2 model bornstein et al 2022 which is available on an open source github project https github com wqdss ce qual w2 linux details of ce qual w2 model can be found in cole and wells 2018 and only a short overview is presented here the w2 model is based on 2 d hydrodynamic time dependent differential equations that require initial and boundary conditions to start a w2 simulation the user must specify initial conditions of water surface elevation and water quality variables only water temperature in this case the degree to which the initial conditions affect the accuracy of the w2 model simulation depends upon the reservoir residence time and the duration of the simulation debele et al 2008 the impact of initial conditions diminishes with decreasing residence time and or longer simulation periods in this study the period between 1985 and 2017 is set as the simulation period the initial water surface elevation is set to the observed reservoir level at the beginning of the simulation whereas initial water temperature is set to 0 c given that the nechako reservoir is mostly a shallow system and the simulation period is long the effect of the initial conditions on simulated water temperature will be negligible boundary conditions required by w2 are surface boundary conditions inflow and outflow the surface boundary conditions affect the water atmosphere processes at the reservoir surface and include heat exchange solar radiation absorption and wind stress therefore the model requires meteorological forcing data that includes air temperature dew point temperature wind speed and direction and cloud cover see fig 2 precipitation is an optional meteorological input and is considered as an inflow that is supplied for each branch as vic gl is calibrated against reconstructed inflows see section 3 4 that already account for reservoir evaporation and precipitation w2 is run with evaporation and precipitation excluded from the water budget the model uses cloud cover to calculate both shortwave radiation from sun angle relationship and longwave radiation the model can use measured shortwave radiation by activating this option in the configuration file as cloud cover data are not available modifications were made such that longwave radiation is read from the meteorological file instead of calculating this flux from cloud cover for each waterbody of the nechako reservoir timeseries of the required meteorological forcing data see fig 2 are extracted from the gridded pnwanmet era5 data and supplied to the model at 3 hourly timestep note that the requirement for wind direction means that w2 can only be operated from 1980 to 2018 the w2 model allows different types of inflow boundary conditions inflows can be supplied as upstream inflow i e branch inflow or as point or non point sources called tributary and distributed tributary inflows four major tributaries feed the southern branch of the nechako reservoir see fig 1c daily inflows are supplied as tributary inflow at the corresponding locations except for the eutsuk river which is supplied as branch inflow sub basins in the northern branch of the nechako reservoir include whitesail lake basin and tahtsa lake and tahtsa reach see fig 1 discharge at the outlet of these basins is supplied to the w2 model as distributed tributaries for branch 1 representing the whitesail lake and branch 5 representing tahtsa lake and tahtsa reach the corresponding inflow water temperature at each tributary must also be supplied outflow can be specified as a lateral withdrawal or as a downstream release from the reservoir through spillways gates pumps etc lateral withdrawals are outflows that can be specified for any active cell of any w2 segment whereas the downstream outflows can only occur at the downstream segment of a branch in this study both water release at the skins lake spillway and water withdrawal at the west end of the reservoir are identified as lateral withdrawals in the model the outlet of the nechako reservoir at the skins lake spillway consists of two gates which are opened at different water levels however the outflow data is only available as the total from both gates therefore outflow was modelled using a single gate configured as a withdrawal with the w2 selective withdrawal algorithm used to determine the reservoir source layers the selective withdrawal algorithm determines the vertical zone limits based on the outflow outlet geometry and in pool densities cole and wells 2018 then it assigns flow for each layer within the identified withdrawal zone this algorithm requires setting upper and lower boundary layers from which outflows do not occur in this case an upper layer limit was set as the surface layer and a bottom layer limit was adjusted to equal the observed water temperature of the outlet the w2 model allow inputs at different timesteps hence meteorological forcing is supplied at 3 hourly timestep whereas hydrological inputs inflow inflow water temperature and outflows are supplied at daily timestep according to the literature the w2 model is relatively insensitive to hydraulic parameters dispersion coefficients and bottom friction parameters for the chezy friction model and default values were used cole and wells 2018 3 5 bathymetry and w2 computational grid bathymetry is a key element in the development of the computational grid for the w2 model three different data sources were used to estimate nechako reservoir bathymetry the first data set consisted of depth measurements taken in tahtsa lake in 2016 and a small area upstream of the skins lake spillway in 2019 which were provided by rio tinto a second data set consisted of bathymetry contours that were reconstructed from aerial photos collected before impoundment of the reservoir made available by triton environmental as such the bathymetry contours are only available for the reservoir volume located between the current and pre impoundment lake surfaces it does not provide bathymetry for lakes and river volume that existed prior to impoundment lastly the bottom elevations for the pre existing lakes were constrained using pre impoundment spot measurements taken from hand drafted bathymetry maps produced in 1951 52 by the bc department of recreation and conservation scanned copies are available via http a100 gov bc ca pub fidq viewbathymetricmaps do a digital elevation model of reservoir bathymetry was estimated using ordinary kriging on the combined elevation data sets the w2 model is configured onto a computational grid by discretizing the reservoir along the longitudinal and vertical dimensions whereby the longitudinal dimension is divided into segments and each segment is divided into vertical layers each grid cell is therefore characterized by its longitudinal location i e segment depth and cross sectional width the w2 allows for a variable grid and the segment spacing is fixed to 1 km for most grid cells however at lake connections the segment spacing was increased to ensure that branches only flow into a single segment and the segment spacing upstream of the spillway is decreased to between 300 and 500 m the depth and cross section width of the computational grids were determined using reservoir bathymetry for most layers the vertical grid spacing was fixed at 2 2 m however whitesail and tahtsa lakes are much deeper than the other lakes in the nechako reservoir resulting in many inactive layers within the computational grid therefore vertical layers lower than an elevation of 777 m which is the bottom elevation at kenney dam were spaced every 4 4 m the cross sectional width for each grid cell was estimated using the qgis plugin ce qual w2 bathymetry https plugins qgis org plugins create bathymetry according to the estimated bathymetry the final model grid has 425 segments and 86 layers w2 allows modelling a system with multiple waterbodies where each waterbody has its own water quality parameters and meteorological forcing to account for climate variability the nechako reservoir is modeled as 6 waterbodies and 18 branches according to the pre existing lakes see fig 1c bathymetry data is a key constraint on the accuracy of water surface elevation and water temperature simulations in the w2 model alcantra et al 2010 xie et al 2017 hence the accuracy of the bathymetry was evaluated by forcing w2 with observed total inflows and observed meteorological data and comparing the simulated to the observed water surface elevation for the period spanning 1986 2017 the resulting model simulation shows good agreement with the observed water surface elevation with a mean error of 0 11 m and a rmse of 0 13 m see fig 3b although this is not a strict validation of the estimated bathymetry errors are also introduced via model parametrization and the meteorological data it suggests that to a first order the volume of the reservoir is represented with reasonable accuracy 3 6 sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of water temperature to surface meteorology a 20 increase is applied individually to each of the following input forcings incoming longwave radiation incoming shortwave radiation air temperature and wind speed the impact of air temperature is evaluated by increasing air temperature by 2 c the reservoir water temperature is simulated repeatedly by increasing one forcing element each time and vertical temperature profiles are evaluated at the two key locations of kenney dam and the skins lake spillway flow regulation at the nechako reservoir has altered both downstream streamflow volume and seasonality average water release is approximately 32 m3 s at skins lake spillway during fall and winter to support chinook salmon see fig 4a the water release is increased during summer in response to warming trends to support sockeye salmon migration during the stmp period the increased flow release during summer has created an unnatural peak flow in late july as opposed to the natural peak flow occurring in june to assess the impact of flow regulation on the outflow thermograph we evaluate the response of water temperature to changes in outflow seasonality and volume at the spillway to do so we consider two scenarios for outflow at the skins lake spillway 1 a combined regulated scenario where water release at the spillway is the total of the historical spillway and powerhouse intake flows qsls qph and 2 a natural outflow scenario where water release at the spillway is equal to net inflow see fig 4a the first scenario evaluates changes to outflow volume at the spillway but where flow seasonality remains regulated and the second scenario mimics a natural outflow regime where outflow is unregulated in each scenario diversion to the powerhouse is set to zero 4 results 4 1 model performance 4 1 1 inflow and inflow water temperature table 3 presents the performance of vic gl model to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the main tributaries of the nechako reservoir during the calibration period whereas fig 5 presents observed and simulated time series at these locations the performance of vic gl varies by location with nse ranging from 0 42 entia and 0 78 eutsu and a bias between 4 and 16 low flows are relatively well produced with a lnse ranging from 0 46 cheda and 0 8 eutsu lnse is not reported for tahol and white because the data are seasonal at these stations hence these values would not be representative of the model performance reproducing low flows the total simulated inflows are evaluated for the period 1979 2017 despite the good performance of vic gl at the station scale the volume and timing of the total simulated inflows at the major tributaries do not adequately match the total historical inflow the model annual bias is variable and substantially underestimates inflow during the high inflow years see fig 3a the model bias is caused by the underestimation of peak flows during high years and runoff from creeks and small tributaries that is not considered in the model the model bias is 16 whereas the nse is 0 53 given the tendency of vic gl to underestimate inflows bias correction is applied to the simulated total inflows via quantile mapping as described in section 3 3 fig 3a compares observed and corrected simulated annual mean inflows the corrected mean annual inflows show good agreement with the observed net inflows and the nse of the corrected net inflow timeseries is 0 76 with a bias of 0 65 the model simulations from 1979 to 2017 are used to estimate the climatological contribution of each tributary to the total inflow the eutsu and tahol sub basins are the major tributaries that feed the reservoir with 35 and 33 of total inflow respectively the white tributary contributes 16 to the total inflow whereas the sub basins entia and cheda contribute 5 and 2 respectively the chela tributary contributes 9 to the total inflow these estimated contributions are applied to the total bias corrected inflow to estimate bias corrected inflow at each tributary using eq 1 fig 6 compares observed and rbm simulated daily water temperature of all tributaries from june to october 1994 in addition the observed daily maximum and minimum water temperature extracted from the hourly data are used to evaluate the model s ability to simulate daily water temperature between these ranges the mae values for daily mean temperature range from 0 86 c at laven station to 1 58 c at cheda station the model does well in representing the seasonal variability of stream temperatures the daily variability of water temperature is well represented at the north west stations laven and coles and chela but it is over estimated in the southern stations cheda and entia the observed daily variability of water temperature at eutsu is very low and overestimated in the simulation note that this station is located at the outlet of eutsuk lake which is not explicitly modelled likely explaining the poor performance of vic gl rbm at this station nevertheless the overall performance of rbm seems satisfactory due to the short length of water temperature observations one summer only it is not possible to evaluate the model under different climatic conditions 4 1 2 reservoir level and thermal conditions using the simulated bias corrected inflow and observed spillway and powerhouse outflows we evaluate the accuracy of w2 in representing the water surface elevation for the period 1986 2017 the initial water surface elevation is fixed to the observed reservoir level at the beginning of the simulation period then we evaluate model performance to simulate the wide variation of water surface elevation as suggested by cole and wells 2018 over the entire period comparisons of simulated and observed reservoir levels using corrected modelled inflow are depicted in fig 3b the w2 model simulates reservoir levels well for the entire simulation period 1986 2017 fig 3 with a rmse of 0 63 m and mean error of 0 42 m however there is an increased bias following 2003 which can be due a remaining inflow bias note that bias correction aims at matching distribution of inflows and year to year simulated and observed inflows do not necessarily match since actual records of spillway discharge and powerhouse intake are used to simulate surface elevation the bias in timing of inflow might explain the increased bias water temperature profiles are evaluated at an hourly timestep at kenney dam and natalkuz lake for the summer of 1994 w2 accurately simulates water temperature at the kenny dam at all depths with a mae of 0 59 c and rmse of 0 72 c for the entire evaluation period the mae of the timeseries at natalkuz lake is approximately 1 52 c and the rmse is 1 83 c the low performance at this location is due the poor model performance in reproducing extreme surface temperature for the period spanning july 12 to july 15 hourly simulated and observed water temperature profiles are depicted in fig 7 for selected dates the entire timeseries of temperature profiles are supplied in the supplementary material w2 does well in representing the seasonal progression of surface temperature which is approximately 15 c at end june reaches a maximum of 22 c during late july then decreases throughout september to october the main features in the seasonal progression of the water temperature profiles are also captured well by w2 including the deepening of the thermocline and epilimnion in june and july and again from august to october as well as the development of strong stratification from mid august to mid october in both the observations and simulations the top of the hypolimnion remains at a depth of approximately 30 m and has a water temperature of around 5 c for the entire evaluation period performance of the w2 model to simulate temperature of water released at the spillway is evaluated by comparing model simulation to water temperature recorded over summer 2016 and 2017 the mae of water temperature released at the spillway is 0 21 c for the period between june to october 2016 and 0 44 c for the period june to early november 2017 note that during summer 2017 water temperature was recorded 1 3 km below the spillway whereas during summer 2016 water temperature was recorded 300 m below the spillway therefore summer 2016 observations are likely more representative of the temperature of spilled water than are those collected in summer 2017 which may reflect additional warming in the channel below the spillway overall the model has small bias during summer but underestimates water temperature during autumn 4 2 meteorological and outflow sensitivity to reduce computational time the period 1986 1998 forms the basis for the meteorological sensitivity analysis and outflow scenarios we evaluate the thermal sensitivity to a 20 increase in each of the forcing data separately at kenney dam and skins lake spillway fig 8 the water temperature profile is most sensitive to changes in incoming longwave or shortwave radiation a 20 increase in longwave radiation leads to a surface temperature increase of 1 65 c at kenney dam and 1 71 c at the spillway and an increase in shortwave radiation leads to a surface temperature increase of 1 14 c at the spillway and 1 12 c at kenney dam increasing air temperature by 2 c leads to a 0 30 c increase in surface water temperature increasing the wind speed by 20 increases evaporative heat loss which decreases the temperature at the water surface by 0 4 c at both the kenney dam and the skins lake spillway locations increased air temperature longwave radiation and solar radiation increases the temperature of the water column up to 30 m below surface level at the skins lake spillway and kenney dam increased wind speed decreases water temperature until about 10 m below surface level and slightly increases water temperature between 10 m and 27 m below surface level in deeper layers i e below 40 m the water temperature is insensitive to changes in meteorological input at both locations diverting all outflow to the skins lake spillway has a strong impact on the water temperature profile surface temperature is only slightly elevated and a much weaker temperature gradient develops as compared to the reference simulation fig 8 consequently the largest water temperature increase occurs at approximately 20 m below the surface and water temperature remains elevated throughout the profile at skins lake and to a depth of approximately 45 m at kenney dam the result is similar for both outflow scenarios although the natural flow regime generates the weaker temperature gradient i e largest temperature increase at depth as mentioned the surface temperature response is small being almost negligible at skins lake and less than 0 5 c at kenney dam at kenney dam water temperature below roughly 45 m is generally insensitive to changes in the outflow regime fig 4 compares the outflow hydrographs and thermographs at the skins lake spillway for the historical outflow scenario plus the two hypothetical scenarios in the combined regulated scenario qsls qph although the volume of spillway outflow is increased the seasonality is still highly regulated with large baseflow 150 175 m3 s throughout much of the year and a large outflow pulse over the stmp period this contrasts with the natural qsls net inflow scenario with lower baseflow in fall and winter followed by a large freshet that peaks in june releasing outflow by restoring a more natural regime at the spillway leads to releasing cooler surface water during spring and early summer i e during the snowmelt freshet but warmer water during fall compared to the current water release conditions outflow water temperature in the combined regulated scenario adheres more closely to historical release conditions during spring but is warmer in the fall and early winter during the summer particularly the stmp period outflow water temperature for the scenarios does not depart markedly from what transpired under historical outflow conditions results for the meteorological and outflow sensitivity are further synthesized in fig 9 which shows the mean variation of water temperature by depth up to 33 m below the surface over the year at the spillway with respect to the reference simulation increases in the meteorological forcings are most pronounced near the surface whereas changing the outflow regime has a larger effect on water temperature throughout the profile 5 discussion the nechako reservoir is a large multi basin reservoir with narrow southern and northern arcs implementing a detailed hydrologic model that captures all streams that feeds the reservoir is challenging due to the complex geometry of the reservoir itself and limited data representing the spatial variability of reservoir hydrology to constrain such model in this paper the hydrologic model vic gl was implemented to the six major tributaries feeding the reservoir the developed model was able to simulate both the spatial variability of discharge and the overall total volume of inflow however the model failed to reproduce the inter annual variability and high flow years inaccuracy of representing high streamflow extreme and streamflow variability may be caused by a precipitation bias it is likely that the gridded precipitation dataset used here underestimate extreme precipitation and inter annual precipitation variability which resulted in poor hydrologic model performance to simulate high inflow years in our case modelling only the six major tributaries also contributed to model bias which manifested as underestimation of actual inflows the area of the watershed that is not modelled may contribute more inflow during high flow years which could have exacerbated the model bias during high flow years in addition inaccuracy of representing high streamflow extreme and streamflow variability is a common issue in hydrological modelling farmer and vogel 2016 farmer et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 when simulated streamflow are routed through a reservoir model inflow bias may severely affect water resources decisions farmer et al 2018 hence bias correction of hydrological model outputs is a necessary step when used as an upstream boundary condition for a hydrodynamic model due to limited records of water temperature of tributaries temperature of water release and water column in the reservoir the model was calibrated only to summer temperatures the model simulates accurately the temperature of the water column and temperature of water released at the spillway during the warmer months of july and august but underestimates water temperature from mid september to early october with a bias of 1 26 c additional water temperature measurements extending beyond summer would be necessary to improve the model performance during fall and early spring nevertheless retrospective simulation shows that the model is able to simulate the wide variation of water surface elevations fig 3 and the seasonality of evaporation flux water surface temperature and ice cover see fig 10 the onset if the ice thaw is around late january and ice break up occurs around early april day 97 the freeze back occurs around late november to early december day 330 at tahtsa lake and day 339 at kenney dam although we have no direct observations of lake ice phenology for the reservoir these dates are generally consistent with regional estimates for instance the hydrological atlas of canada estimates freeze over lake completely ice covered to occur between november 15th and december 1st and ice free conditions to occur between april 15th and may 1st allen 1978 using data from the global lake and river ice phenology database benson et al 2000 for nine regional lakes anahim burns hourglass kathlyn lakelse nukko one eye stuart and williston we obtain a mean freeze over date of november 27 day 331 and a mean ice off date of april 30th day 120 the variation of ice cover is affected by the location and temperature of inflows and outflows evaporative wind variations over the ice surface and effects of water movements on the ice to water exchange cole and wells 2018 the evaporation flux is also spatially variable over the lake fig 10d the lower evaporation heat flux at northwestern part of the reservoir i e tahtsa lake coincides with cooler surface water as compared to the other locations fig 10b spatial variability of evaporation due to spatial differences in surface water temperature was observed in other lakes in the region e g spence and hedstrom 2015 the sensitivity analysis shows that radiation is the dominant heat source to the reservoir increased air temperature also warms the epilimnion whereas increased wind speed cools the epilimnion temperature these results suggest that reservoir surface temperature is most vulnerable to possible future increases in solar and longwave radiations however projected changes in solar radiation over the coming century are uncertain predominantly due to variation in the treatment of cloud cover and aerosols in global and regional climate models bartók et al 2017 chen 2021 although no literature on projected changes in longwave radiation could be found rising air temperatures and the associated increase in water vapor would presumably see an increase in downwelling longwave radiation our analysis indicates that air temperature is not as dominant a factor in surface heat exchange and suggests that reservoir water temperature will be less vulnerable to increasing air temperature modifying the outflow rate at the spillway changes the thermal stratification of the reservoir fig 9 but has less overall impact on water temperature at the surface although adopting a more natural outflow regime at the spillway would potentially reduce the surface water temperature in the spring such a regulatory change would be ineffective at reducing the outflow temperature during the critical stmp period in july and august overall the results of the reference simulation and the two outflow scenarios indicate that outflow temperature at the spillway during the stmp is insensitive to any plausible outflow regime these results agree with the findings of triton 2021 in that total volume of water released during the stmp does not correlate with the number of exceedances of water temperature above 20 c at the downstream thermal constraint historically the stmp was efficient at maintaining water temperature in the nechako river below 20 c macdonald et al 2012 fraser basin council 2015 however this may not be the case under rising air temperatures for example summer 2013 saw a record of twenty two days out of the thirty day control period july 20th to august 20th with water temperature exceeding 20 c downstream due to channel warming below the reservoir as a result of extreme high air temperatures despite a record volume of water released from the spillway during the stmp period triton 2021 this suggest that the efficiency of stmp to provide cool water during the sockeye salmon migration could be limited in a warming climate where no management options currently exists to reduce outflow water temperature water withdrawal from the hypolimnion at kenney dam could potentially help regulate water temperature in the nechako river for consideration of a cold water release facility at kenney dam it has been suggested that a temperature of 10 c would be necessary to reduce the occurrence of water temperature above 20 c in the nechako river above the stuart confluence during the stmp period lawrence and pieters 2005 retrospective simulation shows that the thermocline layer lies between 10 and 30 m and water temperatures below 10 c are available on average at depths below 20 m during the stmp period this is consistent with the findings of triton 1994 where the depth of the 10 c isotherm was observed to be between 17 m and 21 m from june through august currently there is no water release at kenny dam the proposed model would be useful to provide insight on how different selective water withdrawal scenarios at kenny dam could impact downstream water temperature requirements in the same context the model could also be used to regulate reservoir thermal stratification and water release temperature through reservoir operations he et al 2022 to do so the model should be linked with a reservoir operation model i e decision making model in this study the vic gl and rbm models were used to provide upstream boundary conditions of the ce qual w2 model whereas historical outflows were provided as downstream boundary conditions to develop adaptation strategies or for climate change impact assessment coupling this modelling framework with a reservoir operation model forced with simulated streamflow is critical using a reservoir operation model based on a dynamic approach aiming at designing operations to accommodate water use trade offs forced with inflow scenarios is an efficient way to anticipate the reservoir adaptation strategies giudici et al 2021 6 conclusion motivated by the need to understand and manage reservoir impacts on water temperature in the nechako river under future climates a modelling system able to provide prognostic estimates of in reservoir water temperature and outflow temperature of the nechako reservoir has been developed simulation of the nechako reservoir system is undertaken by coupling hydrologic stream water temperature and hydrodynamic models vic gl rbm and ce qual w2 the vic gl and rbm models are used to simulate inflow volume and temperature from the surrounding drainage area and the ce qual w2 model is used to simulate processes controlling reservoir water level and temperature vic gl performance is reasonable although bias correction of the model output was necessary given the sensitivity of ce qual w2 to the inflow data bias the limited records of the stream water temperature only one summer and station discharge did not permit calibration and evaluation of vic gl and rbm under different climatic conditions the ce qual w2 model was evaluated by modelling the entire period of simulation continuously instead of calibrating and validating on two independent periods the model is able to simulate the wide variation of water surface elevations it is also capable of simulating the in reservoir and outlet water temperature accurately during the warmer months of july and august however additional data are required to improve the model performance during fall sensitivity analysis of the ce qual w2 model was conducted using perturbations of surface forcing solar and longwave radiation air temperature and wind speed the modifications result in changes in both the surface temperature and the temperature gradient with depth with the model showing the greatest sensitivity to perturbations in incoming solar and longwave radiation forcing the model with different outflow scenarios the results show that outflow water temperature is weakly sensitive to outflow volume during the summer temperature management program stmp period i e july 20th to august 20th a time which is critical for salmon migration these findings suggest that the efficiency of stmp to provide cool water downstream would be limited during extreme high air temperatures however the direct relationship between water temperature at the spillway and the number of exceedances of water temperature above 20 c at finmoore constraint location will be the subject of future study the integrated model was applied in this paper to simulate the nechako reservoir under historical operations of water withdrawal at the powerhouse in take and water release at the skins lake spillway it has been demonstrated that the modelling system is able to realistically simulate the volume and thermal dynamics of the nechako reservoir system in future work this model will be used to explore the reservoir response to future

7819,study region the study region was the sakura river a tributary of lake kasumigaura japan study focus we asked whether particulate organic phosphorus pop contributed to the p cycle in rivers previous studies have focused on the interaction between po4 3 and particulate inorganic p pip but our study focused on whether pop could also be the source of po4 3 new hydrological insights for the region after rain events during irrigation concentrations of suspended particles and particulate p pp increased pop accounted for 42 4 of pp concentrations the pip and pop concentrations were both positively correlated with suspended particle concentrations the po4 3 concentrations were significantly higher during decomposition experiments when suspended particles were present in the water decomposition experiments revealed that the p composition changed and the proportion of organic p decreased as dna p disappeared from the pp the fact that the dop concentration was significantly lower in the treatment with suspended particles than without suspended particles suggested that dop mineralization rates were increased by the presence of suspended particles in addition to mineral sorbed p the pop derived from the irrigation of paddy fields may also be bioavailable graphical abstract ga1 keywords organic phosphorus springtime particulate phosphorus dissolved phosphorus data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the phosphorus p supplied by tributary rivers is important for lake ecosystems because p is required by all living organisms and is often a limiting nutrient in lakes for example recent cyanobacterial blooms in lakes have been caused by the orthophosphate po4 3 supplied by tributary rivers michalak et al 2013 a large amount of p is associated with suspended particles particulate p pp and pp controls po4 3 concentrations in solution through adsorption and desorption of po4 3 froelich 1988 knowledge of the potential bioavailability and the role of pp in a river is therefore a prerequisite for understanding the effects of tributary rivers on lake ecosystems po4 3 is the most bioavailable form of inorganic p among p species researchers have studied the po4 3 concentration in solution in equilibrium between a solution and sediment solids dorich et al 1985 jarvie et al 2005 yi et al 2017 this po4 3 concentration is termed epc0 when po4 3 concentrations exceed the epc0 value po4 3 is adsorbed onto riverbed sediment solids jarvie et al 2005 furthermore the minerals binding po4 3 can also be involved in controlling the po4 3 concentration in solution because naoh extractable fe and al bound p desorbs under high ph conditions pacini and gächter 1999 jin et al 2006 these reactions have been widely studied because they directly control po4 3 concentrations in solution roberts and cooper 2018 mcdowell et al 2020 wilcock et al 2020 information about p groups other than po4 3 in river water including organic p and pyro polyphosphate is extremely limited gao et al 2020 the reason for this paucity of information is the assumption that organic p is a minor contributor to the p in solution however circumstantial evidence has suggested that there is a high potential for particulate organic p pop to serve as a source of po4 3 in agricultural watersheds agricultural activities involve use of p containing fertilizers in the watershed annaheim et al 2015 and those fertilizers contain bioavailable p other than orthophosphate turner and leytem 2004 the p groups in animal manure include orthophosphate monoesters e g mononucleotides and myo inositol hexakisphosphate and orthophosphate diesters e g dna p and phospholipids when such p rich solids are supplied to a riverbed brennan et al 2017 periphyton can take up the p and store it as polyphosphate in their cells rier et al 2016 in fact organic p accumulates onto riverbed sediment wang and pant 2010 mcdowell and hill 2015 and during or after rainfall events a significant proportion of pp is composed of organic p pacini and gächter 1999 shinohara et al 2018b the principal question addressed in this study was whether pop contributes to the p cycle in rivers because many models that simulate conditions in tributary rivers and lakes ignore the bioavailability of organic p zeng et al 2006 kim et al 2017 the role of organic p may have been underestimated or entirely overlooked and the effects of organic p may be large in tributary rivers we hypothesized that 1 both pop and pip are significant components of pp and 2 pop is composed of labile p groups during the water irrigation period in the springtime in japan to test these hypotheses we first carried out long term 2001 2015 monitoring of the forms of p in a tributary river of lake kasumigaura japan and we subsequently monitored the same river in the watershed of the lake from october 2017 to september 2018 the river we studied was appropriate for testing our hypothesis because cyanobacterial blooms have been observed in the vicinity of the river mouth every year tomioka et al 2011 furthermore phytoplankton photosynthetic rates are high during the springtime in lake kasumigaura shinohara et al 2022 we then carried out a 30 day organic matter decomposition experiment to identify the effects of decomposition on the po4 3 concentration in the river water finally we used 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy to track how the compositions of the p groups changed during the decomposition experiment 2 methods 2 1 study sites and sampling lake kasumigaura is located approximately 60 km northeast of tokyo and is the second largest freshwater lake in japan 171 km2 fig 1 the lake is eutrophic the concentrations of total n and p in its water average 1 1 mg n l 1 and 0 12 mg p l 1 respectively cyanobacterial blooms have been observed in the lake every year since the 1980 s tomioka et al 2011 we studied the sakura river which is a tributary to lake kasumigaura the sakura river is the largest river in the lake kasumigaura watershed which covers an area of 350 3 km2 in 2017 the mean discharge of the sakura river was 3 31 m3 s 1 paddy fields in the watershed are irrigated from april to june the ranking of land use types in the lake kasumigaura watershed is forest 40 paddy field 20 agriculture 14 urban area 16 and water surface 10 for both long term 2001 2014 and short term 2017 2018 observations we made monthly measurements in the sakura river fig 1 we used an acid washed container to collect surface water from the river the samples were stored with ice packs and brought to our laboratory as quickly as possible 2 h h in the laboratory we filtered the water 200 ml through a pre combusted 450 c for 4 h glass fiber filter type gf f nominal pore size 0 7 µm whatman buckinghamshire uk the filters were stored at 20 c until analysis concentrations of suspended particles were measured by first filtering water through a precombusted pre weighed gf f filter the filters were dried overnight 16 h at 105 c and then weighed 2 2 sample collection for decomposition experiments for the decomposition experiments we collected water samples in an acid washed polyethylene bottle 20 l in november 2020 and april 2021 in november 2020 the concentration of suspended particles was low 6 5 mg l 1 and we collected water for analysis of the dop and po4 3 concentrations during the decomposition experiment in april 2021 the concentration of suspended particles was high 57 mg l 1 the weather conditions in november were characterized by consecutive days without rain fig s1 in contrast in april 2021 the sampling was conducted just after several rainy days the large differences in the concentrations of suspended particles might have been caused by this difference in meteorological conditions and resulting runoff amounts the protocol for the decomposition experiment was the same in november and april in april however we also collected river water 12 l to track p groups with 31p nmr to determine the initial conditions for the 31p nmr we filtered 4 l of the sample through a gf f glass fiber filter and stored the filtrate in the laboratory at 20 c until analysis 2 3 decomposition experiments we conducted decomposition experiments twice once in the winter and once in the spring the experiments were based on the experimental design of kawasaki et al 2013 river water 500 ml and filtrates thereof 0 7 µm were incubated in glass bottles five replicates of both the river water and filtrates the glass bottles were covered with aluminum foil and then shaken with a rotary shaker 60 rpm we incubated the bottles at 20 c for 30 days in the dark and sampled water at 3 7 14 22 and 30 days after the start of the incubation the water was filtered through a gf f glass fiber filter and the filters and filtrates were then stored at 30 c until analysis of dissolved p dp and po4 3 to track p groups with 31p nmr during the decomposition of organic matter 12 l of river water that had been collected in april was transferred to a 20 l polyethylene bottle that was shaken with a rotary shaker 60 rpm to maintain oxygenated conditions we shook the bottle vigorously at least once a day we filtered the water samples 4 l seven and 30 days after the start of the incubation the water was filtered through gf f glass fiber filters then the filters stored at 20 c until prepared for analysis 2 4 chemical analyses 2 4 1 pp pip and pop concentrations the pp and pip concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically for pp the samples were combusted 470 c for 2 h and then the p was extracted with hcl 5 ml 1 mol l 1 in accord with suzumura 2008 to measure the pip concentration we extracted p with hcl 5 ml 1 mol l 1 without combustion the extracts were filtered through a membrane filter pvdf millipore burlington usa nominal pore size 0 45 µm and diluted by a factor of 10 suzumura 2008 the p concentrations were then analyzed using the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 the pop concentrations were equated to the difference between the pp and pip concentrations the results represent the mean values of duplicate or triplicate samples the limit of detection for the molybdenum blue method was no more than 1 0 μg p l 1 for po4 3 for dissolved p concentrations we used an auto analyzer bltec tokyo japan to analyze po4 3 and dissolved p dp for po4 3 and dp we used the molybdenum blue method before and after digestion with a persulfate solution american public health association 2005 respectively we analyzed dp and srp by the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 dissolved organic p dop was calculated as the difference between dp and po4 3 ji et al 2017 2 4 2 31p nmr analyses we used a sodium hydroxide naoh ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta extraction method to identify the different classes of organic compounds in the samples cade menun and preston 1996 this method is conventionally used for analysis of the following p groups orthophosphate orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diesters pyrophosphate and polyphosphate turner et al 2003 briefly the filters were extracted with 50 ml of naoh 0 25 mol l 1 edta 0 05 mol l 1 for 4 h at room temperature 20 c the extracts were filtered through gf f glass fiber filters and the filtrates were then lyophilized for several days the lyophilized samples were subsequently stored in a freezer 20 c until nmr analysis for the 31p nmr analysis we dissolved the lyophilized powder into a naoh edta solution containing 1 mol l 1 naoh and 50 mmol l 1 edta 1 35 ml in deuterium oxide 0 15 ml we then sonicated the samples to help dissolve the powder into the solution which was subsequently passed through a membrane filter nominal pore size 0 45 µm millipore burlington ma usa transferred to an nmr tube ϕ 5 mm and analyzed for 31p we measured 31p nmr spectra with a jnm eca 500 spectrometer jeol tokyo japan operated at 202 5 mhz for 31p samples were analyzed using a 15 μs pulse 30 a delay time of 5 s and an acquisition time of 0 64 s with broadband proton decoupling approximately 15 000 scans 23 h were acquired for each sample a d3po4 standard sigma aldrich japan k k tokyo japan was diluted by a factor of approximately 10 8 5 and used as an external standard for assignment of p groups we adjusted the orthophosphate peak to 6 0 ppm liu et al 2015 the spectra were then processed by line broadening of 2 hz and the relative proportion of each peak was quantified the specific ranges of the p compound classes were as follows orthophosphate 6 0 ppm orthophosphate monoesters 3 5 5 5 ppm orthophosphate diesters 3 5 to 5 5 ppm and pyrophosphate 3 5 to 4 0 ppm the nmr spectra that we obtained exhibited overlapping peaks of the compounds present each p compound was quantified by multiplying its relative proportion in the 31p nmr spectrum by the total p concentration in the naoh edta extract 2 5 statistical analysis we used paired t tests to identify differences in the composition of p compound classes between december and july we also used the pearson correlation coefficient r for trend analyses we used r ver 3 4 1 software for statistical analysis a type i error rate p 0 05 was considered to be significant 3 results 3 1 seasonal and long term changes of p supply from the sakura river we analyzed long term changes of p concentrations in the sakura river the pp accounted for the largest percentage 78 9 of the total p mean 0 076 mgp l 1 in the dissolved p the po4 3 concentrations were comparable to the dop concentrations which averaged 0 010 mgp l 1 the concentrations of forms of p and suspended particles in the sakura river varied seasonally fig 2a d the pp concentrations were high in april and july 0 11 mgp l 1 in both months the dop concentrations were highest in june 0 019 mgp l 1 the po4 3 concentrations were highest in october the concentrations of suspended particles were consistent with the pp changes r 0 86 p 0 01 analysis of the long term trend of monthly mean discharge m3 s 1 revealed that the discharge increased significantly in the springtime from 2001 to 2014 fig 2e r 0 51 p 0 01 in contrast the pp po4 3 and dop concentrations in pop during the spring did not change significantly from 2001 to 2014 fig 2f r 0 12 p 0 47 fig s2 the load discharge l q relationship exhibited a clear increase of pp load l with increase of discharge q the pp loads were a nonlinear function of discharge fig 3a short term monitoring of pip and pop revealed that pip and pop accounted for an average of 57 6 and 42 4 respectively of pp the concentrations of pip and pop increased significantly with the concentrations of suspended particles fig 3b 3 2 decomposition experiments at high and low concentrations of suspended particles we carried out simulated decomposition experiments with suspended particles from the river water when the concentration of suspended particles was high in april 2021 and when it was low in november 2020 fig 4 when the concentration of suspended particles was low the initial dop concentration was 0 0081 mgp l 1 and the initial po4 3 concentration was 0 005 mgp l 1 without suspended particles the dop concentration increased to 0 011 mgp l 1 by day 3 and the po4 3 concentration decreased to 0 002 mgp l 1 the dop and po4 3 concentrations subsequently changed only slightly fig 4a when the concentration of suspended particles was high fig 4b the initial dop and po4 3 concentrations were 0 009 and 0 029 mgp l 1 respectively without suspended particles the dop concentration increased to 0 014 mgp l 1 by day 3 and subsequently decreased to 0 010 mgp l 1 in contrast the po4 3 concentration decreased to 0 025 mgp l 1 by day 3 and subsequently increased only slightly to 0 026 mgp l 1 the changes in the concentrations of dop and po4 3 differed in the treatments with and without suspended particles the change in the po4 3 concentrations was most remarkable when the concentration of suspended particles was low the po4 3 concentration dropped to 0 003 mgp l 1 but then increased to 0 006 mgp l 1 this pattern was very different from the pattern without suspended particles table 1 however the dop concentration was significantly lower with suspended particles than without them table 1 when the concentration of suspended particles was high the initial dop and po4 3 concentrations were 0 009 and 0 029 mgp l 1 respectively the dop concentration then gradually decreased to 0 008 mgp l 1 whereas the po4 3 concentration increased markedly to 0 064 mgp l 1 at day 30 fig 4b the dop concentration was significantly lower 25 with suspended particles than without suspended particles whereas the po4 3 concentration with suspended particles was significantly higher than and twice the concentration without suspended particles table 1 3 3 changes in the composition due to decomposition assessed with 31p nmr use of 31p nmr revealed a variety of chemical forms of p in the suspended particles fig 5 we found orthophosphate orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diesters and pyrophosphate at day 0 initial conditions orthophosphate accounted for 72 0 of the detected p groups whereas orthophosphate monoesters dna p and pyrophosphate accounted for only 15 0 7 3 and 5 7 respectively decomposition of pp was apparent from the changes in the composition of the p groups the p groups other than orthophosphate decreased from 28 0 to 15 6 of the detected p groups seven days after the start of the experiment dna p had disappeared undetectable level whereas peaks of orthophosphate monoesters 19 1 and pyrophosphate 7 4 were still present after 30 days of decomposition there was still no dna p peak whereas a tiny peak 17 8 ppm of phosphonate appeared fig 5b 4 discussion there have been numerous studies of labile or recalcitrant particulate organic carbon poc and their potential role in the release of dissolved organic c doc into rivers yoshimura et al 2010 johnson et al 2018 given the numerous studies of poc and doc in rivers it is surprising that the role of pop in rivers has scarcely been investigated suspended particles in rivers are supplied from a variety of sources including runoff from agricultural fields ekholm et al 2000 franke et al 2020 and bank erosion bull 1997 green et al 1999 packett 2020 and those sources certainly contain organic p pacini and gächter 1999 mcdowell et al 2004 our study was undertaken during only a single season the irrigation periods in the springtime but we found two major roles of suspended particles they served as a source of po4 3 and they increased the rate of dop mineralization 4 1 effects of pp on po4 3 the changes of p composition and the proportions of each p group were fingerprints of decomposition and production evidence obtained from the decomposition experiment and 31p nmr analyses indicated that organic p composition changed and the proportion of organic p decreased e g dna p fig 4 and 5 and table 2 our study could not quantitatively determine whether pop or pip was the major contributor to the po4 3 but the decrease in the organic p concentration was consistent with the notion that pop decomposed decomposition of dna p was similar in lake sediments decomposition causes a decrease with depth in the contribution of dna p to the total p ahlgren et al 2005 reitzel et al 2007 recent studies of environmental dna edna have also determined that the rapidity of the decomposition of dna depends on conditions in the rivers pilliod et al 2014 nukazawa et al 2018 the magnitudes of the changes of po4 3 and dop concentrations differed between the treatments with high and low concentrations of suspended particles fig 4a and b pp is generally supplied when there is an increase of river discharge stutter et al 2008 and the l q curve in the current study indicated that the pp load increased when the discharge increased fig 3a although the pp concentration was constant during 2001 2014 fig 2 f monthly mean discharge from april to june fig 2e implied that pp loading increased significantly 4 2 dop mineralization another remarkable finding of the current study was that dop mineralization was promoted by the presence of suspended particles suspended particles in rivers may include minerals as well as attached bacteria adhikari et al 2019 the attached bacteria may be able to mineralize dissolved organic matter just as they do in the ocean lapoussière et al 2011 kong et al 2021 the role of bacteria in rivers has been scarcely explored but production of epilithic bacteria has been observed tsuchiya et al 2021 the sakura river also has a gravel bed and bacteria attached to that gravel may contribute to mineralization of organic matter we did not measure attached or free living bacteria in our study but the increases we observed in the mineralization of dissolved matter in the presence of suspended particles were similar to the analogous increases reported by geeraert et al 2016 further investigation of the relationships between bed type bacterial community structure and their contribution to dop mineralization in rivers is warranted although dop mineralization is promoted by the presence of suspended particles the fact that the dop concentration remained at 82 of the initial dop concentration after a 30 day incubation indicated that the dop was largely recalcitrant this inference is inconsistent with previous understanding that the dop in rivers is labile islam et al 2013 the exact reason for the recalcitrance of the dop in the current study is unclear but phospholipids may form recalcitrant particles by forming liposome like micromolecular organic complexes nagata and kirchman 1992 suzumura et al 1998 and such particles are protected from enzymatic cleavage nagata and kirchman 1992 4 3 environmental implications the loading of particulate p from tributary streams is the primary source of the p in lakes based on the area of the basin of lake kasumigaura 46 km2 and the l q curve of the sakura river fig 3 we estimated the pp loading from the sakura river to be 1 96 mg m 2 d 1 this amount of pp loading was much greater than the maximum p release rate from the bottom sediments of lake kasumigaura ishii et al 2010 increases in the concentrations of suspended particles and pp are caused by runoff of rain water and irrigation water from paddy fields care with respect to organic p decomposition should be taken if p is provided to a river from agricultural activities e g tillage and irrigation farahani et al 2020 the source of the high pp concentrations during the spring in japan could reflect inputs from paddy fields the pp concentrations were highest during the spring in lake kasumigaura s watershed fig 2a furthermore rain events increase pp loads in a nonlinear manner fig 3a our finding of the role of pop in p cycling may be relevant to other rivers because paddy fields are common in many asian countries such as china song et al 2005 cui et al 2020 and korea cho et al 2000 the timeseries of the change of dop concentrations was similar to the case of doc decomposition in lake water reported by kawasaki et al 2013 in which bacterial c assimilation was responsible for the increase of the doc concentration during the first 3 7 days of the study our study revealed a slight increase of the dop concentrations in contrast to the decrease of the po4 3 concentrations our study did not include analysis of bacterial po4 3 uptake but future work will need to address the interactions between dop and po4 3 mediated by bacteria as well as the increase in dop mineralization associated with attached bacteria this study was limited by the fact that we had no information about the sources of the pop and dop and how much they contributed to the po4 3 concentration relative to the mineral bound p we assumed that the pop probably came from paddy fields based on the seasonality of the pp concentrations caused by the rain events but we had no information about dop sources possible sources of dop include soil water and groundwater mcdowell et al 2004 for the further understanding of dop mineralization information of p compound classes in dop e g monbet et al 2009 and enzymatic activities e g bray et al 2017 under a variety of riverbed conditions is also warranted for a future study future work should aim to identify the sources of suspended particles and the formation as well as bioavailability of dop and pop the relative contributions of pop and mineral bound p to po4 3 will also be needed in future work that expands on the results of the current study the epc0 the po4 3 concentration in equilibrium with the suspended particles determines the contribution of mineral bound p however our study showed that the composition of organic p changed during the decomposition of organic matter fig 5 and the proportion of organic p species decreased these results qualitatively indicated that pop contributed to po4 3 interestingly we found a tiny peak of phosphonates at day 30 of the incubation fig 4 phosphonates are considered to be formed under extremely p limited conditions in the ocean karl et al 2008 repeta et al 2016 but how phosphonates are produced in lacustrine environments is still unclear species of phosphonates such as aminoethylphosphonic acid shinohara et al 2018a and methylphosphonic acid khatun et al 2019 may involve oxic methane production during lyase activity grossart et al 2011 mcgrath et al 2013 the presence of newly formed phosphonates means that understanding of the activities of bacterial taxa as well as their uptake and decomposition of phosphonates may be needed in future investigations of decomposition processes 5 conclusions we analyzed the bioavailability of organic p in river water which has not been considered in many studies the primary finding of the current study was that the pop composition changed and the proportion of organic p orthophosphate monoesters and diesters decreased during decomposition of organic matter a dna p peak was observed by 31p nmr on day 0 but the peak disappeared by day 7 when the po4 3 concentration increased we also found that the presence of suspended particles promoted mineralization of dop dop concentrations during the decomposition experiment were 25 less with suspended particles than without these results suggested that the pop in the river had a high potential to supply po4 3 to the river water the timeseries of dop concentrations revealed that the dop concentration increased during the first three days and then decreased slightly because of mineralization although most of the dop was recalcitrant and remained for 30 days the current study therefore inferred that both pip and pop are the source of po4 3 in river water role of the funding source this

7819,study region the study region was the sakura river a tributary of lake kasumigaura japan study focus we asked whether particulate organic phosphorus pop contributed to the p cycle in rivers previous studies have focused on the interaction between po4 3 and particulate inorganic p pip but our study focused on whether pop could also be the source of po4 3 new hydrological insights for the region after rain events during irrigation concentrations of suspended particles and particulate p pp increased pop accounted for 42 4 of pp concentrations the pip and pop concentrations were both positively correlated with suspended particle concentrations the po4 3 concentrations were significantly higher during decomposition experiments when suspended particles were present in the water decomposition experiments revealed that the p composition changed and the proportion of organic p decreased as dna p disappeared from the pp the fact that the dop concentration was significantly lower in the treatment with suspended particles than without suspended particles suggested that dop mineralization rates were increased by the presence of suspended particles in addition to mineral sorbed p the pop derived from the irrigation of paddy fields may also be bioavailable graphical abstract ga1 keywords organic phosphorus springtime particulate phosphorus dissolved phosphorus data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the phosphorus p supplied by tributary rivers is important for lake ecosystems because p is required by all living organisms and is often a limiting nutrient in lakes for example recent cyanobacterial blooms in lakes have been caused by the orthophosphate po4 3 supplied by tributary rivers michalak et al 2013 a large amount of p is associated with suspended particles particulate p pp and pp controls po4 3 concentrations in solution through adsorption and desorption of po4 3 froelich 1988 knowledge of the potential bioavailability and the role of pp in a river is therefore a prerequisite for understanding the effects of tributary rivers on lake ecosystems po4 3 is the most bioavailable form of inorganic p among p species researchers have studied the po4 3 concentration in solution in equilibrium between a solution and sediment solids dorich et al 1985 jarvie et al 2005 yi et al 2017 this po4 3 concentration is termed epc0 when po4 3 concentrations exceed the epc0 value po4 3 is adsorbed onto riverbed sediment solids jarvie et al 2005 furthermore the minerals binding po4 3 can also be involved in controlling the po4 3 concentration in solution because naoh extractable fe and al bound p desorbs under high ph conditions pacini and gächter 1999 jin et al 2006 these reactions have been widely studied because they directly control po4 3 concentrations in solution roberts and cooper 2018 mcdowell et al 2020 wilcock et al 2020 information about p groups other than po4 3 in river water including organic p and pyro polyphosphate is extremely limited gao et al 2020 the reason for this paucity of information is the assumption that organic p is a minor contributor to the p in solution however circumstantial evidence has suggested that there is a high potential for particulate organic p pop to serve as a source of po4 3 in agricultural watersheds agricultural activities involve use of p containing fertilizers in the watershed annaheim et al 2015 and those fertilizers contain bioavailable p other than orthophosphate turner and leytem 2004 the p groups in animal manure include orthophosphate monoesters e g mononucleotides and myo inositol hexakisphosphate and orthophosphate diesters e g dna p and phospholipids when such p rich solids are supplied to a riverbed brennan et al 2017 periphyton can take up the p and store it as polyphosphate in their cells rier et al 2016 in fact organic p accumulates onto riverbed sediment wang and pant 2010 mcdowell and hill 2015 and during or after rainfall events a significant proportion of pp is composed of organic p pacini and gächter 1999 shinohara et al 2018b the principal question addressed in this study was whether pop contributes to the p cycle in rivers because many models that simulate conditions in tributary rivers and lakes ignore the bioavailability of organic p zeng et al 2006 kim et al 2017 the role of organic p may have been underestimated or entirely overlooked and the effects of organic p may be large in tributary rivers we hypothesized that 1 both pop and pip are significant components of pp and 2 pop is composed of labile p groups during the water irrigation period in the springtime in japan to test these hypotheses we first carried out long term 2001 2015 monitoring of the forms of p in a tributary river of lake kasumigaura japan and we subsequently monitored the same river in the watershed of the lake from october 2017 to september 2018 the river we studied was appropriate for testing our hypothesis because cyanobacterial blooms have been observed in the vicinity of the river mouth every year tomioka et al 2011 furthermore phytoplankton photosynthetic rates are high during the springtime in lake kasumigaura shinohara et al 2022 we then carried out a 30 day organic matter decomposition experiment to identify the effects of decomposition on the po4 3 concentration in the river water finally we used 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy to track how the compositions of the p groups changed during the decomposition experiment 2 methods 2 1 study sites and sampling lake kasumigaura is located approximately 60 km northeast of tokyo and is the second largest freshwater lake in japan 171 km2 fig 1 the lake is eutrophic the concentrations of total n and p in its water average 1 1 mg n l 1 and 0 12 mg p l 1 respectively cyanobacterial blooms have been observed in the lake every year since the 1980 s tomioka et al 2011 we studied the sakura river which is a tributary to lake kasumigaura the sakura river is the largest river in the lake kasumigaura watershed which covers an area of 350 3 km2 in 2017 the mean discharge of the sakura river was 3 31 m3 s 1 paddy fields in the watershed are irrigated from april to june the ranking of land use types in the lake kasumigaura watershed is forest 40 paddy field 20 agriculture 14 urban area 16 and water surface 10 for both long term 2001 2014 and short term 2017 2018 observations we made monthly measurements in the sakura river fig 1 we used an acid washed container to collect surface water from the river the samples were stored with ice packs and brought to our laboratory as quickly as possible 2 h h in the laboratory we filtered the water 200 ml through a pre combusted 450 c for 4 h glass fiber filter type gf f nominal pore size 0 7 µm whatman buckinghamshire uk the filters were stored at 20 c until analysis concentrations of suspended particles were measured by first filtering water through a precombusted pre weighed gf f filter the filters were dried overnight 16 h at 105 c and then weighed 2 2 sample collection for decomposition experiments for the decomposition experiments we collected water samples in an acid washed polyethylene bottle 20 l in november 2020 and april 2021 in november 2020 the concentration of suspended particles was low 6 5 mg l 1 and we collected water for analysis of the dop and po4 3 concentrations during the decomposition experiment in april 2021 the concentration of suspended particles was high 57 mg l 1 the weather conditions in november were characterized by consecutive days without rain fig s1 in contrast in april 2021 the sampling was conducted just after several rainy days the large differences in the concentrations of suspended particles might have been caused by this difference in meteorological conditions and resulting runoff amounts the protocol for the decomposition experiment was the same in november and april in april however we also collected river water 12 l to track p groups with 31p nmr to determine the initial conditions for the 31p nmr we filtered 4 l of the sample through a gf f glass fiber filter and stored the filtrate in the laboratory at 20 c until analysis 2 3 decomposition experiments we conducted decomposition experiments twice once in the winter and once in the spring the experiments were based on the experimental design of kawasaki et al 2013 river water 500 ml and filtrates thereof 0 7 µm were incubated in glass bottles five replicates of both the river water and filtrates the glass bottles were covered with aluminum foil and then shaken with a rotary shaker 60 rpm we incubated the bottles at 20 c for 30 days in the dark and sampled water at 3 7 14 22 and 30 days after the start of the incubation the water was filtered through a gf f glass fiber filter and the filters and filtrates were then stored at 30 c until analysis of dissolved p dp and po4 3 to track p groups with 31p nmr during the decomposition of organic matter 12 l of river water that had been collected in april was transferred to a 20 l polyethylene bottle that was shaken with a rotary shaker 60 rpm to maintain oxygenated conditions we shook the bottle vigorously at least once a day we filtered the water samples 4 l seven and 30 days after the start of the incubation the water was filtered through gf f glass fiber filters then the filters stored at 20 c until prepared for analysis 2 4 chemical analyses 2 4 1 pp pip and pop concentrations the pp and pip concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically for pp the samples were combusted 470 c for 2 h and then the p was extracted with hcl 5 ml 1 mol l 1 in accord with suzumura 2008 to measure the pip concentration we extracted p with hcl 5 ml 1 mol l 1 without combustion the extracts were filtered through a membrane filter pvdf millipore burlington usa nominal pore size 0 45 µm and diluted by a factor of 10 suzumura 2008 the p concentrations were then analyzed using the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 the pop concentrations were equated to the difference between the pp and pip concentrations the results represent the mean values of duplicate or triplicate samples the limit of detection for the molybdenum blue method was no more than 1 0 μg p l 1 for po4 3 for dissolved p concentrations we used an auto analyzer bltec tokyo japan to analyze po4 3 and dissolved p dp for po4 3 and dp we used the molybdenum blue method before and after digestion with a persulfate solution american public health association 2005 respectively we analyzed dp and srp by the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 dissolved organic p dop was calculated as the difference between dp and po4 3 ji et al 2017 2 4 2 31p nmr analyses we used a sodium hydroxide naoh ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta extraction method to identify the different classes of organic compounds in the samples cade menun and preston 1996 this method is conventionally used for analysis of the following p groups orthophosphate orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diesters pyrophosphate and polyphosphate turner et al 2003 briefly the filters were extracted with 50 ml of naoh 0 25 mol l 1 edta 0 05 mol l 1 for 4 h at room temperature 20 c the extracts were filtered through gf f glass fiber filters and the filtrates were then lyophilized for several days the lyophilized samples were subsequently stored in a freezer 20 c until nmr analysis for the 31p nmr analysis we dissolved the lyophilized powder into a naoh edta solution containing 1 mol l 1 naoh and 50 mmol l 1 edta 1 35 ml in deuterium oxide 0 15 ml we then sonicated the samples to help dissolve the powder into the solution which was subsequently passed through a membrane filter nominal pore size 0 45 µm millipore burlington ma usa transferred to an nmr tube ϕ 5 mm and analyzed for 31p we measured 31p nmr spectra with a jnm eca 500 spectrometer jeol tokyo japan operated at 202 5 mhz for 31p samples were analyzed using a 15 μs pulse 30 a delay time of 5 s and an acquisition time of 0 64 s with broadband proton decoupling approximately 15 000 scans 23 h were acquired for each sample a d3po4 standard sigma aldrich japan k k tokyo japan was diluted by a factor of approximately 10 8 5 and used as an external standard for assignment of p groups we adjusted the orthophosphate peak to 6 0 ppm liu et al 2015 the spectra were then processed by line broadening of 2 hz and the relative proportion of each peak was quantified the specific ranges of the p compound classes were as follows orthophosphate 6 0 ppm orthophosphate monoesters 3 5 5 5 ppm orthophosphate diesters 3 5 to 5 5 ppm and pyrophosphate 3 5 to 4 0 ppm the nmr spectra that we obtained exhibited overlapping peaks of the compounds present each p compound was quantified by multiplying its relative proportion in the 31p nmr spectrum by the total p concentration in the naoh edta extract 2 5 statistical analysis we used paired t tests to identify differences in the composition of p compound classes between december and july we also used the pearson correlation coefficient r for trend analyses we used r ver 3 4 1 software for statistical analysis a type i error rate p 0 05 was considered to be significant 3 results 3 1 seasonal and long term changes of p supply from the sakura river we analyzed long term changes of p concentrations in the sakura river the pp accounted for the largest percentage 78 9 of the total p mean 0 076 mgp l 1 in the dissolved p the po4 3 concentrations were comparable to the dop concentrations which averaged 0 010 mgp l 1 the concentrations of forms of p and suspended particles in the sakura river varied seasonally fig 2a d the pp concentrations were high in april and july 0 11 mgp l 1 in both months the dop concentrations were highest in june 0 019 mgp l 1 the po4 3 concentrations were highest in october the concentrations of suspended particles were consistent with the pp changes r 0 86 p 0 01 analysis of the long term trend of monthly mean discharge m3 s 1 revealed that the discharge increased significantly in the springtime from 2001 to 2014 fig 2e r 0 51 p 0 01 in contrast the pp po4 3 and dop concentrations in pop during the spring did not change significantly from 2001 to 2014 fig 2f r 0 12 p 0 47 fig s2 the load discharge l q relationship exhibited a clear increase of pp load l with increase of discharge q the pp loads were a nonlinear function of discharge fig 3a short term monitoring of pip and pop revealed that pip and pop accounted for an average of 57 6 and 42 4 respectively of pp the concentrations of pip and pop increased significantly with the concentrations of suspended particles fig 3b 3

from tributary streams is the primary source of the p in lakes based on the area of the basin of lake kasumigaura 46 km2 and the l q curve of the sakura river fig 3 we estimated the pp loading from the sakura river to be 1 96 mg m 2 d 1 this amount of pp loading was much greater than the maximum p release rate from the bottom sediments of lake kasumigaura ishii et al 2010 increases in the concentrations of suspended particles and pp are caused by runoff of rain water and irrigation water from paddy fields care with respect to organic p decomposition should be taken if p is provided to a river from agricultural activities e g tillage and irrigation farahani et al 2020 the source of the high pp concentrations during the spring in japan could reflect inputs from paddy fields the pp concentrations were highest during the spring in lake kasumigaura s watershed fig 2a furthermore rain events increase pp loads in a nonlinear manner fig 3a our finding of the role of pop in p cycling may be relevant to other rivers because paddy fields are common in many asian countries such as china song et al 2005 cui et al 2020 and korea cho et al 2000 the timeseries of the change of dop concentrations was similar to the case of doc decomposition in lake water reported by kawasaki et al 2013 in which bacterial c assimilation was responsible for the increase of the doc concentration during the first 3 7 days of the study our study revealed a slight increase of the dop concentrations in contrast to the decrease of the po4 3 concentrations our study did not include analysis of bacterial po4 3 uptake but future work will need to address the interactions between dop and po4 3 mediated by bacteria as well as the increase in dop mineralization associated with attached bacteria this study was limited by the fact that we had no information about the sources of the pop and dop and how much they contributed to the po4 3 concentration relative to the mineral bound p we assumed that the pop probably came from paddy fields based on the seasonality of the pp concentrations caused by the rain events but we had no information about dop sources possible sources of dop include soil water and groundwater mcdowell et al 2004 for the further understanding of dop mineralization information of p compound classes in dop e g monbet et al 2009 and enzymatic activities e g bray et al 2017 under a variety of riverbed conditions is also warranted for a future study future work should aim to identify the sources of suspended particles and the formation as well as bioavailability of dop and pop the relative contributions of pop and mineral bound p to po4 3 will also be needed in future work that expands on the results of the current study the epc0 the po4 3 concentration in equilibrium with the suspended particles determines the contribution of mineral bound p however our study showed that the composition of organic p changed during the decomposition of organic matter fig 5 and the proportion of organic p species decreased these results qualitatively indicated that pop contributed to po4 3 interestingly we found a tiny peak of phosphonates at day 30 of the incubation fig 4 phosphonates are considered to be formed under extremely p limited conditions in the ocean karl et al 2008 repeta et al 2016 but how phosphonates are produced in lacustrine environments is still unclear species of phosphonates such as aminoethylphosphonic acid shinohara et al 2018a and methylphosphonic acid khatun et al 2019 may involve oxic methane production during lyase activity grossart et al 2011 mcgrath et al 2013 the presence of newly formed phosphonates means that understanding of the activities of bacterial taxa as well as their uptake and decomposition of phosphonates may be needed in future investigations of decomposition processes 5 conclusions we analyzed the bioavailability of organic p in river water which has not been considered in many studies the primary finding of the current study was that the pop composition changed and the proportion of organic p orthophosphate monoesters and diesters decreased during decomposition of organic matter a dna p peak was observed by 31p nmr on day 0 but the peak disappeared by day 7 when the po4 3 concentration increased we also found that the presence of suspended particles promoted mineralization of dop dop concentrations during the decomposition experiment were 25 less with suspended particles than without these results suggested that the pop in the river had a high potential to supply po4 3 to the river water the timeseries of dop concentrations revealed that the dop concentration increased during the first three days and then decreased slightly because of mineralization although most of the dop was recalcitrant and remained for 30 days the current study therefore inferred that both pip and pop are the source of po4 3 in river water role of the funding source this
