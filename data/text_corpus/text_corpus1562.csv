elmqvist et al 2003 shamsudduha 2013 nampak et al 2014 chinnasamy et al 2018 not only is groundwater essential for all life but it also performs valuable ecosystem services the combination of climate change and human activities has already overburdened groundwater resources in arid inland river basins chen et al 2019 yang et al 2019 ozano et al 2022 however this essential resource remains at serious risk from declining groundwater levels soil salinization land desertification and vegetation degradation all of which degrade vulnerable ecosystems zhang et al 2012 groundwater security is experiencing significant challenges in arid regions where groundwater exploitation and utilization are approaching or surpassing its threshold and concerns about the resilience of groundwater systems in arid regions are a primary focus hugman et al 2012 fuchs et al 2018 pourmoghim et al 2022 since holling adopted resilience into ecosystem stability studies in 1973 resilience has been a research focus in the fields of hydrology ecology and meteorology holling 1973 gönnert and gerkensmeier 2015 thomas and waring 2015 fuchs et al 2018 resiliency indicates how quickly a water resource system returns to a satisfactory condition after an unsatisfactory condition hashimoto et al 1982 katic and grafton 2011 introduced groundwater resilience as the ability of a groundwater system to recover to its original state after an external disturbance and deviation from its equilibrium state following natural and human intervention the resilience and vulnerability of a groundwater system under external disturbance are constantly changing with the changes in external stresses and system functions many scholars have studied water resilience from various perspectives hashimoto et al 1982 first proposed the indices of reliability resiliency and vulnerability rrv for classifying and evaluating the performance of water resource systems this approach rrv has been widely used by researchers because it is rational efficient and accessible fowler et al 2003 peters et al 2005 mondal and wasimi 2007 rodak et al 2014 lu et al 2019 nair and indu 2021 qi et al 2016 proposed an indicator p i reflecting the autocorrelation of variables at a given time based on a convex model and critical slowing down theory initially used to identify changes in watershed resilience for annual runoff liu et al 2021 studied the resilience of the yangtze river basin under climatic factors and anthropogenic disturbance using this indicator herrera franco et al 2020 developed a matrix for evaluating the resilience of coastal aquifers based on indicators from sustainable development goals sdgs within a sociohydrological framework combining four axes of development political social environmental and cultural behboudian et al 2021 proposed two criteria based on robustness redundancy resourcefulness rapidity and durability 4r d and a social resilience based criterion sr to assess the total resilience of water resource systems according to previous studies different methods have evaluated the resilience of water resource systems nevertheless the quantification of groundwater resilience remains a challenge previous works have mostly focused on selecting single indicators hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 hugman et al 2012 qi et al 2016 or constructing indicator frameworks herrera franco et al 2020 behboudian et al 2021 to assess the resilience of water resource systems in changing environments however single factor evaluation methods often lead to inconsistent resilience results due to differences in the selection of indicators and calculation methods although the indicator systematic evaluation method accounts for multiple factors it can obtain only an average level of resilience at the local scale which makes obtaining the spatial distribution characteristic of resilience and verifying the reliability of the selection of weights for each indicator difficult currently few studies have been conducted to spatially predict groundwater resilience for the effective management and long term use of groundwater resources an urgency exists to find a spatially scalable calculation method to assess groundwater resilience which requires mapping to the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience the factors influencing the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience can be divided into natural and anthropogenic factors natural factors include the geological and hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer singh et al 2011 garg and wani 2013 mogaji et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 alraggad et al 2017 mogaji 2017 anthropogenic factors mainly refer to various behavioural factors that may cause groundwater decline and pollution singh et al 2011 nampak et al 2014 rahmati and melesse 2016 the available methods widely used for studying the spatial distribution of groundwater include the overlay and index method ertürk et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 fuzzy logic naghibi et al 2015 rahmati et al 2015 frequency ratio fr nampak et al 2014 razandi et al 2015 analytic hierarchy process ahp chowdhury et al 2009 razandi et al 2015 and dempster shafer ds theory model nampak et al 2014 mogaji et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 the dempster shafer theory model which supports the integration of information from multiple heterogeneous sources and enables the flexible construction of basic probability assignment bpa between single factor resilience indicators and spatial data layers of groundwater conditioning factors and provides prediction results systematic errors and random errors mogaji et al 2015 naghibi et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 is a potentially reliable method for predicting the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience the hotan river basin is a typical arid inland river basin with mountains as the runoff generation regions and plains as the oasis water consuming area guo et al 2016 the hotan river runoff is primarily recharged by glacial snow meltwater and the river is a seasonal river with runoff concentrated in the summer accounting for 75 of annual runoff li et al 2018 with scarce precipitation and uneven spatial and temporal distributions of surface water groundwater plays an important role in meeting the growing demand for water for agricultural production and domestic use shi et al 2021 huang et al 2022 with economic development and population growth the human demand for groundwater resources has further intensified fu et al 2018 shi et al 2021 and the water levels in groundwater wells in the hotan river basin have almost universally declined therefore taking the hotan river basin as a case study research on groundwater resilience especially after extraction in arid inland river basins is significant for the safety and effective management of regional groundwater resources grönwall and oduro kwarteng 2018 fuchs et al 2018 the main purpose of this study is to construct a verifiable evaluation method for the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience in the hotan river basin 1 the most widely used groundwater performance indicator c rs nair and indu 2021 of the rrv criterion and the resilience indicator p i qi et al 2016 are adopted to calculate groundwater resilience 2 quantitative analysis of the relationship between groundwater resilience and various conditioning factors is performed based on gis technology combined with the dempster shafer theory model 3 groundwater resilience zoning maps are generated and validated with groundwater resilience data from observation wells to assess the validity of the dempster shafer theory model as a criterion for determining spatial groundwater resilience zones the study will provide information on groundwater resilience in arid inland river basins and serve as a scientific reference for the integrated management of water resources in inland river basins 2 study area the study area 79 23 80 38 e 36 53 38 7 n fig 1 is part of the hotan river basin in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region in china located at the southern edge of the taklamakan desert and the northern slope of the kunlun mountains with a total area of 9349 63 km2 the study area has a warm continental arid desert climate with an average annual precipitation of 48 7 mm and the average annual temperature is 11 9 c fu et al 2018 the hotan river comprises two tributaries the eastern branch of the yurunkash river and the western branch of the karakash river which originate from the northern slope of the kunlun mountains and the karakoram mountains respectively the yurunkash river has a total length of 504 km and a catchment area of 14813 km2 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the karakash river has a total length of 808 km and a catchment area of 21532 km2 wang et al 2021 the average annual runoff of the yurunkash river and karakash river is 22 85 108 m3 and 21 67 108 m3 respectively shi et al 2021 which converts into runoff depths of 154 3 mm and 100 6 mm the groundwater recharge runoff and discharge in the study area are obviously horizontally zoned due to the constraints of climatic and hydrological conditions geological formations and geomorphology shi et al 2021 the mountainous area is the groundwater recharge source area the premontane diluvial gravel plain is the groundwater recharge runoff area and the alluvial diluvial fine soil plain and the northern desert alluvial layer are groundwater discharge areas shi et al 2021 from south to north the groundwater hydraulic gradient gradually declines and the groundwater level rises the groundwater recharge sources and recharge modes in this area are mainly river seepage channels and field irrigation infiltration huang et al 2022 the discharge modes are mainly phreatic water evaporation and spring overflow huang et al 2022 the hotan oasis is an area of significant irrigated agriculture and urban and rural residents whose survival and development are dependent on the water of the hotan river fu et al 2018 agricultural water use is the mainstay of water resource use in the basin with agriculture accounting for 55 75 and domestic water use accounting for 0 5 3 of the total consumption in the basin from 2003 to 2020 the data are provided by the xinjiang tarim river basin authority in addition groundwater is an essential source of water supply with production domestic use and ecological use accounting for 90 6 8 6 and 0 8 respectively of the total groundwater extraction in 2010 in hotan and agriculture accounted for 62 of the total groundwater extraction wang et al 2013 ensuring the sustainable use of groundwater resources in the hotan river basin is therefore vital to the sustainable socioeconomic development of the hotan oasis 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater resilience index single factor evaluation methods are applied here to evaluate long term groundwater resilience the c rs resilience indicates how quickly a system returns to a satisfactory state after an unsatisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 the resilience indicator p i proposed by qi et al 2016 based on the convex model and critical slowing down theory reflects the autocorrelation of variables at a given time and quantifies the temporal variation in water resource system resilience kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2021 we thus use the two indicators above to calculate groundwater resilience 3 1 1 groundwater performance indicator c rs the groundwater performance indicator c rs from the traditional rrv criteria is used to assess groundwater resilience in the study area hashimoto et al 1982 nair and indu 2021 first a criterion c i e multiyear average groundwater level is defined for each groundwater well and x t represents a time series of groundwater levels a satisfactory state s indicates that the groundwater level of the well exceeds the annual average and an unsatisfactory state u indicates that the groundwater level is lower than the annual average the groundwater performance indicator c rs can be defined in eq 1 if x t c then x t s 1 else x t u c rs p x t u and x t 1 s p x t u c rs is used to assess the resilience of the wells in the study area ranging from 0 to 1 this indicator reflects the rate of recovery to a satisfactory state after a system failure the larger the value of c rs is the higher the groundwater resilience 3 1 2 resilience indicator p i we use groundwater level as a state variable and the resilience indicator p i to quantify the temporal variation in the resilience of the groundwater system groundwater resilience can be reflected by the deviance between a state variable a i and its adjacent values a i n a i n 1 a i 2 a i 1 a i 1 a i 2 a i n 1 a i n with the number of neighbouring points being 2 n the larger the deviation is the higher the groundwater system resilience indicating that the time series corresponding to state variables have a lower autocorrelation the resilience indicator p i can be computed as shown in eqs 2 5 2 a i a i n a i n 1 a i 2 a i 1 a i 1 a i 2 a i n 1 a i n 3 f ij 1 a i a j γ 0 a i a j γ 4 γ 0 5 θ a max a min 0 375 a max a min 5 p i j i n j i n f ij where γ is the threshold of the deviation of a i from its adjacent points a max and a min denote the maximum and minimum of the monthly groundwater level data series respectively according to qi et al 2016 θ is used as an empirical value of 0 75 and the threshold γ is 0 375 a max a min eq 4 the temporal variation of p i is consistent for different n here n is considered to be 4 the number of neighbouring points is 8 the range of p i is 0 8 based on the groundwater level data we use eqs 2 5 to calculate the groundwater system resilience in the study area at moment i 3 1 3 data source data for the calculation of the groundwater resilience index can be directly retrieved from the monthly groundwater level data of 27 groundwater wells monitored by the hotan water resources bureau from 1989 to 2020 3 2 groundwater resilience zones groundwater resilience zonation mapping consists of four primary steps 1 creating spatial datasets of groundwater conditioning factors as evidential layers for the dempster shafer theory model 2 establishing mathematical relationships between resilience and groundwater conditioning factors and integrating evidence based on the dempster shafer theory model 3 creating and validating the groundwater resilience zonation map 4 interpretation and comparison of results the overall methodology is illustrated in fig 2 3 2 1 groundwater resilience conditioning factors in addition a spatial database of different spatial datasets is essential to establishing a reliable and accurate groundwater resilience prediction model in the study area the spatial distribution of groundwater is governed by natural factors including meteorology hydrology geomorphology and geological formations singh et al 2011 garg and wani 2013 mogaji et al 2015 alraggad et al 2017 mogaji 2017 and anthropogenic factors such as land use singh et al 2011 nampak et al 2014 rahmati and melesse 2016 liu et al 2021 through the information obtained from the literature nine groundwater conditioning factors including lithology geomorphology slope soil type distance to river canal density hydraulic conductivity groundwater depth and land use are considered in this study these factors affect the groundwater resilience of the area by influencing groundwater storage recharge transport and discharge raster datasets of the nine groundwater conditioning factors are generated in gis to evaluate groundwater resilience in the study area a brief description of these nine factors is provided below 3 2 1 1 lithology lithological differences directly affect infiltration and lithology is one of the indispensable factors for the evaluation and prediction of groundwater prospects in the region mogaji et al 2015 ait el mekki and laftouhi 2016 the aquifer in the study area mainly consists of alluvial diluvial aquifers in the gravel plain and alluvial diluvial aquifers in the fine soil plain the gravel plain alluvial diluvial aquifer mainly comprises sand gravel and fine sand intercalated by sand gravel and gravel cobble as the slope of the terrain becomes flatter the sediment grains of the alluvial diluvial aquifer in the fine soil plain become finer and the lithology of the aquifer is finer with medium to coarse sand and fine sand generally found in the area shi et al 2021 the lithology of the study area is divided into four categories from south to north as follows gravel sand gravel fine sand and meal sand fig 3a 3 2 1 2 geomorphology the topographic map of the study area is derived from the dataset of the remote sensing survey of resources and the environmental project of the chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 100 m the dataset has four geomorphology classes including beach land plain mountains and desert fig 3b 3 2 1 3 slope the slope determines the recharge process of groundwater and is negatively related to the infiltration rate of surface water with which groundwater interacts nampak et al 2014 ait el mekki and laftouhi 2016 the slope is calculated from a digital elevation model dem in gis the slope is classified into five classes using quantile classification 0 0 313 0 313 0 625 0 625 0 938 0 938 1 355 and 1 355 26 577 for evaluating groundwater resilience in the study area fig 3c 3 2 1 4 soil type soil properties are a critical factor controlling groundwater recharge and soil types and their various permeabilities largely control the infiltration or transport rate of surface water into aquifer systems rahmati and melesse 2016 the soil map of the study area is extracted from the second national soil census data a 1 1 000 000 scale digital soil map of china amorphic soils semi aquatic soils anthrosols desert soils and alkali saline soils are distributed throughout the study area fig 3d 3 2 1 5 distance to river and canal density euclidean distance and line density tools are applied to generate river distance and canal density maps in the study area respectively from the current river and canal data the distance from the river is categorized into five groups 2 18 2 18 5 89 5 89 12 87 12 87 24 20 and 24 20 km fig 3e fig 3f indicates that the canal density is divided into five categories including 0 0 0 103 0 103 0 175 0 175 0 315 and 0 315 km km2 a shorter distance to the river and a higher canal density imply a higher surface runoff which favours groundwater storage 3 2 1 6 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity depends on the groundwater flow in the aquifer mogaji 2017 and regions with a higher hydraulic conductivity favour groundwater enrichment as shown in fig 3g the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of shallow groundwater in the study area generally decreases from south to north the zoning of hydraulic conductivity in the study area is divided into five classes 3 2 1 7 groundwater depth the groundwater depth dictates the depth of groundwater transport and the time of contact with the surrounding medium oikonomidis et al 2015 the groundwater depth is separated into six categories 1 1 3 3 6 6 10 10 20 and 20 m fig 3h the groundwater depth map of the study area is obtained from 2010 groundwater depth data from the hotan river basin 3 2 1 8 land use land use is a vital factor in controlling groundwater recharge and different land types have different impacts on the groundwater recharge process kaliraj et al 2014 the land use data of the study area in 2015 are obtained from the results dataset of the remote sensing survey of resources and the environmental project of the chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 30 m according to the land use characteristics of the study area and national land type classification standards land types are reclassified into six categories farmland woodland grassland water body residential area and unused land fig 3i 3 2 2 dempster shafer evidence theory model in 1967 dempster first suggested the dempster shafer evidence theory as a rule of information combination in his study of statistical questions dempster 1967 in further developing this evidence theory shafer proposed a mathematical approach to uncertainty inference based on evidence and combination by adopting the concept of a belief function shafer 1976 in the present study the dempster shafer evidence theory model is applied to predict groundwater resilience and it is constructed by establishing a framework of discernment defining the basic probability assignment calculating the mass function and implementing the evidence combination a framework of discernment ϑ is the set of all probable targets for a certain object to be judged and is a mutually exclusive nonempty finite set eq 6 a in eq 6 is the probability that each pixel p is high for the target groundwater resilience and a is the negation of a i e the probability that each pixel p is lower for the groundwater resilience the basic probability assignment is performed for the target in the framework of discernment and the basic probability function m eq 7 needs to fulfil the conditions 2 θ 0 1 and x ϑ m x 1 6 ϑ a a 7 m 2 θ a a ϑ according to the existing groundwater resilience calculation results we consider c rs 0 094 and p i 2 as the criteria for target a the belief function bel disbelief function dis plausibility function pls and uncertainty function unc are calculated using eqs 8 11 park 2011 rahmati and melesse 2016 bel indicates the degree of belief in any one target the calculation of pls contains the degree of belief in this target and the degree of belief in the unknown field and the difference between bel and pls is denoted as unc bel a and pls a indicate the lower and upper probabilities in target a respectively the bel a pls a interval refers to the belief interval which characterizes the range of the degree of uncertainty fig 4 the size of the belief interval determines the extent of credibility of the evidence the wider the interval is the lower the credibility of the evidence and vice versa 8 bel a λ a e ij λ a e ij 9 dis a λ a e ij λ a e ij 10 pls a 1 dis a 11 unc a 1 dis a bel a where e ij is the class i attribute of the spatial information layer j λ a e ij is the likelihood ratio for supporting target a and λ a e ij is the likelihood ratio for supporting target a the likelihood ratio for supporting the target can be defined as eqs 12 and 13 12 λ a e ij n l e ij n l n e ij n l e ij n a n l 13 λ a e ij n l n l e ij n l n a n l n e ij n l e ij n a n l where n l e ij is the number of groundwater well pixels in e ij that support target a n l is the total number of groundwater wells in the study area that support target a n e ij is the total number of pixels for class i attributes in layer j and n a is the total number of pixels in the whole region the basic probability assignment of each information layer is decided according to the spatial relationship between the spatial location of observation wells and the groundwater conditioning factor layers the attributes of the groundwater conditioning factor layers are superimposed to obtain raster layers corresponding to the belief disbelief plausibility and uncertainty of each groundwater conditioning factor the basic probability assignment of different information layers is combined to obtain the ultimate results according to the combination rules of the dempster shafer evidence theory the evidence combination rules used in this study are as follows mogaji et al 2015 14 bel x bel a bel b bel a unc b bel b unc a δ 15 dis x dis a dis b dis a unc b dis b unc a δ 16 unc x unc a unc b δ 17 pls x unc x bel x 18 δ 1 bel a dis b dis a bel b the degree of belief generated by evidence a is expressed by bel a the degree of plausibility is expressed by pls a the degree of uncertainty is expressed by unc a and calculated as pls a bel a and the degree of disbelief is expressed by dis a and calculated as 1 pls a in eqs 14 18 bel x denotes the lower degree of belief for each layer of factor type or range dis x denotes the degree of disbelief for each layer of factor type or range unc x denotes the degree of uncertainty for each layer of factor type or range x denotes each factor type 1 2 9 and δ is called the normalization factor the mass functions in the dempster shafer evidence theory model including belief disbelief uncertainty and plausibility are the belief function components that evaluate the predictive ability of the evidence model using eqs 14 18 to iterate evidential layers eight operational iterations are performed on the nine evidential layers the final results are used to construct a groundwater resilience zonation map for the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater resilience based on the groundwater performance indicator c rs and resilience indicator p i the paper quantitatively estimates groundwater resilience based on groundwater level data in the study area using two methods the groundwater performance indicator c rs and the resilience indicator p i the statistical characteristics are shown in table 1 the theoretical value of the groundwater performance indicator c rs is 0 1 and c rs ranges from 0 to 0 25 in the study area with an average value of 0 094 and 44 of the wells being greater than the average according to the c rs value resilience is classified into five classes with values ranging from 0 to 0 01 0 01 0 02 0 02 0 03 0 03 0 094 and 0 094 nineteen percent of the wells have low resilience compared with moderate resilience and 44 of the wells have high resilience the average p i of 27 wells is used to assess the interannual variation in groundwater resilience in the study area the observation wells are located in areas with a relatively high resilience while the wells with a relatively low resilience are mainly located in areas with a high groundwater depth and are far from the river wells with a relatively high resilience are mainly found in the upstream oasis irrigation area and near the downstream river channel where the lithology is coarse sand gravel and fine sand the terrain is flat and canal systems are densely distributed and the soil types are mainly semi aquatic soils and anthrosols fig 5 fig 6 presents the proportion of different classes of resilience based on c rs and p i the c rs is concentrated in the high and moderate high classes p i accounts for the largest proportion 74 in the high classes and c rs is higher than p i in the very low and moderate high classes which more representative in assessing regional groundwater resilience the groundwater performance indicator c rs or the resilience indicator p i the advantage of the water resource systems resilience metric c rs proposed by hashimoto et al 1982 is that it can describe the rate at which the system recovers to a satisfactory state after a failure but the satisfactory or unsatisfactory state depends on a set threshold here we set the multiyear average groundwater level of each well as the threshold the resilience indicator p i based on a convex model and critical slowing down theory can not only reveal the temporal variability of groundwater system resilience but also effectively identify critical shifts in groundwater system resilience qi et al 2016 kumar et al 2020 both approaches to assessing resilience can address long term changes in system resilience but the resilience metric c rs better meets the five criteria baseline functionality threshold functionality whole system damage elapsed time to satisfactory recovery and uncertainty scenarios of disruptions included in the resilience assessment of water resource systems than does the resilience indicator p i shin et al 2018 notably for four wells c rs has a value of 0 but p i is not 0 the reason for this is that the calculation of c rs is constrained by the threshold limit if the observation wells are subject to external disturbance and the groundwater level is below the multiyear average groundwater level for a long time and cannot return to its original state the water level is still stable within a fixed range in this case a calculated c rs of 0 does not mean that the groundwater resilience at that location is low and quantifying the groundwater resilience based on the c rs is not reliable at this point in contrast the resilience indicator p i better reflects variations in long term groundwater system resilience as it is not limited by other conditions using the resilience indicator p i to assess groundwater resilience and exploring the effects of various resolutions daily monthly annual or different types of hydrological series as state variables on groundwater resilience under climate change and anthropogenic disturbance scenarios remains a challenge in quantifying groundwater resilience and requires further research in the future 4 2 application of the dempster shafer theory model in groundwater resilience mapping based on wells with a groundwater performance indicator c rs value 0 094 and a resilience indicator p i value 2 the components of the belief function including bel dis unc and pls for each category of the groundwater resilience conditioning factor calculated using eqs 8 13 adequately represent the relationship between the groundwater resilience and nine conditioning factors table 2 the bel value directly reflects the groundwater resilience with relatively high bel values implying a high groundwater resilience bel values of 0 in a category indicate that no groundwater wells of the category are present lithology is a critical factor controlling groundwater occurrence rahmati and melesse 2016 and different lithological units affect the groundwater storage capacity the results of the belief calculations show that the bel value of fine sand and sand gravel in the study area is higher than that of other lithological units indicating a positive correlation between this category and groundwater resilience in terms of geomorphology the highest pls values are found on the plain with c rs showing low bel and high unc values and p i showing high bel and low unc values bel is relatively high at the lower slope and closer to the river 2 18 5 89 km previous studies have illustrated that areas with flatter slopes have slower surface runoff comparatively higher infiltration and higher groundwater potential nampak et al 2014 mogaji et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 for soil types the highest bel values occur in anthrosols and semi aquatic soils indicating the highest groundwater resilience while the relationship between desert soils amorphic soils and alkali saline soils and groundwater resilience is weak for canal density the bel results for c rs and p i are the reverse with the former showing high groundwater resilience in low density zones 0 0 103 km km2 and the latter showing an overall increasing trend in bel as the canal density increases with the highest at canal densities 0 709 km km2 according to the findings of nampak et al 2014 rahmati and melesse 2016 and shi et al 2021 a positive correlation exists between dense river drainage systems and groundwater occurrence therefore we believe that estimating the belief function for each category of canal density based on p i is more reliable the hydraulic conductivity is defined as the rate of water flow per unit cross sectional area of an aquifer mogaji 2017 reducing hydraulic conductivity is important for improving resilience alraggad et al 2017 the highest bel value in the study area is at k 20 m d when k 20 m d groundwater resilience tends to increase with increasing k values and the bel value is 0 when k 80 m d due to the absence of groundwater well distribution in the area regarding the groundwater depth the bel of c rs shows an overall increasing trend with increasing groundwater depth and the bel of p i is highest at 10 20 m illustrating the high probability of groundwater resilience occurring in the case of land use the c rs calculation indicates that the bel of residential areas is significantly higher than that of other land use types probably because groundwater wells are mostly located in residential areas p i shows that the bel value of woodlands is the highest followed by residential areas indicating that the groundwater resilience is highest in woodlands the reason for this is that the presence of woodlands decreases groundwater runoff and soil evaporation while the presence of impermeable layers in residential areas is not conducive to groundwater recharge the combined belief function components bel dis unc and pls are integrated and the integration results of the nine evidential layers are presented in figs 7 and 8 the spatial distribution of bel values explain the combination of groundwater resilience with nine conditioning factor evidential layers fig 7a fig 8a mogaji et al 2015 concluded that a correlation exists between areas with a high degree of bel a low degree of dis a high degree of pls and a low degree of unc in contrast to the spatial distribution of dis values bel values are always low in areas with high unc and the belief that areas with low unc values indicate a high groundwater resilience is reliable areas with high pls values are also characterized by relatively high bel and unc values the belief function maps of the two indicators fig 7a fig 8a reveal that the areas with the highest groundwater resilience in the study area are located mainly in the river channel and the oasis irrigation area in the southern part of the study area where the canal system is denser the terrain is flatter and the lithological units are mostly fine sand and gravelly sand meanwhile the areas with relatively low groundwater resilience are concentrated around the oasis irrigation area and in the middle area from the river channel to the desert the unc values in the study area range from 10 fig 7c to 11 8 fig 8c the unc value in the c rs based dempster shafer theory model fusion is generally higher than p i with fig 7c demonstrating that the areas of low unc values are mostly located in the oasis irrigation area fig 8c illustrates that the areas with the highest unc values are mainly situated in mountains with higher unc values outside the oasis irrigation area and around the downstream river due to insufficient observation well data in these areas available for validation 4 3 validation of the groundwater resilience map the belief maps figs 7a 8a are overlaid with the locations of 27 wells in gis and the predicted values for each point are obtained c rs 0 0 25 and p i 1 25 4 18 for the 27 wells are then classified as very low low moderate moderate high and high and compared with the predicted values for that point the dempster shafer theory model results for c rs and p i using nine groundwater conditioning factor evidential layers are 40 7 and 59 3 accurate respectively and the model is subsequently rerun by removing nonsignificant factors from the model for this purpose we consider excluding lithology fig 3a or hydraulic conductivity fig 3g from evidential layers because they are relatively coarse and unvalidated data with low reliability the results from the final model after removing those factors from the evidential layer table 3 show that the c rs values are consistent with the predicted values for 14 wells with a prediction accuracy of 51 9 and the p i values are consistent with those predicted for 18 wells with a prediction accuracy of 66 7 the selection of the groundwater conditioning factor the evidential layer transformed in the dempster shafer theory model has a significant impact on the performance of the dempster shafer theory model a conclusion that is consistent with previous studies nampak et al 2014 mogaji et al 2015 the prediction accuracy of the p i based dempster shafer model increases by 7 4 after removing the lithology factor and by 11 2 after the removal of lithology and hydraulic conductivity factors in general the dempster shafer theory model constructed using p i as an indicator for evaluating groundwater resilience is superior to that using c rs 4 4 creation of groundwater resilience map the groundwater resilience zonation map fig 9 of the final output of the bel values show different levels of groundwater resilience within the study area representing the degree to which the evidential layers support groundwater resilience and is considered the most likely map for predicting groundwater resilience mogaji et al 2015 the percentage of each category in the study area is shown in fig 10 fig 9a shows the spatial relationship between seven evidential layers excluding lithology and hydraulic conductivity and c rs the bel values are classified as very low 0 0 168 low 0 168 0 260 moderate 0 260 0 405 moderate high 0 405 0 632 and high 0 632 accounting for 25 15 21 22 and 17 of the total area respectively fig 9b explains the spatial relationship between eight evidential layers with lithology removed and p i with bel values divided into five categories very low bel value of 0 0 072 3 of the total area low 0 072 0 171 30 medium 0 171 0 458 30 high 0 458 0 786 22 and high 0 786 15 prediction maps based on the two resilience indicators show that the regions with moderate high and high resilience have a good coherence and are mostly distributed in the upstream oasis irrigation area and around the downstream river channel but differences exist in the prediction results the c rs based prediction map fig 9a indicates high resilience in the southern mountains of the study area and overall low resilience around the downstream channel with large continuous zones of very low resilience in contrast the prediction map based on p i fig 9b displays a discontinuous strip of resilience around the downstream channel that transitions from higher areas to moderate then alternating from very low to low due to the different classification of the two indicators and the difference in the resilience categories corresponding to the observation wells see 4 1 fig 5 5 conclusions the purpose of this study is to construct a dempster shafer theory model based on the groundwater performance indicator c rs and the resilience indicator p i to spatially predict groundwater resilience in the study area and evaluate the validity of these two indicators in predicting groundwater resilience nine groundwater conditioning factors are selected and spatial datasets are created as evidential layers in the dempster shafer theory model the integration results are combined to spatially predict the groundwater resilience in the study area ultimately outputting groundwater resilience zoning map as quantitative criteria for groundwater resilience both c rs and p i can address long term changes in the resilience of groundwater systems wells with relatively high resilience are mainly located in the upstream oasis irrigation area and near the downstream river while wells with relatively low resilience are distributed in areas with higher groundwater depths and greater distances from the river the dempster shafer theory model is constructed based on resilience indicators and evidential layers consisting of groundwater conditioning factors to produce zonal maps of very low low moderate moderate high and high groundwater resilience the accuracy of the prediction maps produced by the final model is 51 9 c rs and 66 7 p i validation of the predicted results with p i yields better results than validation with c rs according to the spatial relationship between eight groundwater conditioning factors geomorphology slope distance to river soil type canal density hydraulic conductivity groundwater depth and land use and p i groundwater resilience is classified as very low bel value of 0 0 072 low 0 072 0 171 moderate 0 171 0 458 moderate high 0 458 0 786 and high 0 786 accounting for 3 30 30 22 and 15 of the total area of the region respectively in conclusion regional groundwater resilience predictions based on the dempster shafer theory model are reasonably reliable and the model has the advantage of not only outputting the degree of support for the prediction results from the evidential layers through belief functions but also quantifying the uncertainty to reflect systematic and random errors in addition the selection of groundwater conditioning factors has a significant impact on the performance of the dempster shafer theory model which may produce more accurate and reliable spatial prediction results when the evidential layers are sufficiently detailed this study may provide a scientific basis for groundwater resource planning and management in the hotan river basin and the findings will assist in understanding groundwater resilience in arid inland river basins credit authorship contribution statement yuehui wang writing original draft writing review editing

elmqvist et al 2003 shamsudduha 2013 nampak et al 2014 chinnasamy et al 2018 not only is groundwater essential for all life but it also performs valuable ecosystem services the combination of climate change and human activities has already overburdened groundwater resources in arid inland river basins chen et al 2019 yang et al 2019 ozano et al 2022 however this essential resource remains at serious risk from declining groundwater levels soil salinization land desertification and vegetation degradation all of which degrade vulnerable ecosystems zhang et al 2012 groundwater security is experiencing significant challenges in arid regions where groundwater exploitation and utilization are approaching or surpassing its threshold and concerns about the resilience of groundwater systems in arid regions are a primary focus hugman et al 2012 fuchs et al 2018 pourmoghim et al 2022 since holling adopted resilience into ecosystem stability studies in 1973 resilience has been a research focus in the fields of hydrology ecology and meteorology holling 1973 gönnert and gerkensmeier 2015 thomas and waring 2015 fuchs et al 2018 resiliency indicates how quickly a water resource system returns to a satisfactory condition after an unsatisfactory condition hashimoto et al 1982 katic and grafton 2011 introduced groundwater resilience as the ability of a groundwater system to recover to its original state after an external disturbance and deviation from its equilibrium state following natural and human intervention the resilience and vulnerability of a groundwater system under external disturbance are constantly changing with the changes in external stresses and system functions many scholars have studied water resilience from various perspectives hashimoto et al 1982 first proposed the indices of reliability resiliency and vulnerability rrv for classifying and evaluating the performance of water resource systems this approach rrv has been widely used by researchers because it is rational efficient and accessible fowler et al 2003 peters et al 2005 mondal and wasimi 2007 rodak et al 2014 lu et al 2019 nair and indu 2021 qi et al 2016 proposed an indicator p i reflecting the autocorrelation of variables at a given time based on a convex model and critical slowing down theory initially used to identify changes in watershed resilience for annual runoff liu et al 2021 studied the resilience of the yangtze river basin under climatic factors and anthropogenic disturbance using this indicator herrera franco et al 2020 developed a matrix for evaluating the resilience of coastal aquifers based on indicators from sustainable development goals sdgs within a sociohydrological framework combining four axes of development political social environmental and cultural behboudian et al 2021 proposed two criteria based on robustness redundancy resourcefulness rapidity and durability 4r d and a social resilience based criterion sr to assess the total resilience of water resource systems according to previous studies different methods have evaluated the resilience of water resource systems nevertheless the quantification of groundwater resilience remains a challenge previous works have mostly focused on selecting single indicators hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 hugman et al 2012 qi et al 2016 or constructing indicator frameworks herrera franco et al 2020 behboudian et al 2021 to assess the resilience of water resource systems in changing environments however single factor evaluation methods often lead to inconsistent resilience results due to differences in the selection of indicators and calculation methods although the indicator systematic evaluation method accounts for multiple factors it can obtain only an average level of resilience at the local scale which makes obtaining the spatial distribution characteristic of resilience and verifying the reliability of the selection of weights for each indicator difficult currently few studies have been conducted to spatially predict groundwater resilience for the effective management and long term use of groundwater resources an urgency exists to find a spatially scalable calculation method to assess groundwater resilience which requires mapping to the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience the factors influencing the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience can be divided into natural and anthropogenic factors natural factors include the geological and hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer singh et al 2011 garg and wani 2013 mogaji et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 alraggad et al 2017 mogaji 2017 anthropogenic factors mainly refer to various behavioural factors that may cause groundwater decline and pollution singh et al 2011 nampak et al 2014 rahmati and melesse 2016 the available methods widely used for studying the spatial distribution of groundwater include the overlay and index method ertürk et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 fuzzy logic naghibi et al 2015 rahmati et al 2015 frequency ratio fr nampak et al 2014 razandi et al 2015 analytic hierarchy process ahp chowdhury et al 2009 razandi et al 2015 and dempster shafer ds theory model nampak et al 2014 mogaji et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 the dempster shafer theory model which supports the integration of information from multiple heterogeneous sources and enables the flexible construction of basic probability assignment bpa between single factor resilience indicators and spatial data layers of groundwater conditioning factors and provides prediction results systematic errors and random errors mogaji et al 2015 naghibi et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 is a potentially reliable method for predicting the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience the hotan river basin is a typical arid inland river basin with mountains as the runoff generation regions and plains as the oasis water consuming area guo et al 2016 the hotan river runoff is primarily recharged by glacial snow meltwater and the river is a seasonal river with runoff concentrated in the summer accounting for 75 of annual runoff li et al 2018 with scarce precipitation and uneven spatial and temporal distributions of surface water groundwater plays an important role in meeting the growing demand for water for agricultural production and domestic use shi et al 2021 huang et al 2022 with economic development and population growth the human demand for groundwater resources has further intensified fu et al 2018 shi et al 2021 and the water levels in groundwater wells in the hotan river basin have almost universally declined therefore taking the hotan river basin as a case study research on groundwater resilience especially after extraction in arid inland river basins is significant for the safety and effective management of regional groundwater resources grönwall and oduro kwarteng 2018 fuchs et al 2018 the main purpose of this study is to construct a verifiable evaluation method for the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience in the hotan river basin 1 the most widely used groundwater performance indicator c rs nair and indu 2021 of the rrv criterion and the resilience indicator p i qi et al 2016 are adopted to calculate groundwater resilience 2 quantitative analysis of the relationship between groundwater resilience and various conditioning factors is performed based on gis technology combined with the dempster shafer theory model 3 groundwater resilience zoning maps are generated and validated with groundwater resilience data from observation wells to assess the validity of the dempster shafer theory model as a criterion for determining spatial groundwater resilience zones the study will provide information on groundwater resilience in arid inland river basins and serve as a scientific reference for the integrated management of water resources in inland river basins 2 study area the study area 79 23 80 38 e 36 53 38 7 n fig 1 is part of the hotan river basin in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region in china located at the southern edge of the taklamakan desert and the northern slope of the kunlun mountains with a total area of 9349 63 km2 the study area has a warm continental arid desert climate with an average annual precipitation of 48 7 mm and the average annual temperature is 11 9 c fu et al 2018 the hotan river comprises two tributaries the eastern branch of the yurunkash river and the western branch of the karakash river which originate from the northern slope of the kunlun mountains and the karakoram mountains respectively the yurunkash river has a total length of 504 km and a catchment area of 14813 km2 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the karakash river has a total length of 808 km and a catchment area of 21532 km2 wang et al 2021 the average annual runoff of the yurunkash river and karakash river is 22 85 108 m3 and 21 67 108 m3 respectively shi et al 2021 which converts into runoff depths of 154 3 mm and 100 6 mm the groundwater recharge runoff and discharge in the study area are obviously horizontally zoned due to the constraints of climatic and hydrological conditions geological formations and geomorphology shi et al 2021 the mountainous area is the groundwater recharge source area the premontane diluvial gravel plain is the groundwater recharge runoff area and the alluvial diluvial fine soil plain and the northern desert alluvial layer are groundwater discharge areas shi et al 2021 from south to north the groundwater hydraulic gradient gradually declines and the groundwater level rises the groundwater recharge sources and recharge modes in this area are mainly river seepage channels and field irrigation infiltration huang et al 2022 the discharge modes are mainly phreatic water evaporation and spring overflow huang et al 2022 the hotan oasis is an area of significant irrigated agriculture and urban and rural residents whose survival and development are dependent on the water of the hotan river fu et al 2018 agricultural water use is the mainstay of water resource use in the basin with agriculture accounting for 55 75 and domestic water use accounting for 0 5 3 of the total consumption in the basin from 2003 to 2020 the data are provided by the xinjiang tarim river basin authority in addition groundwater is an essential source of water supply with production domestic use and ecological use accounting for 90 6 8 6 and 0 8 respectively of the total groundwater extraction in 2010 in hotan and agriculture accounted for 62 of the total groundwater extraction wang et al 2013 ensuring the sustainable use of groundwater resources in the hotan river basin is therefore vital to the sustainable socioeconomic development of the hotan oasis 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater resilience index single factor evaluation methods are applied here to evaluate long term groundwater resilience the c rs resilience indicates how quickly a system returns to a satisfactory state after an unsatisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 the resilience indicator p i proposed by qi et al 2016 based on the convex model and critical slowing down theory reflects the autocorrelation of variables at a given time and quantifies the temporal variation in water resource system resilience kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2021 we thus use the two indicators above to calculate groundwater resilience 3 1 1 groundwater performance indicator c rs the groundwater performance indicator c rs from the traditional rrv criteria is used to assess groundwater resilience in the study area hashimoto et al 1982 nair and indu 2021 first a criterion c i e multiyear average groundwater level is defined for each groundwater well and x t represents a time series of groundwater levels a satisfactory state s indicates that the groundwater level of the well exceeds the annual average and an unsatisfactory state u indicates that the groundwater level is lower than the annual average the groundwater performance indicator c rs can be defined in eq 1 if x t c then x t s 1 else x t u c rs p x t u and x t 1 s p x t u c rs is used to assess the resilience of the wells in the study area ranging from 0 to 1 this indicator reflects the rate of recovery to a satisfactory state after a system failure the larger the value of c rs is the higher the groundwater resilience 3 1 2 resilience indicator p i we use groundwater level as a state variable and the resilience indicator p i to quantify the temporal variation in the resilience of the groundwater system groundwater resilience can be reflected by the deviance between a state variable a i and its adjacent values a i n a i n 1 a i 2 a i 1 a i 1 a i 2 a i n 1 a i n with the number of neighbouring points being 2 n the larger the deviation is the higher the groundwater system resilience indicating that the time series corresponding to state variables have a lower autocorrelation the resilience indicator p i can be computed as shown in eqs 2 5 2 a i a i n a i n 1 a i 2 a i 1 a i 1 a i 2 a i n 1 a i n 3 f ij 1 a i a j γ 0 a i a j γ 4 γ 0 5 θ a max a min 0 375 a max a min 5 p i j i n j i n f ij where γ is the threshold of the deviation of a i from its adjacent points a max and a min denote the maximum and minimum of the monthly groundwater level data series respectively according to qi et al 2016 θ is used as an empirical value of 0 75 and the threshold γ is 0 375 a max a min eq 4 the temporal variation of p i is consistent for different n here n is considered to be 4 the number of neighbouring points is 8 the range of p i is 0 8 based on the groundwater level data we use eqs 2 5 to calculate the groundwater system resilience in the study area at moment i 3 1 3 data source data for the calculation of the groundwater resilience index can be directly retrieved from the monthly groundwater level data of 27 groundwater wells monitored by the hotan water resources bureau from 1989 to 2020 3 2 groundwater resilience zones groundwater resilience zonation mapping consists of four primary steps 1 creating spatial datasets of groundwater conditioning factors as evidential layers for the dempster shafer theory model 2 establishing mathematical relationships between resilience and groundwater conditioning factors and integrating evidence based on the dempster shafer theory model 3 creating and validating the groundwater resilience zonation map 4 interpretation and comparison of results the overall methodology is illustrated in fig 2 3 2 1 groundwater resilience conditioning factors in addition a spatial database of different spatial datasets is essential to establishing a reliable and accurate groundwater resilience prediction model in the study area the spatial distribution of groundwater is governed by natural factors including meteorology hydrology geomorphology and geological formations singh et al 2011 garg and wani 2013 mogaji et al 2015 alraggad et al 2017 mogaji 2017 and anthropogenic factors such as land use singh et al 2011 nampak et al 2014 rahmati and melesse 2016 liu et al 2021 through the information obtained from the literature nine groundwater conditioning factors including lithology geomorphology slope soil type distance to river canal density hydraulic conductivity groundwater depth and land use are considered in this study these factors affect the groundwater resilience of the area by influencing groundwater storage recharge transport and discharge raster datasets of the nine groundwater conditioning factors are generated in gis to evaluate groundwater resilience in the study area a brief description of these nine factors is provided below 3 2 1 1 lithology lithological differences directly affect infiltration and lithology is one of the indispensable factors for the evaluation and prediction of groundwater prospects in the region mogaji et al 2015 ait el mekki and laftouhi 2016 the aquifer in the study area mainly consists of alluvial diluvial aquifers in the gravel plain and alluvial diluvial aquifers in the fine soil plain the gravel plain alluvial diluvial aquifer mainly comprises sand gravel and fine sand intercalated by sand gravel and gravel cobble as the slope of the terrain becomes flatter the sediment grains of the alluvial diluvial aquifer in the fine soil plain become finer and the lithology of the aquifer is finer with medium to coarse sand and fine sand generally found in the area shi et al 2021 the lithology of the study area is divided into four categories from south to north as follows gravel sand gravel fine sand and meal sand fig 3a 3 2 1 2 geomorphology the topographic map of the study area is derived from the dataset of the remote sensing survey of resources and the environmental project of the chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 100 m the dataset has four geomorphology classes including beach land plain mountains and desert fig 3b 3 2 1 3 slope the slope determines the recharge process of groundwater and is negatively related to the infiltration rate of surface water with which groundwater interacts nampak et al 2014 ait el mekki and laftouhi 2016 the slope is calculated from a digital elevation model dem in gis the slope is classified into five classes using quantile classification 0 0 313 0 313 0 625 0 625 0 938 0 938 1 355 and 1 355 26 577 for evaluating groundwater resilience in the study area fig 3c 3 2 1 4 soil type soil properties are a critical factor controlling groundwater recharge and soil types and their various permeabilities largely control the infiltration or transport rate of surface water into aquifer systems rahmati and melesse 2016 the soil map of the study area is extracted from the second national soil census data a 1 1 000 000 scale digital soil map of china amorphic soils semi aquatic soils anthrosols desert soils and alkali saline soils are distributed throughout the study area fig 3d 3 2 1 5 distance to river and canal density euclidean distance and line density tools are applied to generate river distance and canal density maps in the study area respectively from the current river and canal data the distance from the river is categorized into five groups 2 18 2 18 5 89 5 89 12 87 12 87 24 20 and 24 20 km fig 3e fig 3f indicates that the canal density is divided into five categories including 0 0 0 103 0 103 0 175 0 175 0 315 and 0 315 km km2 a shorter distance to the river and a higher canal density imply a higher surface runoff which favours groundwater storage 3 2 1 6 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity depends on the groundwater flow in the aquifer mogaji 2017 and regions with a higher hydraulic conductivity favour groundwater enrichment as shown in fig 3g the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of shallow groundwater in the study area generally decreases from south to north the zoning of hydraulic conductivity in the study area is divided into five classes 3 2 1 7 groundwater depth the groundwater depth dictates the depth of groundwater transport and the time of contact with the surrounding medium oikonomidis et al 2015 the groundwater depth is separated into six categories 1 1 3 3 6 6 10 10 20 and 20 m fig 3h the groundwater depth map of the study area is obtained from 2010 groundwater depth data from the hotan river basin 3 2 1 8 land use land use is a vital factor in controlling groundwater recharge and different land types have different impacts on the groundwater recharge process kaliraj et al 2014 the land use data of the study area in 2015 are obtained from the results dataset of the remote sensing survey of resources and the environmental project of the chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 30 m according to the land use characteristics of the study area and national land type classification standards land types are reclassified into six categories farmland woodland grassland water body residential area and unused land fig 3i 3 2 2 dempster shafer evidence theory model in 1967 dempster first suggested the dempster shafer evidence theory as a rule of information combination in his study of statistical questions dempster 1967 in further developing this evidence theory shafer proposed a mathematical approach to uncertainty inference based on evidence and combination by adopting the concept of a belief function shafer 1976 in the present study the dempster shafer evidence theory model is applied to predict groundwater resilience and it is constructed by establishing a framework of discernment defining the basic probability assignment calculating the mass function and implementing the evidence combination a framework of discernment ϑ is the set of all probable targets for a certain object to be judged and is a mutually exclusive nonempty finite set eq 6 a in eq 6 is the probability that each pixel p is high for the target groundwater resilience and a is the negation of a i e the probability that each pixel p is lower for the groundwater resilience the basic probability assignment is performed for the target in the framework of discernment and the basic probability function m eq 7 needs to fulfil the conditions 2 θ 0 1 and x ϑ m x 1 6 ϑ a a 7 m 2 θ a a ϑ according to the existing groundwater resilience calculation results we consider c rs 0 094 and p i 2 as the criteria for target a the belief function bel disbelief function dis plausibility function pls and uncertainty function unc are calculated using eqs 8 11 park 2011 rahmati and melesse 2016 bel indicates the degree of belief in any one target the calculation of pls contains the degree of belief in this target and the degree of belief in the unknown field and the difference between bel and pls is denoted as unc bel a and pls a indicate the lower and upper probabilities in target a respectively the bel a pls a interval refers to the belief interval which characterizes the range of the degree of uncertainty fig 4 the size of the belief interval determines the extent of credibility of the evidence the wider the interval is the lower the credibility of the evidence and vice versa 8 bel a λ a e ij λ a e ij 9 dis a λ a e ij λ a e ij 10 pls a 1 dis a 11 unc a 1 dis a bel a where e ij is the class i attribute of the spatial information layer j λ a e ij is the likelihood ratio for supporting target a and λ a e ij is the likelihood ratio for supporting target a the likelihood ratio for supporting the target can be defined as eqs 12 and 13 12 λ a e ij n l e ij n l n e ij n l e ij n a n l 13 λ a e ij n l n l e ij n l n a n l n e ij n l e ij n a n l where n l e ij is the number of groundwater well pixels in e ij that support target a n l is the total number of groundwater wells in the study area that support target a n e ij is the total number of pixels for class i attributes in layer j and n a is the total number of pixels in the whole region the basic probability assignment of each information layer is decided according to the spatial relationship between the spatial location of observation wells and the groundwater conditioning factor layers the attributes of the groundwater conditioning factor layers are superimposed to obtain raster layers corresponding to the belief disbelief plausibility and uncertainty of each groundwater conditioning factor the basic probability assignment of different information layers is combined to obtain the ultimate results according to the combination rules of the dempster shafer evidence theory the evidence combination rules used in this study are as follows mogaji et al 2015 14 bel x bel a bel b bel a unc b bel b unc a δ 15 dis x dis a dis b dis a unc b

pls a the degree of uncertainty is expressed by unc a and calculated as pls a bel a and the degree of disbelief is expressed by dis a and calculated as 1 pls a in eqs 14 18 bel x denotes the lower degree of belief for each layer of factor type or range dis x denotes the degree of disbelief for each layer of factor type or range unc x denotes the degree of uncertainty for each layer of factor type or range x denotes each factor type 1 2 9 and δ is called the normalization factor the mass functions in the dempster shafer evidence theory model including belief disbelief uncertainty and plausibility are the belief function components that evaluate the predictive ability of the evidence model using eqs 14 18 to iterate evidential layers eight operational iterations are performed on the nine evidential layers the final results are used to construct a groundwater resilience zonation map for the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater resilience based on the groundwater performance indicator c rs and resilience indicator p i the paper quantitatively estimates groundwater resilience based on groundwater level data in the study area using two methods the groundwater performance indicator c rs and the resilience indicator p i the statistical characteristics are shown in table 1 the theoretical value of the groundwater performance indicator c rs is 0 1 and c rs ranges from 0 to 0 25 in the study area with an average value of 0 094 and 44 of the wells being greater than the average according to the c rs value resilience is classified into five classes with values ranging from 0 to 0 01 0 01 0 02 0 02 0 03 0 03 0 094 and 0 094 nineteen percent of the wells have low resilience compared with moderate resilience and 44 of the wells have high resilience the average p i of 27 wells is used to assess the interannual variation in groundwater resilience in the study area the observation wells are located in areas with a relatively high resilience while the wells with a relatively low resilience are mainly located in areas with a high groundwater depth and are far from the river wells with a relatively high resilience are mainly found in the upstream oasis irrigation area and near the downstream river channel where the lithology is coarse sand gravel and fine sand the terrain is flat and canal systems are densely distributed and the soil types are mainly semi aquatic soils and anthrosols fig 5 fig 6 presents the proportion of different classes of resilience based on c rs and p i the c rs is concentrated in the high and moderate high classes p i accounts for the largest proportion 74 in the high classes and c rs is higher than p i in the very low and moderate high classes which more representative in assessing regional groundwater resilience the groundwater performance indicator c rs or the resilience indicator p i the advantage of the water resource systems resilience metric c rs proposed by hashimoto et al 1982 is that it can describe the rate at which the system recovers to a satisfactory state after a failure but the satisfactory or unsatisfactory state depends on a set threshold here we set the multiyear average groundwater level of each well as the threshold the resilience indicator p i based on a convex model and critical slowing down theory can not only reveal the temporal variability of groundwater system resilience but also effectively identify critical shifts in groundwater system resilience qi et al 2016 kumar et al 2020 both approaches to assessing resilience can address long term changes in system resilience but the resilience metric c rs better meets the five criteria baseline functionality threshold functionality whole system damage elapsed time to satisfactory recovery and uncertainty scenarios of disruptions included in the resilience assessment of water resource systems than does the resilience indicator p i shin et al 2018 notably for four wells c rs has a value of 0 but p i is not 0 the reason for this is that the calculation of c rs is constrained by the threshold limit if the observation wells are subject to external disturbance and the groundwater level is below the multiyear average groundwater level for a long time and cannot return to its original state the water level is still stable within a fixed range in this case a calculated c rs of 0 does not mean that the groundwater resilience at that location is low and quantifying the groundwater resilience based on the c rs is not reliable at this point in contrast the resilience indicator p i better reflects variations in long term groundwater system resilience as it is not limited by other conditions using the resilience indicator p i to assess groundwater resilience and exploring the effects of various resolutions daily monthly annual or different types of hydrological series as state variables on groundwater resilience under climate change and anthropogenic disturbance scenarios remains a challenge in quantifying groundwater resilience and requires further research in the future 4 2 application of the dempster shafer theory model in groundwater resilience mapping based on wells with a groundwater performance indicator c rs value 0 094 and a resilience indicator p i value 2 the components of the belief function including bel dis unc and pls for each category of the groundwater resilience conditioning factor calculated using eqs 8 13 adequately represent the relationship between the groundwater resilience and nine conditioning factors table 2 the bel value directly reflects the groundwater resilience with relatively high bel values implying a high groundwater resilience bel values of 0 in a category indicate that no groundwater wells of the category are present lithology is a critical factor controlling groundwater occurrence rahmati and melesse 2016 and different lithological units affect the groundwater storage capacity the results of the belief calculations show that the bel value of fine sand and sand gravel in the study area is higher than that of other lithological units indicating a positive correlation between this category and groundwater resilience in terms of geomorphology the highest pls values are found on the plain with c rs showing low bel and high unc values and p i showing high bel and low unc values bel is relatively high at the lower slope and closer to the river 2 18 5 89 km previous studies have illustrated that areas with flatter slopes have slower surface runoff comparatively higher infiltration and higher groundwater potential nampak et al 2014 mogaji et al 2015 rahmati and melesse 2016 for soil types the highest bel values occur in anthrosols and semi aquatic soils indicating the highest groundwater resilience while the relationship between desert soils amorphic soils and alkali saline soils and groundwater resilience is weak for canal density the bel results for c rs and p i are the reverse with the former showing high groundwater resilience in low density zones 0 0 103 km km2 and the latter showing an overall increasing trend in bel as the canal density increases with the highest at canal densities 0 709 km km2 according to the findings of nampak et al 2014 rahmati and melesse 2016 and shi et al 2021 a positive correlation exists between dense river drainage systems and groundwater occurrence therefore we believe that estimating the belief function for each category of canal density based on p i is more reliable the hydraulic conductivity is defined as the rate of water flow per unit cross sectional area of an aquifer mogaji 2017 reducing hydraulic conductivity is important for improving resilience alraggad et al 2017 the highest bel value in the study area is at k 20 m d when k 20 m d groundwater resilience tends to increase with increasing k values and the bel value is 0 when k 80 m d due to the absence of groundwater well distribution in the area regarding the groundwater depth the bel of c rs shows an overall increasing trend with increasing groundwater depth and the bel of p i is highest at 10 20 m illustrating the high probability of groundwater resilience occurring in the case of land use the c rs calculation indicates that the bel of residential areas is significantly higher than that of other land use types probably because groundwater wells are mostly located in residential areas p i shows that the bel value of woodlands is the highest followed by residential areas indicating that the groundwater resilience is highest in woodlands the reason for this is that the presence of woodlands decreases groundwater runoff and soil evaporation while the presence of impermeable layers in residential areas is not conducive to groundwater recharge the combined belief function components bel dis unc and pls are integrated and the integration results of the nine evidential layers are presented in figs 7 and 8 the spatial distribution of bel values explain the combination of groundwater resilience with nine conditioning factor evidential layers fig 7a fig 8a mogaji et al 2015 concluded that a correlation exists between areas with a high degree of bel a low degree of dis a high degree of pls and a low degree of unc in contrast to the spatial distribution of dis values bel values are always low in areas with high unc and the belief that areas with low unc values indicate a high groundwater resilience is reliable areas with high pls values are also characterized by relatively high bel and unc values the belief function maps of the two indicators fig 7a fig 8a reveal that the areas with the highest groundwater resilience in the study area are located mainly in the river channel and the oasis irrigation area in the southern part of the study area where the canal system is denser the terrain is flatter and the lithological units are mostly fine sand and gravelly sand meanwhile the areas with relatively low groundwater resilience are concentrated around the oasis irrigation area and in the middle area from the river channel to the desert the unc values in the study area range from 10 fig 7c to 11 8 fig 8c the unc value in the c rs based dempster shafer theory model fusion is generally higher than p i with fig 7c demonstrating that the areas of low unc values are mostly located in the oasis irrigation area fig 8c illustrates that the areas with the highest unc values are mainly situated in mountains with higher unc values outside the oasis irrigation area and around the downstream river due to insufficient observation well data in these areas available for validation 4 3 validation of the groundwater resilience map the belief maps figs 7a 8a are overlaid with the locations of 27 wells in gis and the predicted values for each point are obtained c rs 0 0 25 and p i 1 25 4 18 for the 27 wells are then classified as very low low moderate moderate high and high and compared with the predicted values for that point the dempster shafer theory model results for c rs and p i using nine groundwater conditioning factor evidential layers are 40 7 and 59 3 accurate respectively and the model is subsequently rerun by removing nonsignificant factors from the model for this purpose we consider excluding lithology fig 3a or hydraulic conductivity fig 3g from evidential layers because they are relatively coarse and unvalidated data with low reliability the results from the final model after removing those factors from the evidential layer table 3 show that the c rs values are consistent with the predicted values for 14 wells with a prediction accuracy of 51 9 and the p i values are consistent with those predicted for 18 wells with a prediction accuracy of 66 7 the selection of the groundwater conditioning factor the evidential layer transformed in the dempster shafer theory model has a significant impact on the performance of the dempster shafer theory model a conclusion that is consistent with previous studies nampak et al 2014 mogaji et al 2015 the prediction accuracy of the p i based dempster shafer model increases by 7 4 after removing the lithology factor and by 11 2 after the removal of lithology and hydraulic conductivity factors in general the dempster shafer theory model constructed using p i as an indicator for evaluating groundwater resilience is superior to that using c rs 4 4 creation of groundwater resilience map the groundwater resilience zonation map fig 9 of the final output of the bel values show different levels of groundwater resilience within the study area representing the degree to which the evidential layers support groundwater resilience and is considered the most likely map for predicting groundwater resilience mogaji et al 2015 the percentage of each category in the study area is shown in fig 10 fig 9a shows the spatial relationship between seven evidential layers excluding lithology and hydraulic conductivity and c rs the bel values are classified as very low 0 0 168 low 0 168 0 260 moderate 0 260 0 405 moderate high 0 405 0 632 and high 0 632 accounting for 25 15 21 22 and 17 of the total area respectively fig 9b explains the spatial relationship between eight evidential layers with lithology removed and p i with bel values divided into five categories very low bel value of 0 0 072 3 of the total area low 0 072 0 171 30 medium 0 171 0 458 30 high 0 458 0 786 22 and high 0 786 15 prediction maps based on the two resilience indicators show that the regions with moderate high and high resilience have a good coherence and are mostly distributed in the upstream oasis irrigation area and around the downstream river channel but differences exist in the prediction results the c rs based prediction map fig 9a indicates high resilience in the southern mountains of the study area and overall low resilience around the downstream channel with large continuous zones of very low resilience in contrast the prediction map based on p i fig 9b displays a discontinuous strip of resilience around the downstream channel that transitions from higher areas to moderate then alternating from very low to low due to the different classification of the two indicators and the difference in the resilience categories corresponding to the observation wells see 4 1 fig 5 5 conclusions the purpose of this study is to construct a dempster shafer theory model based on the groundwater performance indicator c rs and the resilience indicator p i to spatially predict groundwater resilience in the study area and evaluate the validity of these two indicators in predicting groundwater resilience nine groundwater conditioning factors are selected and spatial datasets are created as evidential layers in the dempster shafer theory model the integration results are combined to spatially predict the groundwater resilience in the study area ultimately outputting groundwater resilience zoning map as quantitative criteria for groundwater resilience both c rs and p i can address long term changes in the resilience of groundwater systems wells with relatively high resilience are mainly located in the upstream oasis irrigation area and near the downstream river while wells with relatively low resilience are distributed in areas with higher groundwater depths and greater distances from the river the dempster shafer theory model is constructed based on resilience indicators and evidential layers consisting of groundwater conditioning factors to produce zonal maps of very low low moderate moderate high and high groundwater resilience the accuracy of the prediction maps produced by the final model is 51 9 c rs and 66 7 p i validation of the predicted results with p i yields better results than validation with c rs according to the spatial relationship between eight groundwater conditioning factors geomorphology slope distance to river soil type canal density hydraulic conductivity groundwater depth and land use and p i groundwater resilience is classified as very low bel value of 0 0 072 low 0 072 0 171 moderate 0 171 0 458 moderate high 0 458 0 786 and high 0 786 accounting for 3 30 30 22 and 15 of the total area of the region respectively in conclusion regional groundwater resilience predictions based on the dempster shafer theory model are reasonably reliable and the model has the advantage of not only outputting the degree of support for the prediction results from the evidential layers through belief functions but also quantifying the uncertainty to reflect systematic and random errors in addition the selection of groundwater conditioning factors has a significant impact on the performance of the dempster shafer theory model which may produce more accurate and reliable spatial prediction results when the evidential layers are sufficiently detailed this study may provide a scientific basis for groundwater resource planning and management in the hotan river basin and the findings will assist in understanding groundwater resilience in arid inland river basins credit authorship contribution statement yuehui wang writing original draft writing review editing

7811,study region the yellow river basin in china study focus the discharge in the lowlands of a watershed is susceptible to the variations in its high altitude headwaters in terms of climate land cover use and anthropogenic interference this study not only focuses on the key role of the high altitude headwaters of the yellow river basin yrb on the water supply in its droughty downstream lowlands but also analyzes the contributions of the headwaters changes to affect the variations of discharge in the entire basin especially in the early 21st century compared to the last half of the 20th century new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that more than 1 3 of the actual flow out of the headwaters of the yrb supported the excessive water demand mainly for irrigation downstream the observed discharge q obs increased by 44 07 in the yrb as a whole before and after the mutation year 2002 during 1986 2019 and 76 45 of the discharge increment derived from the headwaters the increasing precipitation in the headwaters dominated the discharge recovery of the yrb and resulted in a relative increase of 36 28 in the q obs of the entire yrb whereas the variations of the headwaters in terms of potential evapotranspiration land cover and water use for human activities have decreased the q obs of the entire yrb by 4 68 2 07 and 5 10 respectively keywords discharge variations headwater region of the yellow river water supply climate land cover water use data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a key resource in the 21st century mountains as the water towers of the world provide substantial freshwater resources to the adjacent lowlands for natural and anthropogenic water demands immerzeel et al 2020 almost 1 2 of global mountain areas provide supportive or even essential water resources for the areas downstream viviroli et al 2007 and 1 3 of the global lowland area depend heavily on runoff contributions from mountains for irrigation viviroli et al 2020 the tibetan plateau and its surrounding areas known as the asian water tower are the headwater regions of more than a dozen major rivers in asia l wang et al 2021 and the water demands in the downstream lowlands of the asian water tower is much higher than that of other water towers worldwide immerzeel et al 2020 the asian water tower was acutely affected by global changes in recent decades which was reflected in that the cryosphere has melted more rapidly under the rapid regional warming and the anthropogenic interference has increased azam et al 2021 yao et al 2019 since the 21st century drastic changes in the asian water tower not only have altered the discharge in the headwaters of major rivers khanal et al 2021 but also have increased the dependence of the downstream population on the water supply in the headwaters especially in the basins where arid and semi arid areas are widespread downstream immerzeel et al 2020 viviroli et al 2020 among many rivers originating from asian water towers the yellow river yr is the only one with humid headwaters and downstream regions flowing through arid and semi arid areas lian et al 2021 thus the important influence of the recent variations in the high altitude headwater regions of the yellow river basin yrb on the water resources in its low altitude downstream regions deserves more attention the yr originates from the asian water tower and has been fundamental to chinese civilization in china the yr supported 8 7 of the total population kong et al 2016 13 of the arable land x wang et al 2018 and 15 of the total irrigation water accounting for only 2 of the total river discharge and its flow frequently stopped in the late 20th century tang et al 2008 su et al 2021 thus water shortages and the gap between the supply and demand in the yrb are of considerable concern during the current period of large variations in the social ecological environment numerous studies have been conducted in response to these water resource problems and similar conclusions have frequently been reached that is the discharge across the yrb has decreased notably since the 1950 s due to the larger influences of anthropogenic activities e g irrigation water conservancy projects and underlying surface changes caused by artificial measures compared to those of climatic change reflected in the amplitude and frequency of the precipitation temperature and or evaporation leading to a large water budget deficit and the regional water demand exceeding the supply zhang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 chang et al 2017 kong et al 2016 lv et al 2018 it is noteworthy that the zero flow phenomenon has disappeared and an increase in discharge has been found since the 21st century tang et al 2013 although many previous studies have focused on the decrease in the discharge of the yrb since the 1950 s a substantial recovery in the discharge and its attribution analysis especially in the early 21st century compared to the last half of the 20th century has been not been thoroughly studied the headwater region of the yellow river basin yrb with an average altitude above 3600 m has produced approximately 70 of the natural discharge for the entire basin and this proportion of runoff generation overtopped that of other large rivers derived from the tibetan plateau most of the natural discharge in the headwaters of the yr is transformed by precipitation while the glacier and snow meltwater has the few replenishment to discharge li et al 2021 t wang et al 2018 which differs from other asian large rivers that rely heavily on seasonal meltwater supply such as the ganges river and the indus river biemans et al 2019 pritchard 2019 as the main water producing area the headwater region of the yrb not only plays a pivotal role in supplying excess water demand downstream for agricultural irrigation industrial production urban living and ecological needs but also regulates the variations in the discharge in the whole yrb most studies about the headwaters of yr focused on its recent variations in the hydrological process and water budget caused by the changes in climate underlying surface and human activities l ma et al 2021 q ma et al 2021 t wang et al 2018 yan et al 2020 zhou and huang 2012 however the contributions of the discharge to water demands from the headwater region of the yr to the downstream lowlands and the responses of the discharge in the entire yrb to headwater changes have also not been sufficiently studied the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to systematically analyze the large role of the headwaters of the yr in the water supply in its downstream lowlands 2 to quantitatively research how the variations in the headwater region affect the recovery in discharge in the entire yrb in the early 21st century different from the last half of the 20th century specifically we first respectively calculated the variations in natural discharge q nat observed discharge q obs and restored discharge caused by human activities q human in the period 1986 2002 relative to the period 2003 2019 from in headwater region to the entire yrb and then identified the contributions of the discharge in the headwater region of the yr to the water demands in its downstream lowlands section 4 1 next the spatiotemporal variations of climate e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and land cover e g land use and vegetation cover as the main driving factors that control natural discharge variations across the yrb have been analyzed section 4 2 finally the relative contributions of climate land cover and water consumption and impoundment by human activities to discharge variation in the headwater region downstream lowlands and the whole yrb have been separated respectively based on the choudhury yang equation and thus how the headwater changes to influence the water budget of the entire yrb has been illustrated section 4 3 these may help the research community and policy makers to implement integrated management of basin wide water resources in the yrb enabling sustainable regional socioeconomic and eco environmental development in the future 2 study area and datasets 2 1 yellow river basin the yrb is located in northern central china it originates in the bayan kara mountains of the tibetan plateau and flows into the bohai sea with a length of about 5464 km and a basin area of about 75 2 104 km2 the yrb successively crosses the arid semi arid and semi humid regions in china from northwest to southeast fig 1 the annual precipitation distribution ranges from 145 mm to 788 mm fig a 1a and the annual potential evapotranspiration distribution ranges from 798 mm to 1208 mm fig a 2a the drought in the region between the lanzhou and toudaoguai stations outclassed other areas of yrb fig a 3a grassland occupied the highest proportion 47 of the entire yrb in 2018 followed by farmland 26 forests 13 water bodies and unused land 10 and urban land 4 fig a 4a the vegetation coverage in the yrb increased from northwest to southeast fig a 5a more than 75 of the water consumption for human activities in the yrb was used for agricultural irrigation mainly in the arid northwestern and downstream areas fig a 6a furthermore there were 219 large and medium sized reservoirs in the yrb by 2019 with a water storage capacity of 43 08 km3 contributing to flooding control irrigation and power generation in addition numerous measures and policies concerning water management and eco environmental protection have been implemented since 1998 to address the severe water problems across the yrb tables a 1 and a 2 2 2 data sources and processing 2 2 1 discharge data with the rapid development of society and the economy the discharge of the yr has been utilized for and regulated by human activities such as agricultural irrigation and water conservation projects consequently the observed discharge q obs at the main hydrological stations along the yr does not reflect the flow and variation rules of the natural discharge q nat in terms of the quantity and spatial and temporal distributions therefore it is necessary to decompose the q obs into anthropogenic and natural unaffected by human activities q nat components for water resource evaluation and water conservation project design in this study the inter annual variations in the q obs and q nat across the yrb were analyzed during 2003 2019 and were compared to those during 1986 2002 in addition the q nat or q obs in a sub basin is the difference in the discharge between two adjacent hydrological stations representing the water yield of the sub basin between the two stations the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources in china developed a method of calculating the q nat in the yrb and the equations for calculating the q nat in the yrb can be simplified as follows 1 qnat qobs qhuman where q human is the estimated sum of the water directly consumed and regulated by human activities that is q human is the restored discharge from q obs to q nat equal to the sum of the surface water consumption by all sectors of the national economy including agricultural irrigation urban activities industry forestry and ecology and the change in the reservoir water storage although the change of water impoundment by reservoirs has not changed the long term trend of q obs compared with the water consumption mainly for agricultural irrigation but could modulate and mitigate the distribution of q obs between varying time scales e g year month and day in the early 21st century with no new building of large reservoirs the data for the annual q nat q obs and q human across the sub basins of the yrb were obtained from the yellow river water resources bulletin http www yrcc gov cn zwzc gzgb gb szygb furthermore the monthly q obs data across the yrb were obtained from the yellow river sediment bulletin http www yrcc gov cn zwzc gzgb gb nsgb 2 2 2 climate and land cover data the precipitation data and other meteorological data used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration i e maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and sunshine duration during 1986 2019 were derived from the chinese surface climatic data daily dataset v3 0 china meteorological data service centre and national meteorological information centre http data cma cn data the potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the penman monteith equation which is recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao owing to its better performance and more detailed calculations were conducted by xie et al 2019 the precipitation data and potential evapotranspiration data from 133 meteorological stations fig 1 were interpolated onto spatial grids using the kriging method which has a better fitting effect the leaf area index lai was used to characterize the vegetation cover in the yrb and the lai data were obtained from the globmap leaf area index lai version 3 description https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 336 based on the quantitative fusion inversion of satellite remote sensing images such as advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images liu et al 2012 the land use data with a spatial resolution of 1 km were downloaded from https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 264 which mainly originated from landsat remote sensing data collected by the us and were obtained via manual visual interpretation the vector boundaries of the entire yrb and its sub basins were derived from the spatial distribution of the third order basins in china https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 278 in addition r3 6 2 and arcmap 10 2 were used for the data processing and analysis in this study and all of the daily results were summed to obtain the yearly data 3 methods 3 1 trend and mutation tests the linear regression analysis method was used to calculate the inter annual trend of the discharge i e q nat q obs and q human for a certain driving factor across the yrb kong et al 2016 the linear tendency estimation method is often applied to hydro meteorological time series and the statistical value p which was obtained from the linear tendency estimation is used to indicate the level of significance when p 0 01 the result is significant at the 99 confidence level and when p 0 05 it is significant at the 95 confidence level the cumulative anomaly method peng et al 2016 was used to identify the turning points in the discharge across the yrb when the cumulative anomaly curve exhibits an upward trend the discharge is higher than the running average whereas a downward trend indicates the discharge is lower than the running average 3 2 discharge variation attribution analysis various empirical statistics hydrological models and the elasticity method have been used by numerous scholars to analyze the contributions of climate change land cover changes and human activities to discharge variations on different spatial and temporal scales the statistical method e g the method of the change in the slope of the cumulative quantity has simple calculations but it requires long term measurements of hydro meteorological data and lacks a physical mechanism s wang et al 2012 hydrological models are physically reliable but require complicated model calibrations and validation via massive amounts of high resolution input data and the simulation results can be affected by the reliability of the datasets from multiple sources the surface conditions and the water intake engineering hu et al 2015 liu and xu 2017 rasmy et al 2019 in view of the limitations of both empirical statistical methods and hydrological models the elasticity coefficient method based on the choudhury yang equation under the budyko framework was adopted in this study which not only has a scientific physical basis but also makes it relatively simple to separate the respective contributions of the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and changes in the underlying land surface to the changes in the natural discharge without human water withdrawal under the budyko framework the long term actual land evapotranspiration is mainly determined by the balance between the atmospheric water supply to the land surface i e precipitation and the atmospheric evaporation demand equal to the potential evapotranspiration without consideration of the characteristics of the underlying land surface dale et al 2015 the watershed coupled water energy balance equation based on budyko s hypothesis has been improved choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 yang and yang 2011 liu et al 2018 which is referred to as the choudhury yang equation this equation fully considers the contributions of the water energy and underlying surface conditions according to the choudhury yang equation and based on budyko s hypothesis liang et al 2020 yang et al 2008 yang and yang 2011 the evapotranspiration in the yrb conforms to the following formula 2 e pe p pe n p n 1 n where p is the precipitation pe is the potential evapotranspiration and the parameter n reflects the characteristics of the underlying land surface e g topography land use type vegetation cover and soil properties hydrological elements such as the climate variables i e precipitation and evapotranspiration the change in the terrestrial water storage and the natural discharge for a closed basin over a certain time period follow the water balance equation 3 q nat p e tws where q nat is the natural discharge depth p is precipitation e is evapotranspiration and tws is the change in the terrestrial water storage in the catchment notably tws is generally ignored on long time scales thus eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 q nat p pe p pe n p n 1 n according to eq 4 the change of annual q nat can be expressed in the following total differential form 5 d q nat f p dp f pe dpe f n dn runoff sensitivity is an important indicator of the response of the natural discharge to variations in the climatic factors and factors related to the underlying surface within a particular catchment and it can be used to quantitatively and physically separate the effects of the climate and land cover changes on the natural discharge without the use of highly parameterized hydrological models berghuijs et al 2017 chen et al 2019 tang et al 2020 yang et al 2008 yang and yang 2011 zhao et al 2015 the sensitivity of the runoff can be defined as the proportional change in the discharge in response to a proportional change in a specific factor such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration and land cover fu et al 2007 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 yang et al 2012 zheng et al 2009 the equation for calculating the fundamental sensitivity of the runoff is as follows 6 ε x d q nat q nat dx x where ε x is the sensitivity of the runoff q nat is the natural discharge without water consumption and regulation by human activities and x is the factor under consideration re arranging the terms in eqs 5 and 6 we can have the following form 7 d q nat q nat ε p dp p ε pe dpe pe ε n dn n then the sensitivity of the runoff can be rewritten according to eq 7 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2014 and as follows 8 ε p 1 φ n 1 n 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n φ 9 ε pe 1 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 n 10 ε n ln 1 φ n φ n ln 1 φ n n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n where φ pe p the study period 1986 2019 was divided into the baseline period 1986 2002 and the post impact period 2003 2019 according to the mutation point detected using the cumulative anomaly method fig a 7 based on eqs 6 8 the discharge increment caused by the precipitation q p potential evapotranspiration q pe and land surface q land during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 was calculated as follows 11 q p ε p q nat p p 12 q pe ε pe q nat pe pe 13 q land ε n q nat n n it should be noted that q nat p and pe in eqs 6 13 are the long term average annual mean values for 1986 2019 p pe and n are the increments of the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface index n during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 when water use for human activities is excluded the change in q nat i e q nat during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 can be expressed as 14 q nat q p q pe q land in contrast when water use for human activities is included the change in q obs i e q obs during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 can be expressed as 15 q obs q p q pe q land q human using the elasticity coefficient method based on the choudhury yang equation described above we quantitatively separated the contributions of the driving factors e g climate change land cover change and water use for human activities of the discharge variation across the yrb during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 then the respective relative contributions of precipitation η p potential evapotranspiration η pe land cover η land and water use for human activities η huamn to q obs in a certain basin were calculated for example 16 η p q p q p q pe q land q human 100 and η pe η land and η huamn were computed similarly to η p 3 3 uncertainty of the runoff attribution analysis the applicability and reliability of the elasticity method based on the choudhury yang equation have been widely proven for discharge attribution analysis in numerous rivers in china and abroad such as the lower connecticut river in the u s wang and stephenson 2018 and the tarim river yang et al 2018 the lancang river h liu et al 2020 the yalong river zhao et al 2021 the minjiang river liang et al 2020 and the yr in china lv et al 2018 the sensitivity of the runoff was regarded as constant based on the method described in section 3 2 when analyzing the attribution of the runoff however regarding the sensitivity of the runoff the key parameters in the elastic method vary with time but are regarded as constants leading to uncertainty in the discharge attribution analysis i e the unexpected changes in δ q p δ q pe and δ q land y wang et al 2021 therefore uncertainty analysis must be performed before using this method but many studies have not performed this crucial step in this study the uncertainties of the runoff attribution analysis using the elasticity coefficient method based on the choudhury yang equation were analyzed in this study using the following two indicators three groups of ε p ε pe and ε n values were obtained using the datasets for 1986 2002 baseline period 2003 2019 post baseline period and 1986 2016 entire period the corresponding q p q pe and q land values were subsequently calculated the indicator σ x represents the relative range of change of q x due to the variation in the sensitivity of the runoff and it is calculated as follows 17 σ x q x baseline q x entire q x entire q x post baseline q x entire q x entire 100 where x refers to precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe or land surface land furthermore the smaller the range of the relative change in q x the higher the reliability of the runoff attribution analysis given that the sum of q p q pe q land and q human may differ from q obs due to the relative changes in the sensitivity of the runoff in this study the indicator δ was used to measure whether the q p q pe q land and q human values calculated using the elasticity coefficient method conform to eq 15 as expected similar to the indicator σ x the smaller the absolute value for the indicator δ the more reliable the attribution analysis of the change in the discharge in the yr based on the elasticity coefficient method the indicator δ for a certain basin was obtained as follows 18 δ q p q pe q land q human q obs q obs 100 4 results 4 1 variations in discharge from in headwater region to the entire yrb the increasing natural discharge q nat in the headwater region of the yrb is most beneficial for the q nat recovery in the yrb in the early 21st century according to the cumulative anomaly method the abrupt change year of the q nat series from 1986 to 2019 across the yrb was primarily 2002 fig a 7 for all of the major hydrological stations q nat has increased since 2002 whereas it decreased significantly during the last half of the 20th century fig 2a and a 8a b for the entire yrb the annual mean q nat increased by 15 20 during the period after 2002 at a rate of 0 83 km3 year whereas it sharply decreased at a rate of 1 61 km3 year during 1986 2002 fig 2a the runoff generation ability shows a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity across the yrb the headwater region only 28 00 of the total area of the yrb accounted for 67 33 of the total q nat of the entire yrb during 2003 2019 fig 3 furthermore the headwater region accounted for 79 76 of the increase in the q nat in the entire yrb 6 72 km3 in the early 21st century fig 2a the discharge directly utilized for human activities e g water consumption by all sectors of the national economy and water impoundment changes of reservoirs was regarded as the anthropogenic restored discharge q human and it caused the annual mean observed discharge q obs to decrease by 62 89 with respect to the q nat for the entire yrb during the early 21st century fig 3 spatially only 10 95 of the q human occurred in the headwater region whereas 89 05 of the q human mainly for irrigation occurred in downstream lowlands where the water demand i e the q human overstepped the water supply i e the q nat fig 3 except for the headwater region the total q human and the water consumption of most industries increased downstream the sub basins during the early 21st century demonstrating the severe imbalance between the water yield and water demand for human activities across the yrb fig a 6 additional policies and management measures have been implemented to regulate the water in the yrb since 1998 and have led to remarkable improvements in the efficiency of the utilization of the water in the yr table a 1 and the water utilization efficiency in the entire yrb improved from 74 88 in 1998 to 83 96 in 2019 fig a 9 the increase in q nat due to climate and land cover changes far exceeded the decrease in discharge caused by water use for human activities in most regions of the yrb and thus q obs still increased by 44 07 from 13 21 km3 to 19 03 km3 in the yrb as a whole before and after 2002 fig 2b the significant increase in q obs in the headwater region ensured that the entire yrb had a steady water supply during the early 21st century the water demand has exceeded the supply in the lowlands of since 1986 figs 2b and 3 and the grey region in figs 2b and a10 represents the water supply from the headwaters to the downstream lowlands in the early 21st century more than 1 3 of the discharge i e the q obs from the headwater regions was used to compensate for the excessive water demand in the downstream sub basins fig 2b meanwhile nearly half of the total water demand in the lowlands depended on the water supply from the headwaters fig 4 the water supply ratio of the headwaters to its downstream lowlands decreased slightly during 2003 2019 38 96 compared with 1986 2002 51 54 fig 2b owing to the implementation of numerous water saving policies and management measures downstream during the early 21st century table a 2 the highest water supply ratio of the headwater region to the downstream sub basins occurred in spring 72 15 followed by winter 43 42 autumn 39 43 and summer 19 90 and the water supply ratio in all of the seasons decreased similar to the annual scale in the early 21st century fig a10 the part of water demand in the lowlands of the yrb due to the headwaters supply also reduced slightly from 47 19 in 1986 2002 41 06 in 2003 2019 fig 4 to ensure the continuous supply of water from the headwater region to the entire yrb under the intense climatic and environmental changes in the 21st century a series of eco environmental protection measures such as the establishment of the three river source nature reserve 2000 and the three river source national park 2018 the latter of which is the first national park in china have been implemented table a 2a 4 2 variations in climate and land cover across the yrb the yrb tended to be humid in the early 21st century the annual mean precipitation increased by 11 45 from 412 mm in 1986 2002 459 mm in 2003 2019 across the entire yrb with the larger increase of 13 11 in the headwaters fig 5a and a 1 the runoff coefficient the ratio of precipitation to q nat represents how much precipitation is converted to natural discharge in a region in contrast to the statistically significant decrease during 1986 2002 the runoff coefficient exhibited a slightly increasing trend and positive change in the entire yrb after 2002 especially in the headwater region which had the highest runoff coefficient more than 30 compared with other downstream sub basins less than 7 fig 5b and a 11 this large increase in precipitation especially in the headwater region produced an abundant supply of runoff for the entire yrb the evaporation capacity has been increasing since 2002 whereas the degree of drought has eased across the yrb the potential evapotranspiration represents the evaporation capacity of a region and it is strongly and positively correlated with temperature according to the penman monteith equation xie et al 2019 the potential evapotranspiration increased significantly in most regions of the yrb during 1986 2019 in particular with the headwater region which had the highest increase of 33 98 mm during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 figs 5c and a 2 nevertheless the increased potential evapotranspiration was not conducive to runoff generation in the yrb the dryness index that is the ratio of the potential evapotranspiration to precipitation indicates the degree of drought in a region the trend and amplitude of the increase in precipitation were greater than those of the increase in the potential evapotranspiration fig 5a and c thus leading to the decreased dryness index across the yrb in the early 21st century figs 5d and a 3 the land cover has undergone major changes across the yrb because a series of ecological restoration and conservation policies were implemented after 1998 table a 2b for example the headwater region has the largest increases of 8 97 103 km2 6 00 in the grassland compared with other downstream sub basins the proportions of forest increased widely across the yrb corresponding to a general decrease in farmland in the early 21st century fig a 4 in addition the annual mean lai exhibited a statistically significant increasing trend during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 indicating the vegetation greening across the yrb figs 5e and a 5 revegetation has vital impacts on the water balance and hydrological cycle especially in arid and semi arid areas with critical water shortage problems bao et al 2019 during the early 21st century climate and socioeconomic drivers contributed to vegetation greening precipitation played a leading role in the increase in vegetation cover naeem et al 2021 in turn the vegetation restoration also had a positive effect on the local precipitation especially on the loess plateau naeem et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 co environmental protection measures have effectively improved the land cover conditions in the yrb and have had profound impacts on the discharge in the yr naeem et al 2021 y zhang et al 2015 notably the value of underlying surface index n which represents the more characterization of the catchment landscape more comprehensively than lai varied slightly before and after 2002 4 3 contributions of climate land cover and water use for human activities in headwater region to the variations in the discharge of the entire yrb the q obs in the entire yrb increased from 13 21 km3 to 19 03 km3 in the early 21st century relative to 1986 2002 which was attributed to the changes in the headwater region the δ q obs from the headwater region reached 4 45 km3 accounting for 76 45 of the total δ q obs in the entire yrb fig 6 in addition the q obs in the headwater region was about twice that for the entire yrb during the early 21st century fig 3 therefore the variations in climate land cover and water use for human activities in the headwater region of yrb not only would affect the runoff generation of the headwater region but also regulate the water budget in the entire yrb the increase in precipitation in the headwater region was the key driving force of the wetting in the entire yrb for the entire yrb the relative contribution of the changes in precipitation to the total δ q obs reached 65 98 i e the η p similarly below fig 6 and table 1 and the changes in the discharge components caused by precipitation i e the δ q p similarly below was mainly from the headwater region fig 7 in other words the increase in precipitation in the headwaters resulted in a relative increase of 36 28 in the q obs of the entire yrb while the contribution of the precipitation in the lowlands resulted in a 29 70 increase in the q obs in the entire yrb fig 7 the increase in potential evapotranspiration contributed negatively to the increase in the q obs across the yrb while its impact was smaller than that of precipitation most of the δ q pe in the entire yrb was concentrated in the headwater region fig 7 and the largest increase in potential evapotranspiration in the headwaters caused a 4 68 decrease in the q obs in the entire yrb fig 7 the land cover changes in the headwater region had a minimal impact on the q obs recovery in the entire yrb the variations in the land use cover were found to have negative effects on the increase in discharge in the entire yrb resulting in a relative reduction in the q obs by 23 40 table 1 the land cover changes in the headwater region i e the vegetation restoration and frozen soil degradation only reduced the q obs in the entire yrb by 2 07 whereas most of the δ q land in the entire yrb occurred in the lowlands fig 7 especially in the region between the loess plateau i e sub basin iii fig a 12 and previous studies have focused on the impact of vegetation greening on discharge reduction on the loess plateau in the last two decades hu et al 2021 bao et al 2019 lv et al 2019 zuo et al 2016 the decrease in the q obs in the entire yrb caused by the variations in water use for human activities from the headwater region was close to that due to the potential evapotranspiration for the entire yr the variations in water use for human activities i e the δ q human had a smaller influence on the changes in the q obs than the climate and land cover changes leading to a decrease in the q obs value of only 0 90 km3 fig 6 the q human in the headwater region increased by 35 68 before and after 2002 whereas the q human in the lowlands during 2003 2019 was only 0 06 less than that in 1986 2002 thus the vast majority of the δ q human in the entire yrb derived from the headwater region and the increase in water use for human activities from the headwater region reduced the q obs in the entire yrb by 5 10 fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of the changes in cryosphere in the headwater region the variations in the q nat in the most headwater regions located in the tibetan plateau are not only affected by the changes in precipitation but also by the changes in cryospheric elements such as the snow glacier and frozen soil compared with other headwaters in the tibetan plateau the discharge in the source region of the yr are mainly contributed by rainfall more than 70 snow ablation about 20 but the glacier melting less than 1 and degradation of frozen soil has little contribution on it li et al 2021 t wang et al 2018 view that the little impact of cryospheric changes on the variations in discharge in the entire yrb the frozen soil and glacier are classified as part of the underlying surface characteristics and the snowfall together with rainfall forms precipitation and therefore the contributions of three cryosphere elements to discharge changes are not analyzed separately in the elasticity coefficient method under the budyko framework used in this study noted that if tws is not ignored in eq 3 the contribution of the frozen soil or glacier to discharge changes could be calculated based on the modified budyko equation in the watersheds where the glacier melting or degradation of permafrost seriously affects runoff changes liu et al 2022 t wang et al 2018 xin et al 2021 some studies also try to research hydrological effects of snow fraction or snow ratio on runoff within the budyko framework liu et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the budyko framework based on water and energy balance deserves extensive attention in order to separate the influences of various climate and cryosphere elements on runoff changes more concisely accurately and effectively in the future although the impact of cryosphere changes on runoff is far less than that of climate change mainly precipitation it cannot be completely ignored the snow melting mainly affected the spring discharge in the headwater region for example a 1 variation in the snow depth could cause a 0 43 variation in the discharge in april and a 1 variation in the number of snow days could lead to a 0 82 variation in the discharge in the 21st century li et al 2021 the supply from the headwater region to the downstream water consumption mainly for irrigation was the highest in the spring fig 4 caused by the snowmelt discharge recently studies have found that the snow depth has increased li et al 2021 and the timing of the snowmelt discharge has been advancing in most areas of the headwater region of the yr since 2000 liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 compared with the high latitude permafrost region in the arctic the permafrost degradation on the tibetan plateau has been more active in response to climate warming wang and gao 2022 wang et al 2012 the significant degradation of the permafrost in the source region of the yrb could reduce the streamflow by increasing groundwater storage t wang et al 2018 5 2 uncertainties due to the variations in sensitivities of runoff in the above study the sensitivities of the natural discharge to precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε pe and underlying surface index n ε n have been regarded as constants as shown in table 1 for the entire yrb the long term mean values of ε p ε pe and ε n during 1986 2019 are 2 33 1 33 and 2 01 respectively this indicates that 1 changes in the values of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface index n caused natural variations of 2 33 1 33 and 2 01 respectively in the entire yrb actually the sensitivities of the natural discharge would vary with the spatial and temporal variations the absolute value of the climate elasticity of the discharge i e ε p and ε pe strengthened slightly in the entire basin as the climate became wetter seen by a reduction of the dryness index after 2002 except in the headwater region in which ε p and ε pe decreased figs 8a c in contrast the absolute value of the underlying surface elasticity of the discharge i e ε n decreased as the degree of drought decreased during 2003 2019 in addition ε p ε pe and ε n were all positively correlated with underlying surface index n and increased as the complexity of the land surface conditions increased figs 8d f however the variation in the sensitivities of runoff could cause unexpected changes in δ q p δ q pe and δ q land therefore the uncertainties of the discharge attribution analysis for the yr were analyzed considering the spatiotemporal changes in the sensitivity of the runoff discussed above the range of the relative change in δ q p δ q pe and δ q land were measured by the indicators σ p σ pe and σ land calculated using eq 17 in the entire yrb σ p was the smallest from 0 92 to 0 95 followed by that in σ pe 1 60 to 1 66 and σ land 2 17 to 2 30 indicating that the change in the sensitivity of the runoff only slightly affect the discharge attribution results figs 8g i the headwater region has the lowest uncertainty in the δ q p and δ q pe less than 1 in contrast to downstream sub basins whereas it has the highest σ land 2 76 to 3 10 the difference in the δ q p δ q pe and δ q land caused by the changes in the sensitivities of runoff across the yrb all did not exceed 4 and thus the results of the attribution analysis of the δ q nat were reliable moreover the sum of δ q p δ q pe δ q land and δ q human is consistent with the actual change in the discharge i e the δ q obs overall with deviations i e the indicator δ calculated using eq 18 of only 0 05 entire yrb 0 07 sub basin i and 0 62 sub basin ii v confirming again that the results of the attribution analysis of the change in the discharge of the yr in the entire yrb and its sub basins are trustworthy table 1 6 conclusion the discharge of the yellow river especially for the headwaters changed significantly on different spatial and temporal scales in the early 21st century relative to the last half of the 20th century based on the choudhury yang equation how the variations in the headwater region affected the water demand in the downstream lowlands and the discharge changes in the entire yrb were quantitatively analyzed and the relative contributions of climate land cover and water consumption and impoundment for human activities to the discharge variations across the yrb were determined the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the headwater region produced 67 33 of the natural flow in the entire yrb in the early 21st century the 38 96 of the actual flow in the headwater region was utilized to compensate for the excessive water demand mainly for irrigation in the downstream lowlands especially in spring and the 47 19 of the water demand in the lowlands was due to the water supply from the headwaters during 2003 2019 2 the observed discharge q obs in the headwater region increased by 4 45 km3 from 26 37 km3 to 30 82 km3 before and after the mutation year 2002 during 1986 2019 which accounted for 76 45 of the increase in the q obs in the entire yrb from 13 21 km3 to 19 03 km3 3 for the entire yrb the variations in precipitation potential evapotranspiration land cover and water use for human activities contributed 65 98 12 02 km3 5 66 1 03 km3 23 40 4 26 km3 and 4 96 0 90 km3 respectively to the changes in observed discharge 4 for the headwater region the increase in precipitation resulted in a relative increase of 36 28 6 61 km3 in the q obs of the entire yrb while the largest increase in potential evapotranspiration the land cover changes such as the vegetation restoration and the increasing water use for human activities reduced the q obs of the entire yrb by 4 68 0 85 km3 2 07 0 38 km3 and 5 10 0 93 km3 respectively in conclusion it is of great significance to study how the variations in high altitude headwater regions in the asian water tower area under the global change has a chain effect on the changes of runoff in the entire basin and how it affects the water supply in its downstream lowlands with the large population aggregation the method under the budyko framework used in the paper has not effectively separated the impact of the variations in cryospheric elements in the headwaters of the yr on the runoff change in the entire yrb therefore the cryosphere hydrology model should be used to more accurately simulate the hydrological relationship between the high altitude headwater regions especially with large glacier area and its downstream lowlands and the comparison among different watersheds also should be enhanced in the future credit authorship contribution statement xinfeng fan conceptualization methodology data analysis writing

7811,study region the yellow river basin in china study focus the discharge in the lowlands of a watershed is susceptible to the variations in its high altitude headwaters in terms of climate land cover use and anthropogenic interference this study not only focuses on the key role of the high altitude headwaters of the yellow river basin yrb on the water supply in its droughty downstream lowlands but also analyzes the contributions of the headwaters changes to affect the variations of discharge in the entire basin especially in the early 21st century compared to the last half of the 20th century new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that more than 1 3 of the actual flow out of the headwaters of the yrb supported the excessive water demand mainly for irrigation downstream the observed discharge q obs increased by 44 07 in the yrb as a whole before and after the mutation year 2002 during 1986 2019 and 76 45 of the discharge increment derived from the headwaters the increasing precipitation in the headwaters dominated the discharge recovery of the yrb and resulted in a relative increase of 36 28 in the q obs of the entire yrb whereas the variations of the headwaters in terms of potential evapotranspiration land cover and water use for human activities have decreased the q obs of the entire yrb by 4 68 2 07 and 5 10 respectively keywords discharge variations headwater region of the yellow river water supply climate land cover water use data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a key resource in the 21st century mountains as the water towers of the world provide substantial freshwater resources to the adjacent lowlands for natural and anthropogenic water demands immerzeel et al 2020 almost 1 2 of global mountain areas provide supportive or even essential water resources for the areas downstream viviroli et al 2007 and 1 3 of the global lowland area depend heavily on runoff contributions from mountains for irrigation viviroli et al 2020 the tibetan plateau and its surrounding areas known as the asian water tower are the headwater regions of more than a dozen major rivers in asia l wang et al 2021 and the water demands in the downstream lowlands of the asian water tower is much higher than that of other water towers worldwide immerzeel et al 2020 the asian water tower was acutely affected by global changes in recent decades which was reflected in that the cryosphere has melted more rapidly under the rapid regional warming and the anthropogenic interference has increased azam et al 2021 yao et al 2019 since the 21st century drastic changes in the asian water tower not only have altered the discharge in the headwaters of major rivers khanal et al 2021 but also have increased the dependence of the downstream population on the water supply in the headwaters especially in the basins where arid and semi arid areas are widespread downstream immerzeel et al 2020 viviroli et al 2020 among many rivers originating from asian water towers the yellow river yr is the only one with humid headwaters and downstream regions flowing through arid and semi arid areas lian et al 2021 thus the important influence of the recent variations in the high altitude headwater regions of the yellow river basin yrb on the water resources in its low altitude downstream regions deserves more attention the yr originates from the asian water tower and has been fundamental to chinese civilization in china the yr supported 8 7 of the total population kong et al 2016 13 of the arable land x wang et al 2018 and 15 of the total irrigation water accounting for only 2 of the total river discharge and its flow frequently stopped in the late 20th century tang et al 2008 su et al 2021 thus water shortages and the gap between the supply and demand in the yrb are of considerable concern during the current period of large variations in the social ecological environment numerous studies have been conducted in response to these water resource problems and similar conclusions have frequently been reached that is the discharge across the yrb has decreased notably since the 1950 s due to the larger influences of anthropogenic activities e g irrigation water conservancy projects and underlying surface changes caused by artificial measures compared to those of climatic change reflected in the amplitude and frequency of the precipitation temperature and or evaporation leading to a large water budget deficit and the regional water demand exceeding the supply zhang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 chang et al 2017 kong et al 2016 lv et al 2018 it is noteworthy that the zero flow phenomenon has disappeared and an increase in discharge has been found since the 21st century tang et al 2013 although many previous studies have focused on the decrease in the discharge of the yrb since the 1950 s a substantial recovery in the discharge and its attribution analysis especially in the early 21st century compared to the last half of the 20th century has been not been thoroughly studied the headwater region of the yellow river basin yrb with an average altitude above 3600 m has produced approximately 70 of the natural discharge for the entire basin and this proportion of runoff generation overtopped that of other large rivers derived from the tibetan plateau most of the natural discharge in the headwaters of the yr is transformed by precipitation while the glacier and snow meltwater has the few replenishment to discharge li et al 2021 t wang et al 2018 which differs from other asian large rivers that rely heavily on seasonal meltwater supply such as the ganges river and the indus river biemans et al 2019 pritchard 2019 as the main water producing area the headwater region of the yrb not only plays a pivotal role in supplying excess water demand downstream for agricultural irrigation industrial production urban living and ecological needs but also regulates the variations in the discharge in the whole yrb most studies about the headwaters of yr focused on its recent variations in the hydrological process and water budget caused by the changes in climate underlying surface and human activities l ma et al 2021 q ma et al 2021 t wang et al 2018 yan et al 2020 zhou and huang 2012 however the contributions of the discharge to water demands from the headwater region of the yr to the downstream lowlands and the responses of the discharge in the entire yrb to headwater changes have also not been sufficiently studied the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to systematically analyze the large role of the headwaters of the yr in the water supply in its downstream lowlands 2 to quantitatively research how the variations in the headwater region affect the recovery in discharge in the entire yrb in the early 21st century different from the last half of the 20th century specifically we first respectively calculated the variations in natural discharge q nat observed discharge q obs and restored discharge caused by human activities q human in the period 1986 2002 relative to the period 2003 2019 from in headwater region to the entire yrb and then identified the contributions of the discharge in the headwater region of the yr to the water demands in its downstream lowlands section 4 1 next the spatiotemporal variations of climate e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and land cover e g land use and vegetation cover as the main driving factors that control natural discharge variations across the yrb have been analyzed section 4 2 finally the relative contributions of climate land cover and water consumption and impoundment by human activities to discharge variation in the headwater region downstream lowlands and the whole yrb have been separated respectively based on the choudhury yang equation and thus how the headwater changes to influence the water budget of the entire yrb has been illustrated section 4 3 these may help the research community and policy makers to implement integrated management of basin wide water resources in the yrb enabling sustainable regional socioeconomic and eco environmental development in the future 2 study area and datasets 2 1 yellow river basin the yrb is located in northern central china it originates in the bayan kara mountains of the tibetan plateau and flows into the bohai sea with a length of about 5464 km and a basin area of about 75 2 104 km2 the yrb successively crosses the arid semi arid and semi humid regions in china from northwest to southeast fig 1 the annual precipitation distribution ranges from 145 mm to 788 mm fig a 1a and the annual potential evapotranspiration distribution ranges from 798 mm to 1208 mm fig a 2a the drought in the region between the lanzhou and toudaoguai stations outclassed other areas of yrb fig a 3a grassland occupied the highest proportion 47 of the entire yrb in 2018 followed by farmland 26 forests 13 water bodies and unused land 10 and urban land 4 fig a 4a the vegetation coverage in the yrb increased from northwest to southeast fig a 5a more than 75 of the water consumption for human activities in the yrb was used for agricultural irrigation mainly in the arid northwestern and downstream areas fig a 6a furthermore there were 219 large and medium sized reservoirs in the yrb by 2019 with a water storage capacity of 43 08 km3 contributing to flooding control irrigation and power generation in addition numerous measures and policies concerning water management and eco environmental protection have been implemented since 1998 to address the severe water problems across the yrb tables a 1 and a 2 2 2 data sources and processing 2 2 1 discharge data with the rapid development of society and the economy the discharge of the yr has been utilized for and regulated by human activities such as agricultural irrigation and water conservation projects consequently the observed discharge q obs at the main hydrological stations along the yr does not reflect the flow and variation rules of the natural discharge q nat in terms of the quantity and spatial and temporal distributions therefore it is necessary to decompose the q obs into anthropogenic and natural unaffected by human activities q nat components for water resource evaluation and water conservation project design in this study the inter annual variations in the q obs and q nat across the yrb were analyzed during 2003 2019 and were compared to those during 1986 2002 in addition the q nat or q obs in a sub basin is the difference in the discharge between two adjacent hydrological stations representing the water yield of the sub basin between the two stations the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources in china developed a method of calculating the q nat in the yrb and the equations for calculating the q nat in the yrb can be simplified as follows 1 qnat qobs qhuman where q human is the estimated sum of the water directly consumed and regulated by human activities that is q human is the restored discharge from q obs to q nat equal to the sum of the surface water consumption by all sectors of the national economy including agricultural irrigation urban activities industry forestry and ecology and the change in the reservoir water storage although the change of water impoundment by reservoirs has not changed the long term trend of q obs compared with the water consumption mainly for agricultural irrigation but could modulate and mitigate the distribution of q obs between varying time scales e g year month and day in the early 21st century with no new building of large reservoirs the data for the annual q nat q obs and q human across the sub basins of the yrb were obtained from the yellow river water resources bulletin http www yrcc gov cn zwzc gzgb gb szygb furthermore the monthly q obs data across

methods 3 1 trend and mutation tests the linear regression analysis method was used to calculate the inter annual trend of the discharge i e q nat q obs and q human for a certain driving factor across the yrb kong et al 2016 the linear tendency estimation method is often applied to hydro meteorological time series and the statistical value p which was obtained from the linear tendency estimation is used to indicate the level of significance when p 0 01 the result is significant at the 99 confidence level and when p 0 05 it is significant at the 95 confidence level the cumulative anomaly method peng et al 2016 was used to identify the turning points in the discharge across the yrb when the cumulative anomaly curve exhibits an upward trend the discharge is higher than the running average whereas a downward trend indicates the discharge is lower than the running average 3 2 discharge variation attribution analysis various empirical statistics hydrological models and the elasticity method have been used by numerous scholars to analyze the contributions of climate change land cover changes and human activities to discharge variations on different spatial and temporal scales the statistical method e g the method of the change in the slope of the cumulative quantity has simple calculations but it requires long term measurements of hydro meteorological data and lacks a physical mechanism s wang et al 2012 hydrological models are physically reliable but require complicated model calibrations and validation via massive amounts of high resolution input data and the simulation results can be affected by the reliability of the datasets from multiple sources the surface conditions and the water intake engineering hu et al 2015 liu and xu 2017 rasmy et al 2019 in view of the limitations of both empirical statistical methods and hydrological models the elasticity coefficient method based on the choudhury yang equation under the budyko framework was adopted in this study which not only has a scientific physical basis but also makes it relatively simple to separate the respective contributions of the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and changes in the underlying land surface to the changes in the natural discharge without human water withdrawal under the budyko framework the long term actual land evapotranspiration is mainly determined by the balance between the atmospheric water supply to the land surface i e precipitation and the atmospheric evaporation demand equal to the potential evapotranspiration without consideration of the characteristics of the underlying land surface dale et al 2015 the watershed coupled water energy balance equation based on budyko s hypothesis has been improved choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 yang and yang 2011 liu et al 2018 which is referred to as the choudhury yang equation this equation fully considers the contributions of the water energy and underlying surface conditions according to the choudhury yang equation and based on budyko s hypothesis liang et al 2020 yang et al 2008 yang and yang 2011 the evapotranspiration in the yrb conforms to the following formula 2 e pe p pe n p n 1 n where p is the precipitation pe is the potential evapotranspiration and the parameter n reflects the characteristics of the underlying land surface e g topography land use type vegetation cover and soil properties hydrological elements such as the climate variables i e precipitation and evapotranspiration the change in the terrestrial water storage and the natural discharge for a closed basin over a certain time period follow the water balance equation 3 q nat p e tws where q nat is the natural discharge depth p is precipitation e is evapotranspiration and tws is the change in the terrestrial water storage in the catchment notably tws is generally ignored on long time scales thus eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 q nat p pe p pe n p n 1 n according to eq 4 the change of annual q nat can be expressed in the following total differential form 5 d q nat f p dp f pe dpe f n dn runoff sensitivity is an important indicator of the response of the natural discharge to variations in the climatic factors and factors related to the underlying surface within a particular catchment and it can be used to quantitatively and physically separate the effects of the climate and land cover changes on the natural discharge without the use of highly parameterized hydrological models berghuijs et al 2017 chen et al 2019 tang et al 2020 yang et al 2008 yang and yang 2011 zhao et al 2015 the sensitivity of the runoff can be defined as the proportional change in the discharge in response to a proportional change in a specific factor such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration and land cover fu et al 2007 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 yang et al 2012 zheng et al 2009 the equation for calculating the fundamental sensitivity of the runoff is as follows 6 ε x d q nat q nat dx x where ε x is the sensitivity of the runoff q nat is the natural discharge without water consumption and regulation by human activities and x is the factor under consideration re arranging the terms in eqs 5 and 6 we can have the following form 7 d q nat q nat ε p dp p ε pe dpe pe ε n dn n then the sensitivity of the runoff can be rewritten according to eq 7 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2014 and as follows 8 ε p 1 φ n 1 n 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n φ 9 ε pe 1 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 n 10 ε n ln 1 φ n φ n ln 1 φ n n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n where φ pe p the study period 1986 2019 was divided into the baseline period 1986 2002 and the post impact period 2003 2019 according to the mutation point detected using the cumulative anomaly method fig a 7 based on eqs 6 8 the discharge increment caused by the precipitation q p potential evapotranspiration q pe and land surface q land during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 was calculated as follows 11 q p ε p q nat p p 12 q pe ε pe q nat pe pe 13 q land ε n q nat n n it should be noted that q nat p and pe in eqs 6 13 are the long term average annual mean values for 1986 2019 p pe and n are the increments of the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface index n during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 when water use for human activities is excluded the change in q nat i e q nat during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 can be expressed as 14 q nat q p q pe q land in contrast when water use for human activities is included the change in q obs i e q obs during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 can be expressed as 15 q obs q p q pe q land q human using the elasticity coefficient method based on the choudhury yang equation described above we quantitatively separated the contributions of the driving factors e g climate change land cover change and water use for human activities of the discharge variation across the yrb during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 then the respective relative contributions of precipitation η p potential evapotranspiration η pe land cover η land and water use for human activities η huamn to q obs in a certain basin were calculated for example 16 η p q p q p q pe q land q human 100 and η pe η land and η huamn were computed similarly to η p 3 3 uncertainty of the runoff attribution analysis the applicability and reliability of the elasticity method based on the choudhury yang equation have been widely proven for discharge attribution analysis in numerous rivers in china and abroad such as the lower connecticut river in the u s wang and stephenson 2018 and the tarim river yang et al 2018 the lancang river h liu et al 2020 the yalong river zhao et al 2021 the minjiang river liang et al 2020 and the yr in china lv et al 2018 the sensitivity of the runoff was regarded as constant based on the method described in section 3 2 when analyzing the attribution of the runoff however regarding the sensitivity of the runoff the key parameters in the elastic method vary with time but are regarded as constants leading to uncertainty in the discharge attribution analysis i e the unexpected changes in δ q p δ q pe and δ q land y wang et al 2021 therefore uncertainty analysis must be performed before using this method but many studies have not performed this crucial step in this study the uncertainties of the runoff attribution analysis using the elasticity coefficient method based on the choudhury yang equation were analyzed in this study using the following two indicators three groups of ε p ε pe and ε n values were obtained using the datasets for 1986 2002 baseline period 2003 2019 post baseline period and 1986 2016 entire period the corresponding q p q pe and q land values were subsequently calculated the indicator σ x represents the relative range of change of q x due to the variation in the sensitivity of the runoff and it is calculated as follows 17 σ x q x baseline q x entire q x entire q x post baseline q x entire q x entire 100 where x refers to precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe or land surface land furthermore the smaller the range of the relative change in q x the higher the reliability of the runoff attribution analysis given that the sum of q p q pe q land and q human may differ from q obs due to the relative changes in the sensitivity of the runoff in this study the indicator δ was used to measure whether the q p q pe q land and q human values calculated using the elasticity coefficient method conform to eq 15 as expected similar to the indicator σ x the smaller the absolute value for the indicator δ the more reliable the attribution analysis of the change in the discharge in the yr based on the elasticity coefficient method the indicator δ for a certain basin was obtained as follows 18 δ q p q pe q land q human q obs q obs 100 4 results 4 1 variations in discharge from in headwater region to the entire yrb the increasing natural discharge q nat in the headwater region of the yrb is most beneficial for the q nat recovery in the yrb in the early 21st century according to the cumulative anomaly method the abrupt change year of the q nat series from 1986 to 2019 across the yrb was primarily 2002 fig a 7 for all of the major hydrological stations q nat has increased since 2002 whereas it decreased significantly during the last half of the 20th century fig 2a and a 8a b for the entire yrb the annual mean q nat increased by 15 20 during the period after 2002 at a rate of 0 83 km3 year whereas it sharply decreased at a rate of 1 61 km3 year during 1986 2002 fig 2a the runoff generation ability shows a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity across the yrb the headwater region only 28 00 of the total area of the yrb accounted for 67 33 of the total q nat of the entire yrb during 2003 2019 fig 3 furthermore the headwater region accounted for 79 76 of the increase in the q nat in the entire yrb 6 72 km3 in the early 21st century fig 2a the discharge directly utilized for human activities e g water consumption by all sectors of the national economy and water impoundment changes of reservoirs was regarded as the anthropogenic restored discharge q human and it caused the annual mean observed discharge q obs to decrease by 62 89 with respect to the q nat for the entire yrb during the early 21st century fig 3 spatially only 10 95 of the q human occurred in the headwater region whereas 89 05 of the q human mainly for irrigation occurred in downstream lowlands where the water demand i e the q human overstepped the water supply i e the q nat fig 3 except for the headwater region the total q human and the water consumption of most industries increased downstream the sub basins during the early 21st century demonstrating the severe imbalance between the water yield and water demand for human activities across the yrb fig a 6 additional policies and management measures have been implemented to regulate the water in the yrb since 1998 and have led to remarkable improvements in the efficiency of the utilization of the water in the yr table a 1 and the water utilization efficiency in the entire yrb improved from 74 88 in 1998 to 83 96 in 2019 fig a 9 the increase in q nat due to climate and land cover changes far exceeded the decrease in discharge caused by water use for human activities in most regions of the yrb and thus q obs still increased by 44 07 from 13 21 km3 to 19 03 km3 in the yrb as a whole before and after 2002 fig 2b the significant increase in q obs in the headwater region ensured that the entire yrb had a steady water supply during the early 21st century the water demand has exceeded the supply in the lowlands of since 1986 figs 2b and 3 and the grey region in figs 2b and a10 represents the water supply from the headwaters to the downstream lowlands in the early 21st century more than 1 3 of the discharge i e the q obs from the headwater regions was used to compensate for the excessive water demand in the downstream sub basins fig 2b meanwhile nearly half of the total water demand in the lowlands depended on the water supply from the headwaters fig 4 the water supply ratio of the headwaters to its downstream lowlands decreased slightly during 2003 2019 38 96 compared with 1986 2002 51 54 fig 2b owing to the implementation of numerous water saving policies and management measures downstream during the early 21st century table a 2 the highest water supply ratio of the headwater region to the downstream sub basins occurred in spring 72 15 followed by winter 43 42 autumn 39 43 and summer 19 90 and the water supply ratio in all of the seasons decreased similar to the annual scale in the early 21st century fig a10 the part of water demand in the lowlands of the yrb due to the headwaters supply also reduced slightly from 47 19 in 1986 2002 41 06 in 2003 2019 fig 4 to ensure the continuous supply of water from the headwater region to the entire yrb under the intense climatic and environmental changes in the 21st century a series of eco environmental protection measures such as the establishment of the three river source nature reserve 2000 and the three river source national park 2018 the latter of which is the first national park in china have been implemented table a 2a 4 2 variations in climate and land cover across the yrb the yrb tended to be humid in the early 21st century the annual mean precipitation increased by 11 45 from 412 mm in 1986 2002 459 mm in 2003 2019 across the entire yrb with the larger increase of 13 11 in the headwaters fig 5a and a 1 the runoff coefficient the ratio of precipitation to q nat represents how much precipitation is converted to natural discharge in a region in contrast to the statistically significant decrease during 1986 2002 the runoff coefficient exhibited a slightly increasing trend and positive change in the entire yrb after 2002 especially in the headwater region which had the highest runoff coefficient more than 30 compared with other downstream sub basins less than 7 fig 5b and a 11 this large increase in precipitation especially in the headwater region produced an abundant supply of runoff for the entire yrb the evaporation capacity has been increasing since 2002 whereas the degree of drought has eased across the yrb the potential evapotranspiration represents the evaporation capacity of a region and it is strongly and positively correlated with temperature according to the penman monteith equation xie et al 2019 the potential evapotranspiration increased significantly in most regions of the yrb during 1986 2019 in particular with the headwater region which had the highest increase of 33 98 mm during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 figs 5c and a 2 nevertheless the increased potential evapotranspiration was not conducive to runoff generation in the yrb the dryness index that is the ratio of the potential evapotranspiration to precipitation indicates the degree of drought in a region the trend and amplitude of the increase in precipitation were greater than those of the increase in the potential evapotranspiration fig 5a and c thus leading to the decreased dryness index across the yrb in the early 21st century figs 5d and a 3 the land cover has undergone major changes across the yrb because a series of ecological restoration and conservation policies were implemented after 1998 table a 2b for example the headwater region has the largest increases of 8 97 103 km2 6 00 in the grassland compared with other downstream sub basins the proportions of forest increased widely across the yrb corresponding to a general decrease in farmland in the early 21st century fig a 4 in addition the annual mean lai exhibited a statistically significant increasing trend during 2003 2019 relative to 1986 2002 indicating the vegetation greening across the yrb figs 5e and a 5 revegetation has vital impacts on the water balance and hydrological cycle especially in arid and semi arid areas with critical water shortage problems bao et al 2019 during the early 21st century climate and socioeconomic drivers contributed to vegetation greening precipitation played a leading role in the increase in vegetation cover naeem et al 2021 in turn the vegetation restoration also had a positive effect on the local precipitation especially on the loess plateau naeem et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 co environmental protection measures have effectively improved the land cover conditions in the yrb and have had profound impacts on the discharge in the yr naeem et al 2021 y zhang et al 2015 notably the value of underlying surface index n which represents the more characterization of the catchment landscape more comprehensively than lai varied slightly before and after 2002 4 3 contributions of climate land cover and water use for human activities in headwater region to the variations in the discharge of the entire yrb the q obs in the entire yrb increased from 13 21 km3 to 19 03 km3 in the early 21st century relative to 1986 2002 which was attributed to the changes in the headwater region the δ q obs from the headwater region reached 4 45 km3 accounting for 76 45 of the total δ q obs in the entire yrb fig 6 in addition the q obs in the headwater region was about twice that for the entire yrb during the early 21st century fig 3 therefore the variations in climate land cover and water use for human activities in the headwater region of yrb not only would affect the runoff generation of the headwater region but also regulate the water budget in the entire yrb the increase in precipitation in the headwater region was the key driving force of the wetting in the entire yrb for the entire yrb the relative contribution of the changes in precipitation to the total δ q obs reached 65 98 i e the η p similarly below fig 6 and table 1 and the changes in the discharge components caused by precipitation i e the δ q p similarly below was mainly from the headwater region fig 7 in other words the increase in precipitation in the headwaters resulted in a relative increase of 36 28 in the q obs of the entire yrb while the contribution of the precipitation in the lowlands resulted in a 29 70 increase in the q obs in the entire yrb fig 7 the increase in potential evapotranspiration contributed negatively to the increase in the q obs across the yrb while its impact was smaller than that of precipitation most of the δ q pe in the entire yrb was concentrated in the headwater region fig 7 and the largest increase in potential evapotranspiration in the headwaters caused a 4 68 decrease in the q obs in the entire yrb fig 7 the land cover changes in the headwater region had a minimal impact on the q obs recovery in the entire yrb the variations in the land use cover were found to have negative effects on the increase in discharge in the entire yrb resulting in a relative reduction in the q obs by 23 40 table 1 the land cover changes in the headwater region i e the vegetation restoration and frozen soil degradation only reduced the q obs in the entire yrb by 2 07 whereas most of the δ q land in the entire yrb occurred in the lowlands fig 7 especially in the region between the loess plateau i e sub basin iii fig a 12 and previous studies have focused on the impact of vegetation greening on discharge reduction on the loess plateau in the last two decades hu et al 2021 bao et al 2019 lv et al 2019 zuo et al 2016 the decrease in the q obs in the entire yrb caused by the variations in water use for human activities from the headwater region was close to that due to the potential evapotranspiration for the entire yr the variations in water use for human activities i e the δ q human had a smaller influence on the changes in the q obs than the climate and land cover changes leading to a decrease in the q obs value of only 0 90 km3 fig 6 the q human in the headwater region increased by 35 68 before and after 2002 whereas the q human in the lowlands during 2003 2019 was only 0 06 less than that in 1986 2002 thus the vast majority of the δ q human in the entire yrb derived from the headwater region and the increase in water use for human activities from the headwater region reduced the q obs in the entire yrb by 5 10 fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of the changes in cryosphere in the headwater region the variations in the q nat in the most headwater regions located in the tibetan plateau are not only affected by the changes in precipitation but also by the changes in cryospheric elements such as the snow glacier and frozen soil compared with other headwaters in the tibetan plateau the discharge in the source region of the yr are mainly contributed by rainfall more than 70 snow ablation about 20 but the glacier melting less than 1 and degradation of frozen soil has little contribution on it li et al 2021 t wang et al 2018 view that the little impact of cryospheric changes on the variations in discharge in the entire yrb the frozen soil and glacier are classified as part of the underlying surface characteristics and the snowfall together with rainfall forms precipitation and therefore the contributions of three cryosphere elements to discharge changes are not analyzed separately in the elasticity coefficient method under the budyko framework used in this study noted that if tws is not ignored in eq 3 the contribution of the frozen soil or glacier to discharge changes could be calculated based on the modified budyko equation in the watersheds where the glacier melting or degradation of permafrost seriously affects runoff changes liu et al 2022 t wang et al 2018 xin et al 2021 some studies also try to research hydrological effects of snow fraction or snow ratio on runoff within the budyko framework liu et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the budyko framework based on water and energy balance deserves extensive attention in order to separate the influences of various climate and cryosphere elements on runoff changes more concisely accurately and effectively in the future although the impact of cryosphere changes on runoff is far less than that of climate change mainly precipitation it cannot be completely ignored the snow melting mainly affected the spring discharge in the headwater region for example a 1 variation in the snow depth could cause a 0 43 variation in the discharge in april and a 1 variation in the number of snow days could lead to a 0 82 variation in the discharge in the 21st century li et al 2021 the supply from the headwater region to the downstream water consumption mainly for irrigation was the highest in the spring fig 4 caused by the snowmelt discharge recently studies have found that the snow depth has increased li et al 2021 and the timing of the snowmelt discharge has been advancing in most areas of the headwater region of the yr since 2000 liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 compared with the high latitude permafrost region in the arctic the permafrost degradation on the tibetan plateau has been more active in response to climate warming wang and gao 2022 wang et al 2012 the significant degradation of the permafrost in the source region of the yrb could reduce the streamflow by increasing groundwater storage t wang et al 2018 5 2 uncertainties due to the variations in sensitivities of runoff in the above study the sensitivities of the natural discharge to precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε pe and underlying surface index n ε n have been regarded as constants as shown in table 1 for the entire yrb the long term mean values of ε p ε pe and ε n during 1986 2019 are 2 33 1 33 and 2 01 respectively this indicates that 1 changes in the values of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface index n caused natural variations of 2 33 1 33 and 2 01 respectively in the entire yrb actually the sensitivities of the natural discharge would vary with the spatial and temporal variations the absolute value of the climate elasticity of the discharge i e ε p and ε pe strengthened slightly in the entire basin as the climate became wetter seen by a reduction of the dryness index after 2002 except in the headwater region in which ε p and ε pe decreased figs 8a c in contrast the absolute value of the underlying surface elasticity of the discharge i e ε n decreased as the degree of drought decreased during 2003 2019 in addition ε p ε pe and ε n were all positively correlated with underlying surface index n and increased as the complexity of the land surface conditions increased figs 8d f however the variation in the sensitivities of runoff could cause unexpected changes in δ q p δ q pe and δ q land therefore the uncertainties of the discharge attribution analysis for the yr were analyzed considering the spatiotemporal changes in the sensitivity of the runoff discussed above the range of the relative change in δ q p δ q pe and δ q land were measured by the indicators σ p σ pe and σ land calculated using eq 17 in the entire yrb σ p was the smallest from 0 92 to 0 95 followed by that in σ pe 1 60 to 1 66 and σ land 2 17 to 2 30 indicating that the change in the sensitivity of the runoff only slightly affect the discharge attribution results figs 8g i the headwater region has the lowest uncertainty in the δ q p and δ q pe less than 1 in contrast to downstream sub basins whereas it has the highest σ land 2 76 to 3 10 the difference in the δ q p δ q pe and δ q land caused by the changes in the sensitivities of runoff across the yrb all did not exceed 4 and thus the results of the attribution analysis of the δ q nat were reliable moreover the sum of δ q p δ q pe δ q land and δ q human is consistent with the actual change in the discharge i e the δ q obs overall with deviations i e the indicator δ calculated using eq 18 of only 0 05 entire yrb 0 07 sub basin i and 0 62 sub basin ii v confirming again that the results of the attribution analysis of the change in the discharge of the yr in the entire yrb and its sub basins are trustworthy table 1 6 conclusion the discharge of the yellow river especially for the headwaters changed significantly on different spatial and temporal scales in the early 21st century relative to the last half of the 20th century based on the choudhury yang equation how the variations in the headwater region affected the water demand in the downstream lowlands and the discharge changes in the entire yrb were quantitatively analyzed and the relative contributions of climate land cover and water consumption and impoundment for human activities to the discharge variations across the yrb were determined the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the headwater region produced 67 33 of the natural flow in the entire yrb in the early 21st century the 38 96 of the actual flow in the headwater region was utilized to compensate for the excessive water demand mainly for irrigation in the downstream lowlands especially in spring and the 47 19 of the water demand in the lowlands was due to the water supply from the headwaters during 2003 2019 2 the observed discharge q obs in the headwater region increased by 4 45 km3 from 26 37 km3 to 30 82 km3 before and after the mutation year 2002 during 1986 2019 which accounted for 76 45 of the increase in the q obs in the entire yrb from 13 21 km3 to 19 03 km3 3 for the entire yrb the variations in precipitation potential evapotranspiration land cover and water use for human activities contributed 65 98 12 02 km3 5 66 1 03 km3 23 40 4 26 km3 and 4 96 0 90 km3 respectively to the changes in observed discharge 4 for the headwater region the increase in precipitation resulted in a relative increase of 36 28 6 61 km3 in the q obs of the entire yrb while the largest increase in potential evapotranspiration the land cover changes such as the vegetation restoration and the increasing water use for human activities reduced the q obs of the entire yrb by 4 68 0 85 km3 2 07 0 38 km3 and 5 10 0 93 km3 respectively in conclusion it is of great significance to study how the variations in high altitude headwater regions in the asian water tower area under the global change has a chain effect on the changes of runoff in the entire basin and how it affects the water supply in its downstream lowlands with the large population aggregation the method under the budyko framework used in the paper has not effectively separated the impact of the variations in cryospheric elements in the headwaters of the yr on the runoff change in the entire yrb therefore the cryosphere hydrology model should be used to more accurately simulate the hydrological relationship between the high altitude headwater regions especially with large glacier area and its downstream lowlands and the comparison among different watersheds also should be enhanced in the future credit authorship contribution statement xinfeng fan conceptualization methodology data analysis writing

7812,study region upper cauvery river basin india study focus reservoir construction is one of the major contributors to changes in natural river flow regime characteristics this study aims to understand the hydrological alterations resulting from the construction of reservoirs and water abstraction in the upper regions of the basin the impacts of dams on river flow regimes where data is available only for periods after the construction of the dams is assessed a landscape based hydrological model flex topo is used to model the flows contributed by the upstream and downstream areas of four major reservoirs in the study area a separate reservoir operation model is developed for each of the reservoirs next the hydrological model is integrated with the reservoir model and the modelled flow at the downstream streamflow gauging station of each of the corresponding four sub basins is calibrated the modelled flow regimes with and without reservoirs are then compared using the indicators of hydrological alterations to understand the degree to which the flows have been altered by the reservoirs new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that flow regimes have been modified from their natural state following reservoir impoundment and water abstractions significant impacts are observed in median monthly flow 1 day minimum flow and low pulses such information could provide a reference to water managers to replicate the natural flow regimes help sustain natural biota and thus contribute toward the sustainable management of river basins in india

as bhakra nangal nagarjunasagar kosi chambal hirakud kakrapar and tungabhadra dams to harness water for developmental needs these dams were built for multipurpose uses such as hydropower irrigation and domestic water supply and have been seen as a sign of development and economic growth klingensmith 2003 according to the national registry for large dams nrld in 2016 a total of 4877 dams were built in india and 313 dams were still under construction the cauvery river is one such peninsular river that has been intensely altered by reservoirs barrages canals and anicuts masonry check dams constructed across streams to divert water in response to rapidly growing water demands for irrigation household consumption and power generation vanham et al 2011 while the construction of the reservoirs has helped to expand the irrigated areas in the basin securing water availability during water stress conditions it has aggravated water tensions due to water allocation between the upstream and downstream states indian semi autonomous administrative regions through which the river runs leading to conflicts among the states sharing the rivers ramaswamy 1994 shah 1994 janakarajan 2016 extensive damming has also led to poor delivery of ecosystem services degradation in water quality is being reported extensively solaraj et al 2010 rani and sherine 2007 regulating services such as sediment transport have been adversely affected which in turn has impacted freshwater ecosystems vaithiyanathan et al 1992 for example changes in aquatic species composition are being observed due to the changes in sediment loads because of the construction of the reservoirs venkatachalapathy and karthikeyan 2015 dhanakumar et al 2015 moreover the population of migratory fish species such as tor spp lates calcarifer bagarius bagarius and anguilla spp has declined due to reduced flow rates in the river raj 1941 these are some examples that underline the necessity to assess the degree to which hydrological flows are altered i e deviated from the natural flows by the construction of dams in basins such as that of cauvery this study is motivated by the need for a systematic assessment of hydrological alterations by the construction of major dams in the upper cauvery basin however such an assessment requires sufficient hydrological data for the periods of pre and post reservoir construction which is often not possible the objectives of this study are therefore to i develop and implement a robust human influenced hydrological model that can reliably simulate pre reservoir hydrological regimes and ii deploy a systematic assessment of pre and post reservoir flow regime changes in the basin many studies of dam induced alterations have used indicators of hydrological alterations iha to evaluate the hydrological impacts of dams on flow regime characteristics gierszewski et al 2020 2018 mittal et al 2016 song et al 2020 do vasco et al 2019 fantin cruz et al 2015 pyron et al 2008 before 1990 methods such as field surveys and ground photograph analyses were used to assess the impact of impoundments on river channels knighton 1988 statistical analysis including the non parametric mann kendall mk method yan et al 2010 pettitt s test and flow duration analysis marcinkowski and grygoruk 2017 were also used to contrast the flow regimes before and after hydraulic interventions geomorphic change detection gcd tools http gcd riverscapes xyz have also been used to qualify topographic or morphological changes after an impoundment wheaton 2015 however a more systematic assessment of flow changes is provided by the range of variability approach richter et al 1997 and associated with it are the indices of hydrological alteration iha framework richter et al 1996 the iha method takes daily streamflow values and characterizes a flow regime in terms of five ecologically significant factors magnitude duration frequency timing and the rate of change of flows page et al 2005 even though the iha method provides a systematic assessment of flow changes due to hydraulic interventions only a few studies of indian rivers have used it see for example the studies for the kangsabati river mittal et al 2014 the krishna river kumar and jayakumar 2020 and the dikrong river borgohain et al 2019 this paper therefore applies the iha method to systematically evaluate the impacts of major dams in the upper cauvery however the information on river flows which is needed for iha is not available for periods before the construction of the dams robust hydrological modelling of basins with and without the reservoirs which enables the analysis of how river flows are impacted by modified landscapes due to human interventions is therefore additionally needed beven 2012 o sullivan et al 2019 different types of hydrological models have incorporated reservoir models or reservoir operations to simulate stream flows mateo et al 2014 li et al 2019 tehrani et al 2021 distributed models like dhsvm and crest snow have been used that combine reservoir operation modules to simultaneously assess the impacts of climate change and reservoir operations on the flow regimes li et al 2019 han et al 2019 these models incorporate reservoir operations and are capable of taking spatial heterogeneity into account but often are data intensive in their representation of changing landscapes and the impacts on river flow regimes for example the swat model accounts for spatial heterogeneities by combining distributed data on soil land cover and elevation and has been used to simulate hydrological regimes regulated by reservoirs at the basin scale sulis et al 2009 wang and xia 2010 babur et al 2016 in addition to the data and computational intensity of such models if the impacts of reservoirs are to be estimated on data that is available only after the reservoirs have been constructed then another key consideration is the transferability of models in space and time gao et al 2016 well constrained model structures are therefore needed to perform pre and post reservoir assessments especially in regions such as cauvery where low resolution data is often available and no records of flow regimes exist prior to the construction of the reservoirs this motivates the use of a topography driven rainfall runoff model flex topo model which is neither computationally expensive nor data intensive it determines well constrained model structures corresponding to the dominant hydrological processes in a catchment gao et al 2014 that can be reliably transferred in space and time gao et al 2016 nijzink et al 2016 the study then integrates the flex topo model with the iha method to assess the impacts of hydrological changes due to the construction of four major dams in the upper cauvery river basin the paper is organized as follows the study area along with reservoir details are described in the next section the methodology that incorporates reservoir operations in a topography driven rainfall runoff model and its calibration are then discussed section 3 the results are subsequently presented section 4 the paper concludes with a discussion on the impacts of reservoirs on river flow regimes in the cauvery river basin sections 5 and 6 the study will provide insight into sustainably managing water resources without hampering the socio ecological integrity of the river systems 2 description of the study area the cauvery is one of the most critical interstate rivers of southern india lying between longitude 75 27 e to 79 54 e and latitude 10 9 n to 13 30 n the cauvery basin extends over the indian states of tamil nadu karnataka kerala and the union territory of puducherry draining an area of 81 155 km2 into the bay of bengal out of this 42 per cent lies in karnataka 54 per cent in tamil nadu karaikkal region of puducherry and 4 per cent in kerala there are around 96 dams constructed in the cauvery basin during the last 1000 years out of which 70 30 per cent of dams have been used for irrigation purposes 19 80 per cent for hydro power generation 6 93 per cent for both irrigation and hydropower generation and the remaining 2 97 per cent dams are used only for drinking water supply the cauvery delta hemavathi mettur krishna raja sagara and harangi irrigation projects are among the major irrigation projects in the cauvery basin as fig 1 shows most of these dams are relatively small four major reservoirs based on size storage capacity and command area in the upper cauvery basin fig 2 have been selected for the study table 1 presents a brief discussion of the reservoirs under study 3 methods fig 3 illustrates the overall methodology it involves modelling the reservoir operations and the hydrology of areas upstream and downstream of the reservoir and then integrating the two to assess the effect of reservoirs on flow regimes observed downstream and thus on the delivery of ecosystem services as a result four sub basins are studied delineated by the four gauging stations shown in fig 5 each sub basin is further sub divided into two parts corresponding to the areas upstream and downstream of its reservoir fig 3 b further shows the modelling concept f1 and f2 represent the flex topo models for upstream and downstream areas of a reservoir contributing to flow at a gauge station gs whereas rm and ca represent the reservoir model and associated command area respectively the flow is measured at the downstream gauge station gs in the event of reservoir integration the outflow from f1 becomes the reservoir s inflow and the outflow from rm enters f2 after which the outflow from f2 is calibrated at gs if the reservoir is removed the outflow from f1 is combined with the outflow from f2 which then forms the outflow at gs further indicators of hydrological alterations which are based on river flow characteristics are used to understand the impact of reservoirs on the river flow regimes the iha method is simple to use and provides valuable information related to flow alternations and helps to assess the potential impacts that flow alterations may have on the river ecosystem 3 1 the flex topo model topography based landscape hydrological model flex topo is used savenije 2010 topography is one of the main characteristics of the river landscape which emerges from the coevolution of vegetation and soil with climate savenije 2010 gao et al 2014 as a result it determines dominant hydrological processes in a catchment gao et al 2014 and has been used as a strong constraint in determining and transferring the model structures in space and time gao et al 2016 nijzink et al 2016 the model simulates the response of catchments based on different hydrological response units hrus it approximates the river landscape hydrological behaviour by delineating catchments into different functional hydrological response units e g wetland hillslope and plateau gharari et al 2014 the novelty is that the model structure depends on landscape classes determined mainly by topography which can include geological geomorphological or land use classification savenije 2010 the parsimonious model has proven to be transferable to data scarce basins because its model structure is constrained by topography relying less on data to calibrate parameters and is robust in its simulations of flows under changing land cover patterns gao et al 2014 savenije 2010 3 1 1 the landscape classification topographic features like dem slope and height above the nearest drainage hand are used to make the three broad classifications the slope and hand are processed in arcgis using dem 80 m resolution the overall watershed area was delineated based on gauge location again the watershed area for f1 is delineated based on dam location the f1 area is clipped from the whole watershed to get f2 for each f1 and f2 the raster data set including dem slope hand and basin boundary are clipped and exported to matlab for further analysis thresholds are selected to distinguish between the three landscape classes locations with hand 5 m and slope 11 per cent is classified as a plateau locations with hand 5 m and slope 11 per cent is considered as hillslopes and locations with hand 5 m are considered wetlands gharari et al 2011 the classified maps are then compared with land use maps and five hrus hillslope forests hillslope crops plateau forests plateau crops wetlands are determined based on the percentage of landscape classes for the upstream f1 and downstream f2 areas of the reservoir for each sub basin 3 1 2 the model structures the flex topo model structure is graphically presented in fig 4 while the description of the variables of each hydrological response unit of the flex topo model is given in table 2 rainfall p mm d 1 is first partitioned between interception evaporation ei mm d 1 and effective rainfall pe mm d 1 based on a threshold si max mm effective rainfall is partitioned between water retention in the soil and yield runoff r mm d 1 based on the root zone storage capacity su max mm and a shape parameter β plant transpiration et mm d 1 is calculated based on potential evaporation e0 mm d 1 a soil moisture threshold parameter ce and the relative soil moisture su su max the generated runoff is further partitioned between a fast component rf mm d 1 and a slow component rs mm d 1 through a separator d a lag function is applied to simulate the lag time t d between peak flow and storm event two linear reservoirs with different time constants kf d and ks d are used to calculate the fast and slow runoff the total runoff qm mm d 1 is the sum of the fast component qf mm d 1 and the slow component qs mm d 1 the flex topo model classifies a landscape into different hydrological response units hrus based on the elevation dem slope and height above nearest drainage hand the landscape is first divided into hillslope plateau and wetland and the classification is then compared with land use maps more than 50 per cent of the area in the cauvery basin is dominated by field crops followed by plantation crops and evergreen forests the hillslope is characterized by comparatively larger root zone capacities due to deeper groundwater levels and perennial forest but the land use pattern of the cauvery basin has been heavily modified by agriculture five hrus are then determined based on the percentage of landscape classes for the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoir for each sub basin fig 5 the main difference between these five hrus is the structure of the unsaturated root zone reservoir su patterns of plant rooting depth bear a strong topographic and hydrologic signature at landscape scales fan et al 2017 therefore the su max for hillslope forest and plateau forest have comparatively larger root zone capacities than hillslope crops and plateau crops in the wetlands the root zone storage capacity sumax w is relatively low due to the shallow groundwater table the five landscape units are connected to a common groundwater reservoir recharged by hillslopes forest rsl hf hillslopes crop rsl hc plateau forest pp pf plateau crop pp pc and capillary rise cr from the wetlands the model parameter ranges used during the calibration of the model are given in table 3 and are set by optimization 3 1 3 reservoir inclusion in the flex topo model separate flex topo models are created for the contributing areas corresponding to the inflow points to the reservoirs and river reaches between the reservoir outflow points and downstream flow gauging stations fig 5 illustrates it in greater detail where for each reservoir case upstream area f1 and downstream area f2 are modelled separately a separate reservoir operation model is created for each reservoir thus for each basin with a reservoir flex topo for f1 models the inflow to the reservoir the operation model of the reservoir then determines inflow to the area f2 and the flex topo model for this area then determines the outflow at the downstream gauge station the outflows from kudige m h halli and t narasipur sub basins are treated as inflows to the kollegal sub basin at their respective gauging stations see fig 5 an attenuation factor ranging between 0 and 1 is considered to account for any water loss from the outflow of the reservoir to the gauge station for which the outflow is being modelled 3 1 4 reservoir operation and modelling reservoir operation is modelled using a shortage rule curve based on water demand for each reservoir depending on the end user demand that a reservoir is catering to the following conservation of mass equation is modelled for each time step 1 s t 1 s t t i t o t e t p t l t d t where s storage it inflow ot outflow et evaporation from reservoir surface pt precipitation on reservoir surface dt demand for reservoir water lt fraction supply of the demand for the reservoir on day t and t 1 day 3 1 5 operation rule curves the reservoir operations are based on shortage rule curves which define zones within which specified proportions of the demand are supplied basson et al 1994 these supply zones in turn depend on reservoir functions which include flood control irrigation hydropower and water supply three operating rule curves for 100 per cent demand supply l 1 0 80 per cent demand supply l 0 8 and 50 per cent demand supply l 0 5 are used to obtain four operating zones i e spill zone flood control zone conservation zone and buffer zone see supplementary materials figure s 1 the operating rule curve is defined based on trigonometric functions developed by ndiritu and sinha 2009 as indicated below 2 l t τ 3 l w a sin 2 π t 365 l where l t is the operation rule curve for a different fraction of demand supply level for the t th time step t 1 2 3 365 days τ translational parameter w width parameter a amplitude parameter l lag parameter the four supply zones derived from three operating rule curves serve as the metric to determine the extent to which demands are met all year round the demand is then calculated on a daily time step and depending on the purpose of the reservoir with respect to the three operating rule curves table s 2 see supplemntary materials shows the range of the various parameters of the operating rule curve equation that are used to calibrate the reservoir operation rules such that the assumptions stated in table s 1 see supplemntary materials are obeyed based on the purpose of the reservoir irrigation or hydropower as defined in the shortage rule curve different levels of demand are satisfied fulfilling the different levels of demand is subjected to multiple reliability constraints of demand and reservoir storage state and optimization is carried out using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii optimization method the reservoirs in the kudige sub basin serve the sole purpose of meeting the irrigation demands the hemavathi and krishna raja sagara in m h halli and kollegal sub basins are used for irrigation and drinking purpose the kabini reservoir in the t narasipur sub basin is used for both irrigation and hydropower production the area capacity curve for the kabini reservoirs is estimated to maintain the water level around the reference level using the least square fitting method for details see supplementary materials section 1 1 the shortage rule curves of different reservoirs studied are shown in fig 6 the l50 l80 and l100 refer to 50 per cent 80 per cent and 100 per cent supply of demand for hemavathi harangi and krs reservoirs the storage state of the reservoir can decrease below 20 per cent to fulfil the irrigation demands but cannot go below the l50 curve as this is the critical limit that determines whether to cut back the water for irrigation or any kind of public use to maintain the function of flood control the upper limit curve will not be changed for all the reservoirs in the case of the kabini reservoir which is used for hydropower production the lower limit defines the hydropower generation and therefore the lower limit l50 will always be more than 40 per cent of the storage state more details about reservoir modelling are given in the supplementary materials 3 2 data input to the model rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are used as forcing data daily gridded rainfall 0 25 x 0 25 and temperature 1 x 1 data are obtained from the indian meteorological department government of india pai et al 2014 srivastava et al 2009 the rainfall and temperature information is extracted for each sub basin to force the flex topo model and the reservoir model the potential evapotranspiration eto is calculated based on the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1982 considering max mean and min temperature values the runoff data are acquired from the central water commission government of india cwc 2018 the data on reservoirs including inflow outflow and storage level is accessed from karnataka state natural disaster monitoring centre government of karnataka india https www ksndmc org reservoir details aspx the crop water demand is calculated using crop coefficient for more details see supplementary materials section 2 3 3 model calibration the dataset from january 1991 to december 2010 is used to calibrate the flex topo models and the data set from 2010 to 2016 is used for validation the reservoir models are calibrated using the dataset from january 2011 to december 2016 to obtain the reservoir operating rules first the calibration of a flex topo model integrated with the reservoir of each basin is conducted in a stepwise manner four calibration strategies are considered for each reservoir location as indicated in fig 7 a b first called r and f the integrated flex reservoir model is calibrated using the downstream gauging station in this calibration strategy the model generated for each reservoir in each sub basin is first integrated into the corresponding upstream and downstream flex topo models of the sub basin then the output of the system of models i e the f r f model is calibrated using monte carlo sampling on observed streamflow at the corresponding gauging station in the second calibration method called r then f the reservoir is calibrated first then keeping the parameters of the reservoir fixed the integrated model is calibrated using a downstream gauging station the parameters of the reservoir model are calibrated first using the reservoir s inflow and outflow data from january 2011 to december 2016 the reservoir parameters are then fixed to the best parameter set and calibrated reservoir model is inserted in the serial system of models f r f the flex topo model parameters are then calibrated using data from the downstream gauging station for each sub basin third r and f separately both the reservoir model and flex topo model are calibrated separately parameters of the flex topo are transferable gao et al 2014 therefore the reservoir and the flex topo model of the entire sub basin are calibrated separately and then the calibrated parameters are used to run the system of the models i e the f r f model in the fourth method the flex topo model for each sub basin is calibrated and assessed separately to compare the results with the above three calibration methods all the parameters are considered independent of each other modelled runoff corresponding to each parameter set is compared with the observed using nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and mean absolute error mae the results indicated that the second calibration method r then f strategy performed well during the calibration and validation phase compared to the other methods therefore the reservoir calibration followed by the flex topo calibration method is adopted for final calibration the spatial heterogeneity as well as variations in land use has been incorporated in f1 and f2 which define the model structures and fluxes of flex topo as shown in fig 5 slope height above the nearest drainage and land use type together defines the various model classes or landscapes and associated with each such type of the landscape is a model structure with its unique equations see fig 4 for example within f1 forested hillslopes have a model structure that replicates subsurface flow processes while areas that are close to river networks such as wetlands have model structures that simulate processes such as saturation excess overland flow further evaporation fluxes from forested hillslopes are modelled differently from the evaporation from forested agriculture areas since the parameters of flex topo are transferable gao et al 2014 the same parameters have been used and calibrated jointly from similar heterogeneities such as for forested hillslopes in f1 and f2 given that topography controls the model structures the flex topo model is calibrated based on streamflow observed at the corresponding stations downstream of the reservoirs the elitist non dominated sorting genetic nsga ii algorithm is used to calibrate the model parameters deb et al 2000 nsga ii is a multi objective optimization algorithm it simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives by identifying parameters that yield model performances that are not dominated by any other feasible parameters in the multi objective space efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 two objective functions are defined and minimized simultaneously the first objective f 1 is the negative of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the second objective f 2 is the mean absolute error mae 3 f 1 nse 1 i 1 n q i o q i m 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 4 f 2 mae 1 n i 1 n q i o q i m here q i o is the i th observation for the observed discharge q i m is the i th value of the modelled discharge being evaluated q o is the mean of observed discharge and n is the total number of observations the parameter sets calibrated for the flex topo model and the reservoir model are given in tables 3 and 4 respectively the nsga ii parameter setting may have different impacts on computational effectiveness the population crossing over and population mutation plays critical roles during optimization wang et al 2019 usually the higher fraction of the population crossing over 0 9 and a lower value of mutation value is preferred for better convergence and to prevent the population from getting trapped in local optima wang et al 2019 the population size depends on the number of the decision variables calibrated in the model and keeping the population size five times the number of decision variables is considered ideal for the simulation gutierrez et al 2019 since for flex topo there are 20 parameters the population size is kept at 100 similarly for the reservoir model the number of parameters is five which translates into a population size of 25 higher population sizes were also attempted but not used and reported for later analysis because the performance achieved was similar to the reported population sizes the number of iterations is first tested using 50 100 250 and 500 iteration runs and 250 was finally chosen based on the best optimization results for each parameter set the modelled run off at stations shown in fig 5 is compared with the observed runoff using nse and mae equations 3 and 4 the pareto front corresponding to the minimum value of nse and mae as identified by the nsga ii algorithm is considered as containing the better performing parameter sets for each of the four basins 3 4 indicators of hydrological alterations the set of indicators of hydrological alteration iha initially proposed by richter et al 1996 is used to understand the impacts of reservoirs on the flow regimes in the cauvery basin the parameters considered in iha have a strong relationship with the river ecosystem and the degree of human interferences in the form of dams barrages and other kinds of water diversions on flow regime can be easily estimated the iha are categorized into five groups in terms of the magnitude of monthly flow magnitude and duration of annual extreme flow condition frequency and duration of high and low flows see supplementary materials table s 5 in the present case study the observed frequency corresponds to the modified flow regime due to reservoir construction and the expected frequency refers to the predicted flow regime without the reservoir 4 results 4 1 reservoir calibration the reservoirs are calibrated on a daily time scale due to limited data on reservoirs all the years were used for calibration there is no validation performed for the modelled streamflow at the reservoir outlets the results of the reservoir calibrations are presented in table 5 within parentheses the pareto front ranges produced by the nsga ii algorithm are given for both nse and mae the mae is always non negative and a lower value means a better prediction the mae value of all four reservoirs falls in the range of 0 71 2 92 106 m3 day 1 which is in the acceptable range similarly the nse value was observed between 0 51 and 0 73 the nse value above 0 50 is acceptable fig 8 compares the modelled outflows with the observed ones for the four reservoirs it was observed that krishna raj sagara krs reservoir which is the biggest reservoir among the studied sample has fluctuating outflows during the low flow periods the adopted operational rule curve within the reservoir models only considers water demands for irrigation or hydropower and does not model water releases for specific purposes such as drinking water from the krs dam this is especially so during the low flow period that is thus not well captured by the model 4 2 integration of reservoirs with flex topo f r f model calibration and validation the calibration metrics of the models after the integration of corresponding reservoirs with the flex topo models are presented in table 5 and how the modelled streamflow time series compare with the observed are shown in fig 9 the figure also shows the modelled stream flows that simulate the pre reservoir cases no res for the four sub basins here for each reservoir model that is integrated a parameter set corresponding to a point that lies in the middle of the pareto front in the objective space i e balanced by non dominated sets on either side is chosen the scatter plots of the observed and modelled stream flows are shown in fig 10 amongst the four sub basins kudige performed the best in calibration r2 0 90 and validation r2 0 81 harangi is in the kudige sub basin which is the smallest reservoir among all the reservoirs taken for the study as indicated in table 1 the residence time of the harangi reservoir is small which meant that the reservoir model being a more difficult calibration problem had little impact on the overall model performance the r squared of m h halli t narasipur and kollegal performed in the range of 0 73 0 77 during the calibration phase and 0 67 0 74 during the validation phase the models of all the basins therefore appear to have a bias in predicting flows with modelled daily flows being higher than the observed on average for t narasipur and kollegal sub basins table 5 reports on the performance of the calibrated f r f model with the observed for the four sub basins the nse was observed in the range of 0 53 0 80 in the calibration phase and 0 50 0 65 in the validation phase for all four sub basins the nse value above 0 50 is considered an acceptable level of performance similarly the values of mae were observed in the range of 0 92 1 36 mm day in the calibration phase and 0 86 2 05 mm day in the validation phase and are acceptable the pbias values for the calibration and validation periods are also provided in table 5 it indicated that for kuidge and m h halli the values of pbias are within the 25 per cent limits which are acceptable however for t narasipur and kollegal sub basins the pbias values of the validation periods are beyond the acceptable limits the mostly positive pbias values suggest that the low flows are better simulated than the high flows this is also evident in fig 8 where high flows are often missed especially in the cases of harangi hemavathi and kabini reservoirs since the parameter sets on the pareto front that are closest to the origin are chosen for the simulations the corresponding model simulations do not have the best possible performances in either of the two objective functions even though nse is used as one of the objective functions that is sensitive to high flows due to nse being a quadratic function of the residuals mae is the other objective function that is robust to outliers pande 2013b pande 2013a this may be a reason why high flows are not as well simulated as low flows 4 3 impacts of the reservoirs on the flow regimes the impacts of the reservoirs on the river flow regimes are assessed using indicators of hydrological alteration richter et al 1996 the calibrations of the entire basins at the gauge sites are not possible to estimate the pre reservoir scenarios due to the lack of data before the dams were constructed furthermore the calibration of the upstream models f1 using inflow data of the reservoirs was hampered by limited data on the reservoirs themselves which were available for six years within the period studied therefore the calibrated f r f models are used to infer the natural flow regimes by removing the reservoirs of the corresponding four sub basins the flow regimes simulated by the models after removing the reservoirs are used as pre impact simulations for the corresponding sub basins the gauge stations used for model calibration and validation located downstream of the reservoirs are used to compare the pre and post construction of reservoirs see fig 5 for gauge station locations and the data from the year 2001 2016 is used for calculating the indicators for hydrological alterations 4 3 1 impact on the magnitudes of the monthly stream flow conditions the median values of the monthly stream flow for the four sub basins are given in fig 11 it shows that the flows in the sub basins were consistently reduced during all the months of the year after the reservoirs were constructed 4 3 2 impact on minimum flows the median values of hydrological alterations for the annual extreme flow conditions of the upper cauvery river basin are given in table 6 the 1 day and 3 day minimum median flows were reduced significantly in all sub basins zero flow days were observed only in the kudige sub basin in the post impact period the base flow indices of all basins were reduced after reservoir constructions except for the m h halli sub basin where the base flow index increased 4 3 3 impact on the maximum flows the median values of the impact of reservoirs on maximum flows are also indicated in table 6 all 1 day and 3 day maximum median flows were reduced in all sub basins and most significantly in the m h halli and t narasipur sub basins where high magnitude flooding was eliminated after reservoir constructions 4 3 4 impact on the frequency and duration of high and low pulses the high and low flow conditions are defined based on 75th high pulse and 25th flow low pulse percentiles increases in the low pulse durations are observed in the kudige m h halli and kollegal sub basin which may worsen the eco hydrological environment of the river and surrounding floodplains a decrease in low pulse duration is observed in the t narasipur sub basin moderate decreases in high pulse durations are observed in all the sub basins a decrease in high pulse duration hampers the supply of nutrients to the aquatic plants and animals and may reduce the riverine biodiversity this means that the supply of nutrients may have been hampered in all the sub basins affecting riverine biodiversity in the context of a hydropower reservoir kabini it was observed that the reservoir case has long low pulse duration than the case without a reservoir since a specific water level should be maintained in the hydro power reservoir to generate electricity water is frequently discharged from the reservoir to do so resulting in low pulse duration in contrast to the hydropower reservoir irrigation reservoirs harangi hemavathi and krs have higher low pulse durations than for its corresponding no reservoir cases this suggests that in comparison to hydropower reservoirs irrigation reservoirs generate higher flow regimes a similar reduction in low pulse duration was observed in the yangtze river due to reservoir operation for irrigation purposes in china gao and wang 2018 5 discussion the method implemented in this paper is limited by various assumptions after discussing the assumptions and how these may be alleviated the influence of reservoir operations on flow regimes in the upper cauvery are synthesized and followed by what it may imply for reservoir operations in india 5 1 model uncertainty and underlying assumptions the result indicates that flow regimes are clearly altered from their natural state following reservoir impoundments although dams differ dramatically in size function and location almost all sub basin record a reduction in median flow minimum and maximum flows these patterns are primarily caused by regulated reservoir operations including storing and releasing flows for irrigation or hydropower generation which alters the river streamflow characteristics moreover the water is being diverted for irrigation outside the basin which also contributed to altered flow regime characteristics however the diverted flow is not addressed in the present simulation in the sense that we assume that the irrigation water supply evaporates and does not return to the basin this implies that the model is likely under estimating available discharges at the sub basin outlets and this has been reflected in the pbias values of t narasipur and kollegal sub basins during the validation phase in case of no reservoir the command areas irrigated by reservoirs become unirrigated and the irrigated areas are reduced proportionally in the model based on the command area falling in the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoirs such an assumption needs to be validated e g based on official records on land use types in the pre reservoir periods the low flows are better simulated than the peaks one explanation may be that the parameter sets on the pareto front that are closest to the origin are chosen for the simulations this means that the corresponding model simulations do not have the best possible performances in either of the two objective functions even though nse is used as one of the objective functions that is sensitive to high flows due to nse being a quadratic function of the residuals mae is the other objective function that is robust to outliers pande 2013b pande 2013a this may be a reason why high flows are not as well simulated as low flows the use of additional objective functions such as log nse and others based on hydrological signatures santos et al 2018 may alleviate such concerns the reservoirs were calibrated first partly because of limited data following r then f calibration strategy only six years of daily scale time series were available for the inflows and outflows of the reservoirs which was not deemed sufficient for the calibration and validation of the f r f model therefore different time series are used for the calibration of flex topo and reservoir models further because a standard operating rule curve is used for all the reservoirs it is acknowledged that some of the dams specific water discharges may not have been captured by the reservoir model validation results also suggest that modelled flows of two reservoirs are biased model calibration may therefore benefit from operating rule curves inspired by specific reservoir functions and flow requirements 5 2 influence of reservoir operations on flow regimes in the upper cauvery the study confirms that the average monthly flow in the upper cauvery basin is greatly influenced by reservoir operations and subsequent water abstractions in the basin the reduction of streamflow in most of the months is likely contributing to the increased scarcity of water in different seasons the decrease in monthly flows is observed across all the sub basins throughout the year due to reservoir operations when compared to its natural flow regimes the different operation rules in different sub basins have varying degrees of influence on downstream flow timing pulse behaviour change rate and frequencies of flow wang et al 2016 the decrease in summer flows during the post reservoir periods as evident from the model results may lead to negative effects on the aquatic habitats and migratory and reproductive biology of fish species in the downstream areas the one day minimum flow at kudige was observed to be below 1 m3s 1 which before the reservoir construction was 15 43 m3s 1 and at a safe level this huge reduction is harmful to the survival of aquatic organisms the frequency and duration of high and low pulses are critical to supporting the migratory behaviour of fish during the spawning season wang et al 2016 this has also been validated by some studies that have indicated that after the construction of reservoirs the reduction in flows and changes in natural flow pulses threatened the survival of migratory fish species tor pitutora in the cauvery basin pinder et al 2015 in addition variations in fish assemblage structures have likely been affected since the structures are strongly associated with mean daily flows base flow number of zero flow days and high flow pulses arthington et al 2014 anderson et al 2006 perkin and bonner 2011 furthermore in the kudige sub basin a period of 90 days of zero flow was recorded after the construction of the harangi reservoir which created a stressful environment for the aquatic organisms in the t narasipur sub basin the natural base flow index of 0 30 was reduced to 0 12 after the construction of the kabini reservoir in tropical rivers the streamflow discharge is composed entirely of the base flow through most of the dry season of the year smakhtin 2001 this extended duration of zero flow leads to the loss of lotic habitats which places aquatic species at high risk of extinction mallen cooper and zampatti 2020 the frequency and duration of low pulses were also impacted across all the studied sub basins decreases in low pulse durations in the kudige m h halli and kollegal sub basins may worsen the eco hydrological environment of the river and surrounding floodplains in contrast an increase in low pulse duration was observed in the t narasipur sub basin where the hydro power reservoir is located the reservoir releases excess water to preserve flood control capacity from june till august after which it releases flow to meet the power generation requirements which then increases the low flow duration in the t narasipur sub basin hydrological connectivity between the river channels and floodplain is dependent on the intensities and durations of high and low pulses and determines the habitat for aquatic species in the dry and wet seasons wang et al 2016 flow pulses also provide essential carbon inputs to the riverine ecosystem and strongly support the aquatic food web sheldon and thoms 2006 thus floodplain ecosystems are dependent on naturally dynamic river flow patterns rood et al 2005 changes in flow patterns directly affect the floodplain habitats and thus biodiversity as exemplified by the reported loss of fish and invertebrates due to dam regulations in the paraná river basin agostinho et al 2004 dam impoundments cause salinization and waterlogging which impact the water quality tuboi et al 2017 similar cases of salinization and waterlogging were reported in the kabini command area of the cauvery basin nagaraj et al 2003 around 23 per cent of karnataka s share of cauvery water is utilized to irrigate highly intensive crops like paddy and sugarcane crop productivity and irrigation effectiveness are both impacted negatively by improper cropping patterns over time which lowers profitability similar to this hydraulic interventions such as dams and barrages changed the mahanadi river delta from an agrarian system that depended on flooding to a landscape that was vulnerable to flooding d souza 2006 since the hirakud dam began operating in 1958 the frequency of high floods in the mahanadi basin has risen from once every 3 48 years to once every 3 3 years d souza 2006 furthermore due to silting of the reservoirs and canals the tail end areas do not get adequate irrigation water for the second crop thereby reducing the area for agricultural production kulkarni 2020 the reported geomorphic consequences of dams include bed armouring changes in bedform morphology and sediment depositions downstream that directly affect the channel morphology by narrowing widths deepening channels and arresting flow within the channel pal 2016 chong et al 2021 downstream bed degradation was accelerated by amplified peak discharges from dams reported in the upper godavari river basin sanyal et al 2021 however no such studies were reported for the cauvery river basin 5 3 implications for india increasingly empirical data is suggesting that dams despite large investments are unable to deliver on their claims pradhan and srinivasan 2022 the reservoirs are critical for economic growth though it significantly affects the river flow regimes the costs of dam removals are huge and have both economic and social implications however the ill effects of the dams can be minimized by incorporating environmental flows as an integral part of dam development programs since irrigation reservoirs have a distinct hydrological influence over hydropower reservoirs there may be a need to differentiate the e flow setting based on the purpose of the reservoirs more research should be done to compare the flow regime changes made by reservoirs serving various purposes to establish e flow standards that specifically target the impact of that type of reservoir operation more specifically in the cauvery river basin and other related basins where dams are already operational the reservoir operation rules could be re calculated to take environmental flow requirements into account thereby reducing their negative effects in india environmental flows are still not widely acknowledged smakhtin and anupthas 2006 even though the supreme court of india has mandated a minimum flow of 10 per cent for rivers like yamuna and cauvery to improve the water quality smakhtin and anupthas 2006 the water released from various dams is not well aligned with such environmental flow requirements there is also a lack of data on the relationships between flows and ecosystem functioning which impedes the implementation of environmental flow assessment jain 2015 further the existing environmental impact assessment eia system in india is unable to keep up with the pace of economic growth and fails to examine and mitigate the broader consequences of widespread dam building erlewein et al 2013 to improve the eia the timing and duration of low high flow pulses should be considered during the impact assessment of dams in relation to the environmental flows it can be more effective if the flow requirements for dry and wet years are assessed separately for different reservoir storage levels and reservoir purposes in addition the tradeoffs between water security of different stakeholders need to be considered during the design and construction of the dams pradhan and srinivasan 2022 6 conclusion given the present scenario of changing climate sustainable water resource management is becoming a bigger issue since it is so difficult to integrate natural hydrological processes with reservoir operations reliable forecasting of future water availability is confronted by significant hurdles with the proposed modelling approach the effects of dams on river flow regime can be studied even when no data is available for the period before the dam was constructed this paper assessed such effects under data scarce conditions using a landscape based hydrological model flex topo and indicators of hydrological alterations iha in the upper cauvery region of india the study confirms that the average monthly flow in the upper cauvery basin is greatly influenced by reservoir operations and subsequent water abstraction in the basin the decrease in monthly flow is observed across all the sub basins throughout the year due to reservoir operations when compared to its natural flow regimes since irrigation reservoirs have a distinct hydrological influence over hydropower reservoirs there may be a need to differentiate the e flow settings based on the purpose of the reservoirs and future research work should be initiated to achieve this target this can be done for example by using the modelling approach presented here to reverse engineer operating rules so flow regimes such as certain high and low flow percentiles essential to sustain biodiversity can be maintained further had there been longer data time series for the inflows and outflows of the reservoirs better outcomes could have been achieved by the proposed method the current work also used a simple trigonometric operation rule curve for all the reservoirs this can be improved further by employing reservoir specific operation rule curves which again depend on the availability of appropriate time series data nonetheless the present study presents a way forward to understand the impacts of dams at the basin scale under data scarce conditions and to help basin managers in formulating strategies to allocate water for both

7812,study region upper cauvery river basin india study focus reservoir construction is one of the major contributors to changes in natural river flow regime characteristics this study aims to understand the hydrological alterations resulting from the construction of reservoirs and water abstraction in the upper regions of the basin the impacts of dams on river flow regimes where data is available only for periods after the construction of the dams is assessed a landscape based hydrological model flex topo is used to model the flows contributed by the upstream and downstream areas of four major reservoirs in the study area a separate reservoir operation model is developed for each of the reservoirs next the hydrological model is integrated with the reservoir model and the modelled flow at the downstream streamflow gauging station of each of the corresponding four sub basins is calibrated the modelled flow regimes with and without reservoirs are then compared using the indicators of hydrological alterations to understand the degree to which the flows have been altered by the reservoirs new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that flow regimes have been modified from their natural state following reservoir impoundment and water abstractions significant impacts are observed in median monthly flow 1 day minimum flow and low pulses such information could provide a reference to water managers to replicate the natural flow regimes help sustain natural biota and thus contribute toward the sustainable management of river basins in india graphical abstract ga1 keywords flex topo model reservoir modelling indicators of hydrological alterations iha human water systems ecosystem services cauvery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction worldwide dams have been constructed to meet growing human needs no doubt dams have provided many economic benefits in the form of water supply hydropower and food production which has boosted economic growth and human wellbeing around the world nearly 63 per cent of the free flowing rivers have been affected by reservoir operations impairing the ecological functioning of the basins grill et al 2019 as a result the ecology of the dams upstream and downstream areas is impacted crossman and pollino 2018 the construction of a dam across a river converts a river segment of the natural watercourse into stagnant water gopal 2016 this changes the hydrological regime of the river in terms of magnitude frequency timing duration and rate of change in flows such alterations in flow regimes influence the ecological processes that impact the functioning of ecosystem services renofalt 2010 brauman et al 2007 for example the longitudinal and lateral connectivity is interrupted by dams and barrages resulting in fragmented biotic communities crook et al 2015 the reduced flows of sediment nutrients and freshwater inputs into estuaries and coastal zones decrease the nutrient composition phytoplankton composition and zooplankton diversity and impact the aquatic food web domingues et al 2012 simões et al 2015 van cappellen and maavara 2016 such disturbances of the aquatic food web decrease the productivity of estuarine and coastal habitats the dams have also displaced 40 60 million people over the last 60 years https www internationalrivers org human impacts of dams as a result large dams have come under harsh criticism worldwide from environmental scientists human rights activists economists and intellectuals large dams have gained notoriety for the detrimental environmental and social impacts that they cause and the huge economic burden of their costs bhatnagar 2004 in india several multipurpose dams have been constructed such as bhakra nangal nagarjunasagar kosi chambal hirakud kakrapar and tungabhadra dams to harness water for developmental needs these dams were built for multipurpose uses such as hydropower irrigation and domestic water supply and have been seen as a sign of development and economic growth klingensmith 2003 according to the national registry for large dams nrld in 2016 a total of 4877 dams were built in india and 313 dams were still under construction the cauvery river is one such peninsular river that has been intensely altered by reservoirs barrages canals and anicuts masonry check dams constructed across streams to divert water in response to rapidly growing water demands for irrigation household consumption and power generation vanham et al 2011 while the construction of the reservoirs has helped to expand the irrigated areas in the basin securing water availability during water stress conditions it has aggravated water tensions due to water allocation between the upstream and downstream states indian semi autonomous administrative regions through which the river runs leading to conflicts among the states sharing the rivers ramaswamy 1994 shah 1994 janakarajan 2016 extensive damming has also led to poor delivery of ecosystem services degradation in water quality is being reported extensively solaraj et al 2010 rani and sherine 2007 regulating services such as sediment transport have been adversely affected which in turn has impacted freshwater ecosystems vaithiyanathan et al 1992 for example changes in aquatic species composition are being observed due to the changes in sediment loads because of the construction of the reservoirs venkatachalapathy and karthikeyan 2015 dhanakumar et al 2015 moreover the population of migratory fish species such as tor spp lates calcarifer bagarius bagarius and anguilla spp has declined due to reduced flow rates in the river raj 1941 these are some examples that underline the necessity to assess the degree to which hydrological flows are altered i e deviated from the natural flows by the construction of dams in basins such as that of cauvery this study is motivated by the need for a systematic assessment of hydrological alterations by the construction of major dams in the upper cauvery basin however such an assessment requires sufficient hydrological data for the periods of pre and post reservoir construction which is often not possible the objectives of this study are therefore to i develop and implement a robust human influenced hydrological model that can reliably simulate pre reservoir hydrological regimes and ii deploy a systematic assessment of pre and post reservoir flow regime changes in the basin many studies of dam induced alterations have used indicators of hydrological alterations iha to evaluate the hydrological impacts of dams on flow regime characteristics gierszewski et al 2020 2018 mittal et al 2016 song et al 2020 do vasco et al 2019 fantin cruz et al 2015 pyron et al 2008 before 1990 methods such as field surveys and ground photograph analyses were used to assess the impact of impoundments on river channels knighton 1988 statistical analysis including the non parametric mann kendall mk method yan et al 2010 pettitt s test and flow duration analysis marcinkowski and grygoruk 2017 were also used to contrast the flow regimes before and after hydraulic interventions geomorphic change detection gcd tools http gcd riverscapes xyz have also been used to qualify topographic or morphological changes after an impoundment wheaton 2015 however a more systematic assessment of flow changes is provided by the range of variability approach richter et al 1997 and associated with it are the indices of hydrological alteration iha framework richter et al 1996 the iha method takes daily streamflow values and characterizes a flow regime in terms of five ecologically significant factors magnitude duration frequency timing and the rate of change of flows page et al 2005 even though the iha method provides a systematic assessment of flow changes due to hydraulic interventions only a few studies of indian rivers have used it see for example the studies for the kangsabati river mittal et al 2014 the krishna river kumar and jayakumar 2020 and the dikrong river borgohain et al 2019 this paper therefore applies the iha method to systematically evaluate the impacts of major dams in the upper cauvery however the information on river flows which is needed for iha is not available for periods before the construction of the dams robust hydrological modelling of basins with and without the reservoirs which enables the analysis of how river flows are impacted by modified landscapes due to human interventions is therefore additionally needed beven 2012 o sullivan et al 2019 different types of hydrological models have incorporated reservoir models or reservoir operations to simulate stream flows mateo et al 2014 li et al 2019 tehrani et al 2021 distributed models like dhsvm and crest snow have been used that combine reservoir operation modules to simultaneously assess the impacts of climate change and reservoir operations on the flow regimes li et al 2019 han et al 2019 these models incorporate reservoir operations and are capable of taking spatial heterogeneity into account but often are data intensive in their representation of changing landscapes and the impacts on river flow regimes for example the swat model accounts for spatial heterogeneities by combining distributed data on soil land cover and elevation and has been used to simulate hydrological regimes regulated by reservoirs at the basin scale sulis et al 2009 wang and xia 2010 babur et al 2016 in addition to the data and computational intensity of such models if the impacts of reservoirs are to be estimated on data that is available only after the reservoirs have been constructed then another key consideration is the transferability of models in space and time gao et al 2016 well constrained model structures are therefore needed to perform pre and post reservoir assessments especially in regions such as cauvery where low resolution data is often available and no records of flow regimes exist prior to the construction of the reservoirs this motivates the use of a topography driven rainfall runoff model flex topo model which is neither computationally expensive nor data intensive it determines well constrained model structures corresponding to the dominant hydrological processes in a catchment gao et al 2014 that can be reliably transferred in space and time gao et al 2016 nijzink et al 2016 the study then integrates the flex topo model with the iha method to assess the impacts of hydrological changes due to the construction of four major dams in the upper cauvery river basin the paper is organized as follows the study area along with reservoir details are described in the next section the methodology that incorporates reservoir operations in a topography driven rainfall runoff model and its calibration are then discussed section 3 the results are subsequently presented section 4 the paper concludes with a discussion on the impacts of reservoirs on river flow regimes in the cauvery river basin sections 5 and 6 the study will provide insight into sustainably managing water resources without hampering the socio ecological integrity of the river systems 2 description of the study area the cauvery is one of the most critical interstate rivers of southern india lying between longitude 75 27 e to 79 54 e and latitude 10 9 n to 13 30 n the cauvery basin extends over the indian states of tamil nadu karnataka kerala and the union territory of puducherry draining an area of 81 155 km2 into the bay of bengal out of this 42 per cent lies in karnataka 54 per cent in tamil nadu karaikkal region of puducherry and 4 per cent in kerala there are around 96 dams constructed in the cauvery basin during the last 1000 years out of which 70 30 per cent of dams have been used for irrigation purposes 19 80 per cent for hydro power generation 6 93 per cent for both irrigation and hydropower generation and the remaining 2 97 per cent dams are used only for drinking water supply the cauvery delta hemavathi mettur krishna raja sagara and harangi irrigation projects are among the major irrigation projects in the cauvery basin as fig 1 shows most of these dams are relatively small four major reservoirs based on size storage capacity and command area in the upper cauvery basin fig 2 have been selected for the study table 1 presents a brief discussion of the reservoirs under study 3 methods fig 3 illustrates the overall methodology it involves modelling the reservoir operations and the hydrology of areas upstream and downstream of the reservoir and then integrating the two to assess the effect of reservoirs on flow regimes observed downstream and thus on the delivery of ecosystem services as a result four sub basins are studied delineated by the four gauging stations shown in fig 5 each sub basin is further sub divided into two parts corresponding to the areas upstream and downstream of its reservoir fig 3 b further shows the modelling concept f1 and f2 represent the flex topo models for upstream and downstream areas of a reservoir contributing to flow at a gauge station gs whereas rm and ca represent the reservoir model and associated command area respectively the flow is measured at the downstream gauge station gs in the event of reservoir integration the outflow from f1 becomes the reservoir s inflow and the outflow from rm enters f2 after which the outflow from f2 is calibrated at gs if the reservoir is removed the outflow from f1 is combined with the outflow from f2 which then forms the outflow at gs further indicators of hydrological alterations which are based on river flow characteristics are used to understand the impact of reservoirs on the river flow regimes the iha method is simple to use and provides valuable information related to flow alternations and helps to assess the potential impacts that flow alterations may have on the river ecosystem 3 1 the flex topo model topography based landscape hydrological model flex topo is used savenije 2010 topography is one of the main characteristics of the river landscape which emerges from the coevolution of vegetation and soil with climate savenije 2010 gao et al 2014 as a result it determines dominant hydrological processes in a catchment gao et al 2014 and has been used as a strong constraint in determining and transferring the model structures in space and time gao et al 2016 nijzink et al 2016 the model simulates the response of catchments based on different hydrological response units hrus it approximates the river landscape hydrological behaviour by delineating catchments into different functional hydrological response units e g wetland hillslope and plateau gharari et al 2014 the novelty is that the model structure depends on landscape classes determined mainly by topography which can include geological geomorphological or land use classification savenije 2010 the parsimonious model has proven to be transferable to data scarce basins because its model structure is constrained by topography relying less on data to calibrate parameters and is robust in its simulations of flows under changing land cover patterns gao et al 2014 savenije 2010 3 1 1 the landscape classification topographic features like dem slope and height above the nearest drainage hand are used to make the three broad classifications the slope and hand are processed in arcgis using dem 80 m resolution the overall watershed area was delineated based on gauge location again the watershed area for f1 is delineated based on dam location the f1 area is clipped from the whole watershed to get f2 for each f1 and f2 the raster data set including dem slope hand and basin boundary are clipped and exported to matlab for further analysis thresholds are selected to distinguish between the three landscape classes locations with hand 5 m and slope 11 per cent is classified as a plateau locations with hand 5 m and slope 11 per cent is considered as hillslopes and locations with hand 5 m are considered wetlands gharari et al 2011 the classified maps are then compared with land use maps and five hrus hillslope forests hillslope crops plateau forests plateau crops wetlands are determined based on the percentage of landscape classes for the upstream f1 and downstream f2 areas of the reservoir for each sub basin 3 1 2 the model structures the flex topo model structure is graphically presented in fig 4 while the description of the variables of each hydrological response unit of the flex topo model is given in table 2 rainfall p mm d 1 is first partitioned between interception evaporation ei mm d 1 and effective rainfall pe mm d 1 based on a threshold si max mm effective rainfall is partitioned between water retention in the soil and yield runoff r mm d 1 based on the root zone storage capacity su max mm and a shape parameter β plant transpiration et mm d 1 is calculated based on potential evaporation e0 mm d 1 a soil moisture threshold parameter ce and the relative soil moisture su su max the generated runoff is further partitioned between a fast component rf mm d 1 and a slow component rs mm d 1 through a separator d a lag function is applied to simulate the lag time t d between peak flow and storm event two linear reservoirs with different time constants kf d and ks d are used to calculate the fast and slow runoff the total runoff qm mm d 1 is the sum of the fast component qf mm d 1 and the slow component qs mm d 1 the flex topo model classifies a landscape into different hydrological response units hrus based on the elevation dem slope and height above nearest drainage hand the landscape is first divided into hillslope plateau and wetland and the classification is then compared with land use maps more than 50 per cent of the area in the cauvery basin is dominated by field crops followed by plantation crops and evergreen forests the hillslope is characterized by comparatively larger root zone capacities due to deeper groundwater levels and perennial forest but the land use pattern of the cauvery basin has been heavily modified by agriculture five hrus are then determined based on the percentage of landscape classes for the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoir for each sub basin fig 5 the main difference between these five hrus is the structure of the unsaturated root zone reservoir su patterns of plant rooting depth bear a strong topographic and hydrologic signature at landscape scales fan et al 2017 therefore the su max for hillslope forest and plateau forest have comparatively larger root zone capacities than hillslope crops and plateau crops in the wetlands the root zone storage capacity sumax w is relatively low due to the shallow groundwater table the five landscape units are connected to a common groundwater reservoir recharged by hillslopes forest rsl hf hillslopes crop rsl hc plateau forest pp pf plateau crop pp pc and capillary rise cr from the wetlands the model parameter ranges used during the calibration of the model are given in table 3 and are set by optimization 3 1 3 reservoir inclusion in the flex topo model separate flex topo models are created for the contributing areas corresponding to the inflow points to the reservoirs and river reaches between the reservoir outflow points and downstream flow gauging stations fig 5 illustrates it in greater detail where for each reservoir case upstream area f1 and downstream area f2 are modelled separately a separate reservoir operation model is created for each reservoir thus for each basin with a reservoir flex topo for f1 models the inflow to the reservoir the operation model of the reservoir then determines inflow to the area f2 and the flex topo model for this area then determines the outflow at the downstream gauge station the outflows from kudige m h halli and t narasipur sub basins are treated as inflows to the kollegal sub basin at their respective gauging stations see fig 5 an attenuation factor ranging between 0 and 1 is considered to account for any water loss from the outflow of the reservoir to the gauge station for which the outflow is being modelled 3 1 4 reservoir operation and modelling reservoir operation is modelled using a shortage rule curve based on water demand for each reservoir depending on the end user demand that a reservoir is catering to the following conservation of mass equation is modelled for each time step 1 s t 1 s t t i t o t e t p t l t d t where s storage it inflow ot outflow et evaporation from reservoir surface pt precipitation on reservoir surface dt demand for reservoir water lt fraction supply of the demand for the reservoir on day t and t 1 day 3 1 5 operation rule curves the reservoir operations are based on shortage rule curves which define zones within which specified proportions of the demand are supplied basson et al 1994 these supply zones in turn depend on reservoir functions which include flood control irrigation hydropower and water supply three operating rule curves for 100 per cent demand supply l 1 0 80 per cent demand supply l 0 8 and 50 per cent demand supply l 0 5 are used to obtain four operating zones i e spill zone flood control zone conservation zone and buffer zone see supplementary materials figure s 1 the operating rule curve is defined based on trigonometric functions developed by ndiritu and sinha 2009 as indicated below 2 l t τ 3 l w a sin 2 π t 365 l where l t is the operation rule curve for a different fraction of demand supply level for the t th time step t 1 2 3 365 days τ translational parameter w width parameter a amplitude parameter l lag parameter the four supply zones derived from three operating rule curves serve as the metric to determine the extent to which demands are met all year round the demand is then calculated on a daily time step and depending on the purpose of the reservoir with respect to the three operating rule curves table s 2 see supplemntary materials shows the range of the various parameters of the operating rule curve equation that are used to calibrate the reservoir operation rules such that the assumptions stated in table s 1 see supplemntary materials are obeyed based on the purpose of the reservoir irrigation or hydropower as defined in the shortage rule curve different levels of demand are satisfied fulfilling the different levels of demand is subjected to multiple reliability constraints of demand and reservoir storage state and optimization is carried out using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii optimization method the reservoirs in the kudige sub basin serve the sole purpose of meeting the irrigation demands the hemavathi and krishna raja sagara in m h halli and kollegal sub basins are used for irrigation and drinking purpose the kabini reservoir in the t narasipur sub basin is used for both irrigation and hydropower production the area capacity curve for the kabini reservoirs is estimated to maintain the water level around the reference level using the least square fitting method for details see supplementary materials section 1 1 the shortage rule curves of different reservoirs studied are shown in fig 6 the l50 l80 and l100 refer to 50 per cent 80 per cent and 100 per cent supply of demand for hemavathi harangi and krs reservoirs the storage state of the reservoir can decrease below 20 per cent to fulfil the irrigation demands but cannot go below the l50 curve as this is the critical limit that determines whether to cut back the water for irrigation or any kind of public use to maintain the function of flood control the upper limit curve will not be changed for all the reservoirs in the case of the kabini reservoir which is used for hydropower production the lower limit defines the hydropower generation and therefore the lower limit l50 will always be more than 40 per cent of the storage state more details about reservoir modelling are given in the supplementary materials 3 2 data input to the model rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are used as forcing data daily gridded rainfall 0 25 x 0 25 and temperature 1 x 1 data are obtained from the indian meteorological department government of india pai et al 2014 srivastava et al 2009 the rainfall and temperature information is extracted for each sub basin to force the flex topo model and the reservoir model the potential evapotranspiration eto is calculated based on the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1982 considering max mean and min temperature values the runoff data are acquired from the central water commission government of india cwc 2018 the data on reservoirs including inflow outflow and storage level is accessed from karnataka state natural disaster monitoring centre government of karnataka india https www ksndmc org reservoir details aspx the crop water demand is calculated using crop coefficient for more details see supplementary materials section 2 3 3 model calibration the dataset from january 1991 to december 2010 is used to calibrate the flex topo models and the data set from 2010 to 2016 is used for validation the reservoir models are calibrated using the dataset from january 2011 to december 2016 to obtain the reservoir operating rules first the calibration of a flex topo model integrated with the reservoir of each basin is conducted in a stepwise manner four calibration strategies are considered for each reservoir location as indicated in fig 7 a b first called r and f the integrated flex reservoir model is calibrated using the downstream gauging station in this calibration strategy the model generated for each reservoir in each sub basin is first integrated into the corresponding upstream and downstream flex topo models of the sub basin then the output of the system of models i e the f r f model is calibrated using monte carlo sampling on observed streamflow at the corresponding gauging station in the second calibration method called r then f the reservoir is calibrated first then keeping the parameters of the reservoir fixed the integrated model is calibrated using a downstream gauging station the parameters of the reservoir model are calibrated first using the reservoir s inflow and outflow data from january 2011 to december 2016 the reservoir parameters are then fixed to the best parameter set and calibrated reservoir model is inserted in the serial system of models f r f the flex topo model parameters are then calibrated using data from the downstream gauging station for each sub basin third r and f separately both the reservoir model and flex topo model are calibrated separately parameters of the flex topo are transferable gao et al 2014 therefore the reservoir and the flex topo model of the entire sub basin are calibrated separately and then the calibrated parameters are used to run the system of the models i e the f r f model in the fourth method the flex topo model for each sub basin is calibrated and assessed separately to compare the results with the above three calibration methods all the parameters are considered independent of each other modelled runoff corresponding to each parameter set is compared with the observed using nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and mean absolute error mae the results indicated that the second calibration method r then f strategy performed well during the calibration and validation phase compared to the other methods therefore the reservoir calibration followed by the flex topo calibration method is adopted for final calibration the spatial heterogeneity as well as variations in land use has been incorporated in f1 and f2 which define the model structures and fluxes of flex topo as shown in fig 5 slope height above the nearest drainage and land use type together defines the various model classes or landscapes and associated with each such type of the landscape is a model structure with its unique equations see fig 4 for example within f1 forested hillslopes have a model structure that replicates subsurface flow processes while areas that are close to river networks such as wetlands have model structures that simulate processes such as saturation excess overland flow further evaporation fluxes from forested hillslopes are modelled differently from the evaporation from forested agriculture areas since the parameters of flex topo are transferable gao et al 2014 the same parameters have been used and calibrated jointly from similar heterogeneities such as for forested hillslopes in f1 and f2 given that topography controls the model structures the flex topo model is calibrated based on streamflow observed at the corresponding stations downstream of the reservoirs the elitist non dominated sorting genetic nsga ii algorithm is used to calibrate the model parameters deb et al 2000 nsga ii is a multi objective optimization algorithm it simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives by identifying parameters that yield model performances that are not dominated by any other feasible parameters in the multi objective space efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 two objective functions are defined and minimized simultaneously the first objective f 1 is the negative of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the second objective f 2 is the mean absolute error mae 3 f 1 nse 1 i 1 n q i o q i m 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 4 f 2 mae 1 n i 1 n q i o q i m here q i o is the i th observation for the observed discharge q i m is the i th value of the modelled discharge being evaluated q o is the mean of observed discharge and n is the total number of observations the parameter sets calibrated for the flex topo model and the reservoir model are given in tables 3 and 4 respectively the nsga ii parameter setting may have different impacts on computational effectiveness the population crossing over and population mutation plays critical roles during optimization wang et al 2019 usually the higher fraction of the population crossing over 0 9 and a lower value of mutation value is preferred for better convergence and to prevent the population from getting trapped in local optima wang et al 2019 the population size depends on the number of the decision variables calibrated in the model and keeping the population size five times the number of decision variables is considered ideal for the simulation gutierrez et al 2019 since for flex topo there are 20 parameters the population size is kept at 100 similarly for the reservoir model the number of parameters is five which translates into a population size of 25 higher population sizes were also attempted but not used and reported for later analysis because the performance achieved was similar to the reported population sizes the number of iterations is first tested using 50 100 250 and 500 iteration runs and 250 was finally chosen based on the best optimization results for each parameter set the modelled run off at stations shown in fig 5 is compared with the observed runoff using nse and mae equations 3 and 4 the pareto front corresponding to the minimum value of nse and mae as identified by the nsga ii algorithm is considered as containing the better performing parameter sets for each of the four basins 3 4 indicators of hydrological alterations the set of indicators of hydrological alteration iha initially proposed by richter et al 1996 is used to understand the impacts of reservoirs on the flow regimes in the cauvery basin the parameters considered in iha have a strong relationship with the river ecosystem and the degree of human interferences in the form of dams barrages and other kinds of water diversions on flow regime can be easily estimated the iha are categorized into five groups in terms of the magnitude of monthly flow magnitude and duration of annual extreme flow condition frequency and duration of high and low flows see supplementary materials table s 5 in the present case study the observed frequency corresponds to the modified flow regime due to reservoir construction and the expected frequency refers to the predicted flow regime without the reservoir 4 results 4 1 reservoir calibration the reservoirs are calibrated on a daily time scale due to limited data on reservoirs all the years were used for calibration there is no validation performed for the modelled streamflow at the reservoir outlets the results of the reservoir calibrations are presented in table 5 within parentheses the pareto front ranges produced by the nsga ii algorithm are given for both nse and mae the mae is always non negative and a lower value means a better prediction the mae value of all four reservoirs falls in the range of 0 71 2 92 106 m3 day 1 which is in the acceptable range similarly the nse value was observed between 0 51 and 0 73 the nse value above 0 50 is acceptable fig 8 compares the modelled outflows with the observed ones for the four reservoirs it was observed that krishna raj sagara krs reservoir which is the biggest reservoir among the studied sample has fluctuating outflows during the low flow periods the adopted operational rule curve within the reservoir models only considers water demands for irrigation or hydropower and does not model water releases for specific purposes such as drinking water from the krs dam this is especially so during the low flow period that is thus not well captured by the model 4 2 integration of reservoirs with flex topo f r f model calibration and validation the calibration metrics of the models after the integration of corresponding reservoirs with the flex topo models are presented in table 5 and how the modelled streamflow time series compare with the observed are shown in fig 9 the figure also shows the modelled stream flows that simulate the pre reservoir cases no res for the four sub basins here for each reservoir model that is integrated a parameter set corresponding to a point that lies in the middle of the pareto front in the objective space i e balanced by non dominated sets on either side is chosen the scatter plots of the observed and modelled stream flows are shown in fig 10 amongst the four sub basins kudige performed the best in calibration r2 0 90 and validation r2 0 81 harangi is in the kudige sub basin which is the smallest reservoir among all the reservoirs taken for the study as indicated in table 1 the residence time of the harangi reservoir is small which meant that the reservoir model being a more difficult calibration problem had little impact on the overall model performance the r squared of m h halli t narasipur and kollegal performed in the range of 0 73 0 77 during the calibration phase and 0 67 0 74 during the validation phase the models of all the basins therefore appear to have a bias in predicting flows with modelled daily flows being higher than the observed on average for t narasipur and kollegal sub basins table 5 reports on the performance of the calibrated f r f model with the observed for the four sub basins the nse was observed in the range of 0 53 0 80 in the calibration phase and 0 50 0 65 in the validation phase for all four sub basins the nse value above 0 50 is considered an acceptable level of performance similarly the values of mae were observed in the range of 0 92 1 36 mm day in the calibration phase and 0 86 2 05 mm day in the validation phase and are acceptable the pbias values for the calibration and validation periods are also provided in table 5 it indicated that for kuidge and m h halli the values of pbias are within the 25 per cent limits which are acceptable however for t narasipur and kollegal sub basins the pbias values of the validation periods are beyond the acceptable limits the mostly positive pbias values suggest that the low flows are better simulated than the high flows this is also evident in fig 8 where high flows are often missed especially in the cases of harangi hemavathi and kabini reservoirs since the parameter sets on the pareto front that are closest to the origin are chosen for the simulations the corresponding model simulations do not have the best possible performances in either of the two objective functions even though nse is used as one of the objective functions that is sensitive to high flows due to nse being a quadratic function of the residuals mae is the other objective function that is robust to outliers pande 2013b pande 2013a this may be a reason why high flows are not as well simulated as low flows 4 3 impacts of the reservoirs on the flow regimes the impacts of the reservoirs on the river flow regimes are assessed using indicators of hydrological alteration richter et al 1996 the calibrations of the entire basins at the gauge sites are not possible to estimate the pre reservoir scenarios due to the lack of data before the dams were constructed furthermore the calibration of the upstream models f1 using inflow data of the reservoirs was hampered by limited data on the reservoirs themselves which were available for six years within the period studied therefore the calibrated f r f models are used to infer the natural flow regimes by removing the reservoirs of the corresponding four sub basins the flow regimes simulated by the models after removing the reservoirs are used as pre impact simulations for the corresponding sub basins the gauge stations used for model calibration and validation located downstream of the reservoirs are used to compare the pre and post construction of reservoirs see fig 5 for gauge station locations and the data from the year 2001 2016 is used for calculating the indicators for hydrological alterations 4 3 1 impact on the magnitudes of the monthly stream flow conditions the median values of the monthly stream flow for the four sub basins are given in fig 11 it shows that the flows in the sub basins were consistently reduced during all the months of the year after the reservoirs were constructed 4 3 2 impact on minimum flows the median values of hydrological alterations for the annual extreme flow conditions of the upper cauvery river basin are given in table 6 the 1 day and 3 day minimum median flows were reduced significantly in all sub basins zero flow days were observed only in the kudige sub basin in the post impact period the base flow indices of all basins were reduced after reservoir constructions except for the m h halli sub basin where the base flow index increased 4 3 3 impact on the maximum flows the median values of the impact of reservoirs on maximum flows are also indicated in table 6 all 1 day and 3 day maximum median flows were reduced in all sub basins and most significantly in the m h halli and t narasipur sub basins where high magnitude flooding was eliminated after reservoir constructions 4 3 4 impact on the frequency and duration of high and low pulses the high and low flow conditions are defined based on 75th high pulse and 25th flow low pulse percentiles increases in the low pulse durations are observed in the kudige m h halli and kollegal sub basin which may worsen the eco hydrological environment of the river and surrounding floodplains a decrease in low pulse duration is observed in the t narasipur sub basin moderate decreases in high pulse durations are observed in all the sub basins a decrease in high pulse duration hampers the supply of nutrients to the aquatic plants and animals and may reduce the riverine biodiversity this means that the supply of nutrients may have been hampered in all the sub basins affecting riverine biodiversity in the context of a hydropower reservoir kabini it was observed that the reservoir case has long low pulse duration than the case without a reservoir since a specific water level should be maintained in the hydro power reservoir to generate electricity water is frequently discharged from the reservoir to do so resulting in low pulse duration in contrast to the hydropower reservoir irrigation reservoirs harangi hemavathi and krs have higher low pulse durations than for its corresponding no reservoir cases this suggests that in comparison to hydropower reservoirs irrigation reservoirs generate higher flow regimes a similar reduction in low pulse duration was observed in the yangtze river due to reservoir operation for irrigation purposes in china gao and wang 2018 5 discussion the method implemented in this paper is limited by various assumptions after discussing the assumptions and how these may be alleviated the influence of reservoir operations on flow regimes in the upper cauvery are synthesized and followed by what it may imply for reservoir operations in india 5 1 model uncertainty and underlying assumptions the result indicates that flow regimes are clearly altered from their natural state following reservoir impoundments although dams differ dramatically in size function and location almost all sub basin record a reduction in median flow minimum and maximum flows these patterns are primarily caused by regulated reservoir operations including storing and releasing flows for irrigation or hydropower generation which alters the river streamflow characteristics moreover the water is being diverted for irrigation outside the basin which also contributed to altered flow regime characteristics however the diverted flow is not addressed in the present simulation in the sense that we assume that the irrigation water supply evaporates and does not return to the basin this implies that the model is likely under estimating available discharges at the sub basin outlets and this has been reflected in the pbias values of t narasipur and kollegal sub basins during the validation phase in case of no reservoir the command areas irrigated by reservoirs become unirrigated and the irrigated areas are reduced proportionally in the model based on the command area falling in the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoirs such an assumption needs to be validated e g based on official records on land use types in the pre reservoir periods the low flows are better simulated than the peaks one explanation may be that the parameter sets on the pareto front that are closest to the origin are chosen for the simulations this means that the corresponding model simulations do not have the best possible performances in either of the two objective functions even though nse is used as one of the objective functions that is sensitive to high flows due to nse being a quadratic function of the residuals mae is the other objective function that is robust to outliers pande 2013b pande 2013a this may be a reason why high flows are not as well simulated as low flows the use of additional objective functions such as log nse and others based on hydrological signatures santos et al 2018 may alleviate such concerns the reservoirs were calibrated first partly because of limited data following r then f calibration strategy only six years of daily scale time series were available for the inflows and outflows of the reservoirs which was not deemed sufficient for the calibration and validation of the f r f model therefore different time series are used for the calibration of flex topo and reservoir models further because a standard operating rule curve is used for all the reservoirs it is acknowledged that some of the dams specific water discharges may not have been captured by the reservoir model validation results also suggest that modelled flows of two reservoirs are biased model calibration may therefore benefit from operating rule curves inspired by specific reservoir functions and flow requirements 5 2 influence of reservoir operations on flow regimes in the upper cauvery the study confirms that the average monthly flow in the upper cauvery basin is greatly influenced by reservoir operations and subsequent water abstractions in the basin the reduction of streamflow in most of the months is likely contributing to the increased scarcity of water in different seasons the decrease in monthly flows is observed across all the sub basins throughout the year due to reservoir operations when compared to its natural flow regimes the different operation rules in different sub basins have varying degrees of influence on downstream flow timing pulse behaviour change rate and frequencies of flow wang et al 2016 the decrease in summer flows during the post reservoir periods as evident from the model results may lead to negative effects on the aquatic habitats and migratory and reproductive biology of fish species in the downstream areas the one day minimum flow at kudige was observed to be below 1 m3s 1 which before the reservoir construction was 15 43 m3s 1 and at a safe level this huge reduction is harmful to the survival of aquatic organisms the frequency and duration of high and low pulses are critical to supporting the migratory behaviour of fish during the spawning season wang et al 2016 this has also been validated by some studies that have indicated that after the construction of reservoirs the reduction in flows and changes in natural flow pulses threatened the survival of migratory fish species tor pitutora in the cauvery basin pinder et al 2015 in addition variations in fish assemblage structures have likely been affected since the structures are strongly associated with mean daily flows base flow number of zero flow days and high flow pulses arthington et al 2014 anderson et al 2006 perkin and bonner 2011 furthermore in the kudige sub basin a period of 90 days of zero flow was recorded after the construction of the harangi reservoir which created a stressful environment for the aquatic organisms in the t narasipur sub basin the natural base flow index of 0 30 was reduced to 0 12 after the construction of the kabini reservoir in tropical rivers the streamflow discharge is composed entirely of the base flow through most of the dry season of the year smakhtin 2001 this extended duration of zero flow leads to the loss of lotic habitats which places aquatic species at high risk of extinction mallen cooper and zampatti 2020 the frequency and duration of low pulses were also impacted across all the studied sub basins decreases in low pulse durations in the kudige m h halli and kollegal sub basins may worsen the eco hydrological environment of the river and surrounding floodplains in contrast an increase in low pulse duration was observed in the t narasipur sub basin where the hydro power reservoir is located the reservoir releases excess water to preserve flood control capacity from june till august after which it releases flow to meet the power generation requirements which then increases the low flow duration in the t narasipur sub basin hydrological connectivity between the river channels and floodplain is dependent on the intensities and durations of high and low pulses and determines the habitat for aquatic species in the dry and wet seasons wang et al 2016 flow pulses also provide essential carbon inputs to the riverine ecosystem and strongly support the aquatic food web sheldon and thoms 2006 thus floodplain ecosystems are dependent on naturally dynamic river flow patterns rood et al 2005 changes in flow patterns directly affect the floodplain habitats and thus biodiversity as exemplified by the reported loss of fish and invertebrates due to dam regulations in the paraná river basin agostinho et al 2004 dam impoundments cause salinization and waterlogging which impact the water quality tuboi et al 2017 similar cases of salinization and waterlogging were reported in the kabini command area of the cauvery basin nagaraj et al 2003 around 23 per cent of karnataka s share of cauvery water is utilized to irrigate highly intensive crops like paddy and sugarcane crop productivity and irrigation effectiveness are both impacted negatively by improper cropping patterns over time which lowers profitability similar to this hydraulic interventions such as dams and barrages changed the mahanadi river delta from an agrarian system that depended on flooding to a landscape that was vulnerable to flooding d souza 2006 since the hirakud dam began operating in 1958 the frequency of high floods in the mahanadi basin has risen from once every 3 48 years to once every 3 3 years d souza 2006 furthermore due to silting of the reservoirs and canals the tail end areas do not get adequate irrigation water for the second crop thereby reducing the area for agricultural production kulkarni 2020 the reported geomorphic consequences of dams include bed armouring changes in bedform morphology and sediment depositions downstream that directly affect the channel morphology by narrowing widths deepening channels and arresting flow within the channel pal 2016 chong et al 2021 downstream bed degradation was accelerated by amplified peak discharges from dams reported in the upper godavari river basin sanyal et al 2021 however no such studies were reported for the cauvery river basin 5 3 implications for india increasingly empirical data is suggesting that dams despite large investments are unable to deliver on their claims pradhan and srinivasan 2022 the reservoirs are critical for economic growth though it significantly affects the river flow regimes the costs of dam removals are huge and have both economic and social implications however the ill effects of the dams can be minimized by incorporating environmental flows as an integral part of dam development programs since irrigation reservoirs have a distinct hydrological influence over hydropower reservoirs there may be a need to differentiate the e flow setting based on the purpose of the reservoirs more research should be done to compare the flow regime changes made by reservoirs serving various purposes to establish e flow standards that specifically target the impact of that type of reservoir operation more specifically in the cauvery river basin and other related basins where dams are already operational the reservoir operation rules could be re calculated to take environmental flow requirements into account thereby reducing their negative effects in india environmental flows are still not widely acknowledged smakhtin and anupthas 2006 even though the supreme court of india has mandated a minimum flow of 10 per cent for rivers like yamuna and cauvery to improve the water quality smakhtin and anupthas 2006 the water released from various dams is not well aligned with such environmental flow requirements there is also a lack of data on the relationships between flows and ecosystem functioning which impedes the implementation of environmental flow assessment jain 2015 further the existing environmental impact assessment eia system in india is unable to keep up with the pace of economic growth and fails to examine and mitigate the broader consequences of widespread dam building erlewein et al 2013 to improve the eia the timing and duration of low high flow pulses should be considered during the impact assessment of dams in relation to the environmental flows it can be more effective if the flow requirements for dry and wet years are assessed separately for different reservoir storage levels and reservoir purposes in addition the tradeoffs between water security of different stakeholders need to be considered during the design and construction of the dams pradhan and srinivasan 2022 6 conclusion given the present scenario of changing climate sustainable water resource management is becoming a bigger issue since it is so difficult to integrate natural hydrological processes with reservoir operations reliable forecasting of future water availability is confronted by significant hurdles with the proposed modelling approach the effects of dams on river flow regime can be studied even when no data is available for the period before the dam was constructed this paper assessed such effects under data scarce conditions using a landscape based hydrological model flex topo and indicators of hydrological alterations iha in the upper cauvery region of india the study confirms that the average monthly flow in the upper cauvery basin is greatly influenced by reservoir operations and subsequent water abstraction in the basin the decrease in monthly flow is observed across all the sub basins throughout the year due to reservoir operations when compared to its natural flow regimes since irrigation reservoirs have a distinct hydrological influence over hydropower reservoirs there may be a need to differentiate the e flow settings based on the purpose of the reservoirs and future research work should be initiated to achieve this target this can be done for example by using the modelling approach presented here to reverse engineer operating rules so flow regimes such as certain high and low flow percentiles essential to sustain biodiversity can be maintained further had there been longer data time series for the inflows and outflows of the reservoirs better outcomes could have been achieved by the proposed method the current work also used a simple trigonometric operation rule curve for all the reservoirs this can be improved further by employing reservoir specific operation rule curves which again depend on the availability of appropriate time series data nonetheless the present study presents a way forward to understand the impacts of dams at the basin scale under data scarce conditions and to help basin managers in formulating strategies to allocate water for both

et al 2017 trenberth 2018 aghakouchak et al 2020 drought is one of the most devastating mishra and singh 2010 and costly natural disasters bryant 1991 which is still not fully understood van lanen et al 2013 blauhut et al 2015 and its causes and effects have not yet been adequately evaluated spinoni et al 2014 there is no universally accepted definition of drought however it can be described as the deficiency of water relative to the statistical multi year mean over a large area and for a large time span e g a season a year or several years palmer 1965 schneider 1996 review of various drought definitions can be found in mishra and singh 2010 the water deficit propagates through the hydrological cycle and causes different types of droughts which can be classified into four major categories i e meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic palmer 1965 wilhite and glantz 1985 among these the first two drought types are of focus of this study hydrological drought on the other hand refers to streamflow deficiency in this study since it is useful to address groundwater drought as a type of drought which is not generally included in the classification of droughts mishra and singh 2010 australia having a high rainfall variability had experienced three major droughts in the recent past the federation drought 1895 1902 the world war ii drought 1937 1945 and the millennium drought 1997 2010 due to its markedly seasonal and highly variable rainfall patterns australia is highly susceptible to droughts more recently southeast australia experienced the driest two year period between 2018 and 2019 on record hughes et al 2020 van oldenborgh et al 2021 and this extraordinary drought was the leading driver of the wildfires the so called black summer in southeast australia kemter et al 2021 previous studies note that there has been a decreasing trend in rainfall and streamflow mainly in southern and south eastern australia murphy and timbal 2008 timbal and fawcett 2013 zhang et al 2016 hajani and rahman 2018 vervoort et al 2021 for instance april to october rainfall covering the period of 2000 2019 has been found to decrease by 12 when compared to the 1900 1999 values csiro and bom 2020 and the storage volumes in south eastern australia in this period were found to be the lowest in more than ten years bureau of meteorology 2020b the deficiency of rainfall has long term effects on both surface and groundwater resources the study area covering nsw and vic comprises more than 60 of water supply over australia and more than 90 of this water is sourced from surface water australian bureau of statistics 2021 therefore investigation of hydrological drought and its link with meteorological drought have a vital importance in water security planning in the study area many researchers analyzed droughts in australia both at regional and national scales white and o meagher 1995 mpelasoka et al 2008 ummenhofer et al 2009 rahmat et al 2012 gallant et al 2013 nazahiyah et al 2014 tian et al 2019 furthermore many studies focused on what causes droughts in australia verdon kidd and kiem 2009 csiro 2010 forootan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 it has been found that four key climate drivers southern annular mode sam el nino southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo cause a highly variable climate from year to year influencing the onset of drought in southeast australia the intensity of a drought covering its frequency areal extent severity and duration is essential for regional drought analysis mishra and singh 2009 for this purpose drought indices are the best tool to monitor drought and to quantify its characteristics to provide information to decision makers and to initiate a drought action plan hence in this study we adopted standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and effective drought index edi byun and wilhite 1999 for the identification of meteorological drought characteristics spi a moving average based index was recommended by world meteorological organization 2012 both drought indices spi and edi have been widely applied around the world for drought monitoring hayes et al 1999 mishra and desai 2005 sönmez et al 2005 cancelliere et al 2007 mishra and singh 2009 deo et al 2017 caloiero 2018 rashid and beecham 2019 li et al 2021 lohpaisankrit and techamahasaranont 2021 malik et al 2021 salimi et al 2021 yildirim et al 2022 monthly rainfall is the only parameter for both indices spi can be computed at different timesteps whereas edi is a time independent index although the edi was developed at a daily time step byun and wilhite 1999 kim et al 2009 it is an effective method to compute drought from monthly rainfall time series data smakhtin and hughes 2007 akhtari et al 2009 dogan et al 2012 in this study standardized streamflow index ssfi modarres 2007 telesca et al 2012 was applied to compute hydrological drought ssfi has a calculation process similar to spi and only input needed for this is monthly streamflow data in previous research streamflow data have been widely used for hydrological drought analysis dracup et al 1980 van loon and laaha 2015 kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 kubiak wójcicka and bąk 2018 the reasons for selecting these three drought indices spi edi ssfi are i spi is the most used index for drought monitoring around the world kchouk et al 2022 yildirim et al 2022 ii wmo recommended to use spi for drought monitoring world meteorological organization 2012 iii edi is popular and preferable for arid semi arid regions dogan et al 2012 kamruzzaman et al 2019 malik et al 2021 mondol et al 2021 iv edi and spi have similarities and hence can be used together for drought monitoring adisa et al 2021 v decile which is used by the bureau of meteorology for drought monitoring in australia is not able to detect drought onset and end kanellou et al 2008 and vi ssfi has not been used in australia for hydrological drought monitoring yildirim et al 2022 a rank based non parametric method mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is commonly applied to perform trends in hydrology helsel and hirsch 1992 zhang et al 2001 yilmaz and perera 2015 kocsis et al 2017 jehanzaib et al 2020a in this study however we used the modified mk m mk hamed and rao 1998 test to reduce the effect of serial correlation on the mk test results identification of change points in annual streamflow time series has been widely used in hydrological drought studies jehanzaib et al 2020a 2020b shah et al 2022 step changes in annual streamflow were detected by pettitt test pettitt 1979 pearson s correlation pearson 1895 and spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 were applied here to assess correlation between meteorological and hydrological drought indices for different timesteps the theory of run or run theory yevjevich 1967 was applied here to detect drought propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought wu et al 2021 the maps and spatial interpolations were made using arcgis 10 6 1 in previous studies detailed drought hazard and comprehensive analysis covering both meteorological and hydrological droughts in australia are lacking kiem et al 2016 noted three key challenges in a drought study which focus on drought hazard to improve understanding and management of australian droughts therefore we aim to fill the currently existing knowledge gap in drought science by investigating drought hazard frequency and propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in southeast australia by using long term monthly rainfall and streamflow dataset overall the aim of this study is to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts in southeast australia the objectives of this study therefore are 1 to apply a conceptual model to assess meteorological drought hazard 2 to estimate frequency of drought and map it through a spatial interpolation method 3 to analyze trends in long term streamflow data and to identify abrupt changes before and after the break points if any 4 to depict trends in hydrological droughts 5 to assess correlation between meteorological spi edi and hydrological ssfi drought indices for different timesteps and 6 to identify when a meteorological drought becomes a hydrological one and discuss the possible factors that potentially affect the propagation time 2 study area and data the study selected southeast australia as the study area this has an area of 1 028 790 km2 covering the most populous states of new south wales nsw and victoria vic fig 1 three main national catchments murray darling basin mdb lake eyre basin leb and south east coast sec are located in the study area the mdb is the twentieth largest river catchment in the world which contains twenty two major catchments covering most of inland of nsw and north of vic sec lies east of mdb and covers most of coastal nsw and vic the study area accounts for approximately 63 of water quantity in australia and roughly 98 of water sources comes from surface water southeast australia is located in arid semi arid and temperate climate zone bureau of meteorology 2016 with average annual rainfall increasing from northwest to southeast monthly rainfall data from 104 stations between 1858 and 2019 shown in fig 1a were obtained from australian bureau of meteorology bureau of meteorology 2020a statistics on monthly rainfall data were calculated record lengths were more than 100 years for 97 stations average length of 123 years minimum length of 81 years the median data length of 122 5 years these rainfall stations are located across 45 rainfall districts in south east australia with at least 2 rainfall stations from each rainfall district in contrast to rainfall data streamflow gauges had less data length we however aimed to choose relatively long periods of streamflow records greater than 40 years stations being spatially distributed with fewer missing data finally monthly streamflow data from 49 stations covering 1948 2019 were obtained as shown in fig 1b delwp 2020 waternsw 2020 3 methodology in this study we carried out a spatiotemporal analysis of meteorological and hydrological droughts to characterize the nature of droughts in southeast australia major parts of the adopted analytical framework can be stepped out as below 1 meteorological drought hazard and frequency analyses were undertaken by using spi and edi from monthly rainfall data 2 monotonic trends of streamflow with their step changes and hydrological droughts were found using the m mk test sen s slope estimator and the pettitt test 3 the hydrological drought frequency was estimated using ssfi from monthly streamflow discharge records 4 correlation between spi edi and ssfi were assessed by pearson s and spearman s rank correlations and 5 estimation of drought propagation time dpt from meteorological to hydrological drought was done using theory of run the framework of the methodology for this study is given in fig 2 3 1 meteorological and hydrological drought identification using theory of run a time series analysis method called run theory was introduced by yevjevich 1967 to identify hydrological drought characteristics and to investigate their statistical properties such as intensity magnitude and duration the theory of run to characterize drought events for a given threshold is illustrated in fig 3 a run is explained as part of time series of drought parameter xt in that all values are either under or over the selected threshold x0 accordingly referred to as a negative run or a positive run respectively mishra et al 2009 mishra and singh 2010 drought identification concept fig 3 which was pro adopted by yevjevich 1967 and dracup et al 1980 can be described as follows a drought starts any time when xt xt refers to edi spi or ssfi in this case is continuously less than zero x0 and achieves an intensity of 1 0 or less drought terminates when xt is positive the duration or run length is defined as the period of time between drought initiation ti and termination time te the magnitude or run sum is the accumulated water deficit e g rainfall during the drought intensity or run intensity is calculated as the drought magnitude divided by its duration drought classifications based on edi spi and ssfi are shown in table 1 mckee et al 1993 hayes et al 1999 modarres 2007 dogan et al 2012 the details of edi spi and ssfi are explained in detail in appendix a 3 2 drought hazard and frequency analyses 3 2 1 drought hazard index drought severity and occurrence probability were used to quantify drought hazard by assigning weights and ratings based on the cumulative distribution function fig 4 the occurrences of drought were examined based on the frequencies of drought events for each drought class for multiple timesteps sönmez et al 2005 explained the percentages of drought occurrence as the ratio of drought occurrences in each time step to the total drought occurrences in the same drought category and timestep in this study the drought occurrence probabilities were calculated for all the selected stations for edi and spi of multi timesteps in southeast australia the drought hazard index dhi concept was applied to address drought hazard in this study dhi was calculated as below first of all the weights varying from 1 to 4 were assigned according to table 1 and secondly the ratings were assigned from 1 to 4 by evenly dividing the range of drought occurrence probability according to fig 4 thiessen polygon thiessen 1911 was used to find areal ratio of each station and average weight ratio calculated based on each station for each district lastly dhi was integrated by using the weights and the ratings as below kim et al 2013 1 dhi nnd w nnd r md w md r sd w sd r ed w ed r where w and r refer to weight and rating respectively the maximum and minimum values of dhi would be 40 and 10 respectively dhi however must be normalized from 10 to 40 0 1 therefore dhi was re scaled using the normalization method as below 2 n v i v i v min v max v min where v min and v max are the minimum and maximum values for variable v and nv i is the normalized value then dhi was classified into four classes as shown in table 2 3 2 2 drought frequency index drought frequency analysis addressed to monitor short term and long term either meteorological or hydrological drought vulnerability in southeast australia for this goal drought frequency index dfi eslamian and eslamian 2017 was calculated to detect vulnerable districts and streams in southeast australia dfi was calculated as below 3 dfi nnd w nnd n md w md n sd w sd n ed w ed n 4 d l where w and n present the weights and number of occurrences of particular drought respectively d l is the data length of a given station in this way maximum weighted drought frequency index value would be 1 and the minimum value would become 0 drought free then dfi was classified into four classes as illustrated in table 3 3 3 trend and step change analyses investigation of annual streamflow data series and trend analysis were performed in this study monotonic trends can occur either abruptly or gradually in streamflow data for this purpose modified hamed and rao 1998 non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to detect monotonic trends in annual streamflow data and sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was applied to calculate the magnitude of trend pettitt test pettitt 1979 was used to detect step change in the time series of streamflow data for all selected gauging stations pettitt test detects one single change point and it is more susceptible to find abrupt change in the middle of time series hawkins 1977 wijngaard et al 2003 costa and soares 2009 the details of m mk sen s slope estimator and pettitt test are explained in appendix a 3 4 drought propagation time drought propagation time dpt from meteorological to hydrological drought can be defined as the difference between the onset of hydrological drought and that of meteorological drought edossa et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 wu et al 2021 dpt was identified by run theory as below 4 dpt i n o hd i o md i n where o hd i and o md i represent the onset of hydrological and meteorological droughts respectively and n is the number of drought events finally dpt is obtained as month since the spi and ssfi were taken on the month scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 meteorological drought assessment 4 1 1 assessment of meteorological drought hazard since dhi provides regional drought hazard considering drought severity and occurrence probability we created a dhi map at the rainfall district level based on edi and multi timestep spi to assess the spatial distribution of meteorological drought hazard the drought occurrence probabilities in this study were calculated for each of the selected stations based on edi and six different timesteps spi 3 6 9 12 24 36 month and summarized the results for five rainfall stations in table 4 as an illustration rd 69 located in nsw has the thiessen polygons consisting of five rainfall stations 68045 69018 69029 70009 and 70045 with ratios of 5 5 56 6 19 8 17 2 and 0 9 respectively we should note that not all these five stations are within rd 69 and the thiessen polygons voronoi diagrams of these five stations are also located in rd 69 these five stations drought occurrence probabilities dop of moderate drought md were 6 7 9 5 9 1 8 and 10 8 respectively table 4 therefore areal weighted probability of drought occurrence for rd 69 was found as 9 0 055 6 7 0 566 9 5 0 198 9 1 0 172 8 0 009 10 8 similarly areal weighted dop of nnd sd and ed were calculated as 47 8 4 8 and 1 7 respectively weights and ratings of rd 69 were selected from table 5 ratings were assigned by dividing the range into 4 as explained in fig 4 for example the weight of md was 2 and the rating of md for rd 69 was 3 table 5 weights and ratings for the other drought categories nnd sd and ed assigned in the similar way then dhi was calculated as 27 from equation 1 which was a relatively high value compared to other districts and was re scaled to 0 57 from equation 2 finally rd 69 was classified as high for dhi 0 57 see table 2 the same procedure was applied to all the stations and districts then ultimate dhi spatial map was created for edi and multi timestep spi as shown in fig 5 fig 5 depicts the spatial dhi in southeast australia and it shows that edi and all timestep spis have detected very high level dhi at least in one district it is clear that there was no low dhi based on short term drought and seasonal drought which were 3 6 9 month spis fig 5a b and c furthermore 67 of the districts had high level dhi based on 3 month spi the south of the study area was detected as the most drought prone part based on the 6 month spi which indicates seasonal to medium term trends the 9 month spi was dominated by a moderate dhi in the region and 69 of the districts were categorized as having moderate drought hazard level and the south east coast of the region mainly faced a high level drought two rainfall districts rd 87 and rd 61 were found to have a very high level dhi based on 3 6 and 9 month spi although two districts rd 47 and rd 75 had low dhi south and south east coastal areas were dominated by high and very high dhi levels based on 12 month spi fig 5d the maximum numbers of very high level dhi were detected based on 24 month spi long term drought in south of the study area a big portion of the north east of nsw was dominated by high and very high levels of dhi in terms of 24 month spi similar to other long term drought indicators 36 month spi was detected as high and very high level dhi mainly in the south of the study area edi was detected as very high and high level dhi in the region at three and twenty two districts respectively edi interestingly was found to be the only index with three low dhi in the inner northwest of nsw victoria was found to be the most drought prone area by edi with 12 districts having either high or very high levels of dhi and other three districts were found to have moderate level dhi moderate dhi was detected for rd 76 and rd 82 for all timestep spi besides rd 85 rd 86 and rd 87 were found to be extremely drought prone having high level or very high level dhi for all timestep spi other rainfall districts rd 88 rd 89 and rd 90 were also drought prone districts with mainly high or very high level dhi fig 6 illustrates the distribution of districts based on different dhi classes 30 rainfall districts out of 45 were found having high level drought hazard based on 3 month spi and this is the worst case compared to other spis and edi the numbers of districts having high level dhi by 3 month 24 month spi and edi were higher than those having moderate dhi in the study area the areal coverage of dhi is presented in table c1 for instance the areal coverage of low moderate high and very high dhi based on edi were 3 9 39 6 54 1 and 2 5 respectively the areal coverage of high level dhi was found as 64 4 57 1 and 54 1 of the south eastern australia based on 3 month short term and 24 month long term spi and edi respectively 4 1 2 assessment of meteorological drought frequency drought frequency analysis is vital for drought vulnerability assessment frequencies of different drought categories can be mapped through spatial interpolation of data points to demarcate various drought prone zones here we investigated drought frequency by assigning proper weights calculating the number of drought event and considering data length of each of the selected rainfall stations finally meteorological drought frequency index mdfi was calculated for all the stations and interpolated by using the spline interpolation technique talmi and gilat 1977 hartkamp et al 1999 in arcgis environment fig 7 fig 7 clearly shows that frequency for spi is changing with time the duration of droughts based on spi increases whereas the frequency decreases and vice versa mckee et al 1993 edi detected high level drought frequency mainly in east and south west of the study area while north west of the study area experienced moderate level mdfi low level mdfi was not detected for edi for any rainfall station whereas 12 and 24 month spi had low level mdfi in terms of all other timesteps spi very high level mdfi was computed at 3 month accumulation period at all rainfall stations this result shows similarities with dhi at 3 month spi high level mdfi was found in the east and south coastal areas which have vital importance in terms of hydrological drought as well since high frequency of meteorological drought increases the occurrence probability of hydrological drought spinoni et al 2014 studied drought frequency and severity in a global scale by using 12 month spi with data covering 1951 2010 and they found significant increasing frequency in southeast australia south west of the study area which is winter dominant wet winter and low summer rainfall climate zone experienced higher mdfi for spi and edi of each time steps this outcome reveals the importance of seasonal rainfall on drought frequency analysis 4 1 3 regional assessment of meteorological drought the study area was divided into three hydrological regions based on annual average rainfall aar distribution by using the jenks natural optimization method jenks 1967 the jenks optimization method seeks to minimize each class s mean deviation from the class average whereas maximizing each class s deviation from the mean of the groups therefore the method seeks to reduce the variance within classes and maximize the variance between classes what s more our hydrological divisions fig 8a show high similarity with köppen climate classification bureau of meteorology 2016 which is essential for the accuracy of regional drought assessment climatic features of divisions are as follows region 1 is regarded as arid region 2 is semi arid and region 3 is temperate climatic zone the numbers of rainfall stations for each region were 11 32 and 59 respectively besides regional drought occurrence probability based on edi and different timestep spis are shown in fig 8b the maximum total ed sd md drought probabilities were calculated at 3 month spi for all regions here the minimum one was detected by edi for region 1 and region 2 the highest extreme drought probabilities in region 1 region 2 and region 3 were detected by spi 3 as 7 2 7 1 and 6 4 respectively furthermore considering long term droughts e g 12 24 and 36 month spi spi 12 detected the maximum total drought occurrence probabilities in each region shukla and wood 2008 found that spi 12 and standardized runoff index sri used for hydrological drought monitoring were similar and had high correlation to depict hydrological aspects of droughts wasko et al 2021 reported decreasing rainfall between 1960 and 2017 in the southeast of australia causing a prolonged period of drought gallant et al 2013 found that the number of drought events in southeast of australia had statistically decreasing trend and increasing average duration over the period 1960 2009 the mdfi distribution at the regional scale is shown in fig 9 region 3 which has the highest aar considering the whole study area had the topmost mdfi level for all the timesteps spi and edi compared to region 1 and region 2 this result is of vital importance in terms of the likelihood of hydrological drought in the region as well as it is seen from fig 9 the frequency of meteorological drought is decreasing as timesteps of spi are increasing edi which is a time independent drought index detected high level mdfi in region 2 and region 3 4 2 historical trends of streamflow a set of 13 gauging stations was identified with step change in annual total streamflow at 0 01 significance level table 6 table 6 shows that the majority of stations showed an abrupt change in the mid 90 s and early 00 s when one of the worst historical droughts hit van dijk et al 2013 southern and eastern parts of australia murphy and timbal 2008 the so called millennium drought bond et al 2008 the most dominant year of step change was found to be 1996 for 7 out of 13 stations zhang et al 2016 studied changes in total annual streamflow across australia and detected the step change by the distribution free cusum method similar to our study they found significant decreasing trends in annual streamflow in nsw and vic besides our results of abrupt change showed similarity with this study in addition we investigated monotonic trends before and after the break year salarijazi et al 2012 differently from zhang et al 2016 table 6 out of 13 stations only 3 showed an increasing trend before and after the step change although these stations had gradual decreasing trends in the long term using the m mk test and sen s slope upward trends were determined for 8 out of 13 stations after the abrupt change spatial variations of annual total streamflow with directions and step changes at different significance levels 0 01 0 05 0 10 are shown in fig 10 although all streamflow stations showed a decreasing trend when significance level was ignored table b1 statistically significant decreasing trends and decreasing step change were detected mainly in the south of the study area fig 10 this finding is consistent with zhang et al 2016 and wasko et al 2021 very strong evidence for decreasing trend based on annual total streamflow was detected at the significance level of 0 01 in the south of southeast coast sec murray darling basin mdb and north of mdb streamflow trend analysis covering monthly and seasonal average flows are explained in detail in appendix b dai 2021 investigated global hydro climatic trends during 1950 and 2018 and noted that rainfall and streamflow had decreased in eastern australia which supports our findings furthermore decreasing streamflow trends in our study showed high similarities with wasko et al 2021 4 3 hydrological drought assessment in order to understand hydrological aspects for adequate drought management hydrological drought was quantified by using ssfi to identify drought characteristics such as drought onset end duration magnitude and intensity thereafter hydrological drought events occurrence of probability hydrological drought frequency index hdfi and long term trends m mk test in multi timestep ssfi were determined 4 3 1 trends in hydrological drought table 7 presents short and long term hydrological drought trends identified by m mk test at significance levels of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 results clearly showed that there was no significant upward trend in six different timesteps of ssfi at selected streamflow gauges decreases in annual median streamflow in southeast australia have been observed in the mdb and sec nsw and vic downward trends in streamflow have been found between 50 and 75 of gauges in each of these basins since 1975 for example more than 75 of the long term streamflow gauges show a decreasing trend since 1970 csiro and bom 2020 and our results for short and long term hydrological drought trends depict how these streamflow decreasing trends led to downward drought trends wasko et al 2021 studied trends in simulated streamflow based on annual sri across australia and our findings support their results in southeast australia 4 3 2 assessment of hydrological drought frequency fig 11 illustrates hydrological drought frequency index hdfi from 3 to 36 month accumulation period in southeast australia as expected hdfi has been decreasing as a function of time whereas high level hdfi was determined at 3 and 6 month ssfis very high level hdfi was not detected at any time step of ssfi however higher hdfis for each timestep of ssfi were detected in sec and north of mdb furthermore we also addressed changing of hydrological drought frequency and duration over the last decades as given in table 6 most of the step changes of streamflow were observed in the mid 1990 s which is well known prolonged drought millennium drought or big dry murphy and timbal 2008 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 that affected southeast australia we therefore compared the numbers of total drought moderate severe extreme events before and after 1990 to depict changes in hydrological drought characteristics for this goal we selected nine streamflow gauges which had the longest more than 60 years data length to investigate changes in frequency and the results are summarized in table c2 average standard deviation results illustrated that 55 10 51 5 50 7 52 6 57 7 and 66 16 of total droughts occurred after 1990 based on 3 6 9 12 24 36 month ssfis respectively similarly longer hydrological drought duration in southeast australia was experienced based on the selected nine streamflow stations after 1990 see table c3 forootan et al 2019 found that hydrological droughts in australia between 2006 and 2011 were highly correlated with the iod and the enso climate drivers where wang et al 2021 noted that the impact of iod was stronger than el nino on hydrological drought with comparison of 2006 2009 and 2018 2020 droughts besides we know that four major climate drivers sam enso iod and ipo influence droughts in south eastern australia csiro 2010 however droughts characteristics due to climate drivers may not be similar in terms of magnitude severity spatial distribution and so on verdon kidd and kiem 2009 maximum hydrological drought quantities such as magnitude duration and intensity severity were detected mainly after 2000 at different accumulated periods and detected maximum hydrological drought quantities are listed in table c4 with drought onset and end 4 4 comparison of meteorological and hydrological drought indices the pearson correlation coefficient was computed between drought indices at different timesteps from 3 to 36 month for better inter comparison and to find the most appropriate accumulation period between spi edi and ssfi for this purpose the closest five streamflow and rainfall stations were selected with average 5 km distance in order to apply correlation analysis these are referred to as paired stations fig 12a depicts correlation coefficient between spi and ssfi at five paired stations it is clear that the least correlation was detected at 3 month timestep 0 45 rp 0 82 and the coefficient of correlation showed an increasing trend with time till 24 month accumulation period 0 63 rp 0 89 after 24 month timestep correlation coefficient was found to be increasing or decreasing at 36 month timestep it should be noted that high correlation of 36 month accumulation period is not meaningful since long term calculation of spis or ssfi longer than 24 month fitting a distribution might be biased due to the limitation of data length mishra and singh 2010 the correlation between the spi and ssfi values at three different time steps 12 24 36 month is depicted by drought severity time steps in fig c1 and scatter plots of these with confidence ellipse are shown in fig c2 the least correlation coefficients at six different timesteps among five paired stations were found for 422002 48015 streamflow gauge rainfall gauge 0 45 rp 0 63 located in semi arid climatic zone region 2 one of the main reasons of this low correlation compared to other cases might be dry climate for this reason there are too many zero rainfall values in a particular season and the computed spi values for short timesteps may not be normally distributed mishra and singh 2010 furthermore due to the lack of soil moisture harsh geology and reduced groundwater discharge may not replenish enough water for streamflow it was also found from regression analysis that geology was one of the main factors affecting hydrological droughts vogel and kroll 1992 van loon and laaha 2015 therefore long term calculation of ssfi might be highly skewed and might not be well fitted by the gamma distribution li et al 2018 investigated connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts in a semi arid basin of yellow river china and found that pearson s correlation between standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and ssfi from one to 12 month timesteps was found to be relatively low rp 0 6 similar to our findings furthermore torabi haghighi et al 2020 found that pearson s correlation coefficient between spi and sri from 1 to 24 month timesteps was less than 0 5 due to low precipitation and large evapotranspiration edi on the other hand showed a decreasing correlation coefficient with hydrological drought index ssfi fig 12b as time increased which is expected since edi has a high dissimilarity level from 6 to 12 month spi dogan et al 2012 and this similarity decreases after 9 month jain et al 2015 wable et al 2019 however edi had a higher correlation 0 58 rp 0 84 than spi at 3 month timestep 0 45 rp 0 82 with ssfi for all the five paired stations especially in arid regions this finding shows that edi is capable to identify short term hydrological drought better than spi similar to our findings dogan et al 2012 also found that edi is preferable to monitor meteorological drought in arid semi arid regions besides we suggest that edi and spi might be used jointly to establish short term hydrological drought for an early drought warning in semi arid regions furthermore combining and comparing different drought indices could help investigate correlation between them characterize droughts explore the accuracy and sensitivity of drought indices and to delve into how well they cohere with each other in the context of a specific objective guttman 1998 szalai et al 2000 wu et al 2001 morid et al 2006 paulo and pereira 2006 smakhtin and hughes 2007 pandey et al 2008 dogan et al 2012 in addition to pearson s correlation coefficient we tested spearman s rank correlation for the same paired stations to find the best accumulation period and we found consistent results to pearson s correlation for both spi ssfi and edi ssfi fig c3 4 5 propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought table 8 presents the drought propagation time dpt with their duration magnitude intensity and interarrival time at a paired station 206025 56065 at 36 month timestep it should be noted that only matched meteorological and hydrological drought events were identified by run theory as shown in table 8 dpt is the lag time between the onset of hydrological drought and that of meteorological one for instance meteorological drought initiated in february 1993 and hydrological drought started in july 1993 therefore dpt which is lag time was found as 5 months for station 206025 table 8 it means that it takes about 5 months for the deficit of rainfall to be manifested in streamflow table 9 summarizes the list of hydrological and meteorological droughts along with their corresponding mean duration magnitude and interarrival times the interarrival time of drought events is defined as the period of time from the initiation of a drought to the onset of a next drought event see fig 3 the return period or recurrence interval of a hydrological drought can be considered as the average interarrival time of hydrological droughts with a certain magnitude or greater haan 1977 shiau and shen 2001 it should be noted that meteorological data set was paired with hydrological data set therefore meteorological drought characteristics in table 9 show pair wise comparison with hydrological drought time period meteorological droughts were most frequent than hydrological droughts hydrological droughts had longer durations and magnitudes than meteorological droughts despite the fact that we expect increasing dpt with time accumulation period but we could not find direct increasing dpt link with accumulation period after 12 month we found increasing or decreasing dpt mainly after the 12 month accumulation period since hydrological drought does not show a linear response to meteorological drought wu et al 2017 however mostly increasing dpt from meteorological to hydrological drought was found with time between 3 and 12 months not shown wu et al 2021 analyzed drought propagation time for 1 3 and 12 month timesteps in three sub basins located in southern china with three hydrometric stations and they found that propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought increased as time step increased although there is a strong linkage between meteorological drought and hydrological drought it is challenging to generalize dpt due to the complexity of the nature of drought response sensitivity of hydrological drought from meteorological one can be different due to the impacts of other variables such as soil moisture evaporation temperature humidity catchment characteristics and human activities for instance dpt from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was estimated by some researchers edossa et al 2010 liu et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 wu et al 2017 and their findings varied from 0 46 to 13 one of the main reasons for different estimated dpts is climatic variability as an illustration short response time for dpt is expected in the humid region whereas arid and semi arid regions show longer response time of the hydrological process barker et al 2016 all in all by considering the aforementioned limitations dpt can be computed by theory of run for regional water resources management and drought forecasting in the study area 5 conclusions the meteorological drought hazard can be identified by applying thiessen polygons voronoi diagrams as a conceptual index dhi which depicts the probability of drought and its severity in a non dimensional spatial extent furthermore the drought frequency index dfi can be estimated by associating the number of drought occurrences and length of time series spatial interpolation can then be used to identify zones that are vulnerable to drought regional assessment of mdfi shows that region 3 temperate which has the highest annual average rainfall considering the whole study area had the topmost level mdfi for any timestep spi and edi compared to region 1 arid and region 2 semi arid therefore it is challenging to propose a relationship between rainfall distribution and potential drought zone hydrological dfi hdfi results show that high level hdfi was found at 3 and 6 month timesteps of ssfi consequently higher hdfis for each timestep of ssfi were detected in the south east coast and north of murray darling basin the major findings of this study are noted below 1 overall the south and coastal zones of southeast australia were detected as the most drought prone regions based on dhi whereas higher level meteorological dfi mdfi were detected mainly in the east coast and southwest parts of the study area 2 decreasing abrupt change in annual total streamflow at 0 01 significance level was identified mainly in victoria the most dominant year of abrupt change was found to be 1996 maximum hydrological drought characteristics duration magnitude and intensity were found in the late 90 s and mostly 00 s based on 3 6 9 12 and 36 month ssfis the percentage of total hydrological drought events and the severity mostly increased after 1990 3 hydrological droughts were found to be increasing at 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 significance levels for all the selected timesteps of ssfi in southeast australia 4 pearson s correlation and spearman s rank correlation agreed that the highest correlation between spi and ssfi was found at 12 and 24 month accumulation periods correlations of 36 month timestep were found to be inconsistent due to the limitation of data length and climate variability 5 edi was found to be inadequate for long term hydrological drought on the other hand edi depicts a higher correlation on both pearson s and spearman s rank with 3 month ssfi compared to 3 month spi furthermore performance of edi with ssfi was found to be better than spi at 3 month timestep in semi arid regions therefore edi and spi can be used jointly in order to identify the onset of short term hydrological drought which could be convenient for an early warning system 6 due to the success of spi and ssfi s capability in defining drought onset drought propagation time dpt can be found from meteorological to hydrological drought by using the theory of runs however defined dpt cannot be directly applied to other regions since it is challenging to formulate or generalize dpt due to complexity of the nature of drought and catchment characteristics shorter timesteps of hydrological drought run into mostly shorter dpt and vice versa however response sensitivity of hydrological drought from meteorological drought can be different due to impacts of other variables such as soil moisture evaporation temperature humidity catchment characteristics and human activities overall dpt can be computed by the theory of runs for regional water resources management and drought forecasting in the southeast australia this study can be extended to identify drought risk in southeast australia by adding related vulnerability and exposure parameters besides this comprehensive analysis can bridge the existing gaps in the current drought research and would be useful to identify the most vulnerable sub areas to drought in order to help early drought warnings water resources management drought mitigation and drought action plan

on the other hand refers to streamflow deficiency in this study since it is useful to address groundwater drought as a type of drought which is not generally included in the classification of droughts mishra and singh 2010 australia having a high rainfall variability had experienced three major droughts in the recent past the federation drought 1895 1902 the world war ii drought 1937 1945 and the millennium drought 1997 2010 due to its markedly seasonal and highly variable rainfall patterns australia is highly susceptible to droughts more recently southeast australia experienced the driest two year period between 2018 and 2019 on record hughes et al 2020 van oldenborgh et al 2021 and this extraordinary drought was the leading driver of the wildfires the so called black summer in southeast australia kemter et al 2021 previous studies note that there has been a decreasing trend in rainfall and streamflow mainly in southern and south eastern australia murphy and timbal 2008 timbal and fawcett 2013 zhang et al 2016 hajani and rahman 2018 vervoort et al 2021 for instance april to october rainfall covering the period of 2000 2019 has been found to decrease by 12 when compared to the 1900 1999 values csiro and bom 2020 and the storage volumes in south eastern australia in this period were found to be the lowest in more than ten years bureau of meteorology 2020b the deficiency of rainfall has long term effects on both surface and groundwater resources the study area covering nsw and vic comprises more than 60 of water supply over australia and more than 90 of this water is sourced from surface water australian bureau of statistics 2021 therefore investigation of hydrological drought and its link with meteorological drought have a vital importance in water security planning in the study area many researchers analyzed droughts in australia both at regional and national scales white and o meagher 1995 mpelasoka et al 2008 ummenhofer et al 2009 rahmat et al 2012 gallant et al 2013 nazahiyah et al 2014 tian et al 2019 furthermore many studies focused on what causes droughts in australia verdon kidd and kiem 2009 csiro 2010 forootan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 it has been found that four key climate drivers southern annular mode sam el nino southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo cause a highly variable climate from year to year influencing the onset of drought in southeast australia the intensity of a drought covering its frequency areal extent severity and duration is essential for regional drought analysis mishra and singh 2009 for this purpose drought indices are the best tool to monitor drought and to quantify its characteristics to provide information to decision makers and to initiate a drought action plan hence in this study we adopted standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and effective drought index edi byun and wilhite 1999 for the identification of meteorological drought characteristics spi a moving average based index was recommended by world meteorological organization 2012 both drought indices spi and edi have been widely applied around the world for drought monitoring hayes et al 1999 mishra and desai 2005 sönmez et al 2005 cancelliere et al 2007 mishra and singh 2009 deo et al 2017 caloiero 2018 rashid and beecham 2019 li et al 2021 lohpaisankrit and techamahasaranont 2021 malik et al 2021 salimi et al 2021 yildirim et al 2022 monthly rainfall is the only parameter for both indices spi can be computed at different timesteps whereas edi is a time independent index although the edi was developed at a daily time step byun and wilhite 1999 kim et al 2009 it is an effective method to compute drought from monthly rainfall time series data smakhtin and hughes 2007 akhtari et al 2009 dogan et al 2012 in this study standardized streamflow index ssfi modarres 2007 telesca et al 2012 was applied to compute hydrological drought ssfi has a calculation process similar to spi and only input needed for this is monthly streamflow data in previous research streamflow data have been widely used for hydrological drought analysis dracup et al 1980 van loon and laaha 2015 kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 kubiak wójcicka and bąk 2018 the reasons for selecting these three drought indices spi edi ssfi are i spi is the most used index for drought monitoring around the world kchouk et al 2022 yildirim et al 2022 ii wmo recommended to use spi for drought monitoring world meteorological organization 2012 iii edi is popular and preferable for arid semi arid regions dogan et al 2012 kamruzzaman et al 2019 malik et al 2021 mondol et al 2021 iv edi and spi have similarities and hence can be used together for drought monitoring adisa et al 2021 v decile which is used by the bureau of meteorology for drought monitoring in australia is not able to detect drought onset and end kanellou et al 2008 and vi ssfi has not been used in australia for hydrological drought monitoring yildirim et al 2022 a rank based non parametric method mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is commonly applied to perform trends in hydrology helsel and hirsch 1992 zhang et al 2001 yilmaz and perera 2015 kocsis et al 2017 jehanzaib et al 2020a in this study however we used the modified mk m mk hamed and rao 1998 test to reduce the effect of serial correlation on the mk test results identification of change points in annual streamflow time series has been widely used in hydrological drought studies jehanzaib et al 2020a 2020b shah et al 2022 step changes in annual streamflow were detected by pettitt test pettitt 1979 pearson s correlation pearson 1895 and spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 were applied here to assess correlation between meteorological and hydrological drought indices for different timesteps the theory of run or run theory yevjevich 1967 was applied here to detect drought propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought wu et al 2021 the maps and spatial interpolations were made using arcgis 10 6 1 in previous studies detailed drought hazard and comprehensive analysis covering both meteorological and hydrological droughts in australia are lacking kiem et al 2016 noted three key challenges in a drought study which focus on drought hazard to improve understanding and management of australian droughts therefore we aim to fill the currently existing knowledge gap in drought science by investigating drought hazard frequency and propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in southeast australia by using long term monthly rainfall and streamflow dataset overall the aim of this study is to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts in southeast australia the objectives of this study therefore are 1 to apply a conceptual model to assess meteorological drought hazard 2 to estimate frequency of drought and map it through a spatial interpolation method 3 to analyze trends in long term streamflow data and to identify abrupt changes before and after the break points if any 4 to depict trends in hydrological droughts 5 to assess correlation between meteorological spi edi and hydrological ssfi drought indices for different timesteps and 6 to identify when a meteorological drought becomes a hydrological one and discuss the possible factors that potentially affect the propagation time 2 study area and data the study selected southeast australia as the study area this has an area of 1 028 790 km2 covering the most populous states of new south wales nsw and victoria vic fig 1 three main national catchments murray darling basin mdb lake eyre basin leb and south east coast sec are located in the study area the mdb is the twentieth largest river catchment in the world which contains twenty two major catchments covering most of inland of nsw and north of vic sec lies east of mdb and covers most of coastal nsw and vic the study area accounts for approximately 63 of water quantity in australia and roughly 98 of water sources comes from surface water southeast australia is located in arid semi arid and temperate climate zone bureau of meteorology 2016 with average annual rainfall increasing from northwest to southeast monthly rainfall data from 104 stations between 1858 and 2019 shown in fig 1a were obtained from australian bureau of meteorology bureau of meteorology 2020a statistics on monthly rainfall data were calculated record lengths were more than 100 years for 97 stations average length of 123 years minimum length of 81 years the median data length of 122 5 years these rainfall stations are located across 45 rainfall districts in south east australia with at least 2 rainfall stations from each rainfall district in contrast to rainfall data streamflow gauges had less data length we however aimed to choose relatively long periods of streamflow records greater than 40 years stations being spatially distributed with fewer missing data finally monthly streamflow data from 49 stations covering 1948 2019 were obtained as shown in fig 1b delwp 2020 waternsw 2020 3 methodology in this study we carried out a spatiotemporal analysis of meteorological and hydrological droughts to characterize the nature of droughts in southeast australia major parts of the adopted analytical framework can be stepped out as below 1 meteorological drought hazard and frequency analyses were undertaken by using spi and edi from monthly rainfall data 2 monotonic trends of streamflow with their step changes and hydrological droughts were found using the m mk test sen s slope estimator and the pettitt test 3 the hydrological drought frequency was estimated using ssfi from monthly streamflow discharge records 4 correlation between spi edi and ssfi were assessed by pearson s and spearman s rank correlations and 5 estimation of drought propagation time dpt from meteorological to hydrological drought was done using theory of run the framework of the methodology for this study is given in fig 2 3 1 meteorological and hydrological drought identification using theory of run a time series analysis method called run theory was introduced by yevjevich 1967 to identify hydrological drought characteristics and to investigate their statistical properties such as intensity magnitude and duration the theory of run to characterize drought events for a given threshold is illustrated in fig 3 a run is explained as part of time series of drought parameter xt in that all values are either under or over the selected threshold x0 accordingly referred to as a negative run or a positive run respectively mishra et al 2009 mishra and singh 2010 drought identification concept fig 3 which was pro adopted by yevjevich 1967 and dracup et al 1980 can be described as follows a drought starts any time when xt xt refers to edi spi or ssfi in this case is continuously less than zero x0 and achieves an intensity of 1 0 or less drought terminates when xt is positive the duration or run length is defined as the period of time between drought initiation ti and termination time te the magnitude or run sum is the accumulated water deficit e g rainfall during the drought intensity or run intensity is calculated as the drought magnitude divided by its duration drought classifications based on edi spi and ssfi are shown in table 1 mckee et al 1993 hayes et al 1999 modarres 2007 dogan et al 2012 the details of edi spi and ssfi are explained in detail in appendix a 3 2 drought hazard and frequency analyses 3 2 1 drought hazard index drought severity and occurrence probability were used to quantify drought hazard by assigning weights and ratings based on the cumulative distribution function fig 4 the occurrences of drought were examined based on the frequencies of drought events for each drought class for multiple timesteps sönmez et al 2005 explained the percentages of drought occurrence as the ratio of drought occurrences in each time step to the total drought occurrences in the same drought category and timestep in this study the drought occurrence probabilities were calculated for all the selected stations for edi and spi of multi timesteps in southeast australia the drought hazard index dhi concept was applied to address drought hazard in this study dhi was calculated as below first of all the weights varying from 1 to 4 were assigned according to table 1 and secondly the ratings were assigned from 1 to 4 by evenly dividing the range of drought occurrence probability according to fig 4 thiessen polygon thiessen 1911 was used to find areal ratio of each station and average weight ratio calculated based on each station for each district lastly dhi was integrated by using the weights and the ratings as below kim et al 2013 1 dhi nnd w nnd r md w md r sd w sd r ed w ed r where w and r refer to weight and rating respectively the maximum and minimum values of dhi would be 40 and 10 respectively dhi however must be normalized from 10 to 40 0 1 therefore dhi was re scaled using the normalization method as below 2 n v i v i v min v max v min where v min and v max are the minimum and maximum values for variable v and nv i is the normalized value then dhi was classified into four classes as shown in table 2 3 2 2 drought frequency index drought frequency analysis addressed to monitor short term and long term either meteorological or hydrological drought vulnerability in southeast australia for this goal drought frequency index dfi eslamian and eslamian 2017 was calculated to detect vulnerable districts and streams in southeast australia dfi was calculated as below 3 dfi nnd w nnd n md w md n sd w sd n ed w ed n 4 d l where w and n present the weights and number of occurrences of particular drought respectively d l is the data length of a given station in this way maximum weighted drought frequency index value would be 1 and the minimum value would become 0 drought free then dfi was classified into four classes as illustrated in table 3 3 3 trend and step change analyses investigation of annual streamflow data series and trend analysis were performed in this study monotonic trends can occur either abruptly or gradually in streamflow data for this purpose modified hamed and rao 1998 non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to detect monotonic trends in annual streamflow data and sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was applied to calculate the magnitude of trend pettitt test pettitt 1979 was used to detect step change in the time series of streamflow data for all selected gauging stations pettitt test detects one single change point and it is more susceptible to find abrupt change in the middle of time series hawkins 1977 wijngaard et al 2003 costa and soares 2009 the details of m mk sen s slope estimator and pettitt test are explained in appendix a 3 4 drought propagation time drought propagation time dpt from meteorological to hydrological drought can be defined as the difference between the onset of hydrological drought and that of meteorological drought edossa et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 wu et al 2021 dpt was identified by run theory as below 4 dpt i n o hd i o md i n where o hd i and o md i represent the onset of hydrological and meteorological droughts respectively and n is the number of drought events finally dpt is obtained as month since the spi and ssfi were taken on the month scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 meteorological drought assessment 4 1 1 assessment of meteorological drought hazard since dhi provides regional drought hazard considering drought severity and occurrence probability we created a dhi map at the rainfall district level based on edi and multi timestep spi to assess the spatial distribution of meteorological drought hazard the drought occurrence probabilities in this study were calculated for each of the selected stations based on edi and six different timesteps spi 3 6 9 12 24 36 month and summarized the results for five rainfall stations in table 4 as an illustration rd 69 located in nsw has the thiessen polygons consisting of five rainfall stations 68045 69018 69029 70009 and 70045 with ratios of 5 5 56 6 19 8 17 2 and 0 9 respectively we should note that not all these five stations are within rd 69 and the thiessen polygons voronoi diagrams of these five stations are also located in rd 69 these five stations drought occurrence probabilities dop of moderate drought md were 6 7 9 5 9 1 8 and 10 8 respectively table 4 therefore areal weighted probability of drought occurrence for rd 69 was found as 9 0 055 6 7 0 566 9 5 0 198 9 1 0 172 8 0 009 10 8 similarly areal weighted dop of nnd sd and ed were calculated as 47 8 4 8 and 1 7 respectively weights and ratings of rd 69 were selected from table 5 ratings were assigned by dividing the range into 4 as explained in fig 4 for example the weight of md was 2 and the rating of md for rd 69 was 3 table 5 weights and ratings for the other drought categories nnd sd and ed assigned in the similar way then dhi was calculated as 27 from equation 1 which was a relatively high value compared to other districts and was re scaled to 0 57 from equation 2 finally rd 69 was classified as high for dhi 0 57 see table 2 the same procedure was applied to all the stations and districts then ultimate dhi spatial map was created for edi and multi timestep spi as shown in fig 5 fig 5 depicts the spatial dhi in southeast australia and it shows that edi and all timestep spis have detected very high level dhi at least in one district it is clear that there was no low dhi based on short term drought and seasonal drought which were 3 6 9 month spis fig 5a b and c furthermore 67 of the districts had high level dhi based on 3 month spi the south of the study area was detected as the most drought prone part based on the 6 month spi which indicates seasonal to medium term trends the 9 month spi was dominated by a moderate dhi in the region and 69 of the districts were categorized as having moderate drought hazard level and the south east coast of the region mainly faced a high level drought two rainfall districts rd 87 and rd 61 were found to have a very high level dhi based on 3 6 and 9 month spi although two districts rd 47 and rd 75 had low dhi south and south east coastal areas were dominated by high and very high dhi levels based on 12 month spi fig 5d the maximum numbers of very high level dhi were detected based on 24 month spi long term drought in south of the study area a big portion of the north east of nsw was dominated by high and very high levels of dhi in terms of 24 month spi similar to other long term drought indicators 36 month spi was detected as high and very high level dhi mainly in the south of the study area edi was detected as very high and high level dhi in the region at three and twenty two districts respectively edi interestingly was found to be the only index with three low dhi in the inner northwest of nsw victoria was found to be the most drought prone area by edi with 12 districts having either high or very high levels of dhi and other three districts were found to have moderate level dhi moderate dhi was detected for rd 76 and rd 82 for all timestep spi besides rd 85 rd 86 and rd 87 were found to be extremely drought prone having high level or very high level dhi for all timestep spi other rainfall districts rd 88 rd 89 and rd 90 were also drought prone districts with mainly high or very high level dhi fig 6 illustrates the distribution of districts based on different dhi classes 30 rainfall districts out of 45 were found having high level drought hazard based on 3 month spi and this is the worst case compared to other spis and edi the numbers of districts having high level dhi by 3 month 24 month spi and edi were higher than those having moderate dhi in the study area the areal coverage of dhi is presented in table c1 for instance the areal coverage of low moderate high and very high dhi based on edi were 3 9 39 6 54 1 and 2 5 respectively the areal coverage of high level dhi was found as 64 4 57 1 and 54 1 of the south eastern australia based on 3 month short term and 24 month long term spi and edi respectively 4 1 2 assessment of meteorological drought frequency drought frequency analysis is vital for drought vulnerability assessment frequencies of different drought categories can be mapped through spatial interpolation of data points to demarcate various drought prone zones here we investigated drought frequency by assigning proper weights calculating the number of drought event and considering data length of each of the selected rainfall stations finally meteorological drought frequency index mdfi was calculated for all the stations and interpolated by using the spline interpolation technique talmi and gilat 1977 hartkamp et al 1999 in arcgis environment fig 7 fig 7 clearly shows that frequency for spi is changing with time the duration of droughts based on spi increases whereas the frequency decreases and vice versa mckee et al 1993 edi detected high level drought frequency mainly in east and south west of the study area while north west of the study area experienced moderate level mdfi low level mdfi was not detected for edi for any rainfall station whereas 12 and 24 month spi had low level mdfi in terms of all other timesteps spi very high level mdfi was computed at 3 month accumulation period at all rainfall stations this result shows similarities with dhi at 3 month spi high level mdfi was found in the east and south coastal areas which have vital importance in terms of hydrological drought as well since high frequency of meteorological drought increases the occurrence probability of hydrological drought spinoni et al 2014 studied drought frequency and severity in a global scale by using 12 month spi with data covering 1951 2010 and they found significant increasing frequency in southeast australia south west of the study area which is winter dominant wet winter and low summer rainfall climate zone experienced higher mdfi for spi and edi of each time steps this outcome reveals the importance of seasonal rainfall on drought frequency analysis 4 1 3 regional assessment of meteorological drought the study area was divided into three hydrological regions based on annual average rainfall aar distribution by using the jenks natural optimization method jenks 1967 the jenks optimization method seeks to minimize each class s mean deviation from the class average whereas maximizing each class s deviation from the mean of the groups therefore the method seeks to reduce the variance within classes and maximize the variance between classes what s more our hydrological divisions fig 8a show high similarity with köppen climate classification bureau of meteorology 2016 which is essential for the accuracy of regional drought assessment climatic features of divisions are as follows region 1 is regarded as arid region 2 is semi arid and region 3 is temperate climatic zone the numbers of rainfall stations for each region were 11 32 and 59 respectively besides regional drought occurrence probability based on edi and different timestep spis are shown in fig 8b the maximum total ed sd md drought probabilities were calculated at 3 month spi for all regions here the minimum one was detected by edi for region 1 and region 2 the highest extreme drought probabilities in region 1 region 2 and region 3 were detected by spi 3 as 7 2 7 1 and 6 4 respectively furthermore considering long term droughts e g 12 24 and 36 month spi spi 12 detected the maximum total drought occurrence probabilities in each region shukla and wood 2008 found that spi 12 and standardized runoff index sri used for hydrological drought monitoring were similar and had high correlation to depict hydrological aspects of droughts wasko et al 2021 reported decreasing rainfall between 1960 and 2017 in the southeast of australia causing a prolonged period of drought gallant et al 2013 found that the number of drought events in southeast of australia had statistically decreasing trend and increasing average duration over the period 1960 2009 the mdfi distribution at the regional scale is shown in fig 9 region 3 which has the highest aar considering the whole study area had the topmost mdfi level for all the timesteps spi and edi compared to region 1 and region 2 this result is of vital importance in terms of the likelihood of hydrological drought in the region as well as it is seen from fig 9 the frequency of meteorological drought is decreasing as timesteps of spi are increasing edi which is a time independent drought index detected high level mdfi in region 2 and region 3 4 2 historical trends of streamflow a set of 13 gauging stations was identified with step change in annual total streamflow at 0 01 significance level table 6 table 6 shows that the majority of stations showed an abrupt change in the mid 90 s and early 00 s when one of the worst historical droughts hit van dijk et al 2013 southern and eastern parts of australia murphy and timbal 2008 the so called millennium drought bond et al 2008 the most dominant year of step change was found to be 1996 for 7 out of 13 stations zhang et al 2016 studied changes in total annual streamflow across australia and detected the step change by the distribution free cusum method similar to our study they found significant decreasing trends in annual streamflow in nsw and vic besides our results of abrupt change showed similarity with this study in addition we investigated monotonic trends before and after the break year salarijazi et al 2012 differently from zhang et al 2016 table 6 out of 13 stations only 3 showed an increasing trend before and after the step change although these stations had gradual decreasing trends in the long term using the m mk test and sen s slope upward trends were determined for 8 out of 13 stations after the abrupt change spatial variations of annual total streamflow with directions and step changes at different significance levels 0 01 0 05 0 10 are shown in fig 10 although all streamflow stations showed a decreasing trend when significance level was ignored table b1 statistically significant decreasing trends and decreasing step change were detected mainly in the south of the study area fig 10 this finding is consistent with zhang et al 2016 and wasko et al 2021 very strong evidence for decreasing trend based on annual total streamflow was detected at the significance level of 0 01 in the south of southeast coast sec murray darling basin mdb and north of mdb streamflow trend analysis covering monthly and seasonal average flows are explained in detail in appendix b dai 2021 investigated global hydro climatic trends during 1950 and 2018 and noted that rainfall and streamflow had decreased in eastern australia which supports our findings furthermore decreasing streamflow trends in our study showed high similarities with wasko et al 2021 4 3 hydrological drought assessment in order to understand hydrological aspects for adequate drought management hydrological drought was quantified by using ssfi to identify drought characteristics such as drought onset end duration magnitude and intensity thereafter hydrological drought events occurrence of probability hydrological drought frequency index hdfi and long term trends m mk test in multi timestep ssfi were determined 4 3 1 trends in hydrological drought table 7 presents short and long term hydrological drought trends identified by m mk test at significance levels of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 results clearly showed that there was no significant upward trend in six different timesteps of ssfi at selected streamflow gauges decreases in annual median streamflow in southeast australia have been observed in the mdb and sec nsw and vic downward trends in streamflow have been found between 50 and 75 of gauges in each of these basins since 1975 for example more than 75 of the long term streamflow gauges show a decreasing trend since 1970 csiro and bom 2020 and our results for short and long term hydrological drought trends depict how these streamflow decreasing trends led to downward drought trends wasko et al 2021 studied trends in simulated streamflow based on annual sri across australia and our findings support their results in southeast australia 4 3 2 assessment of hydrological drought frequency fig 11 illustrates hydrological drought frequency index hdfi from 3 to 36 month accumulation period in southeast australia as expected hdfi has been decreasing as a function of time whereas high level hdfi was determined at 3 and 6 month ssfis very high level hdfi was not detected at any time step of ssfi however higher hdfis for each timestep of ssfi were detected in sec and north of mdb furthermore we also addressed changing of hydrological drought frequency and duration over the last decades as given in table 6 most of the step changes of streamflow were observed in the mid 1990 s which is well known prolonged drought millennium drought or big dry murphy and timbal 2008 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 that affected southeast australia we therefore compared the numbers of total drought moderate severe extreme events before and after 1990 to depict changes in hydrological drought characteristics for this goal we selected nine streamflow gauges which had the longest more than 60 years data length to investigate changes in frequency and the results are summarized in table c2 average standard deviation results illustrated that 55 10 51 5 50 7 52 6 57 7 and 66 16 of total droughts occurred after 1990 based on 3 6 9 12 24 36 month ssfis respectively similarly longer hydrological drought duration in southeast australia was experienced based on the selected nine streamflow stations after 1990 see table c3 forootan et al 2019 found that hydrological droughts in australia between 2006 and 2011 were highly correlated with the iod and the enso climate drivers where wang et al 2021 noted that the impact of iod was stronger than el nino on hydrological drought with comparison of 2006 2009 and 2018 2020 droughts besides we know that four major climate drivers sam enso iod and ipo influence droughts in south eastern australia csiro 2010 however droughts characteristics due to climate drivers may not be similar in terms of magnitude severity spatial distribution and so on verdon kidd and kiem 2009 maximum hydrological drought quantities such as magnitude duration and intensity severity were detected mainly after 2000 at different accumulated periods and detected maximum hydrological drought quantities are listed in table c4 with drought onset and end 4 4 comparison of meteorological and hydrological drought indices the pearson correlation coefficient was computed between drought indices at different timesteps from 3 to 36 month for better inter comparison and to find the most appropriate accumulation period between spi edi and ssfi for this purpose the closest five streamflow and rainfall stations were selected with average 5 km distance in order to apply correlation analysis these are referred to as paired stations fig 12a depicts correlation coefficient between spi and ssfi at five paired stations it is clear that the least correlation was detected at 3 month timestep 0 45 rp 0 82 and the coefficient of correlation showed an increasing trend with time till 24 month accumulation period 0 63 rp 0 89 after 24 month timestep correlation coefficient was found to be increasing or decreasing at 36 month timestep it should be noted that high correlation of 36 month accumulation period is not meaningful since long term calculation of spis or ssfi longer than 24 month fitting a distribution might be biased due to the limitation of data length mishra and singh 2010 the correlation between the spi and ssfi values at three different time steps 12 24 36 month is depicted by drought severity time steps in fig c1 and scatter plots of these with confidence ellipse are shown in fig c2 the least correlation coefficients at six different timesteps among five paired stations were found for 422002 48015 streamflow gauge rainfall gauge 0 45 rp 0 63 located in semi arid climatic zone region 2 one of the main reasons of this low correlation compared to other cases might be dry climate for this reason there are too many zero rainfall values in a particular season and the computed spi values for short timesteps may not be normally distributed mishra and singh 2010 furthermore due to the lack of soil moisture harsh geology and reduced groundwater discharge may not replenish enough water for streamflow it was also found from regression analysis that geology was one of the main factors affecting hydrological droughts vogel and kroll 1992 van loon and laaha 2015 therefore long term calculation of ssfi might be highly skewed and might not be well fitted by the gamma distribution li et al 2018 investigated connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts in a semi arid basin of yellow river china and found that pearson s correlation between standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and ssfi from one to 12 month timesteps was found to be relatively low rp 0 6 similar to our findings furthermore torabi haghighi et al 2020 found that pearson s correlation coefficient between spi and sri from 1 to 24 month timesteps was less than 0 5 due to low precipitation and large evapotranspiration edi on the other hand showed a decreasing correlation coefficient with hydrological drought index ssfi fig 12b as time increased which is expected since edi has a high dissimilarity level from 6 to 12 month spi dogan et al 2012 and this similarity decreases after 9 month jain et al 2015 wable et al 2019 however edi had a higher correlation 0 58 rp 0 84 than spi at 3 month timestep 0 45 rp 0 82 with ssfi for all the five paired stations especially in arid regions this finding shows that edi is capable to identify short term hydrological drought better than spi similar to our findings dogan et al 2012 also found that edi is preferable to monitor meteorological drought in arid semi arid regions besides we suggest that edi and spi might be used jointly to establish short term hydrological drought for an early drought warning in semi arid regions furthermore combining and comparing different drought indices could help investigate correlation between them characterize droughts explore the accuracy and sensitivity of drought indices and to delve into how well they cohere with each other in the context of a specific objective guttman 1998 szalai et al 2000 wu et al 2001 morid et al 2006 paulo and pereira 2006 smakhtin and hughes 2007 pandey et al 2008 dogan et al 2012 in addition to pearson s correlation coefficient we tested spearman s rank correlation for the same paired stations to find the best accumulation period and we found consistent results to pearson s correlation for both spi ssfi and edi ssfi fig c3 4 5 propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought table 8 presents the drought propagation time dpt with their duration magnitude intensity and interarrival time at a paired station 206025 56065 at 36 month timestep it should be noted that only matched meteorological and hydrological drought events were identified by run theory as shown in table 8 dpt is the lag time between the onset of hydrological drought and that of meteorological one for instance meteorological drought initiated in february 1993 and hydrological drought started in july 1993 therefore dpt which is lag time was found as 5 months for station 206025 table 8 it means that it takes about 5 months for the deficit of rainfall to be manifested in streamflow table 9 summarizes the list of hydrological and meteorological droughts along with their corresponding mean duration magnitude and interarrival times the interarrival time of drought events is defined as the period of time from the initiation of a drought to the onset of a next drought event see fig 3 the return period or recurrence interval of a hydrological drought can be considered as the average interarrival time of hydrological droughts with a certain magnitude or greater haan 1977 shiau and shen 2001 it should be noted that meteorological data set was paired with hydrological data set therefore meteorological drought characteristics in table 9 show pair wise comparison with hydrological drought time period meteorological droughts were most frequent than hydrological droughts hydrological droughts had longer durations and magnitudes than meteorological droughts despite the fact that we expect increasing dpt with time accumulation period but we could not find direct increasing dpt link with accumulation period after 12 month we found increasing or decreasing dpt mainly after the 12 month accumulation period since hydrological drought does not show a linear response to meteorological drought wu et al 2017 however mostly increasing dpt from meteorological to hydrological drought was found with time between 3 and 12 months not shown wu et al 2021 analyzed drought propagation time for 1 3 and 12 month timesteps in three sub basins located in southern china with three hydrometric stations and they found that propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought increased as time step increased although there is a strong linkage between meteorological drought and hydrological drought it is challenging to generalize dpt due to the complexity of the nature of drought response sensitivity of hydrological drought from meteorological one can be different due to the impacts of other variables such as soil moisture evaporation temperature humidity catchment characteristics and human activities for instance dpt from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was estimated by some researchers edossa et al 2010 liu et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 wu et al 2017 and their findings varied from 0 46 to 13 one of the main reasons for different estimated dpts is climatic variability as an illustration short response time for dpt is expected in the humid region whereas arid and semi arid regions show longer response time of the hydrological process barker et al 2016 all in all by considering the aforementioned limitations dpt can be computed by theory of run for regional water resources management and drought forecasting in the study area 5 conclusions the meteorological drought hazard can be identified by applying thiessen polygons voronoi diagrams as a conceptual index dhi which depicts the probability of drought and its severity in a non dimensional spatial extent furthermore the drought frequency index dfi can be estimated by associating the number of drought occurrences and length of time series spatial interpolation can then be used to identify zones that are vulnerable to drought regional assessment of mdfi shows that region 3 temperate which has the highest annual average rainfall considering the whole study area had the topmost level mdfi for any timestep spi and edi compared to region 1 arid and region 2 semi arid therefore it is challenging to propose a relationship between rainfall distribution and potential drought zone hydrological dfi hdfi results show that high level hdfi was found at 3 and 6 month timesteps of ssfi consequently higher hdfis for each timestep of ssfi were detected in the south east coast and north of murray darling basin the major findings of this study are noted below 1 overall the south and coastal zones of southeast australia were detected as the most drought prone regions based on dhi whereas higher level meteorological dfi mdfi were detected mainly in the east coast and southwest parts of the study area 2 decreasing abrupt change in annual total streamflow at 0 01 significance level was identified mainly in victoria the most dominant year of abrupt change was found to be 1996 maximum hydrological drought characteristics duration magnitude and intensity were found in the late 90 s and mostly 00 s based on 3 6 9 12 and 36 month ssfis the percentage of total hydrological drought events and the severity mostly increased after 1990 3 hydrological droughts were found to be increasing at 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 significance levels for all the selected timesteps of ssfi in southeast australia 4 pearson s correlation and spearman s rank correlation agreed that the highest correlation between spi and ssfi was found at 12 and 24 month accumulation periods correlations of 36 month timestep were found to be inconsistent due to the limitation of data length and climate variability 5 edi was found to be inadequate for long term hydrological drought on the other hand edi depicts a higher correlation on both pearson s and spearman s rank with 3 month ssfi compared to 3 month spi furthermore performance of edi with ssfi was found to be better than spi at 3 month timestep in semi arid regions therefore edi and spi can be used jointly in order to identify the onset of short term hydrological drought which could be convenient for an early warning system 6 due to the success of spi and ssfi s capability in defining drought onset drought propagation time dpt can be found from meteorological to hydrological drought by using the theory of runs however defined dpt cannot be directly applied to other regions since it is challenging to formulate or generalize dpt due to complexity of the nature of drought and catchment characteristics shorter timesteps of hydrological drought run into mostly shorter dpt and vice versa however response sensitivity of hydrological drought from meteorological drought can be different due to impacts of other variables such as soil moisture evaporation temperature humidity catchment characteristics and human activities overall dpt can be computed by the theory of runs for regional water resources management and drought forecasting in the southeast australia this study can be extended to identify drought risk in southeast australia by adding related vulnerability and exposure parameters besides this comprehensive analysis can bridge the existing gaps in the current drought research and would be useful to identify the most vulnerable sub areas to drought in order to help early drought warnings water resources management drought mitigation and drought action plan

7814,study region china study focus this study focuses on the continental scale spatiotemporal calibration of the blaney criddle equation bc for different climate zones in china daily meteorological data from 82 weather stations in china were collected for the periods of 1970 2004 and 2005 2014 respectively to calibrate and validate the bc model the coefficients of the bc model were spatially and temporally calibrated in different climate types via a linear regression method new hydrological insights for the region 1 performance of the quarterly calibrated bc model was the most satisfactory statistical indices were in the range of 0 449 0 797 mm d 1 for the mean absolute error 0 567 0 969 mm d 1 for the root mean square error and 0 82 0 953 for the index of agreement the accuracy ranges increased from 42 95 96 56 to 87 18 98 74 2 correction coefficient b and a for every quarter was mapped value of b showed a bell shaped consist with temperature while a showed an opposite trend the quarterly calibrated bc model provided satisfactory results in the temperate monsoon and temperate continental climate zones and 3 results indicated maximum temperature was the most influential factor for reference evapotranspiration et0 followed by minimum temperature this study provides a more accurate bc model to calculate et0 for different climate types in china and a reference for agricultural decision makers in irrigation areas that lack sufficient meteorological data graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatiotemporal analysis calibration and validation blaney criddle penman monteith model linear regression data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction with the rapid growth of the world population domestic and industrial water consumption continues to increase posing serious constraints on water resources for agricultural use in china how to improve the utilization of water resources while ensuring high crop yield is becoming increasingly important zhang et al 2019a traore et al 2020 calculating the reference evapotranspiration et0 is an important step in evaluating crop irrigation demand and formulating an irrigation system accurate et0 values are particularly important to agricultural decision makers landeras et al 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 chang et al 2019 pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b hafeez et al 2020 the penman monteith pm model has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations as a standard method for calculating the et0 because it is consistent with climatological and aerodynamic mechanisms allen et al 1998 the pm model has a physical basis and a wide range of applications however the pm model requires a large number of climate data types and involves a complex calculation procedure tao et al 2014 in many areas of the world especially in developing countries such meteorological data are not available therefore the simplified temperature based models such as the blaney criddle model the mccloud model the hargreaves samani model and the thornthwaite model are often used to calculate et0 in areas without complete meteorological data and weather stations xu 2009 these simplified models can be used to calculate et0 and design irrigation systems in areas with imperfect meteorological observation data liu et al 2003 2006 shi et al 2006 the blaney criddle bc model proposed by blaney and criddle 1962 requires fewer parameters than other models is easy to use and can reflect the radiation conditions of a region because the estimation results of the original bc model in some areas are not close to the actual situation the calibrated bc model was more likely to be adjusted in some cases pan et al 2019 jagosz et al 2020 different optimization methods have been proposed to make the calculated values of the bc model closer to the standard values calculated by the pm model some studies have calculated et0 by replacing the average temperature in the bc model with the effective air temperature or the surface temperature improving the accuracy of et0 fooladmand and ahmadi 2009 abd el wahed and abd el mageed 2014 rahimikhoob and hosseinzadeh 2014 trajkovic et al 2000 found that the rbf network provided a better estimate of the b parameter in the calibration of the bc model the transition process from bc equation to pm equation was proposed by sammis et al 2011 and verified well zarei and mahmoudi 2021 by introducing the aridity index proposed by the united nations environmental programme and using the gee method backward generalized estimating equations and cluster analysis carried out calibration on monthly and seasonal scales respectively it has been pointed out that the revised bc equation is still an empirical model and that relevant coefficient should be recalculated to adapt to actual climate conditions in regions with large climatic differences significant research has been performed on the performance of bc model on the regional scale xu and singh 2001 xiong et al 2015 zarei et al 2015 juday et al 2011 suggested that the calibrated bc equation was successfully applied in high altitude semiarid areas of colorado tabari et al 2013 pointed out that the calibrated bc equation effectively reduced the bias in et0 in arid areas in iran several studies have evaluated the bc model in china xiong et al 2015 showed that the average r value of the monthly calibrated bc was 0 75 and that the monthly calibrated bc could be used as an effective method to predict daily et0 in east china tan et al 2021 concluded that the calibrated bc model significantly improved the accuracy of et0 forecast in jiangxi province these studies indicated that the calibrated bc model was applicable in a certain region or a single climate zone however its applicability at the whole continental scale in china is not clear there does seem to have been a systematic evaluation of the performance of the bc model in different climate zones across china bc model may perform differently by calibrating at different time scales mohawesh 2010 compared three calibration methods and found that the spatiotemporal calibration method with the month as a unit had the highest accuracy when calculating et0 in arid areas xue 2013 pointed out that in xinjiang variations in et0 calculated using the calibrated bc equation and the pm equation were consistent before may whereas the difference was larger after may in the emin irrigation district zhang and cong 2016 found that the average et0 values obtained by the pm equation and the calibrated bc equation were similar in the growing season from april to september in the hetao irrigation area of china the above studies may indicate that the calibration effect at the monthly scale and the growth period scale can meet the regional demand however the capability of the calibrated bc model at different time scales as well as the optimal time scale for the calibration of the bc model are unclear in china the main objectives of the study are therefore to 1 explore the performances of the annually quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations and select the optimal time scale 2 evaluate the capability of the calibrated bc equation in different climate zones in china 3 determine the main factors influencing the accuracy of the bc equation in china this study makes it easy for policy makers and nonprofessionals to use the bc model by providing a reference table of calibration coefficients for the model the spatially and temporally calibrated bc model offers an efficient and simple method to calculate et0 in areas that lack sufficient weather data 2 data and methods 2 1 study area meteorological data from 82 weather stations in different climate zones were collected from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn during the period 1970 2014 these data included latitude longitude maximum temperature minimum temperature mean air temperature tmax tmin tmean mean relative humidity rh wind speed at 10 m height and sunshine duration sd the data were measured following the surface meteorological observation administration china meteorological administration cma 2003 and have good quality and integrity liu and erda 2005 xu et al 2012 the daily data have also been checked by feng et al 2004 for homogeneity and consistency data quality was checked including climatic range check internal consistency check temporal consistency check and spatial consistency check based on the quality control of surface meteorological observational data china meteorological administration cma 2010 stations with a larger percentage of missing data include those that were established before or around 1960 and these are not used in the study after 1961 missing data are rare for all the stations chen et al 2010 based on the köppen system of climate classification china was divided into four climate zones in this study the temperate monsoon climate dfc zone the subtropical monsoon climate cwa zone the plateau mountain climate hg zone and the temperate continental climate dwa zone almorox et al 2015 yang et al 2019 because the dfc zone in china has a large latitude span and the cwa zone has a large longitude span these two climate zones were further subdivided to facilitate the use of our research results the 82 stations in the study area were divided into six different regions namely northeast china dfcn north china dfcs southeast china cwae southwest china cwaw west plateau region hgw and inner mongolia and xinjiang region dwai on the basis of climatic zoning and administrative zoning standards of china fig 1 the zoning standard basically follows the spatial scope of the physical geographical regionalization of china http www sinomaps com which divides the country into four natural regions north south northwest and qinghai tibet hu et al 2011 table 1 shows the meteorological data for each region to facilitate the study of the calibration effect in a typical area a representative station was selected in each region and the meteorological data of representative stations are shown in appendix table a 2 2 penman monteith model being the most commonly used equation and the standard equation for calculating et0 recommended by the fao the pm model was employed to calculate et0 in the study area its calculation involves the following equation allen et al 1998 1 ε τ 0 p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where ε τ 0 pm is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated by the pm model mm d 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure and temperature curve kpa 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d 1 t is the average temperature u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturated vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the saturated vapor pressure difference kpa γ is the hygrometer constant kpa 1 r n is the net radiation of crop canopy surface mj m2 d 1 in this study r n is obtained from solar and longwave radiation allen et al 1998 2 3 calibration of the bc model the bc equation blaney and criddle 1962 was proposed to estimate et0 based on the average temperature during the calculation period and the percentage of average daylight hours during the calculation period with respect to annual daylight hours the bc equation can be written as 2 e t 0 b c p 0 46 t 8 13 where et 0 bc is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated using the bc model mm d 1 t is the average temperature c and p is the number of daylight hours on a given day as a percentage of the total number of daylight hours in a year the meteorological data from 1970 to 2014 were inputs into the pm and bc equations to calculate et0 pm and et0 bc respectively the calibration coefficients corresponding to each station were calculated using the least squares method and the specific steps of the calibrated bc equation were as follows 1 division into the calibration period and the validation period the meteorological data were divided into two samples in a chronological order with the meteorological data from 1970 to 2004 were used as the calibration period and the meteorological data from 2005 to 2014 were used as the validation period 2 calculation of et0 bc and et0 pm based on the daily meteorological data from 1970 to 2014 the bc and pm models were used to calculate et0 3 calibration of the bc model et0 pm was taken as the standard value and the least squares algorithm was run to generate the coefficients of the calibrated bc equation the annually quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations in each region were then obtained the bc equation was calibrated via linear regression and the equation after calibration can be written as follows 3 e t 0 b s a b e t 0 b c where ε τ 0 bs is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated using the calibrated bc model mm d 1 and a and b are the coefficients 2 4 statistical analysis the et0 calculated by original and calibrated bc model was compared with the et0 by pm model at different time scales to evaluate the performance of the calibrated bc equation the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse accuracy rate acce index of agreement d and correlation coefficient r were employed the mae was used to measure the deviation between the estimation and observed values the level of agreement between the estimation and observed values was measured using the rmse the degree of accuracy was defined as follows the percentage of days with an et0 error within 1 5 mm d 1 for the total days before and after calibration xiong et al 2015 the index of agreement d developed by willmott 1981 as a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error and varies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement at all willmott 1981 studies indicated that these statistical indices have proved useful in evaluating et0 sanford and selnick 2013 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 yang et al 2019 mobilia and longobardi 2021 the et0 value obtained using the fao56 pm model was regarded as the actual value of local et0 et0 pm 4 m a e i 1 n x i

method before and after calibration and y i represents the reference evapotranspiration obtained by the pm method x is the average values obtained by the bc method before and after calibration and y is the average value of the reference evapotranspiration obtained by the pm method n is amount of the value a point to note is that the square of the correlation coefficient or r2 is denoted as coefficient of determination and is also commonly used in statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing calibrated bc models annual quarterly and monthly calibrated bc models were used to calculate et0 during the period 1970 2014 the spatial distributions of mae and rmse in china using the annual fig 2a d g j quarterly fig 2b e h k and monthly fig 2c f i l calibrated bc method compared with those estimated using the pm method are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2m n the ranges of the original annual mae and rmse value were large and the values increased gradually from northwest to southeast the maximum mae and rmse occurred in the cwa zone and the minimum value occurred in the hg zone there were also a small number of high rmse values in the northeast area of the dwa zone therefore the et0 value calculated using the original bc model had a certain reference value in the hg zone while it was not applicable to the monsoon climate zone fig 2a d g j show the spatial distributions of the mae and rmse values after annual calibration the mae values decreased significantly after the annual calibration the mae range in the dfcn region the cwa zone and the northeast area of the dwa zone decreased significantly and only a few high values less than 1 5 mm d 1 were concentrated near the north china plain fig 2a the rmse values showed a decreasing trend in which the range of the rmse values in the cwa zone decreased significantly the change is greater than 0 5 mm d 1 those in the dfc zone decreased slightly and those in the other climate zones were nearly unchanged fig 2g j the annual calibrated bc equation performed well in the monsoon area but not in the other climate zones the annual calibrated bc equation improved the applicability of the method to the dfc and cwa zones however the original bc model applied well in the hg zone this indicates that the annually calibrated bc equation was applicable in certain regions which were significantly affected by monsoons fig 2b e h k showed the spatial distributions of the mae and rmse values after quarterly calibration the mae values showed a significant decreasing trend after the quarterly calibration and the range of the mae values in the dfc zone the cwa zone and the northeast area of the dwa zone decreased significantly with only a few high values less than 1 5 mm d 1 concentrated in the vicinity of the yunnan guizhou plateau fig 2b e the rmse values also displayed a significant decreasing trend and the range of rmse values in the dfc zone the cwa zone and the northeast area of the dwa zone decreased significantly the change is greater than 0 5 mm d 1 whereas the coverage area of low rmse values expanded significantly fig 2h k compared with the annual calibrated bc model index values of less than 1 0 mm d 1 covered a wider range in the quarterly calibrated bc model therefore it can be seen that et0 calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc equation was closer to et0 pm in the dfc cwa and dwa zones whereas the original bc model had higher applicability in the hg zone the quarterly calibrated bc equation performed better in china than the annual calibrated bc model especially in regions affected by monsoons and in temperate continental regions fig 2c f i l showed the spatial distributions of the mae and rmse values for monthly calibrated bc equation the mae and rmse values of the dfc zone the northeast dwa zone and the coastal areas of the cwa zone decreased significantly the mae and rmse values at the junction of the hg and cwa zones formed a small high value concentration area compared with the index values of the annually calibrated bc equation the range of index values less than 1 0 mm d 1 for the monthly calibrated bc equation was wider but the range of index values was huge and the application to the study area was undesirable it can be seen that the monthly calibrated bc equation optimized the applicability of the original bc model to a certain extent this equation was applicable in several regions of china especially in regions greatly affected by monsoons and temperate continental regions however the performance was not as stable as that of the quarterly calibrated bc model table 2 presents the annual mean values of mae rmse and acce for the original annual calibrated quarterly calibrated and monthly calibrated bc equations it also presents the variation of the index of agreement d the mae and rmse values decreased with calibration especially in the cwae zone where the mae a nd rmse values decreased by more than 1 0 mm d 1 these results are consistent with those of the existing studies xu et al 2012 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 the range of the original acce in the study area was 42 95 96 56 it was 87 38 98 29 after annual calibration 87 18 98 74 after the quarterly calibration and 80 85 97 78 after monthly calibration the mae and rmse values after quarterly calibration were slightly higher than those after annual calibration only in the cwaw zone meanwhile the mae values of the quarterly calibrated bc equation were slightly higher than those of the monthly calibrated bc equation in the dfcn and dwai zone the value of indicator d of quarterly calibration was slightly higher than those after monthly calibration in cwae cwaw and hgw zones the largest amount and percentage change for the calibration and validation periods are 0 093 0 098 12 7 and 13 3 respectively after quarterly calibration it could be seen from the amount of change and percentage change that monthly calibration was not as effective as quarterly calibration in most climate zones the performance of the quarterly calibrated bc model was superior and more stable than those of the other models table 2 also shows the change and the proportions of the change for each indicator of annual quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations compared with the et0 value of the original bc equation the mae and rmse values of the monthly validation period decreased by 40 31 and 41 31 respectively compared with the original values these percentages were higher than those of the hs equation after the monthly calibration 24 6 and 23 9 respectively zhu et al 2019 as clearly shown in table 2 the absolute change values of mae acce and d after quarterly calibration were the largest and the quarterly calibrated bc model performed best even though the variation in rmse after monthly calibration was the largest it was not very different from that after quarterly calibration this indicated that the stability of the bc model based on quarterly calibration was better than that of the model based on annual or monthly calibrations in china in conclusion the index of the quarterly calibrated bc equation significantly reduced indicating that the correction coefficients b and a of the quarterly calibrated bc equation calculated the et0 values closer to et0 pm in practical applications than other calibrations in other words the b and a coefficients reflected the influence of other non temperature meteorological factors on et0 which can be applied in practice and confirms the feasibility of the linear correction scheme of the bc equation for use in china table 3 lists the mae rmse and r annual average values of different zones before and after quarterly calibration the mae values of the original bc model had a range of 0 418 2 090 mm d 1 which were almost twice that of the quarterly calibrated bc model 0 245 1 023 mm d 1 the rmse range of the original bc model was 0 507 2 248 mm d 1 and that of the calibration and validation periods was 0 370 1 177 mm d 1 and 0 330 1 798 mm d 1 respectively after calibration the maximum mae and rmse values were 1 023 mm d 1 in the cwaw zone and 1 798 mm d 1 in the dfcs zone respectively the minimum mae and rmse values were 0 245 mm d 1 and 0 330 mm d 1 in the dfcn zone in the dfcn zone the minimum mae and rmse values occurred in spring the maximum values occurred in summer and the maximum variation was observed in autumn in the dfcs zone the minimum mae and rmse values occurred in winter and the maximum variation was observed in autumn the minimum mae and rmse values of the cwae and cwaw zones occurred in spring and winter respectively and the obvious changes in the index values after calibration were in summer autumn and winter the minimum mae and rmse values of hgw and dwai zones occurred in winter and spring and the index values decreased slightly over the year except for the cwae zone the maximum value of the calibrated r greater than 0 8 occurred in spring meanwhile the maximum value of r in the cwae zone occurred in autumn with a value of 0 698 except for the dfcn zone the minimum values of the calibrated r in other zones occurred in summer whereas the minimum value of r in the dfcn zone occurred in autumn with a value of 0 615 this is likely because of the high latitude of the dfcn zone where the temperature change is not obvious from july to september and the conditions are primarily affected by relative humidity and wind speed the mean values of r were the lowest in the cwae and cwaw zones likely because the subtropical tropical monsoon climate is influenced more by monsoon and coastal conditions from the above data analysis it can be seen that the quarterly bc formula determination plays an obvious role in autumn the index had the largest change the above data changes indicated that the calculated values of the quarterly calibrated bc model were closer to et0 pm than those of the original bc model in spring and winter and that the quarterly calibrated bc model improved the calculated accuracy of et0 in the dfc and cwa zones 3 2 coefficients of the quarterly calibrated bc model it is generally recommended to use the bc model to calculate et0 for a given month or season sammis et al 2011 local and seasonal calibrations and variations in the bc model are important for improving the accuracy of the model fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the b and a coefficients of the quarterly calibrated bc equation the range of the b correction coefficient of the quarterly calibrated bc method was from 0 186 to 2 045 and the range of a was from 6 982 to 1 487 the maximum value of the b coefficient was found in autumn in cwaw while the minimum value of b was found in spring in cwae the maximum value of the a coefficient was found in autumn in dfcs while the minimum value of a was found in autumn in cwae the value of b showed a bell shaped response to the temperature while the value of a showed an opposite trend with a v shaped response this finding agrees well with that of previous studies fooladmand and ahmadi 2009 mohawesh 2010 xiong et al 2015 this indicated that one of the most important sources of variation in the b and a coefficients were related to seasonality xiong et al 2015 the b and a coefficients were calculated for each quarter in all of the regions appendix table a2 results showed that the quarterly calibrated bc model had a higher fitting degree in the subtropical monsoon and plateau mountain climate zones 3 3 long series consistency analysis of et0 to a certain extent the quarterly calibrated bc equation can be used in areas that lack meteorological data representative stations were selected in each region to investigate the synchronization and fitting effect of the accuracy using the quarterly calibrated bc equation a comparison chart was made between the et0 values calculated using the bc model including the original value the calibrated value and the validated value and the et0 values calculated using the pm model during the period 1970 2014 as shown in fig 4 the range of the et0 values was the largest in the dfcn dfcs cwae and dwai zones with values primarily concentrated in the range of 0 8 mm d 1 the et0 values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model and the pm model were relatively synchronous in the dfcn dfcs hgw and dwai zones additionally there was a tendency to underestimate the values when using the calibrated bc model in the alternating times of summer and autumn in the cwaw zone furthermore the values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model tended to be slightly overestimated in the cwae zone in winter and spring this may be because the influences of relative humidity and the wind speed on et0 were ignored this is consistent with previous research findings xiong et al 2015 zhang and cong 2016 3 4 et0 fitting and analysis of influencing factors fig 5 shows a scatter plot of et0 calculated using the bc and pm equations for six typical meteorological stations for a period of over 45 years the et0 values of the calibration and validation periods of each station were concentrated in the range of 0 8 mm d 1 the original bc slope of the zero intercept regression line ranged from 1 101 to 1 415 with the maximum value appearing at hangzhou 1 415 and the minimum value appearing at gonghe 1 101 the slope range of the zero intercept regression line in the calibration period was 0 885 1 030 whereas that in the validation period was 0 835 1 103 the maximum appeared in baotou 1 103 and the minimum appeared in panxian 0 835 at mudanjiang fig 5a yiyuan fig 5b and hangzhou fig 5c the values in the calibration and validation periods were relatively evenly distributed on both sides of the y x line whereas the values of the original bc model were more scattered and mostly overestimated et0 the slope for panxian after quarterly calibration was less than 0 9 and the slopes during the calibration and validation periods were both greater than 0 8 indicating a good fit this indicated that the performance of the quarterly calibrated bc equation was best in the dfcn dfcs and cwae zones whereas the performance in the cwaw zone was mediocre therefore the accuracy needed to be improved the original bc equation in gonghe calculated that the et0 values were relatively evenly distributed on both sides of the y x line fig 5e the calibration performance in baotou was better than that of the validation period however the computational stability still needed to be improved it can be seen that the quarterly calibrated bc model performed well in the monsoon climate zone whereas the original bc model has higher accuracy in the hg and dwa zones there is a certain correlation between the effective performance of the bc model before and after quarterly calibration and the different types of climate zones as shown in figs 4 and 5 in the dfcn mudanjiang station and dfcs yiyuan station zones the calculated values of the calibrated bc model were closer to the standard values indicating that the calibrated bc model had an obvious applicability in the dfc zone in the cwae hangzhou station and cwaw panxian station subzones of the cwa zone the calculated value of the bc equation after calibration was closer to the standard value than the uncalibrated value however the accuracy still needed to be improved the performance of the bc equation in the hgw zone gonghe station changed little after calibration in the dwai zone baotou station the calculation accuracy of et0 was higher than that of the validation period statistical analysis indicated that the bc model was suitable for the dfcn dfcs cwae and dwai zones the better the fit the closer r2 is to 1 the r2 value of the calibrated bc model was not ideal in the cwaw zone and et0 tended to be underestimated in the alternating times of summer and autumn therefore more appropriate calculation methods are still needed additionally the accuracy of the original method was sufficient in the hgw zone generally the quarterly calibrated bc model had a good fit throughout china according to the above result the mean correlation coefficients calculated using the original bc equation and the pm equation were approximately 0 75 this is consistent with the study of xiong et al 2015 this is because the bc equation only considers the impact of temperature and radiation on et0 and ignores other meteorological factors many factors affect et0 including meteorological conditions and soil conditions by calculating the correlation coefficient between meteorological elements and et0 at all stations the average values of correlation coefficients at stations in each zone were used to show the relationship between meteorological elements and et0 in different zones the maximum daily temperature had the greatest influence on et0 followed by the minimum daily temperature the correlation coefficient r between the sunshine duration and et0 ranged from 0 09 to 0 32 that between relative humidity and et0 ranged from 0 19 to 0 28 that between wind speed and et0 ranged from 0 03 to 0 15 it can be seen that the wind speed had a reverse effect on et0 in the cwae zone this may be because of the large number of inland lakes and high air humidity in this zone the relative humidity had a positive effect on et0 in the dfc and hg zones this may be because of low latitudes and different geographical conditions in these zones the correlation between the calculated et0 values and the meteorological elements in each climate zones can be found in appendix table a3 4 conclusions in this study the coefficients of the bc model were corrected and the performance of the calibrated bc model was evaluated using meteorological observation data from 82 weather stations in different climatic regions in china the main conclusions are as follows 1 comparing the index values of annual quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations the performance of the bc equation was more satisfactory when using the quarterly calibration the quarterly calibrated bc model had a higher accuracy than the original bc model with the accuracy range increasing to 87 18 98 74 2 the et0 values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model and the pm model were relatively synchronous in most areas of china however the et0 value calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model tended to be underestimated in the cwaw zone and the et0 values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model tended to be overestimated in the cwae zone the quarterly calibrated bc model provided satisfactory results in the dfc and dwa zones 3 the maximum temperature was the most important factor influencing et0 followed by the minimum temperature additionally the relative humidity had a positive effect on et0 in the hg zone this may be because of different geographical conditions in this zone this study focused on the analysis of regional distributions at the continental scale to illustrate the applicability of the bc model in different climate regions in china the calibrated coefficient a and b of the bc model for different seasons in different climate zones in china were provided the coefficients given in different seasons in each region can help in the allocation of water resources at different stages of crop growth and the results of this study provide an important basis for calculating surface evapotranspiration under the condition of lack of data and therefore have a reference value for irrigation management it should be noted that this is also a calculation model which may be inadequate for some cases it would be therefore much more reliable to attempt to improve et0 accuracy based on actual lysimeter measurements future researches may focus on a systematic evaluation of the performance of the several temperature based models in different climate zones across china thus the most precise equation for et0 estimating for each climate region can be obtained credit authorship contribution statement lei

7814,study region china study focus this study focuses on the continental scale spatiotemporal calibration of the blaney criddle equation bc for different climate zones in china daily meteorological data from 82 weather stations in china were collected for the periods of 1970 2004 and 2005 2014 respectively to calibrate and validate the bc model the coefficients of the bc model were spatially and temporally calibrated in different climate types via a linear regression method new hydrological insights for the region 1 performance of the quarterly calibrated bc model was the most satisfactory statistical indices were in the range of 0 449 0 797 mm d 1 for the mean absolute error 0 567 0 969 mm d 1 for the root mean square error and 0 82 0 953 for the index of agreement the accuracy ranges increased from 42 95 96 56 to 87 18 98 74 2 correction coefficient b and a for every quarter was mapped value of b showed a bell shaped consist with temperature while a showed an opposite trend the quarterly calibrated bc model provided satisfactory results in the temperate monsoon and temperate continental climate zones and 3 results indicated maximum temperature was the most influential factor for reference evapotranspiration et0 followed by minimum temperature this study provides a more accurate bc model to calculate et0 for different climate types in china and a reference for agricultural decision makers in irrigation areas that lack sufficient meteorological data graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatiotemporal analysis calibration and validation blaney criddle penman monteith model linear regression data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction with the rapid growth of the world population domestic and industrial water consumption continues to increase posing serious constraints on water resources for agricultural use in china how to improve the utilization of water resources while ensuring high crop yield is becoming increasingly important zhang et al 2019a traore et al 2020 calculating the reference evapotranspiration et0 is an important step in evaluating crop irrigation demand and formulating an irrigation system accurate et0 values are particularly important to agricultural decision makers landeras et al 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 chang et al 2019 pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b hafeez et al 2020 the penman monteith pm model has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations as a standard method for calculating the et0 because it is consistent with climatological and aerodynamic mechanisms allen et al 1998 the pm model has a physical basis and a wide range of applications however the pm model requires a large number of climate data types and involves a complex calculation procedure tao et al 2014 in many areas of the world especially in developing countries such meteorological data are not available therefore the simplified temperature based models such as the blaney criddle model the mccloud model the hargreaves samani model and the thornthwaite model are often used to calculate et0 in areas without complete meteorological data and weather stations xu 2009 these simplified models can be used to calculate et0 and design irrigation systems in areas with imperfect meteorological observation data liu et al 2003 2006 shi et al 2006 the blaney criddle bc model proposed by blaney and criddle 1962 requires fewer parameters than other models is easy to use and can reflect the radiation conditions of a region because the estimation results of the original bc model in some areas are not close to the actual situation the calibrated bc model was more likely to be adjusted in some cases pan et al 2019 jagosz et al 2020 different optimization methods have been proposed to make the calculated values of the bc model closer to the standard values calculated by the pm model some studies have calculated et0 by replacing the average temperature in the bc model with the effective air temperature or the surface temperature improving the accuracy of et0 fooladmand and ahmadi 2009 abd el wahed and abd el mageed 2014 rahimikhoob and hosseinzadeh 2014 trajkovic et al 2000 found that the rbf network provided a better estimate of the b parameter in the calibration of the bc model the transition process from bc equation to pm equation was proposed by sammis et al 2011 and verified well zarei and mahmoudi 2021 by introducing the aridity index proposed by the united nations environmental programme and using the gee method backward generalized estimating equations and cluster analysis carried out calibration on monthly and seasonal scales respectively it has been pointed out that the revised bc equation is still an empirical model and that relevant coefficient should be recalculated to adapt to actual climate conditions in regions with large climatic differences significant research has been performed on the performance of bc model on the regional scale xu and singh 2001 xiong et al 2015 zarei et al 2015 juday et al 2011 suggested that the calibrated bc equation was successfully applied in high altitude semiarid areas of colorado tabari et al 2013 pointed out that the calibrated bc equation effectively reduced the bias in et0 in arid areas in iran several studies have evaluated the bc model in china xiong et al 2015 showed that the average r value of the monthly calibrated bc was 0 75 and that the monthly calibrated bc could be used as an effective method to predict daily et0 in east china tan et al 2021 concluded that the calibrated bc model significantly improved the accuracy of et0 forecast in jiangxi province these studies indicated that the calibrated bc model was applicable in a certain region or a single climate zone however its applicability at the whole continental scale in china is not clear there does seem to have been a systematic evaluation of the performance of the bc model in different climate zones across china bc model may perform differently by calibrating at different time scales mohawesh 2010 compared three calibration methods and found that the spatiotemporal calibration method with the month as a unit had the highest accuracy when calculating et0 in arid areas xue 2013 pointed out that in xinjiang variations in et0 calculated using the calibrated bc equation and the pm equation were consistent before may whereas the difference was larger after may in the emin irrigation district zhang and cong 2016 found that the average et0 values obtained by the pm equation and the calibrated bc equation were similar in the growing season from april to september in the hetao irrigation area of china the above studies may indicate that the calibration effect at the monthly scale and the growth period scale can meet the regional demand however the capability of the calibrated bc model at different time scales as well as the optimal time scale for the calibration of the bc model are unclear in china the main objectives of the study are therefore to 1 explore the performances of the annually quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations and select the optimal time scale 2 evaluate the capability of the calibrated bc equation in different climate zones in china 3 determine the main factors influencing the accuracy of the bc equation in china this study makes it easy for policy makers and nonprofessionals to use the bc model by providing a reference table of calibration coefficients for the model the spatially and temporally calibrated bc model offers an efficient and simple method to calculate et0 in areas that lack sufficient weather data 2 data and methods 2 1 study area meteorological data from 82 weather stations in different climate zones were collected from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn during the period 1970 2014 these data included latitude longitude maximum temperature minimum temperature mean air temperature tmax tmin tmean mean relative humidity rh wind speed at 10 m height and sunshine duration sd the data were measured following the surface meteorological observation administration china meteorological administration cma 2003 and have good quality and integrity liu and erda 2005 xu et al 2012 the daily data have also been checked by feng et al 2004 for homogeneity and consistency data quality was checked including climatic range check internal consistency check temporal consistency check and spatial consistency check based on the quality control of surface meteorological observational data china meteorological administration cma 2010 stations with a larger percentage of missing data include those that were established before or around 1960 and these are not used in the study after 1961 missing data are rare for all the stations chen et al 2010 based on the köppen system of climate classification china was divided into four climate zones in this study the temperate monsoon climate dfc zone the subtropical monsoon climate cwa zone the plateau mountain climate hg zone and the temperate continental climate dwa zone almorox et al 2015 yang et al 2019 because the dfc zone in china has a large latitude span and the cwa zone has a large longitude span these two climate zones were further subdivided to facilitate the use of our research results the 82 stations in the study area were divided into six different regions namely northeast china dfcn north china dfcs southeast china cwae southwest china cwaw west plateau region hgw and inner mongolia and xinjiang region dwai on the basis of climatic zoning and administrative zoning standards of china fig 1 the zoning standard basically follows the spatial scope of the physical geographical regionalization of china http www sinomaps com which divides the country into four natural regions north south northwest and qinghai tibet hu et al 2011 table 1 shows the meteorological data for each region to facilitate the study of the calibration effect in a typical area a representative station was selected in each region and the meteorological data of representative stations are shown in appendix table a 2 2 penman monteith model being the most commonly used equation and the standard equation for calculating et0 recommended by the fao the pm model was employed to calculate et0 in the study area its calculation involves the following equation allen et al 1998 1 ε τ 0 p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where ε τ 0 pm is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated by the pm model mm d 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure and temperature curve kpa 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d 1 t is the average temperature u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturated vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the saturated vapor pressure difference kpa γ is the hygrometer constant kpa 1 r n is the net radiation of crop canopy surface mj m2 d 1 in this study r n is obtained from solar and longwave radiation allen et al 1998 2 3 calibration of the bc model the bc equation blaney and criddle 1962 was proposed to estimate et0 based on the average temperature during the calculation period and the percentage of average daylight hours during the calculation period with respect to annual daylight hours the bc equation can be written as 2 e t 0 b c p 0 46 t 8 13 where et 0 bc is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated using the bc model mm d 1 t is the average temperature c and p is the number of daylight hours on a given day as a percentage of the total number of daylight hours in a year the meteorological data from 1970 to 2014 were inputs into the pm and bc equations to calculate et0 pm and et0 bc respectively the calibration coefficients corresponding to each station were calculated using the least squares method and the specific steps of the calibrated bc equation were as follows 1 division into the calibration period and the validation period the meteorological data were divided into two samples in a chronological order with the meteorological data from 1970 to 2004 were used as the calibration period and the meteorological data from 2005 to 2014 were used as the validation period 2 calculation of et0 bc and et0 pm based on the daily meteorological data from 1970 to 2014 the bc and pm models were used to calculate et0 3 calibration of the bc model et0 pm was taken as the standard value and the least squares algorithm was run to generate the coefficients of the calibrated bc equation the annually quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations in each region were then obtained the bc equation was calibrated via linear regression and the equation after calibration can be written as follows 3 e t 0 b s a b e t 0 b c where ε τ 0 bs is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated using the calibrated bc model mm d 1 and a and b are the coefficients 2 4 statistical analysis the et0 calculated by original and calibrated bc model was compared with the et0 by pm model at different time scales to evaluate the performance of the calibrated bc equation the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse accuracy rate acce index of agreement d and correlation coefficient r were employed the mae was used to measure the deviation between the estimation and observed values the level of agreement between the estimation and observed values was measured using the rmse the degree of accuracy was defined as follows the percentage of days with an et0 error within 1 5 mm d 1 for the total days before and after calibration xiong et al 2015 the index of agreement d developed by willmott 1981 as a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error and varies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement at all willmott 1981 studies indicated that these statistical indices have proved useful in evaluating et0 sanford and selnick 2013 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 yang et al 2019 mobilia and longobardi 2021 the et0 value obtained using the fao56 pm model was regarded as the actual value of local et0 et0 pm 4 m a e i 1 n x i

method before and after calibration and y i represents the reference evapotranspiration obtained by the pm method x is the average values obtained by the bc method before and after calibration and y is the average value of the reference evapotranspiration obtained by the pm method n is amount of the value a point to note is that the square of the correlation coefficient or r2 is denoted as coefficient of determination and is also commonly used in statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing calibrated bc models annual quarterly and monthly calibrated bc models were used to calculate et0 during the period 1970 2014 the spatial distributions of mae and rmse in china using the annual fig 2a d g j quarterly fig 2b e h k and monthly fig 2c f i l calibrated bc method compared with those estimated using the pm method are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2m n the ranges of the original annual mae and rmse value were large and the values increased gradually from northwest to southeast the maximum mae and rmse occurred in the cwa zone and the minimum value occurred in the hg zone there were also a small number of high rmse values in the northeast area of the dwa zone therefore the et0 value calculated using the original bc model had a certain reference value in the hg zone while it was not applicable to the monsoon climate zone fig 2a d g j show the spatial distributions of the mae and rmse values after annual calibration the mae values decreased significantly after the annual calibration the mae range in the dfcn region the cwa zone and the northeast area of the dwa zone decreased significantly and only a few high values less than 1 5 mm d 1 were concentrated near the north china plain fig 2a the rmse values showed a decreasing trend in which the range of the rmse values in the cwa zone decreased significantly the change is greater than 0 5 mm d 1 those in the dfc zone decreased slightly and those in the other climate zones were nearly unchanged fig 2g j the annual calibrated bc equation performed well in the monsoon area but not in the other climate zones the annual calibrated bc equation improved the applicability of the method to the dfc and cwa zones however the original bc model applied well in the hg zone this indicates that the annually calibrated bc equation was applicable in certain regions which were significantly affected by monsoons fig 2b e h k showed the spatial distributions of the mae and rmse values after quarterly calibration the mae values showed a significant decreasing trend after the quarterly calibration and the range of the mae values in the dfc zone the cwa zone and the northeast area of the dwa zone decreased significantly with only a few high values less than 1 5 mm d 1 concentrated in the vicinity of the yunnan guizhou plateau fig 2b e the rmse values also displayed a significant decreasing trend and the range of rmse values in the dfc zone the cwa zone and the northeast area of the dwa zone decreased significantly the change is greater than 0 5 mm d 1 whereas the coverage area of low rmse values expanded significantly fig 2h k compared with the annual calibrated bc model index values of less than 1 0 mm d 1 covered a wider range in the quarterly calibrated bc model therefore it can be seen that et0 calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc equation was closer to et0 pm in the dfc cwa and dwa zones whereas the original bc model had higher applicability in the hg zone the quarterly calibrated bc equation performed better in china than the annual calibrated bc model especially in regions affected by monsoons and in temperate continental regions fig 2c f i l showed the spatial distributions of the mae and rmse values for monthly calibrated bc equation the mae and rmse values of the dfc zone the northeast dwa zone and the coastal areas of the cwa zone decreased significantly the mae and rmse values at the junction of the hg and cwa zones formed a small high value concentration area compared with the index values of the annually calibrated bc equation the range of index values less than 1 0 mm d 1 for the monthly calibrated bc equation was wider but the range of index values was huge and the application to the study area was undesirable it can be seen that the monthly calibrated bc equation optimized the applicability of the original bc model to a certain extent this equation was applicable in several regions of china especially in regions greatly affected by monsoons and temperate continental regions however the performance was not as stable as that of the quarterly calibrated bc model table 2 presents the annual mean values of mae rmse and acce for the original annual calibrated quarterly calibrated and monthly calibrated bc equations it also presents the variation of the index of agreement d the mae and rmse values decreased with calibration especially in the cwae zone where the mae a nd rmse values decreased by more than 1 0 mm d 1 these results are consistent with those of the existing studies xu et al 2012 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 the range of the original acce in the study area was 42 95 96 56 it was 87 38 98 29 after annual calibration 87 18 98 74 after the quarterly calibration and 80 85 97 78 after monthly calibration the mae and rmse values after quarterly calibration were slightly higher than those after annual calibration only in the cwaw zone meanwhile the mae values of the quarterly calibrated bc equation were slightly higher than those of the monthly calibrated bc equation in the dfcn and dwai zone the value of indicator d of quarterly calibration was slightly higher than those after monthly calibration in cwae cwaw and hgw zones the largest amount and percentage change for the calibration and validation periods are 0 093 0 098 12 7 and 13 3 respectively after quarterly calibration it could be seen from the amount of change and percentage change that monthly calibration was not as effective as quarterly calibration in most climate zones the performance of the quarterly calibrated bc model was superior and more stable than those of the other models table 2 also shows the change and the proportions of the change for each indicator of annual quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations compared with the et0 value of the original bc equation the mae and rmse values of the monthly validation period decreased by 40 31 and 41 31 respectively compared with the original values these percentages were higher than those of the hs equation after the monthly calibration 24 6 and 23 9 respectively zhu et al 2019 as clearly shown in table 2 the absolute change values of mae acce and d after quarterly calibration were the largest and the quarterly calibrated bc model performed best even though the variation in rmse after monthly calibration was the largest it was not very different from that after quarterly calibration this indicated that the stability of the bc model based on quarterly calibration was better than that of the model based on annual or monthly calibrations in china in conclusion the index of the quarterly calibrated bc equation significantly reduced indicating that the correction coefficients b and a of the quarterly calibrated bc equation calculated the et0 values closer to et0 pm in practical applications than other calibrations in other words the b and a coefficients reflected the influence of other non temperature meteorological factors on et0 which can be applied in practice and confirms the feasibility of the linear correction scheme of the bc equation for use in china table 3 lists the mae rmse and r annual average values of different zones before and after quarterly calibration the mae values of the original bc model had a range of 0 418 2 090 mm d 1 which were almost twice that of the quarterly calibrated bc model 0 245 1 023 mm d 1 the rmse range of the original bc model was 0 507 2 248 mm d 1 and that of the calibration and validation periods was 0 370 1 177 mm d 1 and 0 330 1 798 mm d 1 respectively after calibration the maximum mae and rmse values were 1 023 mm d 1 in the cwaw zone and 1 798 mm d 1 in the dfcs zone respectively the minimum mae and rmse values were 0 245 mm d 1 and 0 330 mm d 1 in the dfcn zone in the dfcn zone the minimum mae and rmse values occurred in spring the maximum values occurred in summer and the maximum variation was observed in autumn in the dfcs zone the minimum mae and rmse values occurred in winter and the maximum variation was observed in autumn the minimum mae and rmse values of the cwae and cwaw zones occurred in spring and winter respectively and the obvious changes in the index values after calibration were in summer autumn and winter the minimum mae and rmse values of hgw and dwai zones occurred in winter and spring and the index values decreased slightly over the year except for the cwae zone the maximum value of the calibrated r greater than 0 8 occurred in spring meanwhile the maximum value of r in the cwae zone occurred in autumn with a value of 0 698 except for the dfcn zone the minimum values of the calibrated r in other zones occurred in summer whereas the minimum value of r in the dfcn zone occurred in autumn with a value of 0 615 this is likely because of the high latitude of the dfcn zone where the temperature change is not obvious from july to september and the conditions are primarily affected by relative humidity and wind speed the mean values of r were the lowest in the cwae and cwaw zones likely because the subtropical tropical monsoon climate is influenced more by monsoon and coastal conditions from the above data analysis it can be seen that the quarterly bc formula determination plays an obvious role in autumn the index had the largest change the above data changes indicated that the calculated values of the quarterly calibrated bc model were closer to et0 pm than those of the original bc model in spring and winter and that the quarterly calibrated bc model improved the calculated accuracy of et0 in the dfc and cwa zones 3 2 coefficients of the quarterly calibrated bc model it is generally recommended to use the bc model to calculate et0 for a given month or season sammis et al 2011 local and seasonal calibrations and variations in the bc model are important for improving the accuracy of the model fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the b and a coefficients of the quarterly calibrated bc equation the range of the b correction coefficient of the quarterly calibrated bc method was from 0 186 to 2 045 and the range of a was from 6 982 to 1 487 the maximum value of the b coefficient was found in autumn in cwaw while the minimum value of b was found in spring in cwae the maximum value of the a coefficient was found in autumn in dfcs while the minimum value of a was found in autumn in cwae the value of b showed a bell shaped response to the temperature while the value of a showed an opposite trend with a v shaped response this finding agrees well with that of previous studies fooladmand and ahmadi 2009 mohawesh 2010 xiong et al 2015 this indicated that one of the most important sources of variation in the b and a coefficients were related to seasonality xiong et al 2015 the b and a coefficients were calculated for each quarter in all of the regions appendix table a2 results showed that the quarterly calibrated bc model had a higher fitting degree in the subtropical monsoon and plateau mountain climate zones 3 3 long series consistency analysis of et0 to a certain extent the quarterly calibrated bc equation can be used in areas that lack meteorological data representative stations were selected in each region to investigate the synchronization and fitting effect of the accuracy using the quarterly calibrated bc equation a comparison chart was made between the et0 values calculated using the bc model including the original value the calibrated value and the validated value and the et0 values calculated using the pm model during the period 1970 2014 as shown in fig 4 the range of the et0 values was the largest in the dfcn dfcs cwae and dwai zones with values primarily concentrated in the range of 0 8 mm d 1 the et0 values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model and the pm model were relatively synchronous in the dfcn dfcs hgw and dwai zones additionally there was a tendency to underestimate the values when using the calibrated bc model in the alternating times of summer and autumn in the cwaw zone furthermore the values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model tended to be slightly overestimated in the cwae zone in winter and spring this may be because the influences of relative humidity and the wind speed on et0 were ignored this is consistent with previous research findings xiong et al 2015 zhang and cong 2016 3 4 et0 fitting and analysis of influencing factors fig 5 shows a scatter plot of et0 calculated using the bc and pm equations for six typical meteorological stations for a period of over 45 years the et0 values of the calibration and validation periods of each station were concentrated in the range of 0 8 mm d 1 the original bc slope of the zero intercept regression line ranged from 1 101 to 1 415 with the maximum value appearing at hangzhou 1 415 and the minimum value appearing at gonghe 1 101 the slope range of the zero intercept regression line in the calibration period was 0 885 1 030 whereas that in the validation period was 0 835 1 103 the maximum appeared in baotou 1 103 and the minimum appeared in panxian 0 835 at mudanjiang fig 5a yiyuan fig 5b and hangzhou fig 5c the values in the calibration and validation periods were relatively evenly distributed on both sides of the y x line whereas the values of the original bc model were more scattered and mostly overestimated et0 the slope for panxian after quarterly calibration was less than 0 9 and the slopes during the calibration and validation periods were both greater than 0 8 indicating a good fit this indicated that the performance of the quarterly calibrated bc equation was best in the dfcn dfcs and cwae zones whereas the performance in the cwaw zone was mediocre therefore the accuracy needed to be improved the original bc equation in gonghe calculated that the et0 values were relatively evenly distributed on both sides of the y x line fig 5e the calibration performance in baotou was better than that of the validation period however the computational stability still needed to be improved it can be seen that the quarterly calibrated bc model performed well in the monsoon climate zone whereas the original bc model has higher accuracy in the hg and dwa zones there is a certain correlation between the effective performance of the bc model before and after quarterly calibration and the different types of climate zones as shown in figs 4 and 5 in the dfcn mudanjiang station and dfcs yiyuan station zones the calculated values of the calibrated bc model were closer to the standard values indicating that the calibrated bc model had an obvious applicability in the dfc zone in the cwae hangzhou station and cwaw panxian station subzones of the cwa zone the calculated value of the bc equation after calibration was closer to the standard value than the uncalibrated value however the accuracy still needed to be improved the performance of the bc equation in the hgw zone gonghe station changed little after calibration in the dwai zone baotou station the calculation accuracy of et0 was higher than that of the validation period statistical analysis indicated that the bc model was suitable for the dfcn dfcs cwae and dwai zones the better the fit the closer r2 is to 1 the r2 value of the calibrated bc model was not ideal in the cwaw zone and et0 tended to be underestimated in the alternating times of summer and autumn therefore more appropriate calculation methods are still needed additionally the accuracy of the original method was sufficient in the hgw zone generally the quarterly calibrated bc model had a good fit throughout china according to the above result the mean correlation coefficients calculated using the original bc equation and the pm equation were approximately 0 75 this is consistent with the study of xiong et al 2015 this is because the bc equation only considers the impact of temperature and radiation on et0 and ignores other meteorological factors many factors affect et0 including meteorological conditions and soil conditions by calculating the correlation coefficient between meteorological elements and et0 at all stations the average values of correlation coefficients at stations in each zone were used to show the relationship between meteorological elements and et0 in different zones the maximum daily temperature had the greatest influence on et0 followed by the minimum daily temperature the correlation coefficient r between the sunshine duration and et0 ranged from 0 09 to 0 32 that between relative humidity and et0 ranged from 0 19 to 0 28 that between wind speed and et0 ranged from 0 03 to 0 15 it can be seen that the wind speed had a reverse effect on et0 in the cwae zone this may be because of the large number of inland lakes and high air humidity in this zone the relative humidity had a positive effect on et0 in the dfc and hg zones this may be because of low latitudes and different geographical conditions in these zones the correlation between the calculated et0 values and the meteorological elements in each climate zones can be found in appendix table a3 4 conclusions in this study the coefficients of the bc model were corrected and the performance of the calibrated bc model was evaluated using meteorological observation data from 82 weather stations in different climatic regions in china the main conclusions are as follows 1 comparing the index values of annual quarterly and monthly calibrated bc equations the performance of the bc equation was more satisfactory when using the quarterly calibration the quarterly calibrated bc model had a higher accuracy than the original bc model with the accuracy range increasing to 87 18 98 74 2 the et0 values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model and the pm model were relatively synchronous in most areas of china however the et0 value calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model tended to be underestimated in the cwaw zone and the et0 values calculated using the quarterly calibrated bc model tended to be overestimated in the cwae zone the quarterly calibrated bc model provided satisfactory results in the dfc and dwa zones 3 the maximum temperature was the most important factor influencing et0 followed by the minimum temperature additionally the relative humidity had a positive effect on et0 in the hg zone this may be because of different geographical conditions in this zone this study focused on the analysis of regional distributions at the continental scale to illustrate the applicability of the bc model in different climate regions in china the calibrated coefficient a and b of the bc model for different seasons in different climate zones in china were provided the coefficients given in different seasons in each region can help in the allocation of water resources at different stages of crop growth and the results of this study provide an important basis for calculating surface evapotranspiration under the condition of lack of data and therefore have a reference value for irrigation management it should be noted that this is also a calculation model which may be inadequate for some cases it would be therefore much more reliable to attempt to improve et0 accuracy based on actual lysimeter measurements future researches may focus on a systematic evaluation of the performance of the several temperature based models in different climate zones across china thus the most precise equation for et0 estimating for each climate region can be obtained credit authorship contribution statement lei
