8600,mathematical stormwater models are often used as tools for planning and analysing urban drainage systems however the inherent uncertainties of the models must be properly understood in order to make optimal use of them one source of uncertainty that has received relatively little attention particularly for increasingly popular green areas as part of urban drainage systems is the mathematical model structure this paper analyses the differences between three different widely used models swmm mouse and mike she when simulating rainfall runoff from green areas over a 26 year period eleven different soil types and six different soil depths were used to investigate the sensitivity of the models to changes in both important hydrological factors such as seasonal runoff and evapotranspiration the number of events that generated runoff and the initial conditions for rainfall events varied significantly between the three models mouse generated the highest runoff volumes while it was rather insensitive to changes in soil type and depth mike she was mainly sensitive to changes in soil type swmm which generated the least runoff was sensitive to changes in both soil type and depth explanations for the observed differences were found in the descriptions of the mathematical models the differences in model outputs could significantly impact the conclusions from studies on the design or analysis of urban drainage systems the amount and frequency of runoff from green areas in all three models indicates that green areas cannot be simply ignored in urban drainage modelling studies keywords model structure uncertainty urban drainage green areas runoff infiltration stormwater models 1 introduction stormwater management is a challenge for cities around the world and has traditionally been addressed using pipe based drainage networks these networks are costly to construct and maintain and may potentially exacerbate flooding and water quality issues downstream green infrastructure attempts to solve these problems by managing stormwater in a more natural way see e g eckart et al 2017 fletcher et al 2013 effective and efficient design and operation require the ability to analyse and predict the performance of such green urban drainage systems this is often conducted using one of several simulation models available for urban drainage systems see e g elliott and trowsdale 2007 such models are always simplifications of reality which result in uncertainties associated with their use understanding the sources and describing the magnitude of these uncertainties is necessary if the models are to contribute to optimal management and design of stormwater systems e g deletic et al 2012 a lack of understanding could lead to either over dimensioned unnecessarily expensive drainage systems or under dimensioned systems that lead to flooding and damages uncertainties in urban drainage modelling arise from different sources that may be divided into three groups model input uncertainties calibration uncertainties and model structure uncertainties deletic et al 2012 the uncertainties related to input data and the calibration process have been studied to some extent albeit more extensively for traditional pipe based drainage systems than for green infrastructure dotto et al 2014 showed that calibration can to some extent compensate for measurement errors following developments in natural hydrology different methods for estimating parameter uncertainty have been applied to urban drainage modelling freni et al 2009 dotto et al 2012 including mathematically formal bayesian methods e g kleidorfer et al 2009 dotto et al 2011 2014 wani et al 2017 and mathematically informal methods such as glue e g thorndahl et al 2008 breinholt et al 2013 sun et al 2013 improvements in the calibration procedure have been proposed based on higher resolution input data krebs et al 2014 petrucci and bonhomme 2014 or a more systematic way of distinguishing the parameter sets that provide an acceptable match between simulated and observed values in order to estimate parametric uncertainty vezzaro et al 2013 despite this growing body of research on urban drainage modelling model structure uncertainty has received little attention although model results for green areas are sometimes compared e g infiltration models in duan et al 2011 most comparisons do not explicitly discuss the applied model structures a review by elliott trowsdale 2007 mainly describes the practical and technical differences between a number of common urban drainage models in terms of model uses temporal and spatial resolution runoff generation flow routing representation of low impact development facilities and user interface this review does not consider the differences between the conceptual models used by each of the models compare e g dhi 2017a rossman and huber 2016 understanding these differences and their implications is valuable for three reasons first these differences can be expected to give rise to differences in the results of modelling studies depending on which model is utilised it may be argued that models are usually calibrated to field measurements and that this will reduce or even eliminate the differences between their outcomes however this argument fails to consider that different calibrated models may predict similar outflow rates while diverging in other aspects of the water balance kaleris and langousis 2016 koch et al 2016 for urban drainage models specifically pipe leakage infiltration and misconnections may also affect the measured flow rates and these issues cannot be identified from outflow measurements alone such divergence could lead to conflicting outcomes if different models are used to forecast the performance of urban drainage systems for example examining the differences between various climate and or development scenarios see karlsson et al 2016 for an example of this in a natural catchment second model calibration is often performed by adjusting only a subset of model parameters based on a sensitivity analysis this kind of analysis is traditionally performed using one of the many experimental numerical techniques available but it could also benefit from an improved theoretical understanding of the ways in which different parameters affect the model results third models may be used to predict more extreme events than they were calibrated for and understanding the ways the model might react to more extreme rainfall input can help in understanding the uncertainty involved the three reasons outlined above equally apply to models of traditional and green urban drainage systems one of the aims of the increasing use of green infrastructure is to locally retain and store water for a longer period thus from a theoretical perspective models of such systems would also need to include slower in soil processes such as infiltration groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration fletcher et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 this was also demonstrated by davidsen et al 2018 although they only modelled infiltration capacity using horton s equation and did not consider the fate of the water after it had infiltrated the effect of including a more complete description of in soil processes more similar to descriptions used in models of natural hydrologic systems on urban runoff processes at a fine temporal and spatial resolution has not yet been studied extensively in addition to the theoretical considerations in the previous two paragraphs there are also experimental indications that model structure can play a significant role in urban drainage modelling studies fassman beck and saleh 2018 found that the epa storm water management model swmm displayed some counter intuitive behaviour when modelling a bioretention system for green roof modelling in swmm peng and stovin 2017 for example found that the green roof module requires further modifications leimgruber et al 2018 found that water balance components were insensitive to most parameters involved in the process which could mean that the model structure is unnecessarily complex and johannessen et al 2019 raised concerns about the large variability in calibrated model parameters and their non correspondence with material properties within runoff quality modelling the validity of traditional build up wash off models was shown to be limited to a subset of cases bonhomme and petrucci 2017 sandoval et al 2018 considering the above there are indications that model structure uncertainty could considerably impact modelling outcomes but it has received relatively limited attention in research on modelling green urban drainage thus this paper aims to further the understanding of model structure uncertainties in urban drainage models that specifically address green areas the research questions in this paper are 1 what is the impact of model structure on the predicted runoff and evapotranspiration in green plots with different soil textures and depths in an urban context 2 how can the differences between conceptual model structures be linked to differences in model results answering these questions could ultimately contribute to a better understanding and applicability of urban drainage models for green infrastructure 2 materials and methods 2 1 models the three models used in this paper were the storm water management model swmm version 5 1 011 u s environmental protection agency mouse rdii hereafter referred to as mouse release 2017 dhi danish hydrological institute and mike she hereafter referred to as she release 2017 dhi note that the pcswmm chi interface was used for initial setup of the model but the final model runs were performed with the standard epa swmm 5 1 011 executable a brief description of the conceptual models is given below and in fig 1 for additional details see the official documentation for each of the models an overview of all model parameters may be found in table 1 swmm and mouse are semi distributed models where the study area may be divided into subcatchments of arbitrary shape and size parameter values are set for each subcatchment she on the other hand is a fully distributed model that uses a regular rectilinear grid to divide the study area into a large number of cells and different parameter values can be assigned to each cell all three models contain three possible storage compartments for each catchment surface unsaturated zone uz and saturated zone sz storage the ways in which water is moved between these three storages and out of the catchment vary between the models all three models have methods to account for snowfall and snowmelt but since snow periods were not considered in this study these methods are not described here 2 1 1 swmm swmm rossman and huber 2016 conceptualizes each catchment as a single soil column that is divided into an unsaturated and a saturated zone by a variable groundwater level the surface storage is filled by precipitation supplied as a time series by the user and emptied by overland flow infiltration and evapotranspiration overland flow is described using manning s formula which for the case of overland flow in a catchment can be written as 1 q 1 n s 1 2 d 5 3 w where n is manning s coefficient which depends on the roughness of the surface including vegetation s is the slope of the surface d is the depth of the water and w the width of the flow in ideal cases as in this study w is simply the width of the catchment but in more complex cases it may be considered to be a flow routing parameter instead the water depth d is replenished by rainfall provided as input data to the model and reduced by surface runoff and infiltration for infiltration the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 was selected swmm also supports the horton and curve number methods this model assumes that initially all precipitation will infiltrate until a saturated layer develops at the top of the soil and the maximum infiltration rate becomes 2 f p k sat 1 ψ s θ d f where the infiltration rate fp is controlled by two soil hydraulic parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and suction head ψs the initial soil moisture deficit θ d at the start of the rainfall event and the cumulative infiltration volume f during the rainfall event as the soil becomes more saturated the infiltration rate asymptotically approaches the saturated hydraulic conductivity the rate of recovery of infiltration capacity during dry periods is calculated from 3 δ θ d k sat 75 θ dmax δ t where θ dmax is the maximum possible moisture deficit i e the difference between soil porosity and residual moisture content higher saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat leads to a faster recovery of infiltration capacity if rainfall occurs long enough after the previous rainfall the time is calculated as t r 4 5 k sat the initial moisture deficit θ d for the green ampt calculation is set to the unsaturated zone moisture content thus the recovery of infiltration capacity is initially based only on ksat but after sufficient time has elapsed it is affected by evapotranspiration and also by percolation from the unsaturated to the saturated zone from the unsaturated zone water can percolate to the saturated zone at a rate calculated from 4 f u k sat e θ s θ cur h c o where θ s is the maximum soil water content i e porosity θ cur is the current unsaturated zone soil water content and hco is a soil parameter representing the slope of the conductivity vs soil water content curve the percolation rate grows exponentially up to the value of ksat as the water content in the unsaturated zone increases water can drain from the saturated zone according to a linear reservoir equation which was used for consistency with mouse see section 2 2 evapotranspiration takes place initially from surface water and after this is depleted from both the unsaturated and saturated zone simultaneously a user supplied factor between 0 and 1 determines what fraction of potential evapotranspiration is assigned to the unsaturated zone with the remainder being assigned to the saturated zone in this study this factor was set based on the root zone depth according to shah et al 2007 their work provides values for the division of evapotranspiration between the saturated and unsaturated zones based on groundwater depth thus the average groundwater table from an initial swmm run was used to obtain an estimate of the upper zone evaporation factor uef this was then iterated until there were no further changes in the average groundwater table evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone takes place at the potential rate supplied as input data to the model evapotranspiration from the saturated zone is calculated using 5 f el 1 u e f e max del d u del where du is the groundwater depth and del is the groundwater depth below which evapotranspiration is disabled the potential evapotranspiration rate emax can either be provided by the user directly as in this study or calculated from temperature data using hargreaves s method 2 1 2 mouse in mouse each catchment consists of a surface storage with current storage u a root zone storage with current storage l and a saturated zone which is described by the depth of the phreatic surface below the ground level meaning that it is theoretically infinite in size the surface storage is filled by rain provided as time series by the user and emptied slowly by evapotranspiration and interflow 6 if ck if 1 l l max t if 1 t if u where if is interflow ckif is a user supplied coefficient the factor l lmax is the fraction of the root zone storage that is currently filled and tif is a threshold for l lmax below which interflow is disabled note that the value of l lmax can theoretically vary between 0 and 1 in contrast to the soil volumetric water content θ used by swmm which can vary only between the soil residual moisture content and the soil porosity since ckif has a typical value of 500 to 1000 h and the surface storage u is quite small interflow is usually also small water in the surface storage cannot infiltrate into the soil when surface water exceeds the maximum storage umax comparable to depression storage the excess precipitation pn is divided into overland flow groundwater recharge and infiltration into the unsaturated zone according to 7 of cq of l l max t of 1 t of p n 8 g p n o f l l max t g 1 t g 9 i p n o f g where of is overland flow g is groundwater recharge i is infiltration into the unsaturated zone cqof is a user supplied coefficient between 0 and 1 and tof and tg are threshold values which l lmax must exceed in order to activate overland flow and groundwater recharge respectively the values of of g and i are limited to positive values only higher values of l lmax indicate a more saturated root zone storage which increases overland flow and reduces infiltration into the root zone storage overland flow is routed through two consecutive identical linear reservoirs evapotranspiration is initially drawn from the surface storage at the potential evapotranspiration rate and then from the unsaturated zone according to 10 e a e p l l max where ea and ep are the actual and potential evapotranspiration rates respectively potential evapotranspiration rates are provided by the user there is no percolation from the unsaturated to the saturated zone but capillary flux does take place the opposite way the saturated zone acts as a linear reservoir generating groundwater outflow dhi 2017a 2 1 3 she mike she combines a number of physically based methods to describe hydrological processes overland flow is described by the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equations for 2d shallow water flow as part of this she uses manning s coefficient to describe the friction that the flow experiences from the surface in effect this means that she uses manning s equation like swmm however this equation is applied to each grid cell individually rather than on a catchment scale thus surface water depths and processes that depend on this e g infiltration can vary throughout the catchment area although not used in this study the user supplied precipitation rates can also vary throughout the catchment area water movement in the unsaturated zone including infiltration is described using the 1d richards equation which describes the vertical movement of water in the unsaturated zone it requires a description of how well the soil retains water in this study the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 was used for this 11 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where θ θ s and θ r are the current saturated and residual soil moisture content respectively ψ is the tension head i e the attractive force between water and soil particles calculated when she solves richards equation and α and n are soil specific parameters higher values of these parameters are associated with looser soils schaap et al 2001 water movement in the saturated zone is described using a 3d darcy method in its simplest form flow between two grid cells is calculated using 12 q δ h c where q is the flow rate δh is the difference in piezometric head i e the water level in unconfined aquifers as used in this study and c is the conductance in she the conductance is calculated from the saturated hydraulic conductivity parameter of the soil so the saturated zone flow is mainly controlled by this parameter as a boundary condition the groundwater level was fixed at the bottom of the soil profile on the downhill boundary and excess groundwater allowed to drain from the model at this point dhi 2017b 2 2 synthetic catchments in order to examine how the different models react to changes in soil type and depth the simulations combined eleven different soil types from the standard classification by the u s department of agriculture with six different depths 0 5 1 0 3 0 m for a total of 66 soil profiles the eleven soil types were numbered 01sand 02loamy sand 03sandy loam 04loam 05silt loam 06sandy clay loam 07clay loam 08silty clay loam 09sandy clay 10silty clay 11clay the soils are numbered in order of decreasing hydraulic conductivity however it should be noted that not all other soil hydrological properties follow the same pattern the depth of the soil is appended when referring to single soil profiles e g 11clay 3 0 for the 3 metre deep clay profile each soil profile is used for one catchment that is 240 m 240 m covered in grass with a 2 gradient in one direction for each soil profile parameters for all the models were set to typical values for the soils from literature and based on the models official documentation mouse dhi 2017a she dhi 2017b swmm rossman and huber 2016 the sources of the different parameter values are listed in table 1 while the actual parameter values can be found in table s1 in the supplementary information to this article generic parameter values for the groundwater reservoirs were not available so the parameter values for swmm and mouse were selected based on results from she starting with an empty catchment a she simulation for the saturated zone only was run with a constant rainfall rate and the groundwater outflow rate was obtained for each soil type the time constant of a linear reservoir with the same rainfall input was then calibrated to this groundwater outflow data and the resulting reservoir constant was implemented in both swmm and mouse although swmm supports more complex formulations of the groundwater reservoir these were not used in order to maintain a comparable setup in all three models in mouse overland flow and groundwater recharge only take place if the relative root zone moisture content l lmax is above a certain threshold value the reference manual states that the threshold values should reflect the degree of spatial variability in the catchment characteristics so that a small homogeneous catchment is expected to have larger threshold values than a large heterogeneous catchment dhi 2017a the catchments in this study are homogeneous however setting high values for the thresholds would result in the soil moisture having no impact on the infiltration capacity until the soil was very wet which we considered unrealistic instead the threshold values were set at 0 2 for overland flow and 0 4 for groundwater recharge so that in numerical experiments with constant rainfall the infiltration rate develops in the same way as in horton s infiltration model in addition mouse contains two flow routing time constants for overland flow and interflow respectively that lack a clear way of determining them except via calibration the overland flow constant was set so that the end of the runoff from mouse roughly matched the end of the runoff from swmm for one rainfall event the lack of a clear physical basis in this approach means that the shape of the surface runoff hydrograph cannot be compared directly however since only the runoff routing is affected and not the runoff generation total runoff volumes can still be compared 2 3 meteorological data the precipitation input is a 26 year rain and snow record from trondheim norway 5 minute temporal resolution 0 1 mm tipping bucket see thorolfsson et al 2003 the potential evapotranspiration pet was first calculated using the fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 formula with eleven years of radiation data from a different meteorological station located about 1 km away met norway 2018 a generalized formulation of hargreaves s equation almorox and grieser 2015 was then calibrated to this pet using temperature data from the precipitation station the calibrated formula was then used to estimate pet for the entire simulation period based on temperature from the precipitation station it was not possible to use the penman monteith pet directly since the required solar radiation data was not available for the entire study period 2 4 simulation and analysis the simulations were run as one continuous simulation from which the relevant results for different time periods were extracted the models were compared on both seasonal and event basis since the focus of this article is on rain rather than snow it considers the typically snow free period from april october for seasonal comparisons rain events are defined with a minimum 3 hour antecedent dry weather period adwp as well as a total depth of at least 2 mm and an average intensity of at least 0 01 mm h hernebring 2006 the first three hours after the end of each rain event i e up until the earliest possible start of the next rainfall are included in the analysis of the events the first year of simulations was used as an initialization period and not included in the analysis in the event scale analysis rainfall events that cause mass balance errors greater than 5 of the event rainfall in at least four soil profiles were excluded from the analysis the mass balance is calculated as the precipitation volume minus the volumes of outflows and storage increases this is because such errors would normally render the simulation outcomes unacceptable and the modeller would typically attempt to eliminate these errors by changing computational settings such as the time step control given the length and number of simulations carried out in this study it was not feasible to further reduce the size of the time steps in order not to contaminate the results with known erroneous mass balances these needed to be excluded it would be possible to exclude mass balances only for the soil profiles and events that had larger errors however this would mean that different soil profiles and models employ different sets of events making comparison between them inaccurate thus the entire rainfall event was excluded if four or more soil profiles had a mass balance error of more than 5 in any of the models events for which only a limited number of soil profiles maximum three caused mass balance errors were included to avoid over limiting the set of events 3 results and discussion 3 1 total available soil storage first the theoretically available soil storage volumes in the different models were compared see fig 2 for swmm and she the maximum storage is calculated according to eq 13 13 s max d θ sat θ wp where smax is the maximum water storage capacity mm d the soil depth mm θ sat the saturated soil water content porosity and θ wp the water content at wilting point here it is assumed that soil water content will never fall below wilting point for mouse the maximum storage mm is calculated according to eq 14 14 s max max d d g s y l max max d d g s y min d d r θ fc θ wp where dg is the depth mm at which capillary flux from sz to uz equals 1 mm d 1 dr mm is the effective root depth sy is the specific yield and θ fc is the soil water content at field capacity and lmax is the maximum root zone storage mm calculated according to the model s reference manual dhi 2017a it should be noted that the root zone storage is not expected to empty completely under moderate climate conditions but since there is no clear minimum value of actual root zone storage the entire value of lmax is included in the calculation of total soil storage capacity fig 2 shows that total storage capacity is usually larger in mouse for shallower soils but similar to swmm she for deeper soils silt loam has a larger storage capacity in mouse throughout which is attributable to the large difference between field capacity and wilting point for this soil the results in this section show that even at the model setup stage there may be significant differences between the various models although the magnitude of these differences depends on soil type and soil depth there is of course uncertainty involved in estimating parameter values from the literature without calibration however it should be noted that it is common practice to directly estimate values for the parameters since it may not be possible to estimate values for all parameters during model calibration this can be the result of e g the calibration data not containing enough information to identify all parameters or the model structure being overly complex although model calibration should be performed whenever possible since it provides the information that is most pertinent to the studied catchment it may be unavoidable to base estimates for some parameters on literature values and in that case understanding the effect of the chosen values is valuable in understanding the uncertainties in the study 3 2 seasonal runoff for all soil profiles the average percentage surface runoff from april october was highest in mouse and lowest in she except for some deeper soils for which swmm had the lowest runoff see fig 3 the difference between models for the same soil profile reached up to 37 percentage points 11clay 3 0 which was higher than the range between the different soil profiles in she 19 pp and swmm 31 pp with only mouse showing more variation between soil profiles 50 pp the sensitivity to changes in soil type i e the change along the horizontal axis in fig 3 was the highest in mouse although much of the change occurred in the first four soils and the lowest in she the sensitivity to changes in soil depth i e along the vertical axis in fig 3 was highest in swmm and lowest in she swmm and she showed a larger change in annual percentage runoff than mouse when the soil depth changed from 0 5 m to 1 0 m the pattern visible in the graph for mouse is as expected similar to the pattern of the overland coefficient cqof see table s1 in the supplementary material the cumulative distribution of seasonal april october percentage runoff 25 seasons in total allows examination of the inter annual variation in runoff in the different models see fig 4 mouse had the lowest variation between different years i e the lines in the figure are close to vertical while the variation was similar for swmm and she for all models the inter annual variation was higher in shallower soils than in deeper soils but this effect was much weaker in mouse than in the other two models for all three models soil types that generated minimal runoff also had less inter annual variation the inter model variation between mouse and swmm or she was higher than the inter annual variation in mouse the large inter model variation could significantly impact for example studies that address the effects of climate change or the effects of urbanization and green drainage infrastructure on urban water balances an explanation of the differences described above may be found in the approach to infiltration in the different models in mouse whenever the root zone moisture content l lmax is above a certain threshold and the surface storage is full part of the precipitation becomes overland flow based on the fixed coefficient cq of and current moisture content l lmax the surface storage has a limited capacity 2 5 mm and empties only slowly so it will be full relatively often emptying of the root zone storage through evapotranspiration slows down as l lmax becomes lower see fig 1 so it will only reach below the threshold during long dry periods which are rare in the climate of the study site see fig 7 on the other hand swmm and she adjust the maximum infiltration rate based on the moisture content of the top layer of soil and when this is exceeded surface runoff is generated in other words the different models predict different percentages of surface runoff since they generate runoff in different circumstances swmm and she only generate runoff if rainfall intensity is higher than infiltration capacity which depends on the soil type and the wetness of the top layer of the soil whereas mouse will nearly always generate at least some runoff in a rainfall event the higher inter annual variation in swmm and she can be explained by different factors firstly as described earlier in this paragraph the models are more sensitive to rainfall properties and initial soil conditions both of which may vary from year to year secondly both she and swmm divide the fixed depth of the soil profile into uz and sz by the variable groundwater table which reflects the antecedent conditions on a relatively long time scale and can therefore vary relatively strongly from year to year in mouse the uz and sz are less well connected and the groundwater elevation will only stop infiltration once it reaches the surface 3 3 seasonal evapotranspiration distribution plots of the annual percentage of evapotranspiration are shown in fig 5 she had higher evapotranspiration than the other two models even exceeding 100 of rainfall in some cases this may be attributed to water that is present in the soil following winter evaporating during the subsequent summer i e the period analysed here the absolute values for she were comparable to previously reported modelled values for the same region engen skaugen et al 2005 it should also be noted that the most important parameters that influence evapotranspiration in she have well established values soil hydrological properties from rawls et al 1982 leaf area index and root depth from the model s developer dhi 2017c and were therefore not considered a major source of uncertainty in the model setup of the other two models swmm had higher evapotranspiration than mouse except for the deep sandy soils both she and mouse were insensitive to changes in soil type from left to right in fig 5 but swmm had higher evapotranspiration for clayey soils than for sandy soils the same applied to sensitivity to soil depth with only swmm showing increased evapotranspiration for shallower soils although seemingly counterintuitive this may be explained by swmm dividing evapotranspiration by a fixed factor between the unsaturated and saturated zones in this study this factor was set based on root zone depth section 2 1 1 which meant that a larger fraction of potential evapotranspiration was assigned to the unsaturated zone in shallower soils the actual evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone is equal to the apportioned part of the total but reduced based on groundwater depth for the saturated zone thus increasing evapotranspiration when the root zone covers a large part of the soil depth as is the case in shallow soils one of the benefits and goals of green infrastructure is to retain water in place rather than generating runoff this restores or maintains a water balance which is closer to the natural water balance than would be the case with pipe based drainage systems hydrological models can be used to assess the water balance of existing or proposed drainage systems the results in this section and the previous section show that if models are used to help assess the water balance of a green infrastructure system different models may find different results from a hydrological perspective it is clear that this may influence the design of drainage systems increasing evapotranspiration through the increased use of green infrastructure may help reduce the urban heat island effect and its negative consequences see e g arnfield 2003 gill et al 2007 information from hydrological models may help inform decisions in urban planning processes and the uncertainties of the results in these models should be properly understood in order to make optimal use of the information 3 4 mass balance errors in rainfall events although not a primary objective of this study avoiding mass balance errors is important in any hydrological study and a brief overview is therefore included here fig 6 shows cumulative distribution plots of the mass balance errors for all soil profiles and events mass balance errors on the seasonal scale were negligible and are therefore not presented here a mass balance error free model would show a vertical line at 0 event rainfall and mm respectively and it is clear from the plots that this was not the case for any of the three models swmm had the smallest mass balance errors and mouse the largest in swmm most errors were negative i e outflows larger than inflows changes in storage while she and mouse had mostly positive errors i e some of the rainfall was unaccounted for in outflows and storage changes as described in section 2 4 rainfall events were excluded from the analysis if one of the models caused a mass balance error of more than 5 for four or more soil profiles in total 1 192 rainfall events out of 2 026 total remained part of the comparison for the individual models she would retain 1 452 events mouse 1 623 and swmm 2 005 this shows that the larger mass balance errors in mouse were concentrated in a more limited number of rainfall events than in she the differences in mass balance error behaviour mean that the choice of one model over another can significantly affect the computational aspects of modelling studies and it cannot be assumed without verifying that models are free of such computational errors 3 5 initial conditions for rainfall events the distribution of uz water content relative to total soil pore volume for she and swmm relative to maximum root zone storage for mouse is shown in fig 7 for she it should be noted that soil infiltration capacity depends on moisture content in the top layer of the soil but average swc in the entire uz is shown here in order to facilitate comparison with the other models for swmm it is possible that if the antecedent dry time of an event is relatively short then the initial moisture used in the green ampt equation is not set equal to the value of uz swc but is derived from the green ampt recovery calculation that followed the previous event however it is not possible to obtain this value from the swmm output files from the figure it is clear that initial conditions were most variable in she and least variable in swmm mouse was relatively insensitive to changes in both soil type and depth both swmm and she were sensitive to soil type and she was also somewhat sensitive to soil depth the higher variability and the presence of low values in she can be explained by the higher evapotranspiration see section 3 3 the results in fig 7 show that care needs to be taken in determining the appropriate initial conditions for simulations of green areas especially when using she or to a lesser degree mouse only for clayey soils in swmm can it be considered appropriate to use a standard value for different events these results support previous findings that the infiltration capacity of green areas may be reduced due to initial soil wetness even for sandy soils davidsen et al 2018 using horton s equation for infiltration davidsen et al found that the initial infiltration capacity ranged from 45 to 100 of the maximum although this figure cannot be compared directly with the relative uz swc from our results the variations found here may be smaller or larger depending on the model used 3 6 number of rainfall events with runoff fig 8 shows the percentage of rainfall events that generate at least 1 mm of runoff for each soil profile and model this revealed the same patterns as the seasonal percent runoff i e mouse had the highest number of runoff events and swmm had the lowest however swmm predicted more runoff than she for shallow clayey soils swmm was most sensitive to changes in soil type ranging from 1 of events for shallow sand to 56 for shallow clay while mouse and she were sensitive to changing soil type for the three sand soils but only somewhat sensitive to changes in the other soil types mouse was insensitive to changes in soil depth 6 8 change between shallowest and deepest soil except for sandy soils she was somewhat sensitive up to 33 but not for clay soils and swmm was most sensitive to changes in soil depth e g approx 40 difference between deepest and shallowest soils this last observation was unexpected since swmm used the green ampt model for infiltration in which the infiltration capacity becomes limited as the very top layer of soil becomes wetter and this would be expected to give similar infiltration capacities and therefore surface runoff in shallow and deep soils davidsen et al 2018 found no runoff from sandy soils when simulating infiltration capacity but not the fate of infiltrated water using horton s equation here we found that runoff does occur for shallow sandy soils but less for deeper sandy soils suggesting that the long term storage of water in the saturated and unsaturated zones can also lead to the generation of runoff our findings in this section and in section 3 2 further underline that green areas may contribute to runoff in urban areas during many rainfall events and cannot be simply ignored in studies of catchment runoff it should also be noted that actual runoff from urban green areas may be even higher or more frequent if the soil is compacted see e g gregory et al 2006 muthanna et al 2018 pitt et al 2008 3 7 runoff during rainfall events distribution plots for the event percentage runoff are shown in fig 9 for most soil profiles swmm and she showed similar bi modal distributions i e events tended to generate either less than 10 or more than 60 runoff with relatively few events generating runoff between these percentages this effect was clearer for larger rainfall events compare the upper and lower panel of fig 9 although the distributions for she and swmm appeared to be similar the standard two sample kolmogorov smirnov test at the 95 significance level showed that they may not be considered to be samples from the same distribution this behaviour was not present in mouse where inter event variation was smaller except for sand soil for rainfall events larger than 10 mm lower panel in fig 9 there are no events for which mouse does not predict any runoff except for sandy soils while swmm and she predict some of these events even for clay soils the observations above may be attributed to the mechanisms described in section 3 2 i e the higher sensitivity of swmm and she to varying rainfall properties and initial conditions and the larger influence of the groundwater table in addition the smaller inter event variation in mouse can be explained by negative feedback effects where water infiltrating into the root zone will increase the root zone storage l lmax which then lowers infiltration and groundwater recharge at the next time step in a design context it is important to note that the differences in the distributions found here would be expected to influence the return intervals of runoff events and in this way lead to different models resulting in different designs of urban drainage systems in addition this suggests that if the distribution of the observed event percentage runoff is similar to the unimodal distribution shown by mouse it may be more difficult to match this in a multi event calibration with she or swmm and vice versa 3 8 sensitivity to rainfall intensity the dependence of simulated surface runoff on rainfall intensity is visualized in fig 10 with the exception of she for sandy soil there was no clear increase of event percentage runoff with increasing rainfall intensity for intense events with 15 mm rain in 2 h for such intense events the percentage runoff for clay soils would be expected to be closer to 100 than the figure shows this may be attributed to the fact that these events are observed events where intensity will vary throughout the event where the most intense two hour period is used in the figure this means that the events also can contain less intense periods where little runoff is generated only two intense events one event with 15 4 mm in two hours and a total of 51 9 mm over 34 h one event with 24 7 mm in two hours and a total of 46 8 mm over 24 h had close to 100 runoff in both swmm and she this shows that the variability of rainfall within events makes it challenging to analyse the relationship between rainfall intensity and runoff using observed rainfall data for shallow sand soil she showed a group of events in which surface runoff increased roughly linearly with rainfall intensity which did not exist for the other models this is likely caused by high groundwater levels in the soil for clay soil events with an intensity of less than 15 mm in two hours were split into two groups for she one group with runoff of 75 and another group with less runoff but both groups showed a slight increase in runoff for increasing rainfall intensities for swmm it was mainly the first group that was visible for shallow clay soil and mainly the second group that was visible for deep clay soil for mouse there was no relation between rainfall intensity and runoff at all for any of the soils which may be attributed to the fact that mouse does not feature a limited infiltration rate like she and swmm 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to examine the differences in model structure of three models swmm she and mouse used for urban drainage and their impact on simulation outcomes this comparison was made for varying soil types and varying soil depths the differences found between the three different models are described below on a seasonal scale the differences between the models are large e g up to 33 percentage points for seasonal runoff for the same soil profile compared to those between different soil types mouse generates much more runoff than the other two models runoff in she and mouse is mainly sensitive to soil type and less so to soil depth while swmm is sensitive to both inter annual variation is higher in she and swmm than in mouse on an event basis the inter model variation of runoff generation is similar to the seasonal scale while statistical distributions of event percentage runoff are different while mouse predicts between 10 and 60 runoff for most events swmm and she mainly predict either less than 10 or more than 60 event runoff there was considerable inter event and inter model variation in the initial conditions for rainfall events the sensitivity to rainfall intensity for different soil types also varied between the three models the observed differences may be linked to differences in the model structures in mouse the relative root zone moisture content l lmax influences most of the important processes runoff generation infiltration groundwater recharge creating negative feedback loops which reduce the sensitivity of the model output to variations in soil type soil depth and meteorological conditions in swmm and she saturation of the top layer of soil can limit the maximum infiltration rate making runoff generation more sensitive to rainfall characteristics and increasing inter event and inter annual variation in the model outputs the main practical implications of these findings are that model structure should be regarded as an influential source of uncertainty in urban drainage modelling the differences in the simulation outcomes and in the responses of the models to changes in soil type and depth are large enough that they may significantly impact the outcome of various modelling studies in the special case of model forecasts e g studying the impacts of climate change or changing land use where calibration is per definition impossible the magnitude of the uncertainties arising from model structure should be explicitly considered in the analysis in addition the results from this paper further underline that green areas may contribute significantly to runoff in urban areas and should not be simply ignored even if different models are first calibrated to for example runoff measurements it cannot be expected that the results will be the same for other components of the water balance or in terms of inter event or inter annual variation the differences that were observed in the distribution of the event percentage runoff may also mean that different models may encounter different challenges while calibrating them to multiple events for example different trade offs between the different events might be necessary if flow rate data is available the values of the subset of parameters that are identifiable from flow rate data can be calibrated after this the approach shown in this paper can be used to estimate the range of model outcomes that is still possible for the different values of the parameters that were not identified from the flow data finally the results from this paper show that different models set up with the explicit goal of representing identical simple synthetic catchments may give strongly varying results thus the direct comparison of parameter values between models may not be meaningful declaration of

8600,mathematical stormwater models are often used as tools for planning and analysing urban drainage systems however the inherent uncertainties of the models must be properly understood in order to make optimal use of them one source of uncertainty that has received relatively little attention particularly for increasingly popular green areas as part of urban drainage systems is the mathematical model structure this paper analyses the differences between three different widely used models swmm mouse and mike she when simulating rainfall runoff from green areas over a 26 year period eleven different soil types and six different soil depths were used to investigate the sensitivity of the models to changes in both important hydrological factors such as seasonal runoff and evapotranspiration the number of events that generated runoff and the initial conditions for rainfall events varied significantly between the three models mouse generated the highest runoff volumes while it was rather insensitive to changes in soil type and depth mike she was mainly sensitive to changes in soil type swmm which generated the least runoff was sensitive to changes in both soil type and depth explanations for the observed differences were found in the descriptions of the mathematical models the differences in model outputs could significantly impact the conclusions from studies on the design or analysis of urban drainage systems the amount and frequency of runoff from green areas in all three models indicates that green areas cannot be simply ignored in urban drainage modelling studies keywords model structure uncertainty urban drainage green areas runoff infiltration stormwater models 1 introduction stormwater management is a challenge for cities around the world and has traditionally been addressed using pipe based drainage networks these networks are costly to construct and maintain and may potentially exacerbate flooding and water quality issues downstream green infrastructure attempts to solve these problems by managing stormwater in a more natural way see e g eckart et al 2017 fletcher et al 2013 effective and efficient design and operation require the ability to analyse and predict the performance of such green urban drainage systems this is often conducted using one of several simulation models available for urban drainage systems see e g elliott and trowsdale 2007 such models are always simplifications of reality which result in uncertainties associated with their use understanding the sources and describing the magnitude of these uncertainties is necessary if the models are to contribute to optimal management and design of stormwater systems e g deletic et al 2012 a lack of understanding could lead to either over dimensioned unnecessarily expensive drainage systems or under dimensioned systems that lead to flooding and damages uncertainties in urban drainage modelling arise from different sources that may be divided into three groups model input uncertainties calibration uncertainties and model structure uncertainties deletic et al 2012 the uncertainties related to input data and the calibration process have been studied to some extent albeit more extensively for traditional pipe based drainage systems than for green infrastructure dotto et al 2014 showed that calibration can to some extent compensate for measurement errors following developments in natural hydrology different methods for estimating parameter uncertainty have been applied to urban drainage modelling freni et al 2009 dotto et al 2012 including mathematically formal bayesian methods e g kleidorfer et al 2009 dotto et al 2011 2014 wani et al 2017 and mathematically informal methods such as glue e g thorndahl et al 2008 breinholt et al 2013 sun et al 2013 improvements in the calibration procedure have been proposed based on higher resolution input data krebs et al 2014 petrucci and bonhomme 2014 or a more systematic way of distinguishing the parameter sets that provide an acceptable match between simulated and observed values in order to estimate parametric uncertainty vezzaro et al 2013 despite this growing body of research on urban drainage modelling model structure uncertainty has received little attention although model results for green areas are sometimes compared e g infiltration models in duan et al 2011 most comparisons do not explicitly discuss the applied model structures a review by elliott trowsdale 2007 mainly describes the practical and technical differences between a number of common urban drainage models in terms of model uses temporal and spatial resolution runoff generation flow routing representation of low impact development facilities and user interface this review does not consider the differences between the conceptual models used by each of the models compare e g dhi 2017a rossman and huber 2016 understanding these differences and their implications is valuable for three reasons first these differences can be expected to give rise to differences in the results of modelling studies depending on which model is utilised it may be argued that models are usually calibrated to field measurements and that this will reduce or even eliminate the differences between their outcomes however this argument fails to consider that different calibrated models may predict similar outflow rates while diverging in other aspects of the water balance kaleris and langousis 2016 koch et al 2016 for urban drainage models specifically pipe leakage infiltration and misconnections may also affect the measured flow rates and these issues cannot be identified from outflow measurements alone such divergence could lead to conflicting outcomes if different models are used to forecast the performance of urban drainage systems for example examining the differences between various climate and or development scenarios see karlsson et al 2016 for an example of this in a natural catchment second model calibration is often performed by adjusting only a subset of model parameters based on a sensitivity analysis this kind of analysis is traditionally performed using one of the many experimental numerical techniques available but it could also benefit from an improved theoretical understanding of the ways in which different parameters affect the model results third models may be used to predict more extreme events than they were calibrated for and understanding the ways the model might react to more extreme rainfall input can help in understanding the uncertainty involved the three reasons outlined above equally apply to models of traditional and green urban drainage systems one of the aims of the increasing use of green infrastructure is to locally retain and store water for a longer period thus from a theoretical perspective models of such systems would also need to include slower in soil processes such as infiltration groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration fletcher et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 this was also demonstrated by davidsen et al 2018 although they only modelled infiltration capacity using horton s equation and did not consider the fate of the water after it had infiltrated the effect of including a more complete description of in soil processes more similar to descriptions used in models of natural hydrologic systems on urban runoff processes at a fine temporal and spatial resolution has not yet been studied extensively in addition to the theoretical considerations in the previous two paragraphs there are also experimental indications that model structure can play a significant role in urban drainage modelling studies fassman beck and saleh 2018 found that the epa storm water management model swmm displayed some counter intuitive behaviour when modelling a bioretention system for green roof modelling in swmm peng and stovin 2017 for example found that the green roof module requires further modifications leimgruber et al 2018 found that water balance components were insensitive to most parameters involved in the process which could mean that the model structure is unnecessarily complex and johannessen et al 2019 raised concerns about the large variability in calibrated model parameters and their non correspondence with material properties within runoff quality modelling the validity of traditional build up wash off models was shown to be limited to a subset of cases bonhomme and petrucci 2017 sandoval et al 2018 considering the above there are indications that model structure uncertainty could considerably impact modelling outcomes but it has received relatively limited attention in research on modelling green urban drainage thus this paper aims to further the understanding of model structure uncertainties in urban drainage models that specifically address green areas the research questions in this paper are 1 what is the impact of model structure on the predicted runoff and evapotranspiration in green plots with different soil textures and depths in an urban context 2 how can the differences between conceptual model structures be linked to differences in model results answering these questions could ultimately contribute to a better understanding and applicability of urban drainage models for green infrastructure 2 materials and methods 2 1 models the three models used in this paper were the storm water management model swmm version 5 1 011 u s environmental protection agency mouse rdii hereafter referred to as mouse release 2017 dhi danish hydrological institute and mike she hereafter referred to as she release 2017 dhi note that the pcswmm chi interface was used for initial setup of the model but the final model runs were performed with the standard epa swmm 5 1 011 executable a brief description of the conceptual models is given below and in fig 1 for additional details see the official documentation for each of the models an overview of all model parameters may be found in table 1 swmm and mouse are semi distributed models where the study area may be divided into subcatchments of arbitrary shape and size parameter values are set for each subcatchment she on the other hand is a fully distributed model that uses a regular rectilinear grid to divide the study area into a large number of cells and different parameter values can be assigned to each cell all three models contain three possible storage compartments for each catchment surface unsaturated zone uz and saturated zone sz storage the ways in which water is moved between these three storages and out of the catchment vary between the models all three models have methods to account for snowfall and snowmelt but since snow periods were not considered in this study these methods are not described here 2 1 1 swmm swmm rossman and huber 2016 conceptualizes each catchment as a single soil column that is divided into an unsaturated and a saturated zone by a variable groundwater level the surface storage is filled by precipitation supplied as a time series by the user and emptied by overland flow infiltration and evapotranspiration overland flow is described using manning s formula which for the case of overland flow in a catchment can be written as 1 q 1 n s 1 2 d 5 3 w where n is manning s coefficient which depends on the roughness of the surface including vegetation s is the slope of the surface d is the depth of the water and w the width of the flow in ideal cases as in this study w is simply the width of the catchment but in more complex cases it may be considered to be a flow routing parameter instead the water depth d is replenished by rainfall provided as input data to the model and reduced by surface runoff and infiltration for infiltration the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 was selected swmm also supports the horton and curve number methods this model assumes that initially all precipitation will infiltrate until a saturated layer develops at the top of the soil and the maximum infiltration rate becomes 2 f p k sat 1 ψ s θ d f where the infiltration rate fp is controlled by two soil hydraulic parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and suction head ψs the initial soil moisture deficit θ d at the start of the rainfall event and the cumulative infiltration volume f during the rainfall event as the soil becomes more saturated the infiltration rate asymptotically approaches the saturated hydraulic conductivity the rate of recovery of infiltration capacity during dry periods is calculated from 3 δ θ d k sat 75 θ dmax δ t where θ dmax is the maximum possible moisture deficit i e the difference between soil porosity and residual moisture content higher saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat leads to a faster recovery of infiltration capacity if rainfall occurs long enough after the previous rainfall the time is calculated as t r 4 5 k sat the initial moisture deficit θ d for the green ampt calculation is set to the unsaturated zone moisture content thus the recovery of infiltration capacity is initially based only on ksat but after sufficient time has elapsed it is affected by evapotranspiration and also by percolation from the unsaturated to the saturated zone from the unsaturated zone water can percolate to the saturated zone at a rate calculated from 4 f u k sat e θ s θ cur h c o where θ s is the maximum soil water content i e porosity θ cur is the current unsaturated zone soil water content and hco is a soil parameter representing the slope of the conductivity vs soil water content curve the percolation rate grows exponentially up to the value of ksat as the water content in the unsaturated zone increases water can drain from the saturated zone according to a linear reservoir equation which was used for consistency with mouse see section 2 2 evapotranspiration takes place initially from surface water and after this is depleted from both the unsaturated and saturated zone simultaneously a user supplied factor between 0 and 1 determines what fraction of potential evapotranspiration is assigned to the unsaturated zone with the remainder being assigned to the saturated zone in this study this factor was set based on the root zone depth according to shah et al 2007 their work provides values for the division of evapotranspiration between the saturated and unsaturated zones based on groundwater depth thus the average groundwater table from an initial swmm run was used to obtain an estimate of the upper zone evaporation factor uef this was then iterated until there were no further changes in the average groundwater table evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone takes place at the potential rate supplied as input data to the model evapotranspiration from the saturated zone is calculated using 5 f el 1 u e f e max del d u del where du is the groundwater depth and del is the groundwater depth below which evapotranspiration is disabled the potential evapotranspiration rate emax can either be provided by the user directly as in this study or calculated from temperature data using hargreaves s method 2 1 2 mouse in mouse each catchment consists of a surface storage with current storage u a root zone storage with current storage l and a saturated zone which is described by the depth of the phreatic surface below the ground level meaning that it is theoretically infinite in size the surface storage is filled by rain provided as time series by the user and emptied slowly by evapotranspiration and interflow 6 if ck if 1 l l max t if 1 t if u where if is interflow ckif is a user supplied coefficient the factor l lmax is the fraction of the root zone storage that is currently filled and tif is a threshold for l lmax below which interflow is disabled note that the value of l lmax can theoretically vary between 0 and 1 in contrast to the soil volumetric water content θ used by swmm which can vary only between the soil residual moisture content and the soil porosity since ckif has a typical value of 500 to 1000 h and the surface storage u is quite small interflow is usually also small water in the surface storage cannot infiltrate into the soil when surface water exceeds the maximum storage umax comparable to depression storage the excess precipitation pn is divided into overland flow groundwater recharge and infiltration into the unsaturated zone according to 7 of cq of l l max t of 1 t of p n 8 g p n o f l l max t g 1 t g 9 i p n o f g where of is overland flow g is groundwater recharge i is infiltration into the unsaturated zone cqof is a user supplied coefficient between 0 and 1 and tof and tg are threshold values which l lmax must exceed in order to activate overland flow and groundwater recharge respectively the values of of g and i are limited to positive values only higher values of l lmax indicate a more saturated root zone storage which increases overland flow and reduces infiltration into the root zone storage overland flow is routed through two consecutive identical linear reservoirs evapotranspiration is initially drawn from the surface storage at the potential evapotranspiration rate and then from the unsaturated zone according to 10 e a e p l l max where ea and ep are the actual and potential evapotranspiration rates respectively potential evapotranspiration rates are provided by the user there is no percolation from the unsaturated to the saturated zone but capillary flux does take place the opposite way the saturated zone acts as a linear reservoir generating groundwater outflow dhi 2017a 2 1 3 she mike she combines a number of physically based methods to describe hydrological processes overland flow is described by the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equations for 2d shallow water flow as part of this she uses manning s coefficient to describe the friction that the flow experiences from the surface in effect this means that she uses manning s equation like swmm however this equation is applied to each grid cell individually rather than on a catchment scale thus surface water depths and processes that depend on this e g infiltration can vary throughout the catchment area although not used in this study the user supplied precipitation rates can also vary throughout the catchment area water movement in the unsaturated zone including infiltration is described using the 1d richards equation which describes the vertical movement of water in the unsaturated zone it requires a description of how well the soil retains water in this study the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 was used for this 11 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where θ θ s and θ r are the current saturated and residual soil moisture content respectively ψ is the tension head i e the attractive force between water and soil particles calculated when she solves richards equation and α and n are soil specific parameters higher values of these parameters are associated with looser soils schaap et al 2001 water movement in the saturated zone is described using a 3d darcy method in its simplest form flow between two grid cells is calculated using 12 q δ h c where q is the flow rate δh is the difference in piezometric head i e the water level in unconfined aquifers as used in this study and c is the conductance in she the conductance is calculated from the saturated hydraulic conductivity parameter of the soil so the saturated zone flow is mainly controlled by this parameter as a boundary condition the groundwater level was fixed at the bottom of the soil profile on the downhill boundary and excess groundwater allowed to drain from the model at this point dhi 2017b 2 2 synthetic catchments in order to examine how the different models react to changes in soil type and depth the simulations combined eleven different soil types from the standard classification by the u s department of agriculture with six different depths 0 5 1 0 3 0 m for a total of 66 soil profiles the eleven soil types were numbered 01sand 02loamy sand 03sandy loam 04loam 05silt loam 06sandy clay loam 07clay loam 08silty clay loam 09sandy clay 10silty clay 11clay the soils are numbered in order of decreasing hydraulic conductivity however it should be noted that not all other soil hydrological properties follow the same pattern the depth of the soil is appended when referring to single soil profiles e g 11clay 3 0 for the 3 metre deep clay profile each soil profile is used for one catchment that is 240 m 240 m covered in grass with a 2 gradient in one direction for each soil profile parameters for all the models were set to typical values for the soils from literature and based on the models official documentation mouse dhi 2017a she dhi 2017b swmm rossman and huber 2016 the sources of the different parameter values are listed in table 1 while the actual parameter values can be found in table s1 in the supplementary information to this article generic parameter values for the groundwater reservoirs were not available so the parameter values for swmm and mouse were selected based on results from she starting with an empty catchment a she simulation for the saturated zone only was run with a constant rainfall rate and the groundwater outflow rate was obtained for each soil type the time constant of a linear reservoir with the same rainfall input was then calibrated to this groundwater outflow data and the resulting reservoir constant was implemented in both swmm and mouse although swmm supports more complex formulations of the groundwater reservoir these were not used in order to maintain a comparable setup in all three models in mouse overland flow and groundwater recharge only take place if the relative root zone moisture content l lmax is above a certain threshold value the reference manual states that the threshold values should reflect the degree of spatial variability in the catchment characteristics so that a small homogeneous catchment is expected to have larger threshold values than a large heterogeneous catchment dhi 2017a the catchments in this study are homogeneous however setting high values for the thresholds would result in the soil moisture having no impact on the infiltration capacity until the soil was very wet which we considered unrealistic instead the threshold values were set at 0 2 for overland flow and 0 4 for groundwater recharge so that in numerical experiments with constant rainfall the infiltration rate develops in the same way as in horton s infiltration model in addition mouse contains two flow routing time constants for overland flow and interflow respectively that lack a clear way of determining them except via calibration the overland flow constant was set so that the end of the runoff from mouse roughly matched the end of the runoff from swmm for one rainfall event the lack of a clear physical basis in this approach means that the shape of the surface runoff hydrograph cannot be compared directly however since only the runoff routing is affected and not the runoff generation total runoff volumes can still be compared 2 3 meteorological data the precipitation input is a 26 year rain and snow record from trondheim norway 5 minute temporal resolution 0 1 mm tipping bucket see thorolfsson et al 2003 the potential evapotranspiration pet was first calculated using the fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 formula with eleven years of radiation data from a different meteorological station located about 1 km away met norway 2018 a generalized formulation of hargreaves s equation almorox and grieser 2015 was then calibrated to this pet using temperature data from the precipitation station the calibrated formula was then used to estimate pet for the entire simulation period based on temperature from the precipitation station it was not possible to use the penman monteith pet directly since the required solar radiation data was not available for the entire study period 2 4 simulation and analysis the simulations were run as one continuous simulation from which the relevant results for different time periods were extracted the models were compared on both seasonal and event basis since the focus of this article is on rain rather than snow it considers the typically snow free period from april october for seasonal comparisons rain events are defined with a minimum 3 hour antecedent dry weather period adwp as well as a total depth of at least 2 mm and an average intensity of at least 0 01 mm h hernebring 2006 the first three hours after the end of each rain event i e up until the earliest possible start of the next rainfall are included in the analysis of the events the first year of simulations was used as an initialization period and not included in the analysis in the event scale analysis rainfall events that cause mass balance errors greater than 5 of the event rainfall in at least four soil profiles were excluded from the analysis the mass balance is calculated as the precipitation volume minus the volumes of outflows and storage increases this is because such errors would normally render the simulation outcomes unacceptable and the modeller would typically attempt to eliminate these errors by changing computational settings such as the time step control given the length and number of simulations carried out in this study it was not feasible to further reduce the size of the time steps in order not to contaminate the results with known erroneous mass balances these needed to be excluded it would be possible to exclude mass balances only for the soil profiles and events that had larger errors however this would mean that different soil profiles and models employ different sets of events making comparison between them inaccurate thus the entire rainfall event was excluded if four or more soil profiles had a mass balance error of more than 5 in any of the models events for which only a limited number of soil profiles maximum three caused mass balance errors were included to avoid over limiting the set of events 3 results and discussion 3 1 total available soil storage first the theoretically available soil storage volumes in the different models were compared see fig 2 for swmm and she the maximum storage is calculated according to eq 13 13 s max d θ sat θ wp where smax is the maximum water storage capacity mm d the soil depth mm θ sat the saturated soil water content porosity and θ wp the water content at wilting point here it is assumed that soil water content will never fall below wilting point for mouse the maximum storage mm is calculated according to eq 14 14 s max max d d g s y l max max d d g s y min d d r θ fc θ wp where dg is the depth mm at which capillary flux from sz to uz equals 1 mm d 1 dr mm is the effective root depth sy is the specific yield and θ fc is the soil water content at field capacity and lmax is the maximum root zone storage mm calculated according to the model s reference manual dhi 2017a it should be noted that the root zone storage is not expected to empty completely under moderate climate conditions but since there is no clear minimum value of actual root zone storage the entire value of lmax is included in the calculation of total soil storage capacity fig 2 shows that total storage capacity is usually larger in mouse for shallower soils but similar to swmm she for deeper soils silt loam has a larger storage capacity in mouse throughout which is attributable to the large difference between field capacity and wilting point for this soil the results in this section show that even at the model setup stage there may be significant differences between the various models although the magnitude of these differences depends on soil type and soil depth there is of course uncertainty involved in estimating parameter values from the literature without calibration however it should be noted that it is common practice to directly estimate values for the parameters since it may not be possible to estimate values for all parameters during model calibration this can be the result of e g the calibration data not containing enough information to identify all parameters or the model structure being overly complex although model calibration should be performed whenever possible since it provides the information that is most pertinent to the studied catchment it may be unavoidable to base estimates for some parameters on literature values and in that case understanding the effect of the chosen values is valuable in understanding the uncertainties in the study 3 2 seasonal runoff for all soil profiles the average percentage surface runoff from april october was highest in mouse and lowest in she except for some deeper soils for which swmm had the lowest runoff see fig 3 the difference between models for the same soil profile reached up to 37 percentage points 11clay 3 0 which was higher than the range between the different soil profiles in she 19 pp and swmm 31 pp with only mouse showing more variation between soil profiles 50 pp the sensitivity to changes in soil type i e the change along the horizontal axis in fig 3 was the highest in mouse although much of the change occurred in the first four soils and the lowest in she the sensitivity to changes in soil depth i e along the vertical axis in fig 3 was highest in swmm and lowest in she swmm and she showed a larger change in annual percentage runoff than mouse when the soil depth changed from 0 5 m to 1 0 m the pattern visible in the graph for mouse is as expected similar to the pattern of the overland coefficient cqof see table s1 in the supplementary material the cumulative distribution of seasonal april october percentage runoff 25 seasons in total allows examination of the inter annual variation in runoff in the different models see fig 4 mouse had the lowest variation between different years i e the lines in the figure are close to vertical while the variation was similar for swmm and she for all models the inter annual variation was higher in shallower soils than in deeper soils but this effect was much weaker in mouse than in the other two models for all three models soil types that generated minimal runoff also had less inter annual variation the inter model variation between mouse and swmm or she was higher than the inter annual variation in mouse the large inter model variation could significantly impact for example studies that address the effects of climate change or the effects of urbanization and green drainage infrastructure on urban water balances an explanation of the differences described above may be found in the approach to infiltration in the different models in mouse whenever the root zone moisture content l lmax is above a certain threshold and the surface storage is full part of the precipitation becomes overland flow based on the fixed coefficient cq of and current moisture content l lmax the surface storage has a limited capacity 2 5 mm and empties only slowly so it will be full relatively often emptying of the root zone storage through evapotranspiration slows down as l lmax becomes lower see fig 1 so it will only reach below the threshold during long dry periods which are rare in the climate of the study site see fig 7 on the other hand swmm and she adjust the maximum infiltration rate based on the moisture content of the top layer of soil and when this is exceeded surface runoff is generated in other words the different models predict different percentages of surface runoff since they generate runoff in different circumstances swmm and she only generate runoff if rainfall intensity is higher than infiltration capacity which depends on the soil type and the wetness of the top layer of the soil whereas mouse will nearly always generate at least some runoff in a rainfall event the higher inter annual variation in swmm and she can be explained by different factors firstly as described earlier in this paragraph the models are more sensitive to rainfall properties and initial soil conditions both of which may vary from year to year secondly both she and swmm divide the fixed depth of the soil profile into uz and sz by the variable groundwater table which reflects the antecedent conditions on a relatively long time scale and can therefore vary relatively strongly from year to year in mouse the uz and sz are less well connected and the groundwater elevation will only stop infiltration once it reaches the surface 3 3 seasonal evapotranspiration distribution plots of the annual percentage of evapotranspiration are shown in fig 5 she had higher evapotranspiration than the other two models even exceeding 100 of rainfall in some cases this may be attributed to water that is present in the soil following winter evaporating during the subsequent summer i e the period analysed here the absolute values for she were comparable to previously reported modelled values for the same region engen skaugen et al 2005 it should also be noted that the most important parameters that influence evapotranspiration in she have well established values soil hydrological properties from rawls et al 1982 leaf area index and root depth from the model s developer dhi 2017c and were therefore not considered a major source of uncertainty in the model setup of the other two models swmm had higher evapotranspiration than mouse except for the deep sandy soils both she and mouse were insensitive to changes in soil type from left to right in fig 5 but swmm had higher evapotranspiration for clayey soils than for sandy soils the same applied to sensitivity to soil depth with only swmm showing increased evapotranspiration for shallower soils although seemingly counterintuitive this may be explained by swmm dividing evapotranspiration by a fixed factor between the unsaturated and saturated zones in this study this factor was set based on root zone depth section 2 1 1 which meant that a larger fraction of potential evapotranspiration was assigned to the unsaturated zone in shallower soils the actual evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone is equal to the apportioned part of the total but reduced based on groundwater depth for the saturated zone thus increasing evapotranspiration when the root zone covers a large part of the soil depth as is the case in shallow soils one of the benefits and goals of green infrastructure is to retain water in place rather than generating runoff this restores or maintains a water balance which is closer to the natural water balance than would be the case with pipe based drainage systems hydrological models can be used to assess the water balance of existing or proposed drainage systems the results in this section and the previous section show that if models are used to help assess the water balance of a green infrastructure system different models may find different results from a hydrological perspective it is clear that this may influence the design of drainage systems increasing evapotranspiration through the increased use of green infrastructure may help reduce the urban heat island effect and its negative consequences see e g arnfield 2003 gill et al 2007 information from hydrological models may help inform decisions in urban planning processes and the uncertainties of the results in these models should be properly understood in order to make optimal use of the information 3 4 mass balance errors in rainfall events although not a primary objective of this study avoiding mass balance errors is important in any hydrological study and a brief overview is therefore included here fig 6 shows cumulative distribution plots of the mass balance errors for all soil profiles and events mass balance errors on the seasonal scale were negligible and are therefore not presented here a mass balance error free model would show a vertical line at 0 event rainfall and mm respectively and it is clear from the plots that this was not the case for any of the three models swmm had the smallest mass balance errors and mouse the largest in swmm most errors were negative i e outflows larger than inflows changes in storage while she and mouse had mostly positive errors i e some of the rainfall was unaccounted for in outflows and storage changes as described in section 2 4 rainfall events were excluded from the analysis if one of the models caused a mass balance error of more than 5 for four or more soil profiles in total 1 192 rainfall events out of 2 026 total remained part of the comparison for the individual models she would retain 1 452 events mouse 1 623 and swmm 2 005 this shows that the larger mass balance errors in mouse were concentrated in a more limited number of rainfall events than in she the differences in mass balance error behaviour mean that the choice of one model over another can significantly affect the computational aspects of modelling studies and it cannot be assumed without verifying that models are free of such computational errors 3 5 initial conditions for rainfall events the distribution of uz water content relative to total soil pore volume for she and swmm relative to maximum root zone storage for mouse is shown in fig 7 for she it should be noted that soil infiltration capacity depends on moisture content in the top layer of the soil but average swc in the entire uz is shown here in order to facilitate comparison with the other models for swmm it is possible that if the antecedent dry time of an event is relatively short then the initial moisture used in the green ampt equation is not set equal to the value of uz swc but is derived from the green ampt recovery calculation that followed the previous event however it is not possible to obtain this value from the swmm output files from the figure it is clear that initial conditions were most variable in she and least variable in swmm mouse was relatively insensitive to changes in both soil type and depth both swmm and she were sensitive to soil type and she was also somewhat sensitive to soil depth the higher variability and the presence of low values in she can be explained by the higher evapotranspiration see section 3 3 the results in fig 7 show that care needs to be taken in determining the appropriate initial conditions for simulations of green areas especially when using she or to a lesser degree mouse only for clayey soils in swmm can it be considered appropriate to use a standard value for different events these results support previous findings that the infiltration capacity of green areas may be reduced due to initial soil wetness even for sandy soils davidsen et al 2018 using horton s equation for infiltration davidsen et al found that the initial infiltration capacity ranged from 45 to 100 of the maximum although this figure cannot be compared directly with the relative uz swc from our results the variations found here may be smaller or larger depending on the model used 3 6 number of rainfall events with runoff fig 8 shows the percentage of rainfall events that generate at least 1 mm of runoff for each soil profile and model this revealed the same patterns as the seasonal percent runoff i e mouse had the highest number of runoff events and swmm had the lowest however swmm predicted more runoff than she for shallow clayey soils swmm was most sensitive to changes in soil type ranging from 1 of events for shallow sand to 56 for shallow clay while mouse and she were sensitive to changing soil type for the three sand soils but only somewhat sensitive to changes in the other soil types mouse was insensitive to changes in soil depth 6 8 change between shallowest and deepest soil except for sandy soils she was somewhat sensitive up to 33 but not for clay soils and swmm was most sensitive to changes in soil depth e g approx 40 difference between deepest and shallowest soils this last observation was unexpected since swmm used the green ampt model for infiltration in which the infiltration capacity becomes limited as the very top layer of soil becomes wetter and this would be expected to give similar infiltration capacities and therefore surface runoff in shallow and deep soils davidsen et al 2018 found no runoff from sandy soils when simulating infiltration capacity but not the fate of infiltrated water using horton s equation here we found that runoff does occur for shallow sandy soils but less for deeper sandy soils suggesting that the long term storage of water in the saturated and unsaturated zones can also lead to the generation of runoff our findings in this section and in section 3 2 further underline that green areas may contribute to runoff in urban areas during many rainfall events and cannot be simply ignored in studies of catchment runoff it should also be noted that actual runoff from urban green areas may be even higher or more frequent if the soil is compacted see e g gregory et al 2006 muthanna et al 2018 pitt et al 2008 3 7 runoff during rainfall events distribution plots for the event percentage runoff are shown in fig 9 for most soil profiles swmm and she showed similar bi modal distributions i e events tended to generate either less than 10 or more than 60 runoff with relatively few events generating runoff between these percentages this effect was clearer for larger rainfall events compare the upper and lower panel of fig 9 although the distributions for she and swmm appeared to be similar the standard two sample kolmogorov smirnov test at the 95 significance level showed that they may not be considered to be samples from the same distribution this behaviour was not present in mouse where inter event variation was smaller except for sand soil for rainfall events larger than 10 mm lower panel in fig 9 there are no events for which mouse does not predict any runoff except for sandy soils while swmm and she predict some of these events even for clay soils the observations above may be attributed to the mechanisms described in section 3 2 i e the higher sensitivity of swmm and she to varying rainfall properties and initial conditions and the larger influence of the groundwater table in addition the smaller inter event variation in mouse can be explained by negative feedback effects where water infiltrating into the root zone will increase the root zone storage l lmax which then lowers infiltration and groundwater recharge at the next time step in a design context it is important to note that the differences in the distributions found here would be expected to influence the return intervals of runoff events and in this way lead to different models resulting in different designs of urban drainage systems in addition this suggests that if the distribution of the observed event percentage runoff is similar to the unimodal distribution shown by mouse it may be more difficult to match this in a multi event calibration with she or swmm and vice versa 3 8 sensitivity to rainfall intensity the dependence of simulated surface runoff on rainfall intensity is visualized in fig 10 with the exception of she for sandy soil there was no clear increase of event percentage runoff with increasing rainfall intensity for intense events with 15 mm rain in 2 h for such intense events the percentage runoff for clay soils would be expected to be closer to 100 than the figure shows this may be attributed to the fact that these events are observed events where intensity will vary throughout the event where the most intense two hour period is used in the figure this means that the events also can contain less intense periods where little runoff is generated only two intense events one event with 15 4 mm in two hours and a total of 51 9 mm over 34 h one event with 24 7 mm in two hours and a total of 46 8 mm over 24 h had close to 100 runoff in both swmm and she this shows that the variability of rainfall within events makes it challenging to analyse the relationship between rainfall intensity and runoff using observed rainfall data for shallow sand soil she showed a group of events in which surface runoff increased roughly linearly with rainfall intensity which did not exist for the other models this is likely caused by high groundwater levels in the soil for clay soil events with an intensity of less than 15 mm in two hours were split into two groups for she one group with runoff of 75 and another group with less runoff but both groups showed a slight increase in runoff for increasing rainfall intensities for swmm it was mainly the first group that was visible for shallow clay soil and mainly the second group that was visible for deep clay soil for mouse there was no relation between rainfall intensity and runoff at all for any of the soils which may be attributed to the fact that mouse does not feature a limited infiltration rate like she and swmm 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to examine the differences in model structure of three models swmm she and mouse used for urban drainage and their impact on simulation outcomes this comparison was made for varying soil types and varying soil depths the differences found between the three different models are described below on a seasonal scale the differences between the models are large e g up to 33 percentage points for seasonal runoff for the same soil profile compared to those between different soil types mouse generates much more runoff than the other two models runoff in she and mouse is mainly sensitive to soil type and less so to soil depth while swmm is sensitive to both inter annual variation is higher in she and swmm than in mouse on an event basis the inter model variation of runoff generation is similar to the seasonal scale while statistical distributions of event percentage runoff are different while mouse predicts between 10 and 60 runoff for most events swmm and she mainly predict either less than 10 or more than 60 event runoff there was considerable inter event and inter model variation in the initial conditions for rainfall events the sensitivity to rainfall intensity for different soil types also varied between the three models the observed differences may be linked to differences in the model structures in mouse the relative root zone moisture content l lmax influences most of the important processes runoff generation infiltration groundwater recharge creating negative feedback loops which reduce the sensitivity of the model output to variations in soil type soil depth and meteorological conditions in swmm and she saturation of the top layer of soil can limit the maximum infiltration rate making runoff generation more sensitive to rainfall characteristics and increasing inter event and inter annual variation in the model outputs the main practical implications of these findings are that model structure should be regarded as an influential source of uncertainty in urban drainage modelling the differences in the simulation outcomes and in the responses of the models to changes in soil type and depth are large enough that they may significantly impact the outcome of various modelling studies in the special case of model forecasts e g studying the impacts of climate change or changing land use where calibration is per definition impossible the magnitude of the uncertainties arising from model structure should be explicitly considered in the analysis in addition the results from this paper further underline that green areas may contribute significantly to runoff in urban areas and should not be simply ignored even if different models are first calibrated to for example runoff measurements it cannot be expected that the results will be the same for other components of the water balance or in terms of inter event or inter annual variation the differences that were observed in the distribution of the event percentage runoff may also mean that different models may encounter different challenges while calibrating them to multiple events for example different trade offs between the different events might be necessary if flow rate data is available the values of the subset of parameters that are identifiable from flow rate data can be calibrated after this the approach shown in this paper can be used to estimate the range of model outcomes that is still possible for the different values of the parameters that were not identified from the flow data finally the results from this paper show that different models set up with the explicit goal of representing identical simple synthetic catchments may give strongly varying results thus the direct comparison of parameter values between models may not be meaningful declaration of

8601,groundwater management questions often require understanding how water levels respond to precipitation however direct observations of precipitation alone rarely explain variation in water levels this study introduces a modified method for comparing cumulative precipitation anomalies to groundwater level variation this method transformed gridded monthly precipitation data from 1895 to 2018 into monthly deviations from different moving mean lengths at 90 usgs groundwater monitoring locations in wisconsin the precipitation data was then compared to water level variation at each site and correlations were calculated the average optimal a priori moving mean window length for all sites was identified as 60 months fifty four percent of the monitoring wells were moderately to highly correlated the cumulative deviation from 60 month precipitation and fewer than 30 were uncorrelated well depth aquifer classification and location were tested as potential factors influencing the strength of correlation with groundwater levels and optimal mean length aquifer classification had no effect on correlation or optimal moving mean length indicating aquifer response rates are similar in both bedrock and unconsolidated aquifers correlation strength was also independent of well location well depth and casing in cambrian ordovician formations were the only variables with a weak but statistically significant effect on correlation between the precipitation deviation and water level this work illustrates how this method can help diagnose factors affecting monitoring well response identify inconsistencies in a monitoring record and generate hypotheses regarding aquifer response to precipitation this method leverages easily accessible datasets to serve as a starting point that engineers groundwater professionals and resources managers can use to generate and test hypotheses about sites without prior knowledge of the geology or aquifer properties extraction rates and land cover keywords water level time series recharge cumulative deviation aquifer response monitoring wells groundwater management 1 introduction groundwater levels vary for many reasons including water extractions land use change climate change and variation in weather the united states geological survey usgs actively measures groundwater levels in over 20 000 monitoring wells in the continental u s to observe and understand this variation usgs 2019a the data from these sites are crucial to our general understanding of water quantity and to the development of hydrogeologic conceptual models and groundwater flow models however the spatial and temporal coverage of these wells is highly heterogenous such that only 1405 wells in the nation have a monthly record over 30 years long and only 639 over 50 years furthermore over half of these active long term wells are located in seven states leaving a number of states with no active long term water level monitoring sites through usgs usgs 2019b this spatial and temporal heterogeneity of existing monitoring limits the ability of managers to derive conclusions about local or regional water levels from individual monitoring points taylor and alley 2001 yet even where monitoring data is available there are few resources to provide context to why or how groundwater levels in that location are changing this study proposes a transformation of easily accessed precipitation values to calculate a priori expected time series values for proximate water levels where water level data are sparse this approach can be used to provide context to isolated measurements and interpolate spatial and temporal gaps in the water level record where water level data are available comparing expected values to actual water level observations can help determine the degree to which an aquifer is responding to changes in precipitation furthermore when observed water level variations do not meet expected values based on precipitation this tool could support assessment and hypotheses development regarding the relationship between precipitation and water levels in many hydrogeological settings precipitation is the largest component of the water budget such that variation in precipitation should be expected to contribute substantially to variation in water levels if water levels in a system were independent of antecedent conditions and all other variables were held constant the precipitation anomaly the deviation of precipitation from its average could solely predict water level variation simply a wetter than average observation would predict an increase in water levels whereas a drier than average observation would predict decreased water levels however aquifer discharge rates are in part dependent on hydraulic head such that antecedent water levels play some role in determining how water levels respond to changes in precipitation for example if water levels and corresponding discharge rates are already high precipitation above the long term average could counterintuitively correlate with water level declines if it were below the recent average precipitation conversely if water levels and corresponding discharge rates are already low precipitation below the long term average could lead to water level increases if it were above the recent average precipitation therefore discrete precipitation anomalies do not always predict water level change because the water level in any period depends partially on the water level in preceding periods boswell and olyphant 2007 one method of accounting for antecedent precipitation or system memory is to sum the anomalies into a cumulative deviation or departure from mean cdm cdms have been used for some time in a range of scientific inquires acworth et al 2016 asoka et al 2017 volik et al 2017 and in professional reports patterson 1990 tibbals 1990 and often yield high correlation to water level variation mean precipitation p in a cdm for a sequence of precipitation observations p i with time step i and length n is calculated as p 1 n i 1 n p i weber and stewart 2004 the deviation d i is calculated for each time step by subtracting p from each observation in the period d i p i p so that if p i p the deviation d i is positive and if p i p then d i is negative these values are then summed in sequence cdm i j 1 i d j yielding a time series of the net surplus or deficit in precipitation at any point relative to the mean in water budget terms p i represents the deposits whereas the cdm i represents the running balance at any point although cdms often correlate well to observed water level change their application is limited by a critical sensitivity to the period of record used to calculate the mean this sensitivity creates several analytically awkward outcomes first if the period of record evaluated is the same as the period over which the mean was calculated the cdm time series will necessarily begin and end at zero unless water levels during the period of record arbitrarily happens to begin and end near average the cdm and water levels are unlikely to correlate well furthermore if there are extreme precipitation events or droughts near the beginning of a long time series the cdm may be driven so far above or below the deficit line such that there is no allowance for the resetting of the hydrologic system other than mathematically overcoming the accumulated deficit or surplus weber and stewart 2004 this is particularly problematic since new monitoring efforts often coincide with hydrological drought hayes et al 2012 using a cdm partially resolves the problem of incorporating antecedent precipitation to understand water levels but does not answer what length of time should be used to calculate average conditions the primary purpose of this study was to determine if a cdm derived from a moving mean can effectively predict variation in groundwater levels second the work presented here tested the sensitivity of the cdm to the moving mean length and identified an optimal starting value given no prior knowledge of the aquifer characteristics or response rate at any site these tests were done comparing usgs monitoring well levels in wisconsin to proximate cumulative deviation from moving mean precipitation 2 methods the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr usgs and the wisconsin geological and natural history survey wgnhs collaboratively fund and manage a network of approximately 100 groundwater level monitoring wells across the state of wisconsin the purpose of these wells is to track variation in groundwater levels in different aquifers and make the data available to the public advisory committee on water information subcommittee on ground water 2013 usgs staff are responsible for collecting groundwater level data from data loggers or with real time telemetry and making it publicly available via the national water information system nwis database the network is managed to achieve broad coverage of the state while also targeting areas with management challenges due to large volumes or high densities of groundwater extractions wisconsin geological and natural history survey 2019 these areas include the groundwater management areas in southeast and northeast wisconsin delineated by the wisconsin state legislature as well as the central wisconsin sand and gravel aquifer delineated by the wisconsin department of natural resources 2013 a primary purpose of the network is to maintain long term records of water levels but due to maintenance challenges variation in funding and immediate management needs monitoring wells are sometimes removed from or added to the network nwis currently has water level observations stored for 18 503 monitoring wells in wisconsin however many of these wells have very short records often with only one water level observation a subset of monitoring wells was selected that had a recent and relatively long term record 20 years defined as a first observation before 1995 01 01 and a most recent observation after 2015 01 01 of the 18 503 well sites 124 met these criteria this set was further narrowed to those sites with at least 30 observations in total 90 usgs monitoring wells had a long term record with enough observations depth to water level below land surface usgs parameter code 72019 data were then downloaded from nwis for each site using the r dataretrieval tool de cicco et al 2018 multiplied by 1 to represent a relative elevation and a mean depth to water was calculated for each month in which there was at least a single observation the groundwater monitoring network is designed to capture a range of aquifer properties found in wisconsin s different geological settings and this range is reflected in the wells used in this analysis the state is underlain by crystalline precambrian bedrock mostly granite quartzite or basalt it is at or near the surface in some parts of the state especially in the north but over 300 m deep in the southern part of the state with low water storage the precambrian is not a major aquifer in wisconsin and consequently there are no precambrian monitoring wells included in this analysis cambrian ordovician sandstone and dolomite lie atop the precambrian surface across the southern two thirds of wisconsin and is identified usgs national aquifer code s300camord much of the cambrian ordovician bedrock aquifer has high water yields and serves as the primary source for about half of wisconsin s municipal drinking water systems and for the majority of municipal systems that rely on groundwater meyer et al 2017 given the state s critical dependence on this resource nearly half 44 of the monitoring wells used in this study measure water levels in cambrian ordovician aquifers this aquifer is confined in some parts of the state particularly in the east more recently formed silurian dolomite overlays the cambrian ordovician bedrock in the easternmost part of wisconsin where limited devonian deposits are also occasionally found the silurian devonian dolomite aquifer designated usgs national aquifer code n400slrdvn has low water yields but is still is a major source aquifer for many municipal private residential and agricultural wells in the highly populated eastern part of the state this analysis uses 11 wells monitoring water levels in the silurian devonian dolomite the remaining 35 wells used in this study monitor water levels in the unconsolidated sand and gravel deposited by alluvial or glacial processes most of these unconsolidated aquifers designated usgs national aquifer code n100glcial are highly productive and are the water source for many private residential wells over 4000 high capacity irrigation wells and several municipal public water systems the coordinates of each selected monitoring site were used to extract precipitation data from the oregon state university prism climate group monthly gridded precipitation dataset from 1895 through the end of 2018 generating 1476 monthly observations for each coordinate pair prism climate group 2019 initially the r package geoknife published by usgs was used to extract monthly prism precipitation data for selected sites read et al 2016 this method for data exploration is included in the supporting r script available from the author upon request however to decrease internet processing time for the 90 sites for this analysis full grids were downloaded from the prism website and cropped to wisconsin monthly precipitation values for each site were extracted using the r raster package hijmans and van etten 2012 although prism precipitation data has a coarse temporal and spatial resolution prism estimates in the great lakes region were found to be accurate within and average 2 3 mm of annual measured rainfall behnke et al 2016 a goal of this study was to evaluate whether a moving mean cdm could effectively predict variation in water levels with no prior knowledge of aquifer characteristics or aquifer response rate at any site therefore a default moving mean length was needed to evaluate results across the set of selected sites to identify the optimal default mean length trailing moving mean precipitation time series were calculated for 90 monitoring well locations at different annual time periods using a 12 to 480 month moving windows where k is the moving mean window length 1 k 12 24 480 and the moving mean for each monthly time step i where the start month j is greater than zero 2 pk i 1 k j i k 1 i p j this calculation yielded 40 moving mean sequences for each site with a length of 1476 minus k after trimming the leading values needed to initialize the moving mean deviations from this moving mean were calculated as dk i p i pk i sequences of cumulative precipitation deviations were calculated for each site and each moving mean p 12 p 480 where i is the monthly time step starting at 1 and n is the last monthly index 3 cdmk i j 1 i dk j the raw monthly observed precipitation time series data was also included with the 40 moving mean calculation to identify wells that might respond directly to monthly variation regardless of antecedent conditions each of the 41 times series for the 90 sites were compared to the water level record at the corresponding site and the optimal mean length was identified as the one with the highest mean correlation with water levels across all sites in addition the differences between pearson s correlation coefficient ρ for each site s optimal window and the ρ for each of the remaining 40 windows were calculated to determine the decrease in correlation due to selecting a suboptimal moving mean window pearson correlation is a measure of the strength and direction of covariation between two variables ranging from 1 to 1 with 1 signifying perfect positive correlation 1 signifying perfect negative correlation and 0 indicating no correlation costa 2017 pearson correlation is used here instead of other more complex statistical measure because of its simplicity and common usage correlation coefficients ρ were tested against aquifer well depth casing depth and geographic location to identify any hydrogeological or geographic factors that might systematically affect differences in correlations for the sake of direct visual comparisons each site s cdm and water level were normalized using z scores z i x i μ σ where zero represents the long term average and z represents the number of standard deviations each observation is above or below the mean the optimal cdmk time series was then compared to water levels at all 90 long term monitoring well sites in wisconsin with a pearson s correlation all sites were grouped by wgnhs aquifer classification and the distributions of correlation coefficients for each group were compared with a one way anova the wgnhs aquifer classification was obtained from an unpublished database cataloging details of wisconsin s monitoring network that are not readily available in nwis wisconsin geological and natural history survey 2017 this classification was used instead of the nwis national aquifer code because it added an additional level of detail splitting aquifer s300camord into sandstone and galena platteville dolomite aquifer classifications moran s i measuring the distance weighted covariance of each point s ρ with all other points ρ ord and getis 1992 was calculated to determine if spatial distribution of correlation strength was randomly distributed linear regression was used to identify any relationship between total monitoring well depth d and the correlation coefficient ρ α β d linear regression was also used to identify any relationship between well casing depth c and the correlation coefficient ρ α β c 3 results the moving mean window with the highest mean correlation across all sites was 60 months with an average pearson s correlation coefficient ρ 0 47 the mean window with the lowest mean correlation across all sites was 480 months with an average ρ 0 407 the mean correlation for raw monthly observed precipitation was an average ρ 0 14 the principal effects of changing the moving mean length were to increase the annual amplitude of variation of the cdmk at shorter lengths and extend the duration of cdmk anomalies at longer lengths fig 1 the 60 month moving mean length cdm had the highest mean correlation with water level across all sites but it was not the optimal mean length for most sites fig 2 for example the optimal moving window length for burnett county well bt 39 16w 17 0002 in northwest wisconsin was 312 months with a correlation of ρ 0 80 by comparison the correlation between water level and precipitation at this site when using a mean length of 60 months was ρ 0 54 this was a ρ 0 16 less than the optimal 312 month mean length the window length with the smallest mean difference in ρ from each site s optimal mean length was the 60 month window with an average decrease of ρ 0 06 across all sites having established the 60 month mean as the average best overall predictor pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated comparing each of the 90 long term monitoring well site s monthly cdm60 values and observed monthly groundwater levels yielding a mean ρ 0 469 median ρ 0 531 and a range of ρ 0 279 to 0 915 table 1 for the purposes of summarizing wells were divided into three rough categories of moderate to high correlation ρ 0 50 low correlation 0 30 ρ 0 50 and negligible correlation ρ 0 30 hinkle et al 2003 fifty four percent n 49 of the wells included in this analysis had a moderate to high correlation ρ 0 50 between monthly groundwater level and the cdm60 visual comparisons of normalized water levels and the cdm60 demonstrate a distinct linear relationship between predicted and observed levels fig 3 notably monthly water level observations for this group tracked well with the cdm60 from the beginning of their record even though the cdm60 starts in 1905 and the time series for most wells did not start until decades later for the moderately to highly correlated wells where gaps in the groundwater record are present the record consistently stopped and restarted on track with the cdm60 here the correlation understates the effective fit between the cdm60 and water levels because it does not account for lags seasonal trend or long term trends in the time series yet the fact that the cdm60 closely matched monthly unsmoothed time series groundwater levels makes these results particularly compelling twenty percent of the wells in this study had poor correlation 0 30 ρ 0 5 n 18 with the cdm60 for the most part these water level observations track with the cdm60 series but have poor correlations due to the presence of unexplained outliers or distinct lags in water level response for example water levels for the monitoring well near lake wissota in northwest wi had a correlation of ρ 0 353 with the cdm60 series for the entire record but appeared to perform better in certain years fig 4 in this case excluding the anomalous years of 2001 2002 and 2011 2012 increased the correlation to ρ 0 533 the last group of wells 26 of the study sample had negligible correlation between the water level and the cdm60 ρ 0 30 n 23 in most cases these are wells that were not expected to be directly connected to precipitation variation for several reasons see appendix 1 for example the well is in a highly urbanized area in the alluvium of a major river system is in a highly confined aquifer has hydraulic head substantially above the land surface or is located near large groundwater withdrawals an example with low correlation is the 107 meter deep monitoring well located in the basement of the wisconsin state capital that is finished in cambrian sandstone it is located in an aquifer with significant drawdown at the center of a highly urbanized area parsen et al 2016 the well s water level had a correlation of ρ 0 25 with the cdm60 fig 5 by comparison six other monitoring wells in the madison area had water level correlations with cdm60 ranging from ρ 0 61 to 0 85 with correlations increasing with distance from the city center and municipal water supply wells anova results showed no statistically significant differences in the distribution of correlation strength between the cdm60 and water levels based on national aquifer code f 2 87 1 74 p 0 182 similarly anova results showed no statistically significant differences in the distribution of correlation strength between the cdm60 and water levels based on wgnhs aquifer code f 4 85 1 64 p 0 17 additionally no spatial autocorrelation was found statewide between

groundwater levels analyzed were moderately to highly correlated with the cdm60 calculations with another 20 showing poor correlation see appendix 2 for supplementary figures correlations decreased with well depth for those wells finished in sandstone aquifers other than sandstone well depth no well features were identified that impacted the effectiveness of the cdm60 in predicting groundwater level variation however results of this study may be limited by wisconsin s relative flat topographical range 475 585 m above sea level and the fact 80 of wells in this study are relatively shallow with total depth less than 100 m 4 discussion the cdm60 can be used as a simple and effective correlate to groundwater variation for many of the sites investigated in wisconsin while the results confirmed the somewhat obvious expectation that precipitation is a main driver of water level variation additional utility for the cdm60 is derived from cases where it is not effective the following examples suggest how the cdm60 can be used to identify factors interfering with or confounding the connection between proximate precipitation and the measured groundwater level in certain locations monitoring wells have been installed where aquitards have exacerbated pumping impacts by disconnecting the water level from proximate precipitation for example in the southeast wisconsin groundwater management areas regional extractions in wisconsin and illinois below the maquoketa shale aquitard have caused significant drawdown in the cambrian ordovician aquifer feinstein et al 2004 when comparing the observed water level to cdm60 the absence of correlation is pronounced as the aquifer declines without relation to changes in precipitation fig 8 in other situations the location of a monitoring well may amplify aquifer response relative to precipitation for example monitoring well sw 41 09w 28 0007 at hayward wi was poorly correlated with cdm60 ρ 0 431 despite no known local impacts or confining units visual inspection of the time series comparison showed groundwater level tracking somewhat with precipitation but much noisier than the cdm60 signal fig 9 simply smoothing the groundwater level observations with a 12 month trailing moving mean increased the correlation from ρ 0 431 to ρ 0 671 this transformation not only improved model fit but also provided some insights into the response of this monitoring well to precipitation fig 10 in this case the well is completed in unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits located less than 100 m from the namekagon river mean discharge 3 7 m3 s this yields a testable hypothesis that the noisiness in the groundwater level is being caused in part by fluctuations in nearby river stage another example of the diagnostic utility of this tool is identifying incongruities in the groundwater level record one of the oldest mostly continuous recorded observation wells in wisconsin s monitoring network is located on the university of wisconsin hancock agricultural research station in central wisconsin this well is finished in unconsolidated sand and gravel 7 6 m below the land surface with an average depth to water of 3 4 m it is in an area of extensive irrigated agriculture and groundwater level monitoring began on this well in 1951 the correlation between groundwater level and cdm60 was low ρ 0 239 despite tracking reasonably well with the cdm60 until a sharp break in 2000 fig 11 this distinction is clear in the scatter plot with pre and post 2000 observations appearing in two distinct groups with the later cdm60 observations overpredicting groundwater level given the high volume of extractions in this area since the 1960 s pumping impacts were suspected but did not conceptually comport with the sharp break apparent in the record a review of historical documentation for the well revealed that the original monitoring well was abandoned and replaced in 2000 because a slug test indicated it was no longer well connected to the aquifer batten et al 2000 splitting the water level record and cdm60 into a pre and post 2000 period and reevaluating significantly improved performance of the cdm60 fig 12 the pre 2000 period correlation increased to ρ 0 690 and the post 2000 correlation improved to ρ 0 853 5 conclusion the cdmk transforms a single easily accessible variable monthly precipitation into a useful a priori predictor of relative groundwater level the most direct use of the cdmk may be to add context to groundwater level observations so that spot measurements can be contextualized as likely high or low based solely on recent precipitation this method could be useful in planning activities affected by water levels such as septic ordinances manure storage construction sanitary sewer planning design groundwater remediation or road construction additionally applying seasonal decomposition detrending and cross correlation factors to the cdmk will likely improve model fit such that it can be used as the basis for short term water level forecasting smail 2017 finally the cdmk can be used to assess the degree to which proximate precipitation variation drives variation in water levels and can potentially be used to interpolate or impute missing values in seepage lake levels with sparse datasets hein et al 2019 application of the cdmk does not forego the need for detailed examination of well construction lithology and aquifer properties to accurately understand water level variation at a given location yet where groundwater data is sparse the cdmk provides context and a starting point to begin asking questions that can be answered with more rigorous methods where groundwater level data is available the cdmk serves as a point of comparison to determine how an aquifer responds to proximate precipitation and generate testable hypotheses about aquifer behavior credit authorship contribution statement robert

8601,groundwater management questions often require understanding how water levels respond to precipitation however direct observations of precipitation alone rarely explain variation in water levels this study introduces a modified method for comparing cumulative precipitation anomalies to groundwater level variation this method transformed gridded monthly precipitation data from 1895 to 2018 into monthly deviations from different moving mean lengths at 90 usgs groundwater monitoring locations in wisconsin the precipitation data was then compared to water level variation at each site and correlations were calculated the average optimal a priori moving mean window length for all sites was identified as 60 months fifty four percent of the monitoring wells were moderately to highly correlated the cumulative deviation from 60 month precipitation and fewer than 30 were uncorrelated well depth aquifer classification and location were tested as potential factors influencing the strength of correlation with groundwater levels and optimal mean length aquifer classification had no effect on correlation or optimal moving mean length indicating aquifer response rates are similar in both bedrock and unconsolidated aquifers correlation strength was also independent of well location well depth and casing in cambrian ordovician formations were the only variables with a weak but statistically significant effect on correlation between the precipitation deviation and water level this work illustrates how this method can help diagnose factors affecting monitoring well response identify inconsistencies in a monitoring record and generate hypotheses regarding aquifer response to precipitation this method leverages easily accessible datasets to serve as a starting point that engineers groundwater professionals and resources managers can use to generate and test hypotheses about sites without prior knowledge of the geology or aquifer properties extraction rates and land cover keywords water level time series recharge cumulative deviation aquifer response monitoring wells groundwater management 1 introduction groundwater levels vary for many reasons including water extractions land use change climate change and variation in weather the united states geological survey usgs actively measures groundwater levels in over 20 000 monitoring wells in the continental u s to observe and understand this variation usgs 2019a the data from these sites are crucial to our general understanding of water quantity and to the development of hydrogeologic conceptual models and groundwater flow models however the spatial and temporal coverage of these wells is highly heterogenous such that only 1405 wells in the nation have a monthly record over 30 years long and only 639 over 50 years furthermore over half of these active long term wells are located in seven states leaving a number of states with no active long term water level monitoring sites through usgs usgs 2019b this spatial and temporal heterogeneity of existing monitoring limits the ability of managers to derive conclusions about local or regional water levels from individual monitoring points taylor and alley 2001 yet even where monitoring data is available there are few resources to provide context to why or how groundwater levels in that location are changing this study proposes a transformation of easily accessed precipitation values to calculate a priori expected time series values for proximate water levels where water level data are sparse this approach can be used to provide context to isolated measurements and interpolate spatial and temporal gaps in the water level record where water level data are available comparing expected values to actual water level observations can help determine the degree to which an aquifer is responding to changes in precipitation furthermore when observed water level variations do not meet expected values based on precipitation this tool could support assessment and hypotheses development regarding the relationship between precipitation and water levels in many hydrogeological settings precipitation is the largest component of the water budget such that variation in precipitation should be expected to contribute substantially to variation in water levels if water levels in a system were independent of antecedent conditions and all other variables were held constant the precipitation anomaly the deviation of precipitation from its average could solely predict water level variation simply a wetter than average observation would predict an increase in water levels whereas a drier than average observation would predict decreased water levels however aquifer discharge rates are in part dependent on hydraulic head such that antecedent water levels play some role in determining how water levels respond to changes in precipitation for example if water levels and corresponding discharge rates are already high precipitation above the long term average could counterintuitively correlate with water level declines if it were below the recent average precipitation conversely if water levels and corresponding discharge rates are already low precipitation below the long term average could lead to water level increases if it were above the recent average precipitation therefore discrete precipitation anomalies do not always predict water level change because the water level in any period depends partially on the water level in preceding periods boswell and olyphant 2007 one method of accounting for antecedent precipitation or system memory is to sum the anomalies into a cumulative deviation or departure from mean cdm cdms have been used for some time in a range of scientific inquires acworth et al 2016 asoka et al 2017 volik et al 2017 and in professional reports patterson 1990 tibbals 1990 and often yield high correlation to water level variation mean precipitation p in a cdm for a sequence of precipitation observations p i with time step i and length n is calculated as p 1 n i 1 n p i weber and stewart 2004 the deviation d i is calculated for each time step by subtracting p from each observation in the period d i p i p so that if p i p the deviation d i is positive and if p i p then d i is negative these values are then summed in sequence cdm i j 1 i d j yielding a time series of the net surplus or deficit in precipitation at any point relative to the mean in water budget terms p i represents the deposits whereas the cdm i represents the running balance at any point although cdms often correlate well to observed water level change their application is limited by a critical sensitivity to the period of record used to calculate the mean this sensitivity creates several analytically awkward outcomes first if the period of record evaluated is the same as the period over which the mean was calculated the cdm time series will necessarily begin and end at zero unless water levels during the period of record arbitrarily happens to begin and end near average the cdm and water levels are unlikely to correlate well furthermore if there are extreme precipitation events or droughts near the beginning of a long time series the cdm may be driven so far above or below the deficit line such that there is no allowance for the resetting of the hydrologic system other than mathematically overcoming the accumulated deficit or surplus weber and stewart 2004 this is particularly problematic since new monitoring efforts often coincide with hydrological drought hayes et al 2012 using a cdm partially resolves the problem of incorporating antecedent precipitation to understand water levels but does not answer what length of time should be used to calculate average conditions the primary purpose of this study was to determine if a cdm derived from a moving mean can effectively predict variation in groundwater levels second the work presented here tested the sensitivity of the cdm to the moving mean length and identified an optimal starting value given no prior knowledge of the aquifer characteristics or response rate at any site these tests were done comparing usgs monitoring well levels in wisconsin to proximate cumulative deviation from moving mean precipitation 2 methods the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr usgs and the wisconsin geological and natural history survey wgnhs collaboratively fund and manage a network of approximately 100 groundwater level monitoring wells across the state of wisconsin the purpose of these wells is to track variation in groundwater levels in different aquifers and make the data available to the public advisory committee on water information subcommittee on ground water 2013 usgs staff are responsible for collecting groundwater level data from data loggers or with real time telemetry and making it publicly available via the national water information system nwis database the network is managed to achieve broad coverage of the state while also targeting areas with management challenges due to large volumes or high densities of groundwater extractions wisconsin geological and natural history survey 2019 these areas include the groundwater management areas in southeast and northeast wisconsin delineated by the wisconsin state legislature as well as the central wisconsin sand and gravel aquifer delineated by the wisconsin department of natural resources 2013 a primary purpose of the network is to maintain long term records of water levels but due to maintenance challenges variation in funding and immediate management needs monitoring wells are sometimes removed from or added to the network nwis currently has water level observations stored for 18 503 monitoring wells in wisconsin however many of these wells have very short records often with only one water level observation a subset of monitoring wells was selected that had a recent and relatively long term record 20 years defined as a first observation before 1995 01 01 and a most recent observation after 2015 01 01 of the 18 503 well sites 124 met these criteria this set was further narrowed to those sites with at least 30 observations in total 90 usgs monitoring wells had a long term record with enough observations depth to water level below land surface usgs parameter code 72019 data were then downloaded from nwis for each site using the r dataretrieval tool de cicco et al 2018 multiplied by 1 to represent a relative elevation and a mean depth to water was calculated for each month in which there was at least a single observation the groundwater monitoring network is designed to capture a range of aquifer properties found in wisconsin s different geological settings and this range is reflected in the wells used in this analysis the state is underlain by crystalline precambrian bedrock mostly granite quartzite or basalt it is at or near the surface in some parts of the state especially in the north but over 300 m deep in the southern part of the state with low water storage the precambrian is not a major aquifer in wisconsin and consequently there are no precambrian monitoring wells included in this analysis cambrian ordovician sandstone and dolomite lie atop the precambrian surface across the southern two thirds of wisconsin and is identified usgs national aquifer code s300camord much of the cambrian ordovician bedrock aquifer has high water yields and serves as the primary source for about half of wisconsin s municipal drinking water systems and for the majority of municipal systems that rely on groundwater meyer et al 2017 given the state s critical dependence on this resource nearly half 44 of the monitoring wells used in this study measure water levels in cambrian ordovician aquifers this aquifer is confined in some parts of the state particularly in the east more recently formed silurian dolomite overlays the cambrian ordovician bedrock in the easternmost part of wisconsin where limited devonian deposits are also occasionally found the silurian devonian dolomite aquifer designated usgs national aquifer code n400slrdvn has low water yields but is still is a major source aquifer for many municipal private residential and agricultural wells in the highly populated eastern part of the state this analysis uses 11 wells monitoring water levels in the silurian devonian dolomite the remaining 35 wells used in this study monitor water levels in the unconsolidated sand and gravel deposited by alluvial or glacial processes most of these unconsolidated aquifers designated usgs national aquifer code n100glcial are highly productive and are the water source for many private residential wells over 4000 high capacity irrigation wells and several municipal public water systems the coordinates of each selected monitoring site were used to extract precipitation data from the oregon state university prism climate group monthly gridded precipitation dataset from 1895 through the end of 2018 generating 1476 monthly observations for each coordinate pair prism climate group 2019 initially the r package geoknife published by usgs was used to extract monthly prism precipitation data for selected sites read et al 2016 this method for data exploration is included in the supporting r script available from the author upon request however to decrease internet processing time for the 90 sites for this analysis full grids were downloaded from the prism website and cropped to wisconsin monthly precipitation values for each site were extracted using the r raster package hijmans and van etten 2012 although prism precipitation data has a coarse temporal and spatial resolution prism estimates in the great lakes region were found to be accurate within and average 2 3 mm of annual measured rainfall behnke et al 2016 a goal of this study was to evaluate whether a moving mean cdm could effectively predict variation in water levels with no prior knowledge of aquifer characteristics or aquifer response rate at any site therefore a default moving mean length was needed to evaluate results across the set of selected sites to identify the optimal default mean length trailing moving mean precipitation time series were calculated for 90 monitoring well locations at different annual time periods using a 12 to 480 month moving windows where k is the moving mean window length 1 k 12 24 480 and the moving mean for each monthly time step i where the start month j is greater than zero 2 pk i 1 k j i k 1 i p j this calculation yielded 40 moving mean sequences for each site with a length of 1476 minus k after trimming the leading values needed to initialize the moving mean deviations from this moving mean were calculated as dk i p i pk i sequences of cumulative precipitation deviations were calculated for each site and each moving mean p 12 p 480 where i is the monthly time step starting at 1 and n is the last monthly index 3 cdmk i j 1 i dk j the raw monthly observed precipitation time series data was also included with the 40 moving mean calculation to identify wells that might respond directly to monthly variation regardless of antecedent conditions each of the 41 times series for the 90 sites were compared to the water level record at the corresponding site and the optimal mean length was identified as the one with the highest mean correlation with water levels across all sites in addition the differences between pearson s correlation coefficient ρ for each site s optimal window and the ρ for each of the remaining 40 windows were calculated to determine the decrease in correlation due to selecting a suboptimal moving mean window pearson correlation is a measure of the strength and direction of covariation between two variables ranging from 1 to 1 with 1 signifying perfect positive correlation 1 signifying perfect negative correlation and 0 indicating no correlation costa 2017 pearson correlation is used here instead of other more complex statistical measure because of its simplicity and common usage correlation coefficients ρ were tested against aquifer well depth casing depth and geographic location to identify any hydrogeological or geographic factors that might systematically affect differences in correlations for the sake of direct visual comparisons each site s cdm and water level were normalized using z scores z i x i μ σ where zero represents the long term average and z represents the number of standard deviations each observation is above or below the mean the optimal cdmk time series was then compared to water levels at all 90 long term monitoring well sites in wisconsin with a pearson s correlation all sites were grouped by wgnhs aquifer classification and the distributions of correlation coefficients for each group were compared with a one way anova the wgnhs aquifer classification was obtained from an unpublished database cataloging details of wisconsin s monitoring network that are not readily available in nwis wisconsin geological and natural history survey 2017 this classification was used instead of the nwis national aquifer code because it added an additional level of detail splitting aquifer s300camord into sandstone and galena platteville dolomite aquifer classifications moran s i measuring the distance weighted covariance of each point s ρ with all other points ρ ord and getis 1992 was calculated to determine if spatial distribution of correlation strength was randomly distributed linear regression was used to identify any relationship between total monitoring well depth d and the correlation coefficient ρ α β d linear regression was also used to identify any relationship between well casing depth c and the correlation coefficient ρ α β c 3 results the moving mean window with the highest mean correlation across all sites was 60 months with an average pearson s correlation coefficient ρ 0 47 the mean window with the lowest mean correlation across all sites was 480 months with an average ρ 0 407 the mean correlation for raw monthly observed precipitation was an average ρ 0 14 the principal effects of changing the moving mean length were to increase the annual amplitude of variation of the cdmk at shorter lengths and extend the duration of cdmk anomalies at longer lengths fig 1 the 60 month moving mean length cdm had the highest mean correlation with water level across all sites but it was not the optimal mean length for most sites fig 2 for example the optimal moving window length for burnett county well bt 39 16w 17 0002 in northwest wisconsin was 312 months with a correlation of ρ 0 80 by comparison the correlation between water level and precipitation at this site when using a mean length of 60 months was ρ 0 54 this was a ρ 0 16 less than the optimal 312 month mean length the window length with the smallest mean difference in ρ from each site s optimal mean length was the 60 month window with an average decrease of ρ 0 06 across all sites having established the 60 month mean as the average best overall predictor pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated comparing each of the 90 long term monitoring well site s monthly cdm60 values and observed monthly groundwater levels yielding a mean ρ 0 469 median ρ 0 531 and a range of ρ 0 279 to 0 915 table 1 for the purposes of summarizing wells were divided into three rough categories of moderate to high correlation ρ 0 50 low correlation 0 30 ρ 0 50 and negligible correlation ρ 0 30 hinkle et al 2003 fifty four percent n 49 of the wells included in this analysis had a moderate to high correlation ρ 0 50 between monthly groundwater level and the cdm60 visual comparisons of normalized water levels and the cdm60 demonstrate a distinct linear relationship between predicted and observed levels fig 3 notably monthly water level observations for this group tracked well with the cdm60 from the beginning of their record even though the cdm60 starts in 1905 and the time series for most wells did not start until decades later for the moderately to highly correlated wells where gaps in the groundwater record are present the record consistently stopped and restarted on track with the cdm60 here the correlation understates the effective fit between the cdm60 and water levels because it does not account for lags seasonal trend or long term trends in the time series yet the fact that the cdm60 closely matched monthly unsmoothed time series groundwater levels makes these results particularly compelling twenty percent of the wells in this study had poor correlation 0 30 ρ 0 5 n 18 with the cdm60 for the most part these water level observations track with the cdm60 series but have poor correlations due to the presence of unexplained outliers or distinct lags in water level response for example water levels for the monitoring well near lake wissota in northwest wi had a correlation of ρ 0 353 with the cdm60 series for the entire record but appeared to perform better in certain years fig 4 in this case excluding the anomalous years of 2001 2002 and 2011 2012 increased the correlation to ρ 0 533 the last group of wells 26 of the study sample had negligible correlation between the water level and the cdm60 ρ 0 30 n 23 in most cases these are wells that were not expected to be directly connected to precipitation variation for several reasons see appendix 1 for example the well is in a highly urbanized area in the alluvium of a major river system is in a highly confined aquifer has hydraulic head substantially above the land surface or is located near large groundwater withdrawals an example with low correlation is the 107 meter deep monitoring well located in the basement of the wisconsin state capital that is finished in cambrian sandstone it is located in an aquifer with significant drawdown at the center of a highly urbanized area parsen et al 2016 the well s water level had a correlation of ρ 0 25 with the cdm60 fig 5 by comparison six other monitoring wells in the madison area had water level correlations with cdm60 ranging from ρ 0 61 to 0 85 with correlations increasing with distance from the city center and municipal water supply wells anova results showed no statistically significant differences in the distribution of correlation strength between the cdm60 and water levels based on national aquifer code f 2 87 1 74 p 0 182 similarly anova results showed no statistically significant differences in the distribution of correlation strength between the cdm60 and water levels based on wgnhs aquifer code f 4 85 1 64 p 0 17 additionally no spatial autocorrelation was found statewide between correlation and location moran s i 0 404 z 1 284 p 0 20 fig 6 across all sites monitoring well depth had a weak but statistically significant negative effect on correlation coefficient β 0 0003 r2 0

that wells with shallower casing depth are slightly more correlated with the cdm60 than wells with deeper casing fig 7 similar to total well depth casing depth was only statistically significant for

groundwater levels analyzed were moderately to highly correlated with the cdm60 calculations with another 20 showing poor correlation see appendix 2 for supplementary figures correlations decreased with well depth for those wells finished in sandstone aquifers other than sandstone well depth no well features were identified that impacted the effectiveness of the cdm60 in predicting groundwater level variation however results of this study may be limited by wisconsin s relative flat topographical range 475 585 m above sea level and the fact 80 of wells in this study are relatively shallow with total depth less than 100 m 4 discussion the cdm60 can be used as a simple and effective correlate to groundwater variation for many of the sites investigated in wisconsin while the results confirmed the somewhat obvious expectation that precipitation is a main driver of water level variation additional utility for the cdm60 is derived from cases where it is not effective the following examples suggest how the cdm60 can be used to identify factors interfering with or confounding the connection between proximate precipitation and the measured groundwater level in certain locations monitoring wells have been installed where aquitards have exacerbated pumping impacts by disconnecting the water level from proximate precipitation for example in the southeast wisconsin groundwater management areas regional extractions in wisconsin and illinois below the maquoketa shale aquitard have caused significant drawdown in the cambrian ordovician aquifer feinstein et al 2004 when comparing the observed water level to cdm60 the absence of correlation is pronounced as the aquifer declines without relation to changes in precipitation fig 8 in other situations the location of a monitoring well may amplify aquifer response relative to precipitation for example monitoring well sw 41 09w 28 0007 at hayward wi was poorly correlated with cdm60 ρ 0 431 despite no known local impacts or confining units visual inspection of the time series comparison showed groundwater level tracking somewhat with precipitation but much noisier than the cdm60 signal fig 9 simply smoothing the groundwater level observations with a 12 month trailing moving mean increased the correlation from ρ 0 431 to ρ 0 671 this transformation not only improved model fit but also provided some insights into the response of this monitoring well to precipitation fig 10 in this case the well is completed in unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits located less than 100 m from the namekagon river mean discharge 3 7 m3 s this yields a testable hypothesis that the noisiness in the groundwater level is being caused in part by fluctuations in nearby river stage another example of the diagnostic utility of this tool is identifying incongruities in the groundwater level record one of the oldest mostly continuous recorded observation wells in wisconsin s monitoring network is located on the university of wisconsin hancock agricultural research station in central wisconsin this well is finished in unconsolidated sand and gravel 7 6 m below the land surface with an average depth to water of 3 4 m it is in an area of extensive irrigated agriculture and groundwater level monitoring began on this well in 1951 the correlation between groundwater level and cdm60 was low ρ 0 239 despite tracking reasonably well with the cdm60 until a sharp break in 2000 fig 11 this distinction is clear in the scatter plot with pre and post 2000 observations appearing in two distinct groups with the later cdm60 observations overpredicting groundwater level given the high volume of extractions in this area since the 1960 s pumping impacts were suspected but did not conceptually comport with the sharp break apparent in the record a review of historical documentation for the well revealed that the original monitoring well was abandoned and replaced in 2000 because a slug test indicated it was no longer well connected to the aquifer batten et al 2000 splitting the water level record and cdm60 into a pre and post 2000 period and reevaluating significantly improved performance of the cdm60 fig 12 the pre 2000 period correlation increased to ρ 0 690 and the post 2000 correlation improved to ρ 0 853 5 conclusion the cdmk transforms a single easily accessible variable monthly precipitation into a useful a priori predictor of relative groundwater level the most direct use of the cdmk may be to add context to groundwater level observations so that spot measurements can be contextualized as likely high or low based solely on recent precipitation this method could be useful in planning activities affected by water levels such as septic ordinances manure storage construction sanitary sewer planning design groundwater remediation or road construction additionally applying seasonal decomposition detrending and cross correlation factors to the cdmk will likely improve model fit such that it can be used as the basis for short term water level forecasting smail 2017 finally the cdmk can be used to assess the degree to which proximate precipitation variation drives variation in water levels and can potentially be used to interpolate or impute missing values in seepage lake levels with sparse datasets hein et al 2019 application of the cdmk does not forego the need for detailed examination of well construction lithology and aquifer properties to accurately understand water level variation at a given location yet where groundwater data is sparse the cdmk provides context and a starting point to begin asking questions that can be answered with more rigorous methods where groundwater level data is available the cdmk serves as a point of comparison to determine how an aquifer responds to proximate precipitation and generate testable hypotheses about aquifer behavior credit authorship contribution statement robert

8602,peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition they are characterized by a near surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes influenced by short term meteorological and long term climate variations among other factors site specific conditions such as peat hydrodynamic properties surface vegetation patterns and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics the objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths wtd and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the st lawrence lowlands southern quebec canada up gradient mid gradient and down gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands using dipwells with hourly wtd recordings wtd was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands additionally heads in the outflow i e receiving diffused water from the peatland and inflow i e providing diffused water to the peatland zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1 4 10 7 and 8 5 10 3 cm s whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5 6 10 7 and 3 9 10 6 cm s evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases mcd while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases mci a strong correlation was found between mean peatland wtd and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage this study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling wtd as found for those located in the st lawrence lowlands the results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on mci and mcd moreover this work shows that wtd in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones and confirms that aquifer peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels keywords peatland aquifer water table depth water table fluctuation hydrogeological setting meteorological conditions climate change vulnerability 1 introduction peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition they are characterized by near surface water tables controlled by many factors including meteorological short term and climate long term conditions schonong et al

lukenbach et al 2015 and autogenic ecological processes belyea and clymo 2001 swindles et al 2012 net water balance precipitation minus evapotranspiration is recognized to strongly influence short term water table fluctuations wtf labadz et al 2010 past water table depth wtd reconstructed using testate amoebae has been found to correlate with mean annual temperature schonong et al 2005 payne 2014 and summer moisture deficit has been shown elsewhere to best explain wtd over the long term charman 2007 although the hydrogeological setting in which a peatland developed is also known to influence wtd winter 1999 winter 2001 dimitrov et al 2014 lukenbach et al 2015 few studies have attempted to understand the concurrent relative influences of meteorological conditions and hydrogeological setting on peatland water table dynamics peat hydrodynamic properties control the velocity of water circulating through the horizons morris et al 2019 it has been shown that peat ksat rosa and larocque 2008 morris et al 2015 and peat sy vorob ev 1963 moore et al 2015 bourgault et al 2018 can markedly decrease with depth within the top meter this vertical variability exerts a strong control on wtf waddington et al 2015 for instance as wtd increases smaller amounts of rainfall are needed to trigger a water table increase inversely when wtd is shallow a larger amount of rainfall is needed to raise the water table until a threshold is reached and additional precipitation cannot be stored bourgault et al 2018 have shown that vertical variations in peat sy and ksat do not differ significantly between peatlands and thus cannot explain the observed differences in wtd this suggests that peatland connectivity to adjacent mineral deposits determined by the hydrogeological setting in which the peatland developed may be an important control of wtd the hydrogeological setting of a peatland is defined by the nature and hydraulic conductivity of the geological material adjacent to and underlying the organic deposits peatlands can exist in different geological settings ranging from highly permeable quaternary sand deposits rossi et al 2012 bourgault et al 2014 to low permeability sediments such as silt clay or compact till ferlatte et al 2015 to bedrock branfireun and roulet 1998 levison et al 2014 peatlands can be found in a variety of geomorphic settings

landscapes in which aquifer peatland interactions arise numerical flow modelling quantifies these interactions and surface vegetation and geochemical indicators help to locate them overall some peatlands have been found to be groundwater dependent while others are not ivanov 1981 kløve et al 2011 improved understanding of the factors that differentiate groundwater dependent peatlands gdp kløve et al 2011 from groundwater independent peatlands gip is crucial since exchanged flows are expected to be an important control of peatland wtd connections between adjacent mineral deposits and a peatland can also be indirect through pressure re equilibration between the organic deposits and the adjacent mineral deposits this process has been suggested to be an important mechanism to maintain

peatland which developed over a diamicton dominated by a clayey silt matrix fig 2g 3 methodology 3 1 water level monitoring and hydraulic testing the peatlands composed of a central ombrotrophic section surrounded by a minerotrophic section sites ch sse and vr were divided into six zones up gradient 1 mid gradient 2 down gradient 3 minerotrophic 4 inflow 5 and outflow 6 see fig 2a the ombrotrophic peatlands with no minerotrophic section sites ltf lcy vic and iso were divided into four zones up gradient 1 mid gradient 2 down gradient 3 and outflow zones 6 see fig 2e within each peatland up gradient highest altitude and down gradient lowest altitude zones were located along a longitudinal transect while the mid gradient zone was located halfway between the two all of the zones were identified by manual water table and hydraulic head measurements the inflow zones were located outside the peatlands in the adjacent mineral deposits typically at a higher elevation and characterized by a higher water table than that of the peatland they were found exclusively where minerotrophic zones were present and were therefore used as a criterion to identify gdps minerotrophic zones were identified using surface vegetation nutrient and ph indicators during field work rydin and jeglum 2006 the outflow zones were also located outside the peatlands and were characterized by a lower water table compared to the peatland both inflow and outflow zones were identified using manual water table measurements in the adjacent mineral deposits wtd was not measured in the inflow zone of ch see fig 2a because of the technical difficulties related to the fractured bedrock aquifer at ltf see fig 2b the wtd of the outflow zone was not measured because it was located in impervious clay at lcy see fig 2d the wtd was not measured in the mid gradient zone because of the small distance between the up gradient and down gradient zones wtd was therefore measured at six locations at sse and vr see fig 2c and 2f at five locations at ch see fig 2a at four locations at vic and iso see fig 2e and 2g and at three locations at ltf and lcy see fig 2b and 2d wtd was measured in dipwells constructed from 3 cm outside diameter pvc pipes with 2 m long intakes perforated with 0 254 mm slits spaced equally every 60 mm from top to bottom and sealed at the base in the up gradient mid gradient and down gradient zones the wells were inserted into sphagnum lawn microforms the altitude of the dipwells was surveyed multiple times during the study and no drift was measured the piezometers were inserted into the adjacent mineral deposits 500 m from the edge of the peatland the piezometers were constructed from 3 cm outside diameter steel pipes sealed at the base with a 30 cm solinst drive point they were driven into the mineral sediments using a manual slide hammer with the exception of at ch where the piezometer was installed in a borehole drilled as part of a previous study levison et al 2014 the piezometers were installed 2 m below the field measured wtd see red well screens in fig 2 wtfs in the peatland dipwells and head variations in the outflow and inflow zone piezometers were monitored hourly using level loggers solinst from june 2014 to may 2016 to compare the different sites water level measurements in the outflow and inflow zones were normalized using z scores and wtfs in the peatlands were reported relative to the peat surface at measurement locations slug tests were performed to measure the ksat of the mineral deposits in the inflow and outflow zones using the hvorslev method hvorslev 1951 a minimum of ten slug tests were performed for each piezometer in the outflow zones slug tests were performed at depths of 300 cm for ch 205 cm for sse 193 cm for lcy 281 cm for vic 423 cm for vr and 161 cm for iso these depths were chosen to vary between sites to be close to the maximum wtd recorded at each site during outflow zone monitoring that took place during summer 2013 in the inflow zones slug tests were performed at a depth of 300 cm for sse and 220 cm for vr ksat values for the fractured bedrock at ch are those reported in levison et al 2014 3 2 time series analysis every water table increase linked to a single precipitation event and every water table decrease initiated by pet and lateral water circulation was isolated using the techniques described in bourgault et al 2016 first a computation script written in the r programming language r environement d c t 2008 was used to identify the maximum water table rise following each precipitation event the code calculated total precipitation during the event pevent the maximum water level rise following the event δhrise and the time interval between pevent and δhrise water table decreases were isolated by removing time periods between pevent and δhrise from each water table time series the difference between the maximum and minimum water table height δhdrawdown was computed δhrise and δhdrawdown were cumulated monthly leading to two new variables the monthly cumulative increase mci and the monthly cumulative decrease mcd the data were analyzed to evaluate whether tmonth and pmonth could be used as indicators of mci and mcd in dargie et al 2017 mci correlated strongly with pmonth for wtds above the peat surface however mci has never been used for peatlands where wtd is below the surface likewise the use of mcd as an indicator of the effect of pet considered to be proportional to air temperature has never been reported in the literature linear correlations were performed between tmonth and mcd and pmonth and mci autocorrelation r k and cross correlation rxy k functions were calculated using the hourly water table measurements over periods of 25 days 600 h from june 2014 to june 2016 the autocorrelation functions were calculated for both the ombrotrophic sections of the peatlands and the outflow zones of the adjacent mineral deposits the autocorrelation function is useful to differentiate water table reactivity i e a rapid decrease of r k over time is associated with a reactive water table the time lag equivalent to an r k value of 0 7 was arbitrarily used to compare the slopes of the autocorrelation functions of the seven sites the rxy k functions were calculated between wtd in the up gradient zone of the peatland zone 1 in fig 2 and wtd in the outflow zone of the adjacent mineral deposits zone 6 in fig 2 the lag time between the two time series is quantified as the maximum value of the cross correlation 4 results 4 1 water table depths and water table fluctuations results from this study and from data compiled from bourgault et al 2018 reveal significant differences anova p value 10 14 tukey s test p value 10 10 between wtds of the seven studied peatlands for all peatlands wtd varied between 54 cm below peat surface at lcy fig 3 and 1 cm above peat surface at iso fig 3 with wtf varying between 21 cm iso and 38 cm lcy wtds were closer to the surface in april and were deeper in august and september see supplementary material table 5 wtd in the minerotrophic zones of ch sse and vr was between 22 cm and 17 cm and wtf varied between 11 and 22 cm fig 4 similar to the levels within the ombrotrophic section of the peatland water tables in the minerotrophic zones were higher in april and deeper in august and september see supplementary material table 6 no significant differences were found between peatlands in the inflow zones hydraulic heads varied between 0 cm vr in april 2016 and 131 cm sse in july 2014 while the fluctuations varied between 27 cm at vr in 2014 and 115 cm at sse see supplementary material table 7 the mean annual hydraulic head was 34 cm sd 31 cm for sse and 48 cm sd 23 cm for vr when normalized standard score fig 5 the hydraulic heads at vr varied more strongly than at sse as for the peatlands the hydraulic head in the adjacent mineral deposits was closer to the surface in april and deeper in august and september in the outflow zones the hydraulic heads varied between 0 and 374 cm while fluctuations varied between 11 and 95 cm see supplementary material table 8 the mean annual hydraulic head was 78 cm sd 14 cm for ch 42 cm sd 26 cm for sse 46 cm sd 26 cm for lcy 69 cm sd 23 cm for vic 350 cm sd 20 cm for vr and 13 cm sd 4 cm for iso when normalized standard score fig 6 hydraulic head at vr and at iso showed the largest variation whereas hydraulic head at lcy varied the least 4 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity the ksat of the outflow zones varied by four orders of magnitude ranging between 1 4 10 7 and 8 5 10 3 cm s ltf was excluded because the ksat of the outflow zone was not measured whereas the ksat of the inflow zones varied by only one order of magnitude ranging between 5 6 10 7 and 3 9 10 6 cm s the median ksat of the outflow zones was 3 6 10 4 cm s for ch fournier 2008 5 0 10 9cm s for ltf desaulniers and cherry 1989 1 3 10 4 cm s for sse 2 9 10 3 cm s for lcy 2 6 10 5 cm s for vic 1 4 10 5 cm s for vr and 4 4 10 7 cm s for iso the median ksat of the inflow zones was 1 3 10 6 cm s for sse and 1 10 7 cm s for vr with the exception of ltf the ksat of the outflow zones correlated negatively with mean wtd at the up gradient well zone 1 ombrotrophic section with an r2 of 0 7 fig 7 this suggests that wtd in the ombrotrophic section of the peatlands was closer to the surface when the ksat of the outflow zone was low and that wtd decreases as the ksat of the outflow zone increases no significant correlation was found between the mean wtd of the ombrotrophic section and the ksat measured in the inflow zone not shown 4 3 time series analyses mci varied between 61 mm lcy and 451 mm ltf with the highest mci occurring during the highest evaporative period may to august and the lowest mci occurring during low evaporative periods march april and november fig 8 mcd varied between 44 and 542 mm for all peatlands with the highest mcd at ltf occurring during the highest evaporative period july and august and the lowest mcd at iso occurring during the lowest evaporative period october and november fig 9 mci and pmonth were strongly correlated for all peatlands with r2 values of 0 8 for ch 0 8 for ltf 0 6 for sse 0 8 for lcy 0 7 for vic 0 6 for vr and 0 8 for iso fig 8 the associated slopes varied between 1 0 and 4 2 mm of mci per mm of precipitation with the highest slope for ltf slope 4 2 lcy slope 2 3 and sse slope 2 9 and the lowest slope for vr slope 1 0 and iso slope 1 4 mcd and tmonth were also strongly correlated for all peatlands with r2 values of 0 7 for ch 0 7 for ltf 0 8 for sse 0 9 for lcy 0 7 for vic 0 8 for vr and 0 8 for iso fig 9 the associated slopes varied between 8 and 18 mm mcd per c with the strongest slope calculated for ltf slope 18 mm c lcy slope 15 mm c and sse slope 10 mm c and the weakest slope calculated for vr and iso slope 8 mm c in both cases ltf lcy and sse showed the strongest variation in both mci and mcd whereas vr and iso showe the weakest variation in mci and mcd wtd was not found to correlate significantly with either pmonth or tmonth not shown for the peatlands r k reached a value of 0 7 after 430 h for ch 451 h for ltf 167 h for sse 135 h for lcy 158 h for vic 154 h for vr and 485 h for iso fig 10 a the most rapid decrease in r k was observed for lcy whereas the slowest decrease was observed for iso see fig 10a in the adjacent mineral deposits fig 10b r k reaches a value of 0 7 after 245 h for ch 492 h for sse 570 h for lcy 301 h for vic 326 h for vr and 139 h for iso fig 11 the most rapid decrease in r k was observed for iso and the slowest decrease was observed for lcy see fig 10b cross correlation functions between the outflow zone and the peatland up gradient zone were calculated for all sites fig 11 except for ltf because of its hydrogeological setting maximum rxy k was 0 62 for ch 0 67 for sse 0 65 for sie lcy 0 69 for vic 0 37 for vr and 0 30 for iso time lags were similar for all sites and were less than 16 h 5 discussion 5 1 influence of hydrogeologic setting on aquifer peatland connections aquifer peatland connections can be categorized into four distinct conditions fig 12 including the typical lateral flow suggested by ferlatte et al 2015 based on static groundwater levels direct aquifer peatland connections are characterized by water flowing from the adjacent mineral deposits towards the peatland fig 12a water flowing from the peatland toward permeable adjacent mineral fig 12b and 12c or water flowing from the peatland toward impermeable adjacent mineral fig 12d in the literature water flowing from the aquifer to the peatland and from the peatland to the aquifer corresponds to converging flow zones ferlatte et al 2015 or minerotrophic zones siegel and glaser 1987 glaser et al 2006 when water flows from the aquifer toward the peatland groundwater fluxes contribute to maintaining the peatland water table close to the surface and limit wtf morris and waddington 2011 in the current study this type of aquifer peatland connection fig 12a was observed at the margin of the ch sse and vr peatlands and was characterized by wtf that never exceeded 15 cm year surprisingly the presence of these zones did not correlate with near surface wtd in the up gradient zone for instance wtd and wtf monitored in the up gradient zone of sse was found to be comparable to those of sites where no convergent zone was observed fig 3 green line and fig 7 green point converging flow conditions are important for peatlands because they can contribute substantially to the total annual peatland water budget and can maintain flow in streams and rivers that are located at peatland outlets during dry periods holden and burt 2003 for example bourgault et al 2014 lanoraie peatland complex st lawrence lowlands and levison et al 2014 ch this study quantified groundwater inflows as contributing more than 50 of the annual peatland water budget and convergent zones as contributing to more than 70 of the peatland surface outflow measured during dry periods the influence of the marginal portion of the peatland on wtd and wtf was not restricted to convergent flow conditions as summarized in fig 12b 12c and 12d results from this study suggest that wtd and wtf in the marginal portion of the peatlands are also controlled by the hydraulic conductivity and the presence of drainage in the outflow zone more importantly it was found that the control of wtd and wtf exerted by the outflow zone is not restricted to the marginal portion of the peatland but instead extends to the up gradient zone other studies have emphasised the importance of hydrogeological setting on peatland hydrology ivanov 1981 glaser et al 1997 winter 2001 lukenbach et al 2015 however this is the first report whereby the influence of hydrogeological setting on wtd and wtf is directly demonstrated by in situ field measurements ksat wtd and wtf and time series analysis autocorrelation cross correlation mci and mcd overall the results show that for all the studied peatlands with the exception of the heavily disturbed ltf the underlying mechanisms controlling wtd and wtf in the peatlands is the ksat of the outflow zone see fig 7 the results also show that when water flows from the up gradient zone towards the down gradient zone and the peatland is in contact with a low ksat adjacent mineral deposit fig 12b wtd is close to the surface everywhere in the peatland and less reactive to rain events i e low wtf ch vr and iso fig 2a 2f and 2g when water flows from the up gradient toward the down gradient zone and the peatland is in contact with a high ksat adjacent mineral deposit fig 12c or with a peat margin that has been heavily disturbed by intensive human activities e g ltf fig 12d wtd is deeper everywhere in the peatland and more reactive to rain events i e high wtf these results are also important because they suggest that peatlands that have limited connectivity with the aquifer fig 12b have lower wtf and could be less vulnerable to drawdowns in the aquifer induced by land use changes e g pumping or reduced recharge than peatlands that are more strongly connected to aquifers and have larger wtf fig 12a and 12c consequently any such perturbation e g pumping in the outflow zone of a peatland that was formed on highly permeable sediment should be considered to be a potential threat to the peatland even if up gradient zones have traditionally been assumed to only be impacted by precipitation 5 2 meteorological controls on wtd and wtf the effect of precipitation and temperature on peatland wtf on a monthly time scale was quantified using mci and mcd for the seven peatlands mci correlated strongly with pmonth fig 8 and mcd correlated strongly with tmonth fig 9 with the exception of ltf the heavily disturbed site the sites characterized by the strongest changes in mci and mcd lcy and sse had developed on mineral sediments with the highest ksat from 2 9 10 3 cm s to 1 3 10 4 cm s on the other hand vr and iso characterized by the weakest changes in mci and mcd had developed on materials that have the lowest ksat ranging from 1 4 10 5 cm s to 4 4 10 7 these two new indices mci and mcd are easily accessible indicators of peatland vulnerability to meteorological conditions in different hydrogeological settings and can be relatively easily implemented their usefulness will need to be confirmed on other peatlands and on decadal and longer periods additionally the autocorrelation function of wtd and heads fig 10 could be used as a proxy of mcd while the cross correlation function between wtd in the up gradient zone and heads in the outflow zone fig 11 could be used as a proxy of mineral deposit peatland connection for example it was found that iso which developed on low ksat sediment has the weakest mcd the weakest decrease in r k see yellow line on fig 10a and the weakest cross correlation yellow line on fig 11 lcy which developed on the highest ksat sediment has the highest mcd and the highest decrease in r k see blue line on fig 10a with one of the strongest cross correlations blue line on fig 11 interestingly this influence on drawdown was observed when time series were analyzed at both daily and monthly time scales it therefore appears that meteorological conditions have variable effects on wtd and wtf in peatlands depending on their hydrogeological setting this is an important result in light of the current changing climate conditions and in the context of increasing pressure on groundwater resources from changing land uses more investigation will be needed to delineate protection zones within the mineral deposits adjacent to peatlands in different climate conditions to better protect these ecosystems 5 3 identification of groundwater dependent and groundwater independent peatlands the classification of peatlands as gdp or gip is important because gdps contribute to the maintenance of good quality groundwater moss 2008 gdps are one type of ecosystem kløve et al 2011 often recognized for their rich biodiversity murray et al 2003 in this work gdps and gips were identified using head measurements in the adjacent mineral deposits gdps were characterized by inflow zones where heads in the aquifer were higher than the water table in the peatlands gips were entirely surrounded by outflow zones where the water tables were lower than those of the peatlands ch sse and vr were confirmed to be gdps as suggested by the presence of a marginal minerotrophic zone surrounding the ombrotrophic section ltf lcy vic and iso were identified to be gips others e g lukenbach et al 2015 have previously shown that gdps tend to have wtds closer to the surface in their ombrotrophic section however this was not observed in the current study and peatland wtd did not distinguish gdps from gips additionally as previously demonstrated by the influence of the outflow zone on peatland wtd and wtf the definition of gdps and gips needs to be revisited to include pressure induced connectivity in addition to exchanged fluxes clarification of the influence of hydrogeological setting on distinguishing gdps and gips is therefore needed the hydrogeological setting determines the presence of groundwater inflows which distinguishes gdps kløve et al 2011 for example in eskers isokangas et al 2017 or in sandy deltaic environments bourgault et al 2014 however gdps can also be found in association with low ksat sediments such as glacial deposits e g vr marine silts e g sse and in fractured bedrock aquifers e g ch gdps are therefore not restricted to specific geological settings however it is suggested that groundwater fed peatlands could be linked with the surrounding local topography in this study minerotrophic zones were located within a maximum distance of 500 m and with an elevation of between 2 and 4 m higher than that of the peatlands inversely peatlands that were not groundwater fed were the highest topographic features within a 500 m distance which makes them easy to identify using high resolution topographic maps 6 conclusion the comparison of monthly wtds in peatlands and in their adjacent mineral deposits has revealed a significant relationship between the ksat of the outflow zones and the mean annual wtd for all studied peatlands with the exception of the heavily impacted ltf sites where peatlands are strongly connected with their aquifer show significant differences between mcd and mci compared to weakly connected sites peatlands that were strongly connected with their outflow zone show the strongest correlations and water storage variation suggesting that hydrogeological setting does have some influence on peatland wtd and wtf this mechanism should be further explored to better understand the long term wtd responses of peatlands to climate and anthropogenic pressures by providing new insights regarding peatland hydrology where adjacent mineral deposits play a dominant role the methods developed in this study provide a strong basis from which to further investigate the impacts of variations in such pressures on peatlands this study also provides important new data with which to include hydrogeological setting in numerical models attempting to simulate peatland wtd and wtfs two new indicators mci and mcd were calculated and compared with monthly precipitation pmonth and monthly temperature tmonth strong correlations enabled the quantification of the effects of monthly temperature and monthly precipitation changes on wtd the results show that a 1 c change in monthly temperature imposes a change of between 8 and 18 mm in monthly wtd and that a 1 mm change in monthly precipitation imposes a change of between 1 3 and 4 3 mm in monthly wtd this method should be validated in different climatic contexts and hydrogeological settings to further document the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

8602,peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition they are characterized by a near surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes influenced by short term meteorological and long term climate variations among other factors site specific conditions such as peat hydrodynamic properties surface vegetation patterns and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics the objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths wtd and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the st lawrence lowlands southern quebec canada up gradient mid gradient and down gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands using dipwells with hourly wtd recordings wtd was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands additionally heads in the outflow i e receiving diffused water from the peatland and inflow i e providing diffused water to the peatland zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1 4 10 7 and 8 5 10 3 cm s whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5 6 10 7 and 3 9 10 6 cm s evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases mcd while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases mci a strong correlation was found between mean peatland wtd and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage this study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling wtd as found for those located in the st lawrence lowlands the results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on mci and mcd moreover this work shows that wtd in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones and confirms that aquifer peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels keywords peatland aquifer

2014 and summer moisture deficit has been shown elsewhere to best explain wtd over the long term charman 2007 although the hydrogeological setting in which a peatland developed is also known to influence wtd winter 1999 winter 2001 dimitrov et al 2014 lukenbach et al 2015 few studies have attempted to understand the concurrent relative influences of meteorological conditions and hydrogeological setting on peatland water table dynamics peat hydrodynamic properties control the velocity of water circulating through the horizons morris et al 2019 it has been shown that peat ksat rosa and larocque 2008 morris et al 2015 and peat sy vorob ev 1963 moore et al 2015 bourgault et al 2018 can markedly decrease with depth within the top meter this vertical variability exerts a strong control on wtf waddington et al 2015 for instance as wtd increases smaller amounts of rainfall are needed to trigger a water table increase inversely when wtd is shallow a larger amount of rainfall is needed to raise the water table until a threshold is reached and additional precipitation cannot be stored bourgault et al 2018 have shown that vertical variations in peat sy and ksat do not differ significantly between peatlands and thus cannot explain the observed differences in wtd this suggests that peatland connectivity to adjacent mineral deposits determined by the hydrogeological setting in which the peatland developed may be an important control of wtd the hydrogeological setting of a peatland is defined by the nature and hydraulic conductivity of the geological material adjacent to and underlying the organic deposits peatlands can exist in different geological settings ranging from highly permeable quaternary sand deposits rossi et al 2012 bourgault et al 2014 to low

peatlands have been found to be groundwater dependent while others are not ivanov 1981 kløve et al 2011 improved understanding of the factors that differentiate groundwater dependent peatlands gdp kløve et al 2011 from groundwater independent peatlands gip is crucial since exchanged flows are expected to be an important control of peatland wtd connections between adjacent mineral deposits and a peatland can also be indirect through pressure re equilibration between the organic deposits and the adjacent mineral deposits this process has been suggested to be an important mechanism to maintain

directly over the bedrock the peatlands all have distinct characteristics fig 2 and are described here from southwest to northeast figs 1 and 2 ch 0 5 km2 310 masl is characterized by a central ombrotrophic section surrounded by a minerotrophic section adjacent to the bedrock fournier 2008 levison et al 2014 it has developed in a depression on the cambrian sandstone of the potsdam group fig

lawrence lowlands ltf 6 0 km2 51 m asl is an ombrotrophic peatland that developed on marine clay deposits from the postglacial champlain sea fig 2b before the peatland was intensively drained its area was estimated to be 51 km2 payette and rochefort 2001 which is more than eight times greater than its current size sse 4 9 km2 84 m asl is a peatland complex composed of a central ombrotrophic section

is an ombrotrophic peatland that developed within a sandy dune swale where a discontinuous indurated horizon was found at the mineral organic contact fig 2d vic 2 6 km2 118 m asl is an ombrotrophic

peatland which developed over a diamicton dominated by a clayey silt matrix fig 2g 3 methodology 3 1 water level monitoring and hydraulic testing the peatlands composed of a central ombrotrophic section surrounded by a minerotrophic section sites ch sse and vr were divided into six zones up gradient 1 mid gradient 2 down gradient 3 minerotrophic 4 inflow 5 and outflow 6 see fig 2a the ombrotrophic peatlands with no minerotrophic section sites ltf lcy vic and iso were divided into four zones up gradient 1 mid gradient 2 down gradient 3 and outflow zones 6 see fig 2e within each peatland up gradient highest altitude and down gradient lowest altitude zones were located along a longitudinal transect while the mid gradient zone was located halfway between the two all of the zones were identified by manual water table and hydraulic head measurements the inflow zones were located outside the peatlands in the adjacent mineral deposits typically at a higher elevation and characterized by a higher water table than that of the peatland they were found exclusively where minerotrophic zones were present and were therefore used as a criterion to identify gdps minerotrophic zones were identified using surface vegetation nutrient and ph indicators during field work rydin and jeglum 2006 the outflow zones were also located outside the peatlands and were characterized by a lower water table compared to the peatland both inflow and outflow zones were identified using manual water table measurements in the adjacent mineral deposits wtd was not measured in the inflow zone of ch see fig 2a because of the technical difficulties related to the fractured bedrock aquifer at ltf see fig 2b the wtd of the outflow zone was not measured because it was located in impervious clay at lcy see fig 2d the wtd was not measured in the mid gradient zone because of the small distance between the up gradient and down gradient zones wtd was therefore measured at six locations at sse and vr see fig 2c and 2f at five locations at ch see fig 2a at four locations at vic and iso see fig 2e and 2g and at three locations at ltf and lcy see fig 2b and 2d wtd was measured in dipwells constructed from 3 cm outside diameter pvc pipes with 2 m long intakes perforated with 0 254 mm slits spaced equally every 60 mm from top to bottom and sealed at the base in the up gradient mid gradient and down gradient zones the wells were inserted into sphagnum lawn microforms the altitude of the dipwells was surveyed multiple times during the study and no drift was measured the piezometers were inserted into the adjacent mineral deposits 500 m from the edge of the peatland the piezometers were constructed from 3 cm outside diameter steel pipes sealed at the base with a 30 cm solinst drive point they were driven into the mineral sediments using a manual slide hammer with the exception of at ch where the piezometer was installed in a borehole drilled as part of a previous study levison et al 2014 the piezometers were installed 2 m below the field measured wtd see red well screens in fig 2 wtfs in the peatland dipwells and head variations in the outflow and inflow zone piezometers were monitored hourly using level loggers solinst from june 2014 to may 2016 to compare the different sites water level measurements in the outflow and inflow zones were normalized using z scores and wtfs in the peatlands were reported relative to the peat surface at measurement locations slug tests were performed to measure the ksat of the mineral deposits in the inflow and outflow zones using the hvorslev method hvorslev 1951 a minimum of ten slug tests were performed for each piezometer in the outflow zones slug tests were performed at depths of 300 cm for ch 205 cm for sse 193 cm for lcy 281 cm for vic 423 cm for vr and 161 cm for iso these depths were chosen to vary between sites to be close to the maximum wtd recorded at each site during outflow zone monitoring that took place during summer 2013 in the inflow zones slug tests were performed at a depth of 300 cm for sse and 220 cm for vr ksat values for the fractured bedrock at ch are those reported in levison et al 2014 3 2 time series analysis every water table increase linked to a single precipitation event and every water table decrease initiated by pet and lateral water circulation was isolated using the techniques described in bourgault et al 2016 first a computation script written in the r programming language r environement d c t 2008 was used to identify the maximum water table rise following each precipitation event the code calculated total precipitation during the event pevent the maximum water level rise following the event δhrise and the time interval between pevent and δhrise water table decreases were isolated by removing time periods between pevent and δhrise from each water table time series the difference between the maximum and minimum water table height δhdrawdown was computed δhrise and δhdrawdown were cumulated monthly leading to two new variables the monthly cumulative increase mci and the monthly cumulative decrease mcd the data were analyzed to evaluate whether tmonth and pmonth could be used as indicators of mci and mcd in dargie et al 2017 mci correlated strongly with pmonth for wtds above the peat surface however mci has never been used for peatlands where wtd is below the surface likewise the use of mcd as an indicator of the effect of pet considered to be proportional to air temperature has never been reported in the literature linear correlations were performed between tmonth and mcd and pmonth and mci autocorrelation r k and cross correlation rxy k functions were calculated using the hourly water table measurements over periods of 25 days 600 h from june 2014 to june 2016 the autocorrelation functions were calculated for both the ombrotrophic sections of the peatlands and the outflow zones of the adjacent mineral deposits the autocorrelation function is useful to differentiate water table reactivity i e a rapid decrease of r k over time is associated with a reactive water table the time lag equivalent to an r k value of 0 7 was arbitrarily used to compare the slopes of the autocorrelation functions of the seven sites the rxy k functions were calculated between wtd in the up gradient zone of the peatland zone 1 in fig 2 and wtd in the outflow zone of the adjacent mineral deposits zone 6 in fig 2 the lag time between the two time series is quantified as the maximum value of the cross correlation 4 results 4 1 water table depths and water table fluctuations results from this study and from data compiled from bourgault et al 2018 reveal significant differences anova p value 10 14 tukey s test p value 10 10 between wtds of the seven studied peatlands for all peatlands wtd varied between 54 cm below peat surface at lcy fig 3 and 1 cm above peat surface at iso fig 3 with wtf varying between 21 cm iso and 38 cm lcy wtds were closer to the surface in april and were deeper in august and september see supplementary material table 5 wtd in the minerotrophic zones of ch sse and vr was between 22 cm and 17 cm and wtf varied between 11 and 22 cm fig 4 similar to the levels within the ombrotrophic section of the peatland water tables in the minerotrophic zones were higher in april and deeper in august and september see supplementary material table 6 no significant differences were found between peatlands in the inflow zones hydraulic heads varied between 0 cm vr in april 2016 and 131 cm sse in july 2014 while the fluctuations varied between 27 cm at vr in 2014 and 115 cm at sse see supplementary material table 7 the mean annual hydraulic head was 34 cm sd 31 cm for sse and 48 cm sd 23 cm for vr when normalized standard score fig 5 the hydraulic heads at vr varied more strongly than at sse as for the peatlands the hydraulic head in the adjacent mineral deposits was closer to the surface in april and deeper in august and september in the outflow zones the hydraulic heads varied between 0 and 374 cm while fluctuations varied between 11 and 95 cm see supplementary material table 8 the mean annual hydraulic head was 78 cm sd 14 cm for ch 42 cm sd 26 cm for sse 46 cm sd 26 cm for lcy 69 cm sd 23 cm for vic 350 cm sd 20 cm for vr and 13 cm sd 4 cm for iso when normalized standard score fig 6 hydraulic head at vr and at iso showed the largest variation whereas hydraulic head at lcy varied the least 4 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity the ksat of the outflow zones varied by four orders of magnitude ranging between 1 4 10 7 and 8 5 10 3 cm s ltf was excluded because the ksat of the outflow zone was not measured whereas the ksat of the inflow zones varied by only one order of magnitude ranging between 5 6 10 7 and 3 9 10 6 cm s the median ksat of the outflow zones was 3 6 10 4 cm s for ch fournier 2008 5 0 10 9cm s for ltf desaulniers and cherry 1989 1 3 10 4 cm s for sse 2 9 10 3 cm s for lcy 2 6 10 5 cm s for vic 1 4 10 5 cm s for vr and 4 4 10 7 cm s for iso the median ksat of the inflow zones was 1 3 10 6 cm s for sse and 1 10 7 cm s for vr with the exception of ltf the ksat of the outflow zones correlated negatively with mean wtd at the up gradient well zone 1 ombrotrophic section with an r2 of 0 7 fig 7 this suggests that wtd in the ombrotrophic section of the peatlands was closer to the surface when the ksat of the outflow zone was low and that wtd decreases as the ksat of the outflow zone increases no significant correlation was found between the mean wtd of the ombrotrophic section and the ksat measured in the inflow zone not shown 4 3 time series analyses mci varied between 61 mm lcy and 451 mm ltf with the highest mci occurring during the highest evaporative period may to august and the lowest mci occurring during low evaporative periods march april and november fig 8 mcd varied between 44 and 542 mm for all peatlands with the highest mcd at ltf occurring during the highest evaporative period july and august and the lowest mcd at iso occurring during the lowest evaporative period october and november fig 9 mci and pmonth were strongly correlated for all peatlands with r2 values of 0 8 for ch 0 8 for ltf 0 6 for sse 0 8 for lcy 0 7 for vic 0 6 for vr and 0 8 for iso fig 8 the associated slopes varied between 1 0 and 4 2 mm of mci per mm of precipitation with the highest slope for ltf slope 4 2 lcy slope 2 3 and sse slope 2 9 and the lowest slope for vr slope 1 0 and iso slope 1 4 mcd and tmonth were also strongly correlated for all peatlands with r2 values of 0 7 for ch 0 7 for ltf 0 8 for sse 0 9 for lcy 0 7 for vic 0 8 for vr and 0 8 for iso fig 9 the associated slopes varied between 8 and 18 mm mcd per c with the strongest slope calculated for ltf slope 18 mm c lcy slope 15 mm c and sse slope 10 mm c and the weakest slope calculated for vr and iso slope 8 mm c in both cases ltf lcy and sse showed the strongest variation in both mci and mcd whereas vr and iso showe the weakest variation in mci and mcd wtd was not found to correlate significantly with either pmonth or tmonth not shown for the peatlands r k reached a value of 0 7 after 430 h for ch 451 h for ltf 167 h for sse 135 h for lcy 158 h for vic 154 h for vr and 485 h for iso fig 10 a the most rapid decrease in r k was observed for lcy whereas the slowest decrease was observed for iso see fig 10a in the adjacent mineral deposits fig 10b r k reaches a value of 0 7 after 245 h for ch 492 h for sse 570 h for lcy 301 h for vic 326 h for vr and 139 h for iso fig 11 the most rapid decrease in r k was observed for iso and the slowest decrease was observed for lcy see fig 10b cross correlation functions between the outflow zone and the peatland up gradient zone were calculated for all sites fig 11 except for ltf because of its hydrogeological setting maximum rxy k was 0 62 for ch 0 67 for sse 0 65 for sie lcy 0 69 for vic 0 37 for vr and 0 30 for iso time lags were similar for all sites and were less than 16 h 5 discussion 5 1 influence of hydrogeologic setting on aquifer peatland connections aquifer peatland connections can be categorized into four distinct conditions fig 12 including the typical lateral flow suggested by ferlatte et al 2015 based on static groundwater levels direct aquifer peatland connections are characterized by water flowing from the adjacent mineral deposits towards the peatland fig 12a water flowing from the peatland toward permeable adjacent mineral fig 12b and 12c or water flowing from the peatland toward impermeable adjacent mineral fig 12d in the literature water flowing from the aquifer to the peatland and from the peatland to the aquifer corresponds to converging flow zones ferlatte et al 2015 or minerotrophic zones siegel and glaser 1987 glaser et al 2006 when water flows from the aquifer toward the peatland groundwater fluxes contribute to maintaining the peatland water table close to the surface and limit wtf morris and waddington 2011 in the current study this type of aquifer peatland connection fig 12a was observed at the margin of the ch sse and vr peatlands and was characterized by wtf that never exceeded 15 cm year surprisingly the presence of these zones did not correlate with near surface wtd in the up gradient zone for instance wtd and wtf monitored in the up gradient zone of sse was found to be comparable to those of sites where no convergent zone was observed fig 3 green line and fig 7 green point converging flow conditions are important for peatlands because they can contribute substantially to the total annual peatland water budget and can maintain flow in streams and rivers that are located at peatland outlets during dry periods holden and burt 2003 for example bourgault et al 2014 lanoraie peatland complex st lawrence lowlands and levison et al 2014 ch this study quantified groundwater inflows as contributing more than 50 of the annual peatland water budget and convergent zones as contributing to more than 70 of the peatland surface outflow measured during dry periods the influence of the marginal portion of the peatland on wtd and wtf was not restricted to convergent flow conditions as summarized in fig 12b 12c and 12d results from this study suggest that wtd and wtf in the marginal portion of the peatlands are also controlled by the hydraulic conductivity and the presence of drainage in the outflow zone more importantly it was found that the control of wtd and wtf exerted by the outflow zone is not restricted to the marginal portion of the peatland but instead extends to the up gradient zone other studies have emphasised the importance of hydrogeological setting on peatland hydrology ivanov 1981 glaser et al 1997 winter 2001 lukenbach et al 2015 however this is the first report whereby the influence of hydrogeological setting on wtd and wtf is directly demonstrated by in situ field measurements ksat wtd and wtf and time series analysis autocorrelation cross correlation mci and mcd overall the results show that for all the studied peatlands with the exception of the heavily disturbed ltf the underlying mechanisms controlling wtd and wtf in the peatlands is the ksat of the outflow zone see fig 7 the results also show that when water flows from the up gradient zone towards the down gradient zone and the peatland is in contact with a low ksat adjacent mineral deposit fig 12b wtd is close to the surface everywhere in the peatland and less reactive to rain events i e low wtf ch vr and iso fig 2a 2f and 2g when water flows from the up gradient toward the down gradient zone and the peatland is in contact with a high ksat adjacent mineral deposit fig 12c or with a peat margin that has been heavily disturbed by intensive human activities e g ltf fig 12d wtd is deeper everywhere in the peatland and more reactive to rain events i e high wtf these results are also important because they suggest that peatlands that have limited connectivity with the aquifer fig 12b have lower wtf and could be less vulnerable to drawdowns in the aquifer induced by land use changes e g pumping or reduced recharge than peatlands that are more strongly connected to aquifers and have larger wtf fig 12a and 12c consequently any such perturbation e g pumping in the outflow zone of a peatland that was formed on highly permeable sediment should be considered to be a potential threat to the peatland even if up gradient zones have traditionally been assumed to only be impacted by precipitation 5 2 meteorological controls on wtd and wtf the effect of precipitation and temperature on peatland wtf on a monthly time scale was quantified using mci and mcd for the seven peatlands mci correlated strongly with pmonth fig 8 and mcd correlated strongly with tmonth fig 9 with the exception of ltf the heavily disturbed site the sites characterized by the strongest changes in mci and mcd lcy and sse had developed on mineral sediments with the highest ksat from 2 9 10 3 cm s to 1 3 10 4 cm s on the other hand vr and iso characterized by the weakest changes in mci and mcd had developed on materials that have the lowest ksat ranging from 1 4 10 5 cm s to 4 4 10 7 these two new indices mci and mcd are easily accessible indicators of peatland vulnerability to meteorological conditions in different hydrogeological settings and can be relatively easily implemented their usefulness will need to be confirmed on other peatlands and on decadal and longer periods additionally the autocorrelation function of wtd and heads fig 10 could be used as a proxy of mcd while the cross correlation function between wtd in the up gradient zone and heads in the outflow zone fig 11 could be used as a proxy of mineral deposit peatland connection for example it was found that iso which developed on low ksat sediment has the weakest mcd the weakest decrease in r k see yellow line on fig 10a and the weakest cross correlation yellow line on fig 11 lcy which developed on the highest ksat sediment has the highest mcd and the highest decrease in r k see blue line on fig 10a with one of the strongest cross correlations blue line on fig 11 interestingly this influence on drawdown was observed when time series were analyzed at both daily and monthly time scales it therefore appears that meteorological conditions have variable effects on wtd and wtf in peatlands depending on their hydrogeological setting this is an important result in light of the current changing climate conditions and in the context of increasing pressure on groundwater resources from changing land uses more investigation will be needed to delineate protection zones within the mineral deposits adjacent to peatlands in different climate conditions to better protect these ecosystems 5 3 identification of groundwater dependent and groundwater independent peatlands the classification of peatlands as gdp or gip is important because gdps contribute to the maintenance of good quality groundwater moss 2008 gdps are one type of ecosystem kløve et al 2011 often recognized for their rich biodiversity murray et al 2003 in this work gdps and gips were identified using head measurements in the adjacent mineral deposits gdps were characterized by inflow zones where heads in the aquifer were higher than the water table in the peatlands gips were entirely surrounded by outflow zones where the water tables were lower than those of the peatlands ch sse and vr were confirmed to be gdps as suggested by the presence of a marginal minerotrophic zone surrounding the ombrotrophic section ltf lcy vic and iso were identified to be gips others e g lukenbach et al 2015 have previously shown that gdps tend to have wtds closer to the surface in their ombrotrophic section however this was not observed in the current study and peatland wtd did not distinguish gdps from gips additionally as previously demonstrated by the influence of the outflow zone on peatland wtd and wtf the definition of gdps and gips needs to be revisited to include pressure induced connectivity in addition to exchanged fluxes clarification of the influence of hydrogeological setting on distinguishing gdps and gips is therefore needed the hydrogeological setting determines the presence of groundwater inflows which distinguishes gdps kløve et al 2011 for example in eskers isokangas et al 2017 or in sandy deltaic environments bourgault et al 2014 however gdps can also be found in association with low ksat sediments such as glacial deposits e g vr marine silts e g sse and in fractured bedrock aquifers e g ch gdps are therefore not restricted to specific geological settings however it is suggested that groundwater fed peatlands could be linked with the surrounding local topography in this study minerotrophic zones were located within a maximum distance of 500 m and with an elevation of between 2 and 4 m higher than that of the peatlands inversely peatlands that were not groundwater fed were the highest topographic features within a 500 m distance which makes them easy to identify using high resolution topographic maps 6 conclusion the comparison of monthly wtds in peatlands and in their adjacent mineral deposits has revealed a significant relationship between the ksat of the outflow zones and the mean annual wtd for all studied peatlands with the exception of the heavily impacted ltf sites where peatlands are strongly connected with their aquifer show significant differences between mcd and mci compared to weakly connected sites peatlands that were strongly connected with their outflow zone show the strongest correlations and water storage variation suggesting that hydrogeological setting does have some influence on peatland wtd and wtf this mechanism should be further explored to better understand the long term wtd responses of peatlands to climate and anthropogenic pressures by providing new insights regarding peatland hydrology where adjacent mineral deposits play a dominant role the methods developed in this study provide a strong basis from which to further investigate the impacts of variations in such pressures on peatlands this study also provides important new data with which to include hydrogeological setting in numerical models attempting to simulate peatland wtd and wtfs two new indicators mci and mcd were calculated and compared with monthly precipitation pmonth and monthly temperature tmonth strong correlations enabled the quantification of the effects of monthly temperature and monthly precipitation changes on wtd the results show that a 1 c change in monthly temperature imposes a change of between 8 and 18 mm in monthly wtd and that a 1 mm change in monthly precipitation imposes a change of between 1 3 and 4 3 mm in monthly wtd this method should be validated in different climatic contexts and hydrogeological settings to further document the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

8603,early warning systems ews for river flooding are strategic tools for effective disaster risk management in many world regions when driven by ensemble numerical weather predictions nwp flood ews can provide skillful streamflow forecasts beyond the monthly time scale in large river basins yet effective flood detection is challenged by accurate estimation of warning thresholds that identify specific hazard levels along the entire river network and forecast horizon this research describes a novel approach to estimate warning thresholds which retain statistical consistency with the operational forecasts at all lead times the procedure is developed in the context of the global flood awareness system glofas a 21 year forecast consistent dataset is used to derive thresholds with global coverage and forecast range up to six weeks these are compared with thresholds derived from era5 a state of the art atmospheric reanalysis used to run the baseline simulation for the years 1986 2017 and to give a best guess of the present hydrological states findings show that the use of constant thresholds for 30 day flood forecasting as in the current operational glofas setup is consistent throughout the entire forecast range in only 30 to 40 of the river network depending on the flood return period findings show that range dependent thresholds of weekly duration are a more suitable alternative to time invariant thresholds as they improve the model consistency as well as the skills in flood monitoring and early warning particularly over longer forecasting range keywords flood thresholds early warning system glofas ensemble forecasting hydrologic model global hydrology 1 introduction flooding is among the costliest disasters worldwide with reported population affected of 80 110 million people per year jonkman 2005 unisdr and cred 2015 and flood losses estimated at 30 100 billion usd per year munich re 2015 unisdr 2015 unisdr and cred 2015 these figures are projected to rise even further in the coming decades due to socio economic growth and the consequent increase in flood exposure and to ongoing global warming which is linked to an intensification of weather related disasters in most world regions dottori et al 2018 winsemius et al 2016 flood forecasting and early warning systems are cost effective measures to reduce the impacts of floods by providing timely information on where and when floods will occur in the near future pappenberger et al 2015a a common approach to forecast floods in the medium range i e 3 15 days ahead of their occurrence is by forcing a hydrological model with an ensemble of numerical weather predictions nwp to estimate the probable future hydrological conditions cloke and pappenberger 2009 fan et al 2014 pagano et al 2014 siddique and mejia 2017 thielen et al 2009 thiemig et al 2010 in addition thanks to continuous improvements in weather prediction and to the long travel time of flood waves in the largest world s rivers large scale ensemble flood forecasting is pushing forward the limits of predictability by enabling skillful quantitative forecasts over longer forecast horizons the global flood awareness system glofas is a global hydrological modeling and forecasting system jointly developed by the european commission ec and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and is an operational system of the copernicus emergency management service since 2018 glofas is designed to forecast large scale river flooding worldwide by detecting river reaches where predicted streamflow has significant probability to exceed model consistent warning thresholds in a 30 day forecasting horizon alfieri et al 2013 the estimation of suitable exceedance thresholds is a key task in flood early warning where alerts are determined by the ratio between streamflow estimates and reference thresholds hence model consistency is achieved through the use of the same hydrological model and meteorological product to derive both streamflow forecasts and the reanalysis dataset used to derive the thresholds accurate representation of the true river conditions along the river network is a long standing challenge in the global hydrological community bierkens et al 2015 nijssen et al 2001 yet several examples have shown that skillful early warning systems based on threshold exceedance analysis favor the concept of model consistency rather than a mere pursuit of the true absolute hydrological states pappenberger et al 2015b raynaud et al 2015 reed et al 2007 in glofas the estimation of warning thresholds is determined by the global meteorological datasets used to reproduce a long term streamflow simulation and in turn derive threshold values for selected occurrence probabilities the current operational setup stems from the outcomes of the work by hirpa et al 2016 the key question in hirpa et al 2016 is whether flood thresholds derived from a reforecast climatology hence favoring the consistence between thresholds and daily operational forecasts yield more skillful prediction of severe flood events compared to using thresholds derived from a reanalysis product hence

is reflected not only in average weather variables but also with regard to large scale weather patterns such as tropical cyclones in this work we used daily maps of precipitation minimum mean and maximum surface air temperature mean sea level pressure incoming solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity extracted from era5 for 32 complete years between 1986 and 2017 some variables were then processed to produce estimates of potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation this represents one of the main dynamic input variables of the hydrological model lisflood

forecast runs that use the same integrated forecasting system ifs model version as the real time ensemble forecasts ecmwf ens for the past 20 years similar to the operational forecasts reforecasts have horizontal resolutions of 18 km for up to 15 day lead time and 36 km for longer forecast lead times up to 46 day in this work we used the unperturbed ensemble member i e the control run of 6 week reforecasts with daily resolution initialized once per week in the entire period of availability coupled with the last year of operational forecasts the collected dataset thus includes 1218 sets of reforecasts with global coverage spanning 21 years between 21 11 1996 and 25 12 2017 more in details each of the 21 years of data is composed by 58 weekly reforecasts starting in mid november of the previous year so that each day of each year is ultimately simulated in 6 different reforecasts with lead time between 1 and 6 weeks as for era5 we extracted the same set of atmospheric variables and pre processed them to obtain daily estimates of evapotranspiration which were used as input of the hydrological model together with mean surface air temperature and precipitation 2 2 hydrological

flood hazard mapping alfieri et al 2014 dottori et al 2016 in this work we used a global setup at 0 1 degree and daily resolutions covering the earth s land areas except iceland greenland and antarctica the global setup of the model was calibrated against observed daily streamflow for 24 large river basins 84 000 4 680 000 km2 in area across the globe using the wfdei weedon et al 2014 atmospheric forcing and a multi objective function incorporating bias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and log transformed nse beck et al 2017 the calibrated river basins cover 17 of the entire simulation area while for the uncalibrated area we used a common parameter set derived by expert judgement we expect the model calibration to have a relatively minor impact on the outcomes of this work as all simulations are run with the same model setup and their differences mostly depend on differences in the weather forcing and in their statistics rather than on skills versus measured discharges it is worth noting that the hydrological model used in this work is different from the setup used in the operational glofas which is based on a combination of two models for the land surface and for the river routing component respectively see hirpa et al 2018 2 3 methods we investigated differences in the statistics between era5 and the reforecasts dataset at all lead times and their resulting hydrological simulations the analysis is split in two steps first focusing on the precipitation statistics and then on the flood warning thresholds with regard to precipitation we analyzed the mean annual maxima of daily precipitation pmax and the mean annual precipitation map including spatial patterns of the differences between the two datasets due to their non parametric nature precipitation statistics are key diagnostic indicators that anticipate and explain possible differences between the corresponding hydrological model outputs in this regard pmax is representative of extreme precipitation and is generally well correlated to floods e g guillot and duband 1967 while map is an indicator of long term bias between the considered datasets the second part of the analysis is performed on flood thresholds based on era5 versus those based on reforecasts to this end we first ran a 32 year global hydrological simulation forced with era5 and extracted discharge time series at all points of the river network then 1 218 sets of 6 week reforecasts initialized once per week between 21 11 1996 and 25 12 2017 were used as input to run as many hydrological simulations taking initial conditions from the corresponding date in the era5 based run such model runs forced by reforecasts include 58 different 6 week simulations per year starting on the 21 november of the previous year so that each day of each year is ultimately modeled in six different simulations with forecast range spanning between 1 and 6 weeks we applied extreme value distribution evd fitting to the annual maximum discharges extracted from the era5 based dataset as well as from the six datasets stemming from reforecasts after reordering the data by weekly lead time the first two years of the era5 based dataset were discarded to guarantee sufficient model warm up leaving 30 years of data for the evd fitting while in the case of reforecasts all 21 years of data were used given that meaningful initial conditions were provided by the era5 based run such 9 year difference i e 30 versus 21 years in the length of the two datasets may produce discontinuities in the related flood thresholds in case of substantial differences in the statistics of the extremes in those 9 years when reforecasts are not available in view of the direct implications of this research with the operational runs of glofas we have opted to accept this potential discontinuities for the following reasons while the era5 dataset is continuously extended in near real time and therefore keeps growing in size ecmwf reforecasts are regenerated every week using the latest ifs model version which is updated more than once per year yet only for the most recent 20 years it follows that this 9 year gap will not be closed in the future unless a longer reference period is chosen at ecmwf for issuing reforecasts 30 years are a commonly accepted duration for a reference climate as defined by the world meteorological organization as well as a recommended standard for extreme value analysis e g burroughs 2003 hence it should be a preferred duration for use whenever available the chosen evd fitting is based on the gumbel distribution with the method of l moments hosking 1990 an effective and parsimonious choice which shows best performance for relatively small sample sizes cunnane 1989 as in this case significance of the analytical curves was assessed by bootstrapping using 1000 repetitions for each fit 90 confidence bands between the 5th and 95th percentile around the central estimates were extracted and used to assess the fitting uncertainty in the remainder we refer to flood thresholds as all discharge values estimated from analytical extreme value distributions corresponding to return periods equal or larger than 2 years in reality the occurrence of actual flooding depends on the flood protection standards along the river network which are known to vary considerably from around 2 to several thousand years depending on the exposure and on the country s investment capacity scussolini et al 2016 in the operational version of glofas reference warning thresholds correspond to return periods of discharge peaks of 1 5 2 5 and 20 years see fig 1 following the recommendations of the european flood awareness system efas see bartholmes et al 2009 the 20 year threshold values are considered the most representative for detecting flood alerts in glofas hence a number of figures in the remainder show results for such return periods while results for return periods of 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500 years are shown in the supplementary material for completeness one should note that results for return periods larger than the number of years of the time series i e 50 100 200 and 500 years are likely to be affected by large uncertainty bounds and by possible discrepancies in the behavior of the tail of the hypothesized distribution yet it is valuable to analyze them as they could impact a number of ensuing applications focused on flood hazard mapping and impact assessment alfieri et al 2017 dottori et al 2016 3 results statistics of precipitation were calculated over the world s land area using era5 fig 2 and reforecasts with weekly lead time between 1 and 6 weeks maps of difference in pmax and map between reforecasts and era5 are shown in fig 3 for forecast lead times of 2 4 and 6 weeks more in details results for week 1 include all days with forecast lead time between 1 and 7 days week 2 includes days with lead time between 8 and 14 days and so forth up to week 6 extreme daily precipitation simulated by reforecasts are smaller than those of era5 in most tropical and equatorial regions conversely reforecasts simulate more extreme precipitation in the sahel region west india parts of canada and eastern asia mean annual precipitation shows a less homogeneous pattern with reforecasts being above era5 in india central africa and parts of south america and below era5 in south east asia europe and parts of south america no clear trends in the precipitation statistics appear along the forecast range though the negative bias of reforecasts both pmax and map tends to increase with the lead time for the majority of the land points at the global scale mean reforecasts based map is smaller than the era5 based map by between 2 5 mm year 1 at week 1 and 5 mm year 1 at week 4 5 and 6 the map in fig 4 shows central estimates of maximum peak discharges with average recurrence interval of 20 years based on the era5 driven simulation percent relative differences between reforecasts based and era5 based maps are shown in fig 5 for lead times between 1 and 6 weeks together with a representation per upstream area classes in fig 6 relative differences between reforecasts and era5 flood thresholds tend to increase in drier regions as well as with increasing forecast lead time in larger rivers differences are smaller and vary more gradually due to the larger influence of the initial hydrological conditions looking at changes across the range of considered flood magnitudes see supplement material figs s4 s11 one can note a progressive reduction of flood thresholds derived from reforecasts compared to era5 from a return period of 2 years moving towards 500 years with regard to differences versus upstream area the median change of each upstream class ranges within 4 and 1 at week 1 up to within 7 and 2 at week 6 fig 6 when different quantiles of the distribution of the changes per upstream area classes are considered we found an increasing spread of the empirical distribution of data for increasing values of forecast horizon and return period and for decreasing values of upstream area see supplement material figs s13 s20 at 20 year return period the interquartile range i e the central 50 of the distribution of differences ranges between 10 and 10 at week 1 up to 21 and 16 at week 6 see fig s16 differences in the thresholds described above based on different hydrological simulations cause bias and hence inappropriate interpretation of era5 flood thresholds when they are used in the prediction of threshold exceedances along the forecast range such bias can be evaluated by inverting the evd of reforecasts at each weekly lead time using discharge values corresponding to flood thresholds based on the era5 evd fitting an example for a return period of 20 years is shown in fig 7 for lead times between 1 and 6 weeks light yellow pixels in the figure represent river points where a 20 year flood peak magnitude in the era5 simulation corresponds to the same return period magnitude 10 also in the reforecasts based run conversely shades of red blue indicate that 20 year discharges from era5 actually correspond to smaller larger return periods when used in predictive mode 90 confidence intervals around central estimates of flood thresholds are used to assess statistically significant differences between flood thresholds stemming from different input datasets and at different lead times hence assuming a confidence interval of 90 we show in fig 8 the number of subsequent weeks over which era5 based 20 year thresholds fall within the distribution of range specific thresholds derived from reforecasts we found that only in 27 of grid points are era5 based 20 year thresholds statistically consistent with the entire 6 week streamflow forecasts on the other hand in 44 of grid points era5 based 20 year thresholds are not consistent with those derived from reforecasts already from a forecast range of 1 week the remaining 29 of grid points take on intermediate values between 1 and 5 weeks of consistency of the two sets of thresholds similar figures were found across the considered flood return periods see supplement material fig s30 for instance taking the current glofas configuration of 4 week forecasts era5 based thresholds could be consistently used through the entire forecasting range only in 39 31 of glofas grid points for return periods between 2 and 500 years respectively a closer look is given in fig 9 which shows six examples of the proposed range dependent flood thresholds evaluated at the outlet of six rivers together with their 90 confidence intervals the six cases were chosen to represent different continents climate regions basin size as well as different trends in the threshold values along the 6 week forecast range among these six stations 2 cases dniepr and murray darling retain low variability of flood thresholds over the entire 6 week range two cases cauvery and mobile river show a significantly rising trend while two cases itapicuru and congo river a decreasing trend an interesting example is that of the congo river where thresholds are almost constant through the entire forecast range though they are significantly smaller than those derived from era5 such differences are due to a number of extreme events simulated by era5 in 1986 1996 which are therefore not included in the shorter series derived from the reforecasts dataset i e 1997 2017 hence causing the type of discontinuity described in section 2 3 4 discussion results of our analyses show a complex spatial pattern of sign and magnitude of the differences between thresholds derived from a reanalysis dataset i e era5 and those derived from a forecast consistent dataset i e the reforecasts differences do not appear to have clear linear dependence with a number of considered variables such as return period of the flood thresholds weekly forecast range latitude basin upstream area and mean discharge instead the pattern of such differences follows more that of the differences in precipitation statistics see fig 3 and 5 hence it is specific of the chosen atmospheric datasets however we found a tendency for larger discrepancies between era5 and reforecasts based flood thresholds in smaller and drier river basins over longer forecast ranges conversely flood thresholds in large rivers over short forecast ranges often follow closely those based on era5 from which they take the initial conditions determining a large proportion of the river streamflow the findings of this research indicate that range dependent thresholds should be used and replace time invariant thresholds to improve the consistency in flood monitoring and early warning especially over longer forecast ranges unlike the constant thresholds setup the proposed approach would retain consistency along the entire forecast range with the operational streamflow simulations which integrate the effect of three ifs model configurations with different spatial resolution first the era5 atmospheric reanalysis with grid resolution of 31 km used in the baseline run from which hydrological initial conditions are taken second medium range forecasts up to 15 days with grid resolution of 18 km which are primarily governed by atmospheric initial values third extended range forecasts with ocean atmosphere coupling from 16 to 46 days with grid resolution of 36 km where the sea surface temperature and associated heat and moisture start having non negligible influence on the atmospheric evolution owens and hewson 2018 traditionally flood thresholds used in short term forecasting and early warning are based on observations or reconstructed extreme value distributions based on long term simulations pappenberger et al 2015b on the other hand long term e g seasonal forecasts use less extreme thresholds based on anomalies or percentiles from the streamflow distributions to compensate for the smoothing effect of coarser resolution modeling forecast uncertainty temporal aggregation of results and variability of the precipitation statistics in the long range forecasting arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 in this context we see our approach as a step in the right direction for a smooth transition between quantitative thresholds of discharge or water level to long range forecasts which are tailored more on the identification of wetter or drier than normal periods in an ideal seamless forecasting system seasonal forecasts would anticipate wetter than normal periods which could potentially become large scale river flooding and be detected as severe events as early as a few weeks before leaving enough time for low cost preparatory actions as the event approaches short term forecasts enable improved quantitative estimation of river discharges and corresponding water levels hence transitioning to impact based assessments including the exposure and vulnerability of the potentially affected areas so to prioritize actions for an efficient emergency management to the authors knowledge no operational system for medium range flood early warning uses range dependent thresholds to detect upcoming severe events the concept of range dependent thresholds may initially be difficult to accept for users as it eliminates the univocal link between discharge thresholds and their probability of occurrences in other words any given discharge peak would correspond to a different probability of occurrence depending on when it is forecast in the future yet the proposed approach is more correct and consistent with the data hence it is likely to improve the estimation of the magnitude of upcoming extreme events over longer forecast ranges 5 conclusions in this research we have tested a new method to estimate discharge thresholds for medium range flood forecasting for potential use in the global flood awareness system we have provided evidence that flood thresholds for medium range forecasting can take on significantly different values from thresholds derived from the reference baseline run forced by era5 data used to initialize the forecasts in addition thresholds often vary throughout consecutive weekly forecast ranges with a complex pattern of change mostly driven by differences in the atmospheric datasets used as forcing to the hydrological model therefore we propose a modified framework for the early detection of floods based on range dependent flood thresholds which are able to compensate for forecast drifts in the extreme values particularly useful over long ranges upcoming work ahead of the operational implementation will involve extensive testing and skill evaluation of the operational ensemble forecasts to assess the limits of predictability of the system and compare the system skills to the current operational version this represents a key step in the evolution of glofas which may ultimately lead to the extension from the current 30 day to a 6 week forecasting range it is worth noting that flood thresholds based on reforecasts must be updated regularly as new ifs cycles are released to retain consistency between streamflow predictions and warning thresholds and improve the detection of severe floods along the

8603,early warning systems ews for river flooding are strategic tools for effective disaster risk management in many world regions when driven by ensemble numerical weather predictions nwp flood ews can provide skillful streamflow forecasts beyond the monthly time scale in large river basins yet effective flood detection is challenged by accurate estimation of warning thresholds that identify specific hazard levels along the entire river network and forecast horizon this research describes a novel approach to estimate warning thresholds which retain statistical consistency with the operational forecasts at all lead times the procedure is developed in the context of the global flood awareness system glofas a 21 year forecast consistent dataset is used to derive thresholds with global coverage and forecast range up to six weeks these are compared with thresholds derived from era5 a state of the art atmospheric reanalysis used to run the baseline simulation for the years 1986 2017 and to give a best guess of the present hydrological states findings show that the use of constant thresholds for 30 day flood forecasting as in the current operational glofas setup is consistent throughout the entire forecast range in only 30 to 40 of the river network depending on the flood return period findings show that range dependent thresholds of weekly duration are a more suitable alternative to time invariant thresholds as they improve the model consistency as well as the skills in flood monitoring and early warning particularly over longer forecasting range keywords flood

rivers large scale ensemble flood forecasting is pushing forward the limits of predictability by enabling skillful quantitative forecasts over longer forecast horizons the global flood awareness system glofas is a global hydrological modeling and forecasting system jointly developed by the european commission ec and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and is an operational system of the copernicus emergency management service since 2018 glofas is designed to forecast large scale river flooding worldwide by detecting river reaches where predicted streamflow has significant probability to exceed model consistent warning thresholds in a 30 day forecasting horizon alfieri et al 2013 the estimation of suitable exceedance thresholds is a key task in flood early warning where alerts are determined by the ratio between streamflow estimates and reference thresholds hence model consistency is achieved through the use of the same hydrological model and meteorological product to derive both streamflow forecasts and the reanalysis dataset used to derive the thresholds accurate representation of the true river conditions along the river network is a long standing challenge in the global hydrological community bierkens et al 2015 nijssen et al 2001 yet several examples have shown that skillful early warning systems based on threshold exceedance analysis favor the concept of model consistency rather than a mere pursuit of the true absolute hydrological states pappenberger et al 2015b raynaud et al 2015 reed et al 2007 in glofas the estimation of warning thresholds is determined by the global meteorological datasets used to reproduce a long term streamflow simulation and in turn derive threshold values for selected occurrence probabilities the current operational setup stems from the outcomes of the work by hirpa et al 2016 the key question in hirpa et al 2016 is whether flood thresholds derived from a reforecast climatology hence favoring the consistence between thresholds and daily operational forecasts yield more skillful prediction of severe flood events compared to using thresholds derived from a reanalysis product hence more focused on reproducing the true state of the atmosphere to this end the authors produced a continuous atmospheric forcing by concatenating data from the first days of a weather reforecasts

the related flood thresholds in case of substantial differences in the statistics of the extremes in those 9 years when reforecasts are not available in view of the direct implications of this research with the operational runs of glofas we have opted to accept this potential discontinuities for the following reasons while the era5 dataset is continuously extended in near real time and therefore keeps growing in size ecmwf reforecasts are regenerated every week using the latest ifs model version which is updated more than once per year yet only for the most recent 20 years it follows that this 9 year gap will not be closed in the future unless a longer reference period is chosen at ecmwf for issuing reforecasts 30 years are a commonly accepted duration for a reference climate as defined by the world meteorological organization as well as a recommended standard for extreme value analysis e g burroughs 2003 hence it should be a preferred duration for use whenever available the chosen evd fitting is based on the gumbel distribution with the method of l moments hosking 1990 an effective and parsimonious choice which shows best performance for relatively small sample sizes cunnane 1989 as in this case significance of the analytical curves was assessed by bootstrapping using 1000 repetitions for each fit 90 confidence bands between the 5th and 95th percentile around the central estimates were extracted and used to assess the fitting uncertainty in the remainder we refer to flood thresholds as all discharge values estimated from analytical extreme value distributions corresponding to return periods equal or larger than 2 years in reality the occurrence of actual flooding depends on the flood protection standards along the river network which are known to vary considerably from around 2 to several thousand years depending on the exposure and on the country s investment capacity scussolini et al 2016 in the operational version of glofas reference warning thresholds correspond to return periods of discharge peaks of 1 5 2 5 and 20 years see fig 1 following the recommendations of the european flood awareness system efas see bartholmes et al 2009 the 20 year threshold values are considered the most representative for detecting flood alerts in glofas hence a number of figures in the remainder show results for such return periods while results for return periods of 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500 years are shown in the supplementary material for completeness one should note that results for return periods larger than the number of years of the time series i e 50 100 200 and 500 years are likely to be affected by large uncertainty bounds and by possible discrepancies in the behavior of the tail of the hypothesized distribution yet it is valuable to analyze them as they could impact a number of ensuing applications focused on flood hazard mapping and impact assessment alfieri et al 2017 dottori et al 2016 3 results statistics of precipitation were calculated over the world s land area using era5 fig 2 and reforecasts with weekly lead time between 1 and 6 weeks maps of difference in pmax and map between reforecasts and era5 are shown in fig 3 for forecast lead times of 2 4 and 6 weeks more in details results for week 1 include all days with forecast lead time between 1 and 7 days week 2 includes days with lead time between 8 and 14 days and so forth up to week 6 extreme daily precipitation simulated by reforecasts are smaller than those of era5 in most tropical and equatorial regions conversely reforecasts simulate more extreme precipitation in the sahel region west india parts of canada and eastern asia mean annual precipitation shows a less homogeneous pattern with reforecasts being above era5 in india central africa and parts of south america and below era5 in south east asia europe and parts of south america no clear trends in the precipitation statistics appear along the forecast range though the negative bias of reforecasts both pmax and map tends to increase with the lead time for the majority of the land points at the global scale mean reforecasts based map is smaller than the era5 based map by between 2 5 mm year 1 at week 1 and 5 mm year 1 at week 4 5 and 6 the map in fig 4 shows central estimates of maximum peak discharges with average recurrence interval of 20 years based on the era5 driven simulation percent relative differences between reforecasts based and era5 based maps are shown in fig 5 for lead times between 1 and 6 weeks together with a representation per upstream area classes in fig 6 relative differences between reforecasts and era5 flood thresholds tend to increase in drier regions as well as with increasing forecast lead time in larger rivers differences are smaller and vary more gradually due to the larger influence of the initial hydrological conditions looking at changes across the range of considered flood magnitudes see supplement material figs s4 s11 one can note a progressive reduction of flood thresholds derived from reforecasts compared to era5 from a return period of 2 years moving towards 500 years with regard to differences versus upstream area the median change of each upstream class ranges within 4 and 1 at week 1 up to within 7 and 2 at week 6 fig 6 when different quantiles of the distribution of the changes per upstream area classes are considered we found an increasing spread of the empirical distribution of data for increasing values of forecast horizon and return period and for decreasing values of upstream area see supplement material figs s13 s20 at 20 year return period the interquartile range i e the central 50 of the distribution of differences ranges between 10 and 10 at week 1 up to 21 and 16 at week 6 see fig s16 differences in the thresholds described above based on different hydrological simulations cause bias and hence inappropriate interpretation of era5 flood thresholds when they are used in the prediction of threshold exceedances along the forecast range such bias can be evaluated by inverting the evd of reforecasts at each weekly lead time using discharge values corresponding to flood thresholds based on the era5 evd fitting an example for a return period of 20 years is shown in fig 7 for lead times between 1 and 6 weeks light yellow pixels in the figure represent river points where a 20 year flood peak magnitude in the era5 simulation corresponds to the same return period magnitude 10 also in the reforecasts based run conversely shades of red blue indicate that 20 year discharges from era5 actually correspond to smaller larger return periods when used in predictive mode 90 confidence intervals around central estimates of flood thresholds are used to assess statistically significant differences between flood thresholds stemming from different input datasets and at different lead times hence assuming a confidence interval of 90 we show in fig 8 the number of subsequent weeks over which era5 based 20 year thresholds fall within the distribution of range specific thresholds derived from reforecasts we found that only in 27 of grid points are era5 based 20 year thresholds statistically consistent with the entire 6 week streamflow forecasts on the other hand in 44 of grid points era5 based 20 year thresholds are not consistent with those derived from reforecasts already from a forecast range of 1 week the remaining 29 of grid points take on intermediate values between 1 and 5 weeks of consistency of the two sets of thresholds similar figures were found across the considered flood return periods see supplement material fig s30 for instance taking the current glofas configuration of 4 week forecasts era5 based thresholds could be consistently used through the entire forecasting range only in 39 31 of glofas grid points for return periods between 2 and 500 years respectively a closer look is given in fig 9 which shows six examples of the proposed range dependent flood thresholds evaluated at the outlet of six rivers together with their 90 confidence intervals the six cases were chosen to represent different continents climate regions basin size as well as different trends in the threshold values along the 6 week forecast range among these six stations 2 cases dniepr and murray darling retain low variability of flood thresholds over the entire 6 week range two cases cauvery and mobile river show a significantly rising trend while two cases itapicuru and congo river a decreasing trend an interesting example is that of the congo river where thresholds are almost constant through the entire forecast range though they are significantly smaller than those derived from era5 such differences are due to a number of extreme events simulated by era5 in 1986 1996 which are therefore not included in the shorter series derived from the reforecasts dataset i e 1997 2017 hence causing the type of discontinuity described in section 2 3 4 discussion results of our analyses show a complex spatial pattern of sign and magnitude of the differences between thresholds derived from a reanalysis dataset i e era5 and those derived from a forecast consistent dataset i e the reforecasts differences do not appear to have clear linear dependence with a number of considered variables such as return period of the flood thresholds weekly forecast range latitude basin upstream area and mean discharge instead the pattern of such differences follows more that of the differences in precipitation statistics see fig 3 and 5 hence it is specific of the chosen atmospheric datasets however we found a tendency for larger discrepancies between era5 and reforecasts based flood thresholds in smaller and drier river basins over longer forecast ranges conversely flood thresholds in large rivers over short forecast ranges often follow closely those based on era5 from which they take the initial conditions determining a large proportion of the river streamflow the findings of this research indicate that range dependent thresholds should be used and replace time invariant thresholds to improve the consistency in flood monitoring and early warning especially over longer forecast ranges unlike the constant thresholds setup the proposed approach would retain consistency along the entire forecast range with the operational streamflow simulations which integrate the effect of three ifs model configurations with different spatial resolution first the era5 atmospheric reanalysis with grid resolution of 31 km used in the baseline run from which hydrological initial conditions are taken second medium range forecasts up to 15 days with grid resolution of 18 km which are primarily governed by atmospheric initial values third extended range forecasts with ocean atmosphere coupling from 16 to 46 days with grid resolution of 36 km where the sea surface temperature and associated heat and moisture start having non negligible influence on the atmospheric evolution owens and hewson 2018 traditionally flood thresholds used in short term forecasting and early warning are based on observations or reconstructed extreme value distributions based on long term simulations pappenberger et al 2015b on the other hand long term e g seasonal forecasts use less extreme thresholds based on anomalies or percentiles from the streamflow distributions to compensate for the smoothing effect of coarser resolution modeling forecast uncertainty temporal aggregation of results and variability of the precipitation statistics in the long range forecasting arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 in this context we see our approach as a step in the right direction for a smooth transition between quantitative thresholds of discharge or water level to long range forecasts which are tailored more on the identification of wetter or drier than normal periods in an ideal seamless forecasting system seasonal forecasts would anticipate wetter than normal periods which could potentially become large scale river flooding and be detected as severe events as early as a few weeks before leaving enough time for low cost preparatory actions as the event approaches short term forecasts enable improved quantitative estimation of river discharges and corresponding water levels hence transitioning to impact based assessments including the exposure and vulnerability of the potentially affected areas so to prioritize actions for an efficient emergency management to the authors knowledge no operational system for medium range flood early warning uses range dependent thresholds to detect upcoming severe events the concept of range dependent thresholds may initially be difficult to accept for users as it eliminates the univocal link between discharge thresholds and their probability of occurrences in other words any given discharge peak would correspond to a different probability of occurrence depending on when it is forecast in the future yet the proposed approach is more correct and consistent with the data hence it is likely to improve the estimation of the magnitude of upcoming extreme events over longer forecast ranges 5 conclusions in this research we have tested a new method to estimate discharge thresholds for medium range flood forecasting for potential use in the global flood awareness system we have provided evidence that flood thresholds for medium range forecasting can take on significantly different values from thresholds derived from the reference baseline run forced by era5 data used to initialize the forecasts in addition thresholds often vary throughout consecutive weekly forecast ranges with a complex pattern of change mostly driven by differences in the atmospheric datasets used as forcing to the hydrological model therefore we propose a modified framework for the early detection of floods based on range dependent flood thresholds which are able to compensate for forecast drifts in the extreme values particularly useful over long ranges upcoming work ahead of the operational implementation will involve extensive testing and skill evaluation of the operational ensemble forecasts to assess the limits of predictability of the system and compare the system skills to the current operational version this represents a key step in the evolution of glofas which may ultimately lead to the extension from the current 30 day to a 6 week forecasting range it is worth noting that flood thresholds based on reforecasts must be updated regularly as new ifs cycles are released to retain consistency between streamflow predictions and warning thresholds and improve the detection of severe floods along the

8604,using environmental tracers to date groundwater age in fractured systems is difficult since mass exchange processes between fractures and matrix might mask the actual distribution of groundwater velocity thus leading to biased results here we propose an analytical solution to date groundwater age in fractured media using 4 he data the solution which is an extension of existing solutions based on linear accumulation methods decouples the transport equation in the flowing fracture from the diffusion equation in the rock matrix under the assumption of steady state conditions in the proposed analytical solution groundwater age and 4 he concentration are linearly related and the 4 he bulk production rate in matrix scaled by the inverse of fracture volume fraction is the proportionality constant this scaling factor accounts for the underlying mass exchange processes between fracture and rock matrix moreover an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm based formulation for the numerical assessment of steady state 4 he levels in fractured media is presented and used to test the performance of the proposed dating technique in realistic conditions keywords groundwater age fractured media 4 he data analytical solution 1 introduction the concept of groundwater age has been long used by hydrogeologists to e g assess the vulnerability of aquifers used for drinking water production e g meinardi et al 1995 burgess et al 2010 molson and frind 2012 to investigate saline intrusion processes e g han et al 2011 or to evaluate the suitability of a potential site for the deep geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel neretnieks 2013 trinchero et al 2014 as clearly and didactically explained by bethke and johnson 2008 groundwater age is the interval of time that has elapsed since groundwater at a location in a flow regime entered the subsurface groundwater dating techniques can be roughly divided into two categories i e chemical based methods and physical based approaches physical based approaches estimate groundwater age directly or indirectly from simulations of the groundwater flow regime e g reilly et al 1994 the traditional method used to estimate groundwater age is by means of integration of the velocity vector along a particle pathline davis and bentley 1982 which gives an estimate also denoted as kinematic age the limitation of this approach is that only advective processes are considered by means of a simple analogy with the advection dispersion equation goode 1996 proposed a continuity equation which can be used to simulate the transient evolution of the mean groundwater age and which accounts for the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion at steady state and in the absence of dispersion including numerical mean groundwater age coincides with kinematic age whereas in the presence of dispersion the former gives lower estimates as dispersive and diffusive fluxes in the direction of decreasing mean groundwater age tend to limit maximum ages varni and carrera 1998 noticed that groundwater samples contain a distribution of different ages and thus further extended the analytical framework of goode 1996 by providing analytical solutions for higher order moments of the age distribution the authors also pointed out that kinematic ages computed in heterogeneous fields could be unstable meaning that significant differences in age estimation may appear between two nearby locations on the contrary the continuity equation of the mean groundwater age provides a continuous solution even in the presence of strong contrasts in flow and transport properties chemical based dating methods are typically based on the rate of decay of radioactive environmental tracers asymptotic decay methods bentley et al 1986 torgersen et al 1991 clark and fritz 2013 by assuming a closed piston like system groundwater age can be estimated as 1 t w 1 λ ln c c 0 where c and c 0 mol l are respectively the concentration in the measured sample and at recharge λ t 1 is the radionuclide decay constant and t w y is the groundwater age estimates of groundwater age obtained with eq 1 are denoted as radiometric ages it has been shown that in real systems where mixing occurs as a results of dispersive fluxes radiometric ages are biased toward younger ages and thus are also denoted as apparent ages cornaton et al 2011 in fractured media or in systems where thin conductive aquifers are confined by low permeability aquitards diffusive mass exchange from the fracture aquifer to the matrix aquitard may also lead to biased estimates of groundwater age sudicky and frind 1981 and thus correction methods have been proposed neretnieks 1981 sanford 1997 varni and carrera 1998 however showed that the mean groundwater age computed using the concept of conservation of groundwater age mass is not affected by matrix diffusion besides radioisotopes also stable naturally occurring isotopes can be used to date groundwater age bethke et al 1999 the most common stable nuclide used for groundwater dating is indeed 4 he which is produced by the alpha decay of radionuclides within the natural uranium and thorium decay series ballentine and burnard 2002 4 he has been typically used to date groundwater age in porous aquifers e g torgersen 1980 torgersen and clarke 1985 bethke et al 1999 under the assumption of a closed piston like system groundwater age can be estimated as 2 t w ϕ c c 0 r α where ϕ is the aquifer porosity r α is the helium production rate mol m3 y and the other terms are as in eq 1 in fractured media the intact rock matrix might contain a certain amount of uranium and thorium e g trinchero et al 2014 and references therein thus helium generates in the matrix and back diffuses into the adjacent water bearing fractures it turns out that the use of linear accumulation methods to date groundwater age in fractured media is not trivial in this paper we present an analytical solution which is a simple extension of linear accumulation methods that allows 4 he data to be used for groundwater dating in fractured media as in the classical version of the linear accumulation method eq 2 groundwater age is linearly dependent on 4 he concentration and inversely proportional to 4 he production rate the latter term is however scaled here by the inverse of fracture volume fraction i e the fracture volume divided by the bulk volume of medium this scaling term provides the link with the underlying matrix diffusion processes the proposed solution is validated using a simple test case in the second part of the paper we provide a formulation for the numerical simulation of steady state 4 he levels in fractured media the formulation is based on an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm conceptualisation of the fractured system and is used here to further validate the proposed analytical solution 2 problem formulation in sparsely fractured rock groundwater typically flows along complex networks of fractures fig 1 left through simplification this otherwise incredibly complex system is often conceptualised as a network of quasi parallel flow pathways e g sudicky and frind 1982 see fig 1 right under this hypothesis transport of a long lived non sorbing nuclide is described by these two coupled partial differential equations 3 c f t v c f x d l 2 c f x 2 ϕ d p δ f c m z z 0 0 x l and 4 c m t d p 2 c m z 2 f 0 z δ m where c mol m w 3 is the concentration of radionuclide in solution from hereafter subscripts m f and w are used to refer to the rock matrix the fracture and the water respectively v m y is the water velocity in the fracture ϕ is the rock matrix porosity d p m 2 y is the pore diffusion coefficient in the matrix δ f m is half of the fracture aperture 1 δ f m 1 is the fracture specific surface area and f mol m w 3 y is the radionuclide production rate in the matrix hydrodynamic dispersion d l m 2 y is expressed as 5 d l α l v d w where α l m is the longitudinal dispersivity and d w m2 y is the diffusion coefficient in unconstrained solution for the sake of convenience the origin of the z axis is placed at the matrix fracture interface and not in the middle of the fracture the following boundary conditions apply 6a c f 0 t 0 6b c m x 0 t c f x t 6c c m z x δ m t 0 where δ m m is the available matrix extent which is typically assimilated to the average fracture half spacing we will discuss later about different boundary conditions to be applied at the outlet boundary x l note that this problem formulation mimics the infiltration of nuclide free water and the production of a nuclide in the rock matrix thus this set of equations is suited to simulate transport of radiogenically produced 4 he which is produced by the alpha decay of radionuclides within the natural uranium and thorium decay series at steady state eq 4 has the following solution 6d c m x z c f x fz 2 d p 2 δ m z and the fracture matrix interfacial surface flux is 6e ϕ d p dc m dz z 0 ϕ f δ m at steady state the transport equation in the fracture eq 3 can conveniently be re written in terms of dimensionless distance θ x l and peclet number pe vl d l 6f 1 pe d 2 c f d θ 2 dc f d θ l δ f v f ϕ δ m 0 0 θ 1 for the outlet boundary θ 1 we consider here two alternative boundary conditions 10a c f 0 10b or dc f dx 0 eq 10a i e a dirichlet boundary condition could be used to simulate e g rapid 4 he degassing at the outlet while eq 10b neumann boundary condition could mimic advective discharge in conductive quaternary sediments it is worthwhile noting that for mathematical convenience most of the available analytical solutions for transport in fractured rock assume instead a semi infinite domain the solution of eq 6f is 11 c f η exp pe θ θ 1 exp pe 1 1 exp pe for the dirichlet boundary condition and 12 c f η θ exp pe exp θ 1 pe pe for the neumann boundary condition where 13 η l v δ f f ϕ δ m t w l δ f f ϕ δ m it is interesting to note that t w l in eq 13 is the groundwater residence time at the pathway outlet this term has been used synonymously with the term groundwater age bethke and johnson 2008 groundwater age at given positions along the pathway can then be written as 14 t w θ c f g δ f δ m θ exp pe θ θ 1 exp pe 1 1 exp pe 1 for the dirichlet boundary condition and 15 t w θ c f g δ f δ m θ θ exp pe exp θ 1 pe pe 1 for the neumann boundary conditions here g f ϕ mol m 3 y is the bulk production rate of 4 he in the rock matrix for high peclet numbers eq 12 reduces to 16 c f η θ and groundwater age simplifies to 17 t w θ c f g δ f δ m c f g ω f where ω f is the fracture volume fraction note that the approximation is valid as long as fracture aperture is much smaller than fracture spacing based on site characterisation studies conducted in three fennoscandian fractured crystalline media olkiluoto in finland and forsmark and laxemar in sweden drake et al 2006 eichinger et al 2006 trinchero et al 2014 showed that the 4 he production rate in the matrix of these three fractured media is well known and relatively constant g 1 1 1 4 10 10 mol m3 y we will use a value of 1 2 10 10 mol m3 y in the calculations hereafter it is interesting to note that eq 17 is formally identical to the equation typically used in linear accumulation methods to date groundwater age in sedimentary porous aquifers using 4 he data eq 2 the only difference here is that the production rate is scaled by the inverse of the fracture volume fraction which provides a direct link with the underlying mass exchange processes between the rock matrix and fractures 3 model validation a simple problem based on a system including a rock matrix and a single planar fracture is solved numerically to validate the analytical solutions developed in the previous section the parameters of the problem are summarised in table 1 the numerical calculations were carried out using the numerical code pflotran lichtner et al 2013 hammond et al 2014 the pflotran model was discretised with a structured grid and with constant refinement in the direction parallel to flow using 500 grid cells whereas 750 cells were employed in the perpendicular direction with the first 250 cells having a size of 5 10 6 m and the remaining 500 cells located further away from the fracture with a refinement of 2 10 4 m with a total of 375 000 grid cells two calculation cases were performed the first with longitudinal dispersivity set to α l 0 1 m pe 2 5 and the second with α l 0 05 m pe 3 3 all the calculations were carried out in the jureca booster module jülich supercomputing centre 2018 the results of the validation exercise are shown in fig 2 the analytical solutions of eq 11 dirichlet boundary condition and 12 neumann boundary condition agree well with the numerical calculations with the low peclet numbers considered here eq 16 provides a reasonable approximation to eq 12 only relatively far from the outlet boundary the divergence between the full analytical solution eq 12 and its simplified formulation eq 16 has implications for the groundwater dating technique proposed here as it can lead to lower estimates of groundwater age close to the outlet boundary particularly at low peclet numbers from the set of equations presented in the previous section it is evident that the transport in the fracture can be decoupled from the matrix at steady state by including eq 6e into eq 3 the related differential equation can then be written as follows 18 v dc f dx d l d 2 c f dx 2 γ 0 x l where γ g δ m δ f g ω f mol m3 y is the scaled 4 he production rate the validation of the analytical solution has here been repeated only for the case of pe 2 5 using this formulation i e transport has been solved using a pflotran 1d calculation the results of this validation are shown in fig 3 4 continuum based formulation continuum models based on equivalent continuous porous media ecpm conceptualisations of the fractured systems have been long identified as appealing and numerically efficient tools to investigate groundwater flow and transport in fractured media neuman 1988 selroos et al 2002 trinchero et al 2017 iraola et al 2019 in these types of models an underlying discrete fracture network dfn is used to derive equivalent parameters for the equivalent continuous porous ecp medium among the different available upscaling methodologies e g skb 2011 and references therein the geometrical approach in which intersecting volumes between fractures and grid cell control volumes are computed and contributions from all intersecting fractures are added to the related parameters svensson 2001 svensson 2001 hadgu et al 2017 is probably the most commonly used more specifically in this approach the contribution of each fracture to the permeability tensor is computed using some empirical relationship typically the cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 while kinematic porosity φ is equivalent to the fracture volume fraction ω f using this approach the steady state distribution of 4 he concentration can be simulated using the following formulation 19 q c d c g where q m y is the darcy flux vector d α q m2 y is the dispersion tensor and α m is the isotropic dispersivity value it is interesting to note that g in eq 19 is the bulk 4 he production rate in the rock matrix which is no longer scaled by the fracture volume fraction as opposed to eq 18 in fact eq 18 is valid for a single fracture whereas eq 19 is valid for a generic three dimensional dfn derived ecpm model 4 1 test case 1 tc1 an illustrative example is here used as a demonstrative problem for the proposed continuum based formulation the problem considers a 2d vertical cross section of a sparsely fractured bedrock sfb with a size of 964 m 128 m flow and transport are mostly channeled along two highly transmissive deformation zones dz s see fig 4 the sfb is assumed to have a permeability k sfb 1 10 18 m2 and a fracture volume fraction ω f sfb 1 10 4 whereas the dz s have higher permeability and fracture volume fraction due to the higher fracture intensity k dz 1 10 14 m2 and ω f dz 1 10 2 inlet and outlet boundaries are located at coordinates 0 10 128 and 954 964 128 respectively and the domain was discretised using 241 64 15 424 regular grid cells 4 m 2 m a pressure difference p in p out 10 000 pa is applied between the inlet and the outlet the transport model includes three solutes 4 he a conservative tracer and groundwater age zero 4 he concentration and unitary concentration of the conservative tracer are prescribed at the inlet boundary consistently with the framework of goode 1996 groundwater age is subject to the same transport equation and related processes used to simulate the transport of the conservative tracer with the only difference that a zero order source term accounts for aging groundwater age and therefore also the age mass flux is set to zero at the inlet boundary the initial concentration is set to zero for the three species and a boundary condition of no dispersion across the outlet is prescribed the calculations were carried out using pflotran with dispersivity being set to 1 m the simulation time frame is long enough so that 4 he and mean groundwater age have attained steady state it is worthwhile noting that no matrix diffusion is included in the calculation this implies that the transient analysis of the transport of the conservative solute that is presented hereafter is only intended to provide a description of groundwater flow patterns both mean groundwater age i e goode s equation and 4 he are instead analysed at steady state as shown by varni and carrera 1998 mean groundwater age is not affected by matrix diffusion so it is consistent to compare estimates of mean groundwater age with corresponding estimates obtained using 4 he concentration and eq 17 note also that at steady state the influence of matrix exchange processes on 4 he levels is accounted for by means of the production term as discussed in section 4 above three different time snapshots of tracer concentration are shown in fig 5 as expected relatively quick tracer penetration is observed along the dz s whereas advection through the sfb is much slower 4 he concentrations are analysed at 100 000 y at this time 4 he levels are already at steady state 4 he levels follow similar but inverted patterns as the tracer fig 6 with lower concentration values observed along the two deformation zones due to the effect of infiltrating water and higher concentration values observed in the sfb where the effect of in situ production of 4 he in the matrix is significantly stronger than the effect of infiltration of helium free water the 4 he concentration values can be used to date groundwater age using eq 17 it is worthwhile noting that when applied to a continuum model the proposed mathematical expression depends on the spatial distribution of fracture volume fraction thus similarly to what already observed by varni and carrera 1998 for kinematic age estimates in heterogeneous media the solution does not provide a continuous distribution of groundwater age to qualitatively validate the proposed framework the results of groundwater age computed using 4 he data are compared with estimates of mean groundwater age goode 1996 which instead provide a continuous distribution the comparison between the two sets of results is shown in fig 7 due to the linear relationship between 4 he derived groundwater age and fracture volume fraction estimates along the deformation zones tend to be higher than corresponding estimates from groundwater age mass whereas significantly lower values are observed in cells located outside but nearby the deformation zone these cells are characterised by lower fracture volume fraction and relatively low 4 he content this effect is further amplified when dispersive fluxes are increased by e g using higher dispersivity values results are not shown here despite these differences the generally good agreement between the two set of results points out that the proposed analytical solution eq 17 can be used to obtain approximated values of groundwater age in fractured media 4 2 test case 2 tc2 a second more realistic test case is presented here tc2 is loosely based on a groundwater flow model for laxemar sweden vidstrand et al 2010 laxemar was one of the two sites that were thoroughly characterised during the siting process for a spent nuclear fuel repository in sweden the second site forsmark was finally selected as the candidate site for the proposed repository the sparsely fractured rock was simulated using a discrete fracture network that was generated using darcytools svensson and follin 2010 svensson and ferry 2014 in darcytools the generation of stochastic fractures is governed by the following equation 20 n i a l dl l ref a l l ref a where n is the number of fractures per unit volume i m 3 is the intensity a is the power law exponent and l ref m is the reference length which was set to 1 m here fracture orientation follows a fisher distribution characterised by the following parameters 21a λ 1 cos 90 tr cos pl κ 21b λ 2 sin 90 tr cos pl κ 21c λ 3 sin pl κ where tr and pl are the mean trend and mean plunge respectively and κ is the fisher concentration the following power law relationship between fracture transmissivity t f m2 s and fracture size l m is considered 22 log t f log a t l 100 b t d t u 0 5 0 5 where a t m2 s is the transmissivity of a fracture of size l 100 m and b t is the power law exponent u is the uniform distribution and d t is a scaling factor the parameters of the model were taken from the shallow part of the hydraulic rock domain hrd at laxemar vidstrand et al 2010 and are summarised in tables 2 and 3 the domain is a rectangular parallelepiped with the opposite vertices located at 0 0 0 0 128 0 and 1024 0 1024 0 0 0 which is discretised with regular grid cells of size δ x δ y 4 m and δ z 2 m i e 4 194 304 grid cells continuum dfn derived parameters fracture volume fraction and permeability were calculated using the approach described by svensson 2001 the resulting distributions of permeability and fracture volume fraction are shown in fig 8 cells not intersected by any fracture were deactivated during the flow and transport calculation the total number of active cells is 1 780 414 constant hydraulic pressure was applied to two narrow regions of width 10 m in the x direction and length 1 024 m in the y direction both regions are located at the top face at x 0 m p in and x 1 014 m p out respectively and a pressure difference p in p out 1000 pa was prescribed the rest of the boundaries were considered as no flow boundaries 4he free water was assumed to infiltrate through the inlet boundary 4he production in the rock matrix is the same as used in tc1 i e g 1 2 10 10 mol m3 y to keep track of conservative transport patterns a conservative tracer was also added to the infiltrating boundary water snapshots of the inert tracer concentration taken at simulation time 5 35 and 100 y are shown in fig 9 as already discussed in the previous test case the analysis of the transient evolution of the conservative tracer is only used for a visual evaluation of groundwater flow patterns as matrix diffusion processes are not included at early times the tracer infiltrates through the most conductive fractures and after 100 y has already reached the discharge area although less connected regions are still characterised by moderate to low concentrations the calculation was run in the jureca booster module using 680 cores 5200 transport degrees of freedom per process as groundwater age is also included as primary species the total number of transport degrees of freedom is given by the number of primary species multiplied by the number of active grid cells and around 16 000 h of supercomputing time i e 24 h of wall clock time the simulation was run out to 10 000 y in time to obtain steady state concentration distributions of 4he fig 10 a few grid cells 51 811 cells i e 2 9 of the total active cells are poorly connected or even completely unconnected from the rest of the active cells these cells which have a very low fracture volume fraction and thus are expected to have minor impact on helium levels in the transmissive fractures are not considered in the analysis discussed hereafter 4he levels show a qualitatively similar but inverse pattern as the conservative tracer highly transmissive and connected fractures are clearly delineated by low 4he concentration values even far from the inlet boundary indicating fast infiltration processes whereas less connected regions are characterised by high 4he concentration values 4 he 1 mol m w 3 for the sake of simplicity 4he concentration levels are further analysed in a single vertical cross section taken at x 512 m and with normal vector parallel to the y direction groundwater age was computed in this cross section using 4he concentration values along with eq 17 fig 11 top groundwater age was also computed using the concept of groundwater age mass goode 1996 and the results are shown in fig 11 bottom it is worthwhile noting that the assumptions used to derive eq 17 e g closed piston like system with constant source of helium per unit of water in the flowing fractures are clearly not fulfilled in this more realistic test case thus comparing results obtained with eq 17 with results obtained with a less restrictive dating technique goode 1996 should be seen as an assessment of the performance of the proposed methodology when applied to date groundwater in realistic complex environments the visual comparison between the two figures shows that the two methods provide qualitatively consistent estimates of groundwater age with relatively young ages 50 y observed in the most conductive and connected fractures and with old ages observed in the less connected and mostly stagnant regions a scatter plot showing groundwater age computed along the selected vertical cross section using 4he data vs groundwater age mass concept is also shown in fig 12 as already discussed in tc1 there are differences between the two estimates estimates obtained with eq 17 are not continuous and in a number of points significantly lower values of groundwater age are obtained this difference is attributable to the strong contrasts in porosity of this model in fact these points are all located in the fringe of flowing fractures and have a significantly lower porosity on the contrary in the core of fractured zones estimates obtained with the concept of groundwater age mass are generally lower due to the already discussed effect of dispersive fluxes of groundwater age which tend to limit the maximum ages goode 1996 5 discussion the paper s main contribution is to present an analytical solution that combined with available measurements of 4 he concentration can provide first order estimations of groundwater age in fractured aquifers the method decouples the influence of matrix diffusion processes from the transport equation in the fracture under the assumption of steady state conditions and thus gives estimates of groundwater age that are related to the groundwater velocity in the flowing fractures the main underlying assumption is that the medium behaves as a closed system meaning that mixing at fracture intersections is neglected despite their high complexity and heterogeneity evidence of flow being channelised along sparse channel networks have been observed in several laboratory and field experiments carried out in fractured media e g tsang and neretnieks 1998 another important assumption of eq 17 is that helium sources in the fracture due to back diffusion from the matrix are constant along the considered pathways this implies that helium production rate in the rock matrix f matrix porosity ϕ and fracture volume fraction ω f are also constant if we take the forsmark site as an example it has been shown that the first and second terms are relatively constant in the whole investigated domain drake et al 2006 trinchero et al 2014 however at the forsmark site fracture intensity which is related to the value of ω f decreases with depth thus depending on the depth of the investigated domain biases in the results could be introduced by the assumption of homogeneous production both the analytical solution eq 17 and the ecpm formulation section 4 are based on the assumption that the extent of the rock matrix δ m is limited note however that in eq 17 δ m is constant along the entire flowpath whereas in the ecpm formulation δ m implicitly changes according to the spatial distribution of fracture volume fraction this hypothesis implies that a no flux boundary is placed at z δ m see eq 6c which implicitly means that the medium is conceptualised as a symmetric system of parallel fractures this gross simplification of the fractured medium is commonly employed in contaminant transport simulations see e g sudicky and frind 1982 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 cvetkovic 2017 advection is assumed to be the main transport mechanism in the flowing fractures therefore the proposed method is suited to date groundwater age in relatively shallow and hydraulically active systems for instance trinchero et al 2014 assessed helium levels at forsmark laxemar and olkiluoto the focus of that work was to understand helium transport patters at greater depth from 200 to 1 000 meters below sea level in those conditions where diffusion becomes the main transport mechanism the analytical solution eq 17 is clearly not applicable finally as already discussed above the method presumes that steady state conditions are attained this is an import limitation in sites that have experienced strong changes in the hydrogeological regime over the past thousands of years due to e g landscape evolution or glaciation de glaciation events considering as starting point a hypothetical flushing event interfacial 4 he fluxes will start increasing until reaching the steady state level of eq 6e the time until steady state 4 he fluxes are attained depends on the hydrodynamic conditions i e groundwater velocity and the distance from the recharge boundary moreover increasing production rate increasing porosity or decreasing fracture volume fraction would lead to an extended transient time frame in the second part of the paper we have presented a continuum based formulation for the assessment of helium levels the objective of the formulation is twofold i to further validate the proposed analytical solution and ii to offer a computationally appealing approach for the investigation of steady state helium levels using a stochastic continuum model iraola et al 2019 in the formulation it is implicitly assumed that all the produced radiogenic helium is dissolved in the groundwater and this could lead to helium concentrations exceeding the solubility limit particularly in poorly connected regions thus the possibility of generation of gas bubbles should be considered particularly at shallow depths where water pressure is relatively low 6 summary and conclusion in porous aquifers 4he which is produced by the alpha decay of natural uranium and thorium within the aquifer solids has long been used to date groundwater age the so called linear accumulation method establishes a linear relationship between groundwater age and 4he concentration being the ratio between aquifer porosity and 4he production rate the proportionality constant in fractured granitic rock 4he production takes place in the rock matrix and this leads to back diffusion of 4he from the matrix to the flowing fractures we have analysed here the differential equations that govern 4he production diffusion and migration in a dual porosity system at steady state 4he fracture matrix interfacial surface flux is constant and equal to the bulk production rate scaled by the available size of the matrix it turns out that a similar linear relationship between groundwater age and 4he concentration can be established being in this case the inverse of the bulk production rate scaled by the fracture volume fraction as the proportionality constant this scaling factor provides a direct link with the underlying mass exchange processes the proposed solution which has been validated using a single fracture matrix verification test can be readily applied to date groundwater age in shallow fractured systems where advection along flowing fractures is an important transport mechanism besides 4he data the method requires the knowledge of measurable characteristics of the fractured rock system namely the average fracture aperture and matrix size moreover uranium and thorium content along with matrix porosity are needed to infer the bulk 4he production rate whereas the steady state solution does not depend on matrix diffusivity a continuum based formulation based on an equivalent continuous porous ecpm medium derived from an underlying discrete fracture network dfn has also been presented and used to further analyse the applicability of the proposed dating framework a simple and a more complex and realistic test case have been used to simulate steady state 4he levels and to derive related groundwater ages estimates of groundwater age based on the concept of groundwater age mass have also bee computed the results obtained with the two different methodologies were in qualitatively good agreement discrepancies and in particular generally higher groundwater estimates obtained from 4he data are due to the different underlying assumptions the general conclusion of the verification tests in particular tc2 is that the proposed dating methodology can provide reasonable estimates of groundwater age even in realistic fractured systems as long as flow is characterised by channelised

8604,using environmental tracers to date groundwater age in fractured systems is difficult since mass exchange processes between fractures and matrix might mask the actual distribution of groundwater velocity thus leading to biased results here we propose an analytical solution to date groundwater age in fractured media using 4 he data the solution which is an extension of existing solutions based on linear accumulation methods decouples the transport equation in the flowing fracture from the diffusion equation in the rock matrix under the assumption of steady state conditions in the proposed analytical solution groundwater age and 4 he concentration are linearly related and the 4 he bulk production rate in matrix scaled by the inverse of fracture volume fraction is the proportionality constant this scaling factor accounts for the underlying mass exchange processes between fracture and rock matrix moreover an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm based formulation for the numerical assessment of steady state 4 he levels in fractured media is presented and used to test the performance of the proposed dating technique in realistic conditions keywords groundwater age fractured media 4 he data analytical solution 1 introduction the concept of groundwater age has been long used by hydrogeologists to e g assess the vulnerability of aquifers used for drinking water production e g meinardi et al 1995 burgess et al 2010 molson and frind 2012 to investigate saline intrusion processes e g han et al 2011 or to evaluate the suitability of a potential site for the deep geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel neretnieks 2013 trinchero et al 2014 as clearly and didactically explained by bethke and johnson 2008 groundwater age is the interval of time that has elapsed since groundwater at a location in a flow regime entered the subsurface groundwater dating techniques can be roughly divided into two categories i e chemical based methods and physical based approaches physical based approaches estimate groundwater age directly or indirectly from simulations of the groundwater flow regime e g reilly et al 1994 the traditional method used to estimate groundwater age is by means of integration of the velocity vector along a particle pathline davis and bentley 1982 which gives an estimate also denoted as kinematic age the limitation of this approach is that only advective processes are considered by means of a simple analogy with the advection dispersion equation goode 1996 proposed a continuity equation which can be used to simulate the transient evolution of the mean groundwater age and which accounts for the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion at steady state and in the absence of dispersion including numerical mean groundwater age coincides with kinematic age whereas in the presence of dispersion the former gives lower estimates as dispersive and diffusive fluxes in the direction of decreasing mean groundwater age tend to limit maximum ages varni and carrera 1998 noticed that groundwater samples contain a distribution of different ages and thus further extended the analytical framework of goode 1996 by providing analytical solutions for higher order moments of the age distribution the authors also pointed out that kinematic ages computed in heterogeneous fields could be unstable meaning that significant differences in age estimation may appear between two nearby locations on the contrary the continuity equation of the mean groundwater age provides a continuous solution even in the presence of strong contrasts in flow and transport properties chemical based dating methods are typically based on the rate of decay of radioactive environmental tracers asymptotic decay methods bentley et al 1986 torgersen et al 1991 clark and fritz 2013 by assuming a closed piston like system groundwater age can be estimated as 1 t w 1 λ ln c c 0 where c and c 0 mol l are respectively the concentration in the measured sample and at recharge λ t 1 is the radionuclide decay constant and t w y is the groundwater age estimates of groundwater age obtained with eq 1 are denoted as radiometric ages it has been shown that in real systems where mixing occurs as a results of dispersive fluxes radiometric ages are biased toward younger ages and thus are also denoted as apparent ages cornaton et al 2011 in fractured media or in systems where thin conductive aquifers are confined by low permeability aquitards diffusive mass exchange from the fracture aquifer to the matrix aquitard may also lead to biased estimates of groundwater age sudicky and frind 1981 and thus correction methods have been proposed neretnieks 1981 sanford 1997 varni and carrera 1998 however showed that the mean groundwater age computed using the concept of conservation of groundwater age mass is not affected by matrix diffusion besides radioisotopes also stable naturally occurring isotopes can be used to date groundwater age bethke et al 1999 the most common stable nuclide used for groundwater dating is indeed 4 he which is produced by the alpha decay of radionuclides within the natural uranium and thorium decay series ballentine and burnard 2002 4 he has been typically used to date groundwater age in porous aquifers e g torgersen 1980 torgersen and clarke 1985 bethke et al 1999 under the assumption of a closed piston like system groundwater age can be estimated as 2 t w ϕ c c 0 r α where ϕ is the aquifer porosity r α is the helium production rate mol m3 y and the other terms are as in eq 1 in fractured media the intact rock matrix might contain a certain amount of uranium and thorium e g trinchero et al 2014 and references therein thus helium generates in the matrix and back diffuses into the adjacent water bearing fractures it turns out that the use of linear accumulation methods to date groundwater age in fractured media is not trivial in this paper we present an analytical solution which is a simple extension of linear accumulation methods that allows 4 he data to be used for groundwater dating in fractured media as in the classical version of the linear accumulation method eq 2 groundwater age is linearly dependent on 4 he concentration and inversely proportional to 4 he production rate the latter term is however scaled here by the inverse of fracture volume fraction i e the fracture volume divided by the bulk volume of medium this scaling term provides the link with the underlying matrix diffusion processes the proposed solution is validated using a simple test case in the second part of the paper we provide a formulation for the numerical simulation of steady state 4 he levels in fractured media the formulation is based on an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm conceptualisation of the fractured system and is used here to further validate the proposed analytical solution 2 problem formulation in sparsely fractured rock groundwater typically flows along complex networks of fractures fig 1 left through simplification this otherwise incredibly complex system is often conceptualised as a network of quasi parallel flow pathways e g sudicky and frind 1982 see fig 1 right under this hypothesis transport of a long lived non sorbing nuclide is described by these two coupled partial differential equations 3 c f t v c f x d l 2 c f x 2 ϕ d p δ f c m z z 0 0 x l and 4 c m t d p 2 c m z 2 f 0 z δ m where c mol m w 3 is the concentration of radionuclide in solution from hereafter subscripts m f and w are used to refer to the rock matrix the fracture and the water respectively v m y is the water velocity in the fracture ϕ is the rock matrix porosity d p m 2 y is the pore diffusion coefficient in the matrix δ f m is half of the fracture aperture 1 δ f m 1 is the fracture specific surface area and f mol m w 3 y is the radionuclide production rate in the matrix hydrodynamic dispersion d l m 2 y is expressed as 5 d l α l v d w where α l m is the longitudinal dispersivity and d w m2 y is the diffusion coefficient in unconstrained solution for the sake of convenience the origin of the z axis is placed at the matrix fracture interface and not in the middle of the fracture the following boundary conditions apply 6a c f 0 t 0 6b c m x 0 t c f x t 6c c m z x δ m t 0 where δ m m is the available matrix extent which is typically assimilated to the average fracture half spacing we will discuss later about different boundary conditions to be applied at the outlet boundary x l note that this problem formulation mimics the infiltration of nuclide free water and the production of a nuclide in the rock matrix thus this set of equations is suited to simulate transport of radiogenically produced 4 he which is produced by the alpha decay of radionuclides within the natural uranium and thorium decay series at steady state eq 4 has the following solution 6d c m x z c f x fz 2 d p 2 δ m z and the fracture matrix interfacial surface flux is 6e ϕ d p dc m dz z 0 ϕ f δ m at steady state the transport equation in the fracture eq 3 can conveniently be re written in terms of dimensionless distance θ x l and peclet number pe vl d l 6f 1 pe d 2 c f d θ 2 dc f d θ l δ f v f ϕ δ m 0 0 θ 1 for the outlet boundary θ 1 we consider here two alternative boundary conditions 10a c f 0 10b or dc f dx 0 eq 10a i e a dirichlet boundary condition could be used to simulate e g rapid 4 he degassing at the outlet while eq 10b neumann boundary condition could mimic advective discharge in conductive quaternary sediments it is worthwhile noting that for mathematical convenience most of the available analytical solutions for transport in fractured rock assume instead a semi infinite domain the solution of eq 6f is 11 c f η exp pe θ θ 1 exp pe 1 1 exp pe for the dirichlet boundary condition and 12 c f η θ exp pe exp θ 1 pe pe for the neumann boundary condition where 13 η l v δ f f ϕ δ m t w l δ f f ϕ δ m it is interesting to note that t w l in eq 13 is the groundwater residence time at the pathway outlet this term has been used synonymously with the term groundwater age bethke and johnson 2008 groundwater age at given positions along the pathway can then be written as 14 t w θ c f g δ f δ m θ exp pe θ θ 1 exp pe 1 1 exp pe 1 for the dirichlet boundary condition and 15 t w θ c f g δ f δ m θ θ exp pe exp θ 1 pe pe 1 for the neumann boundary conditions here g f ϕ mol m 3 y is the bulk production rate of 4 he in the rock matrix for high peclet numbers eq 12 reduces to 16 c f η θ and groundwater age simplifies to 17 t w θ c f g δ f δ m c f g ω f where ω f is the fracture volume fraction note that the approximation is valid as long as fracture aperture is much smaller than fracture spacing based on site characterisation studies conducted in three fennoscandian fractured crystalline media olkiluoto in finland and forsmark and laxemar in sweden drake et al 2006 eichinger et al 2006 trinchero et al 2014 showed that the 4 he production rate in the matrix of these three fractured media is well known and relatively constant g 1 1 1 4 10 10 mol m3 y we will use a value of 1 2 10 10 mol m3 y in the calculations hereafter it is interesting to note that eq 17 is formally identical to the equation typically used in linear accumulation methods to date groundwater age in sedimentary porous aquifers using 4 he data eq 2 the only difference here is that the production rate is scaled by the inverse of the fracture volume fraction which provides a direct link with the underlying mass exchange processes between the rock matrix and fractures 3 model validation a simple problem based on a system including a rock matrix and a single planar fracture is solved numerically to validate the analytical solutions developed in the previous section the parameters of the problem are summarised in table 1 the numerical calculations were carried out using the numerical code pflotran lichtner et al 2013 hammond et al 2014 the pflotran model was discretised with a structured grid and with constant refinement in the direction parallel to flow using 500 grid cells whereas 750 cells were employed in the perpendicular direction with the first 250 cells having a size of 5 10 6 m and the remaining 500 cells located further away from the fracture with a refinement of 2 10 4 m with a total of 375 000 grid cells two calculation cases were performed the first with longitudinal dispersivity set to α l 0 1 m pe 2 5 and the second with α l 0 05 m pe 3 3 all the calculations were carried out in the jureca booster module jülich supercomputing centre 2018 the results of the validation exercise are shown in fig 2 the analytical solutions of eq 11 dirichlet boundary condition and 12 neumann boundary condition agree well with the numerical calculations with the low peclet numbers considered here eq 16 provides a reasonable approximation to eq 12 only relatively far from the outlet boundary the divergence between the full analytical solution eq 12 and its simplified formulation eq 16 has implications for the groundwater dating technique proposed here as it can lead to lower estimates of groundwater age close to the outlet boundary particularly at low peclet numbers from the set of equations presented in the previous section it is evident that the transport in the fracture can be decoupled from the matrix at steady state by including eq 6e into eq 3 the related differential equation can then be written as follows 18 v dc f dx d l d 2 c f dx 2 γ 0 x l where γ g δ m δ f g ω f mol m3 y is the scaled 4 he production rate the validation of the analytical solution has here been repeated only for the case of pe 2 5 using this formulation i e transport has been solved using a pflotran 1d calculation the results of this validation are shown in fig 3 4 continuum based formulation continuum models based on equivalent continuous porous media ecpm conceptualisations of the fractured systems have been long identified as appealing and numerically efficient tools to investigate groundwater flow and transport in fractured media neuman 1988 selroos et al 2002 trinchero et al 2017 iraola et al 2019 in these types of models an underlying discrete fracture network dfn is used to derive equivalent parameters for the equivalent continuous porous ecp medium among the different available upscaling methodologies e g skb 2011 and references therein the geometrical approach in which intersecting volumes between fractures and grid cell control volumes are computed and contributions from all intersecting fractures are added to the related parameters svensson 2001 svensson 2001 hadgu et al 2017 is probably the most commonly used more specifically in this approach the contribution of each fracture to the permeability tensor is computed using some empirical relationship typically the cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 while kinematic porosity φ is equivalent to the fracture volume fraction ω f using this approach the steady state distribution of 4 he concentration can be simulated using the following formulation 19 q c d c g where q m y is the darcy flux vector d α q m2 y is the dispersion tensor and α m is the isotropic dispersivity value it is interesting to note that g in eq 19 is the bulk 4 he production rate in the rock matrix which is no longer scaled by the fracture volume fraction as opposed to eq 18 in fact eq 18 is valid for a single fracture whereas eq 19 is valid for a generic three dimensional dfn derived ecpm model 4 1 test case 1 tc1 an illustrative example is here used as a demonstrative problem for the proposed continuum based formulation the problem considers a 2d vertical cross section of a sparsely fractured bedrock sfb with a size of 964 m 128 m flow and transport are mostly channeled along two highly transmissive deformation zones dz s see fig 4 the sfb is assumed to have a permeability k sfb 1 10 18 m2 and a fracture volume fraction ω f sfb 1 10 4 whereas the dz s have higher permeability and fracture volume fraction due to the higher fracture intensity k dz 1 10 14 m2 and ω f dz 1 10 2 inlet and outlet boundaries are located at coordinates 0 10 128 and 954 964 128 respectively and the domain was discretised using 241 64 15 424 regular grid cells 4 m 2 m a pressure difference p in p out 10 000 pa is applied between the inlet and the outlet the transport model includes three solutes 4 he a conservative tracer and groundwater age zero 4 he concentration and unitary concentration of the conservative tracer are prescribed at the inlet boundary consistently with the framework of goode 1996 groundwater age is subject to the same transport equation and related processes used to simulate the transport of the conservative tracer with the only difference that a zero order source term accounts for aging groundwater age and therefore also the age mass flux is set to zero at the inlet boundary the initial concentration is set to zero for the three species and a boundary condition of no dispersion across the outlet is prescribed the calculations were carried out using pflotran with dispersivity being set to 1 m the simulation time frame is long enough so that 4 he and mean groundwater age have attained steady state it is worthwhile noting that no matrix diffusion is included in the calculation this implies that the transient analysis of the transport of the conservative solute that is presented hereafter is only intended to provide a description of groundwater flow patterns both mean groundwater age i e goode s equation and 4 he are instead analysed at steady state as shown by varni and carrera 1998 mean groundwater age is not affected by matrix diffusion so it is consistent to compare estimates of mean groundwater age with corresponding estimates obtained using 4 he concentration and eq 17 note also that at steady state the influence of matrix exchange processes on 4 he levels is accounted for by means of the production term as discussed in section 4 above three different time snapshots of tracer concentration are shown in fig 5 as expected relatively quick tracer penetration is observed along the dz s whereas advection through the sfb is much slower 4 he concentrations are analysed at 100 000 y at this time 4 he levels are already at steady state 4 he levels follow similar but inverted patterns as the tracer fig 6 with lower concentration values observed along the two deformation zones due to the effect of infiltrating water and higher concentration values observed in the sfb where the effect of in situ production of 4 he in the matrix is significantly stronger than the effect of infiltration of helium free water the 4 he concentration values can be used to date groundwater age using eq 17 it is worthwhile noting that when applied to a continuum model the proposed mathematical expression depends on the spatial distribution of fracture volume fraction thus similarly to what already observed by varni and carrera 1998 for kinematic age estimates in heterogeneous media the solution does not provide a continuous distribution of groundwater age to qualitatively validate the proposed framework the results of groundwater age computed using 4 he data are compared with estimates of mean groundwater age goode 1996 which instead provide a continuous distribution the comparison between the two sets of results is shown in fig 7 due to the linear relationship between 4 he derived groundwater age and fracture volume fraction estimates along the deformation zones tend to be higher than corresponding estimates from groundwater age mass whereas significantly lower values are observed in cells located outside but nearby the deformation zone these cells are characterised by lower fracture volume fraction and relatively low 4 he content this effect is further amplified when dispersive fluxes are increased by e g using higher dispersivity values results are not shown here despite these differences the generally good agreement between the two set of results points out that the proposed analytical solution eq 17 can be used to obtain approximated values of groundwater age in fractured media 4 2 test case 2 tc2 a second more realistic test case is presented here tc2 is loosely based on a groundwater flow model for laxemar sweden vidstrand et al 2010 laxemar was one of the two sites that were thoroughly characterised during the siting process for a spent nuclear fuel repository in sweden the second site forsmark was finally selected as the candidate site for the proposed repository the sparsely fractured rock was simulated using a discrete fracture network that was generated using darcytools svensson and follin 2010 svensson and ferry 2014 in darcytools the generation of stochastic fractures is governed by the following equation 20 n i a l dl l ref a l l ref a where n is the number of fractures per unit volume i m 3 is the intensity a is the power law exponent and l ref m is the reference length which was set to 1 m here fracture orientation follows a fisher distribution characterised by the following parameters 21a λ 1 cos 90 tr cos pl κ 21b λ 2 sin 90 tr cos pl κ 21c λ 3 sin pl κ where tr and pl are the mean trend and mean plunge respectively and κ is the fisher concentration the following power law relationship between fracture transmissivity t f m2 s and fracture size l m is considered 22 log t f log a t l 100 b t d t u 0 5 0 5 where a t m2 s is the transmissivity of a fracture of size l 100 m and b t is the power law exponent u is the uniform distribution and d t is a scaling factor the parameters of the model were taken from the shallow part of the hydraulic rock domain hrd at laxemar vidstrand et al 2010 and are summarised in tables 2 and 3 the domain is a rectangular parallelepiped with the opposite vertices located at 0 0 0 0 128 0 and 1024 0 1024 0 0 0 which is discretised with regular grid cells of size δ x δ y 4 m and δ z 2 m i e 4 194 304 grid cells continuum dfn derived parameters fracture volume fraction and permeability were calculated using the approach described by svensson 2001 the resulting distributions of permeability and fracture volume fraction are shown in fig 8 cells not intersected by any fracture were deactivated during the flow and transport calculation the total number of active cells is 1 780 414 constant hydraulic pressure was applied to two narrow regions of width 10 m in the x direction and length 1 024 m in the y direction both regions are located at the top face at x 0 m p in and x 1 014 m p out respectively and a pressure difference p in p out 1000 pa was prescribed the rest of the boundaries were considered as no flow boundaries 4he free water was assumed to infiltrate through the inlet boundary 4he production in the rock matrix is the same as used in tc1 i e g 1 2 10 10 mol m3 y to keep track of conservative transport patterns a conservative tracer was also added to the infiltrating boundary water snapshots of the inert tracer concentration taken at simulation time 5 35 and 100 y are shown in fig 9 as already discussed in the previous test case the analysis of the transient evolution of the conservative tracer is only used for a visual evaluation of groundwater flow patterns as matrix diffusion processes are not included at early times the tracer infiltrates through the most conductive fractures and after 100 y has already reached the discharge area although less connected regions are still characterised by moderate to low concentrations the calculation was run in the jureca booster module using 680 cores 5200 transport degrees of freedom per process as groundwater age is also included as primary species the total number of transport degrees of freedom is given by the number of primary species multiplied by the number of active grid cells and around 16 000 h of supercomputing time i e 24 h of wall clock time the simulation was run out to 10 000 y in time to obtain steady state concentration distributions of 4he fig 10 a few grid cells 51 811 cells i e 2 9 of the total active cells are poorly connected or even completely unconnected from the rest of the active cells these cells which have a very low fracture volume fraction and thus are expected to have minor impact on helium levels in the transmissive fractures are not considered in the analysis discussed hereafter 4he levels show a qualitatively similar but inverse pattern as the conservative tracer highly transmissive and connected fractures are clearly delineated by low 4he concentration values even far from the inlet boundary indicating fast infiltration processes whereas less connected regions are characterised by high 4he concentration values 4 he 1 mol m w 3 for the sake of simplicity 4he concentration levels are further analysed in a single vertical cross section taken at x 512 m and with normal vector parallel to the y direction groundwater age was computed in this cross section using 4he concentration values along with eq 17 fig 11 top groundwater age was also computed using the concept of groundwater age mass goode 1996 and the results are shown in fig 11 bottom it is worthwhile noting that the assumptions used to derive eq 17 e g closed piston like system with constant source of helium per unit of water in the flowing fractures are clearly not fulfilled in this more realistic test case thus comparing results obtained with eq 17 with results obtained with a less restrictive dating technique goode 1996 should be seen as an assessment of the performance of the proposed methodology when applied to date groundwater in realistic complex environments the visual comparison between the two figures shows that the two methods provide qualitatively consistent estimates of groundwater age with relatively young ages 50 y observed in the most conductive and connected fractures and with old ages observed in the less connected and mostly stagnant regions a scatter plot showing groundwater age computed along the selected vertical cross section using 4he data vs groundwater age mass concept is also shown in fig 12 as already discussed in tc1 there are differences between the two estimates estimates obtained with eq 17 are not continuous and in a number of points significantly lower values of groundwater age are obtained this difference is attributable to the strong contrasts in porosity of this model in fact these points are all located in the fringe of flowing fractures and have a significantly lower porosity on the contrary in the core of fractured zones estimates obtained with the concept of groundwater age mass are generally lower due to the already discussed effect of dispersive fluxes of groundwater age which tend to limit the maximum ages goode 1996 5 discussion the paper s main contribution is to present an analytical solution that combined with available measurements of 4 he concentration can provide first order estimations of groundwater age in fractured aquifers the method decouples the influence of matrix diffusion processes from the transport equation in the fracture under the assumption of steady state conditions and thus gives estimates of groundwater age that are related to the groundwater velocity in the flowing fractures the main underlying assumption is that the medium behaves as a closed system meaning that mixing at fracture intersections is neglected despite their high complexity and heterogeneity evidence of flow being channelised along sparse channel networks have been observed in several laboratory and field experiments carried out in fractured media e g tsang and neretnieks 1998 another important assumption of eq 17 is that helium sources in the fracture due to back diffusion from the matrix are constant along the considered pathways this implies that helium production rate in the rock matrix f matrix porosity ϕ and fracture volume fraction ω f are also constant if we take the forsmark site as an example it has been shown that the first and second terms are relatively constant in the whole investigated domain drake et al 2006 trinchero et al 2014 however at the forsmark site fracture intensity which is related to the value of ω f decreases with depth thus depending on the depth of the investigated domain biases in the results could be introduced by the assumption of homogeneous production both the analytical solution eq 17 and the ecpm formulation section 4 are based on the assumption that the extent of the rock matrix δ m is limited note however that in eq 17 δ m is constant along the entire flowpath whereas in the ecpm formulation δ m implicitly changes according to the spatial distribution of fracture volume fraction this hypothesis implies that a no flux boundary is placed at z δ m see eq 6c which implicitly means that the medium is conceptualised as a symmetric system of parallel fractures this gross simplification of the fractured medium is commonly employed in contaminant transport simulations see e g sudicky and frind 1982 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 cvetkovic 2017 advection is assumed to be the main transport mechanism in the flowing fractures therefore the proposed method is suited to date groundwater age in relatively shallow and hydraulically active systems for instance trinchero et al 2014 assessed helium levels at forsmark laxemar and olkiluoto the focus of that work was to understand helium transport patters at greater depth from 200 to 1 000 meters below sea level in those conditions where diffusion becomes the main transport mechanism the analytical solution eq 17 is clearly not applicable finally as already discussed above the method presumes that steady state conditions are attained this is an import limitation in sites that have experienced strong changes in the hydrogeological regime over the past thousands of years due to e g landscape evolution or glaciation de glaciation events considering as starting point a hypothetical flushing event interfacial 4 he fluxes will start increasing until reaching the steady state level of eq 6e the time until steady state 4 he fluxes are attained depends on the hydrodynamic conditions i e groundwater velocity and the distance from the recharge boundary moreover increasing production rate increasing porosity or decreasing fracture volume fraction would lead to an extended transient time frame in the second part of the paper we have presented a continuum based formulation for the assessment of helium levels the objective of the formulation is twofold i to further validate the proposed analytical solution and ii to offer a computationally appealing approach for the investigation of steady state helium levels using a stochastic continuum model iraola et al 2019 in the formulation it is implicitly assumed that all the produced radiogenic helium is dissolved in the groundwater and this could lead to helium concentrations exceeding the solubility limit particularly in poorly connected regions thus the possibility of generation of gas bubbles should be considered particularly at shallow depths where water pressure is relatively low 6 summary and conclusion in porous aquifers 4he which is produced by the alpha decay of natural uranium and thorium within the aquifer solids has long been used to date groundwater age the so called linear accumulation method establishes a linear relationship between groundwater age and 4he concentration being the ratio between aquifer porosity and 4he production rate the proportionality constant in fractured granitic rock 4he production takes place in the rock matrix and this leads to back diffusion of 4he from the matrix to the flowing fractures we have analysed here the differential equations that govern 4he production diffusion and migration in a dual porosity system at steady state 4he fracture matrix interfacial surface flux is constant and equal to the bulk production rate scaled by the available size of the matrix it turns out that a similar linear relationship between groundwater age and 4he concentration can be established being in this case the inverse of the bulk production rate scaled by the fracture volume fraction as the proportionality constant this scaling factor provides a direct link with the underlying mass exchange processes the proposed solution which has been validated using a single fracture matrix verification test can be readily applied to date groundwater age in shallow fractured systems where advection along flowing fractures is an important transport mechanism besides 4he data the method requires the knowledge of measurable characteristics of the fractured rock system namely the average fracture aperture and matrix size moreover uranium and thorium content along with matrix porosity are needed to infer the bulk 4he production rate whereas the steady state solution does not depend on matrix diffusivity a continuum based formulation based on an equivalent continuous porous ecpm medium derived from an underlying discrete fracture network dfn has also been presented and used to further analyse the applicability of the proposed dating framework a simple and a more complex and realistic test case have been used to simulate steady state 4he levels and to derive related groundwater ages estimates of groundwater age based on the concept of groundwater age mass have also bee computed the results obtained with the two different methodologies were in qualitatively good agreement discrepancies and in particular generally higher groundwater estimates obtained from 4he data are due to the different underlying assumptions the general conclusion of the verification tests in particular tc2 is that the proposed dating methodology can provide reasonable estimates of groundwater age even in realistic fractured systems as long as flow is characterised by channelised
