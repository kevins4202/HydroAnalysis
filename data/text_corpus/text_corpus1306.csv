6530,rainfall runoff processes in the karst dominated regions are of great importance however not all areas in a karst dominated river basin are covered by typical limestone and both limestone and soil cover may exist this study proposes a coupled conceptual hydrological model for simulating the rainfall runoff processes in karst dominated areas the model named as k xaj couples the traditional xinanjiang xaj model and a two reservoir based karst model for simulating runoff in both the karst area and the non karst area in the lijiang river basin simulated results demonstrated that the proposed k xaj model satisfactorily simulated the rainfall runoff processes compared with the traditional xaj model the k xaj model produced better forecasts the peak flow predicted by the k xaj model was larger than that by the xaj model but the interflow routed by the k xaj model was significantly smaller than that by the xaj model the magnitude of groundwater predicted by the k xaj model was greater this study thus provides a new way to simulate rainfall runoff processes in karst areas keywords rainfall runoff simulation karst areas xinanjiang model karst reservoirs lijiang river basin 1 introduction karst is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone dolomite and gypsum and is also characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves karst areas cover about 15 of the world s land area or about 2 2 million km2 and are home for around 1 billion people 17 of the world s population yuan and chai 1988 about 25 of the world s population received its water supply largely or entirely from karst waters including deep carbonate aquifers ford and williams 2007 these areas are located in africa asia europe south and north america and oceania the karst terrain covers nearly 35 of the whole of europe so the karst processes are significant components of the physical geography of mediterranean basins daly et al 2002 one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world is located in yunnan guizhou plateau of southwest china it covers about 540 000 km2 and has a population of nearly 100 million people zhang et al 2010 since the karst areas are so large it is of great importance to study their rainfall runoff processes because of the characteristics of soil rocks and so on the rainfall runoff process in karst areas is very different from that in non karst areas the complex geometry of the network of conduits is sometimes the cause of surface and groundwater flow generating temporal variability of recharge and hydraulic connectivity bonacci 2001 bailly comte et al 2009 generally a karst aquifer is composed of three interacting systems the uppermost layer of the carbonate rock is referred to as the epikarst where fractures develop followed by an infiltration zone to a few meters below the ground surface where both unsaturated and saturated flow may occur and finally the low permanently saturated karst zone composed of a highly organized and hierarchized drainage conduit system in connection with a network of secondary drains labat et al 1999 to simulate the discharge from a karst area a variety of karst models have been developed and applied around the world which can be classified into three kinds 1 empirical 2 distributed and 3 conceptual empirical black box models regard the whole karst system as a black box without considering the structure and characteristics of the karst aquifer and develop a relationship between rainfall and runoff linear as well as non linear functions have been used to establish the relationship between rainfall and runoff dreiss 1989a b labat et al 1999 lambrakis et al 2000 neural networks have also been used to simulate flow dynamics in karst areas paleologos et al 2013 chen et al 2014a b the advantages of empirical models are their ease to implement with fewer parameters and applicability to areas where information is lacking the drawbacks are that the models have no physical meaning and the parameters in the function also can also vary and may themselves be functions of characteristics of the aquifer due to the lack of process representation black box models cannot be used to evaluate and manage the impact of human activities on spring flows the second type is the distributed models which consider temporal and spatial variability wang and brubaker 2014 proposed a non linear modification of groundwater algorithm in swat iswat model that improved recession and low flow simulation nikolaidis et al 2013 developed a reservoir model and linked it with swat to simulate karst behavior and recharge of springs of koiliaris basin in crete recently malago et al 2016 used the kswat model swat model and karst flow model for the quantification of a spatially and temporally explicit hydrologic water balance of karst dominated geomorphology in crete island however this model needs more data sets and contains more parameters that need to be calibrated it is often difficult to obtain enough meteorological data in karst areas which restrict its application in practice the third type is the conceptual models which conceptualizes a karst aquifer as a configuration of internal storages and pathways while physical relationships are not considered explicitly but are represented in general terms through conceptualization of the aquifer shi et al 2013 fleury et al 2007 used a three reservoir model to simulate soil slow discharge and rapid discharge of a karstic aquifer in southern france tritz et al 2011 proposed a two reservoir conceptual model with a hysteretic non linear transfer function to model the behavior of a karst catchment charlier et al 2012 proposed a numerical karst model to simulate discharge as well as concentration of non conservative tracers during flood events in french jura using a conceptual rainfall runoff model jukic et al 2009 simulated groundwater flow in the jadro spring catchment a conceptual model appears to be a good compromise between an empirical model and a distributed model which has relatively fewer parameters than the distributed model and can generally reflect physical relationships of the karst aquifer not all karst areas are covered by typical limestone for example the island of crete in greece has an area of 8336 km2 of which about 2730 km2 representing 30 of the total area is carbonate rocks chartzoulakis et al 2001 koiliaris river watershed with the area of 132 km2 is located in the northwestern part of crete of which the karst area is at least 50 km2 moraetis et al 2010 guizhou province in southwest china has one of the largest and continuous karst areas in the world of which 73 areas are covered by limestone li et al 2003 and li et al 2006 generally both limestone and soil cover exist in the same river basin where runoff generation mechanisms in limestone and soil cover areas are entirely different therefore the runoff generation process in these kinds of areas should be considered separately this paper aims at developing a conceptual hydrological model named karst xinanjiang k xaj model which is suitable for karst areas and reflects the physical characteristics of the karst aquifer for runoff simulation this hydrological model coupled the traditional xinanjiang xaj model and a two reservoir karst model which can simulate runoff in both karst area and non karst areas the parameters of the proposed model were calibrated using a multi objective optimization algorithm the lijiang river basin in southwestern china was selected as a case study and the proposed k xaj model and the traditional xaj model were used to simulate rainfall runoff in karst dominated areas simulated results were compared with observed values 2 review of xaj model the xinanjiang xaj model is a conceptual hydrologic model developed by zhao et al 1980 for flood simulation in the xinan river basin china and has since been widely used in china for flood simulation in humid and semi humid regions zhao 1992 this model has also been used for almost all large river basins in china including the yellow river yangtze river huaihe river and so on usually a large watershed is divided into a set of sub basins to capture the spatial variability of precipitation evaporation and the underlying surface the inputs of the xaj model are the average areal rainfall and evaporation in each sub basin the output of the model is streamflow at the watershed outlet for each sub basin the xaj model is composed of four main modules namely evaporation module runoff generation module runoff partition module and runoff routing module the structure of the xaj model is given in fig 1 the physical meanings of the model parameters are given in table 1 1 evaporation module in this model a three layer evapotranspiration scheme is used the soil is divided into three layers namely upper layer lower layer and deep layer of which actual storage are wu wl wd respectively and the storage capacity of the three layer soil are um lm and dm the actual evapotranspiration e is the sum of evapotranspiration in the upper layer eu evapotranspiration in the lower layer el and evapotrans piration in the deep layer ed eu occurs at the potential rate el occurs at the modified rate which is calculated by multiplying the potential rate and the ratio of wl to lm ed occurs at the modified rate which is computed by multiplying the potential rate and the coefficient of the deep layer c 2 runoff generation module the xaj model divides the basin into permeable and impervious areas by im which is the percentage of impervious and saturated areas in the catchment in the impervious areas runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss in the permeable areas the main feature of the xaj model is the concept of runoff formation on the depletion of storage which means that runoff is not produced until the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches the field capacity and thereafter runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss the runoff producing area is critical for calculating runoff runoff distribution is usually nonuniform across a region because the soil moisture deficit is heterogeneous in order to accommodate the nonuniformity of the soil moisture deficit or the tension water capacity distribution the xaj model adopted the storage capacity curve zhao et al 1980 to calculate the total runoff while the b represents the exponential of the distribution to tension water capacity 3 runoff partition module in the xaj model the total runoff is subdivided into three components by a free reservoir including surface runoff rs interflow ri and groundwater runoff rg sm represents the real mean free water capacity of the surface soil layer and ki kg are outflow coefficients of the free water storage to interflow relationships and groundwater relationships respectively fresh water capacity is usually nonuniform across a region because the runoff producing area of saturated slope flow is constantly changing and the xaj model adopted the free water capacity distribution curve to accommodate the nonuniformity of the fresh water capacity while ex represents the exponent of the free water capacity curve influencing the development of the saturated area 4 runoff routing module the surface runoff is routed directly to the watershed outlet of each sub basin in a source to sink form moore et al 2006 by means of the lag and route method while the interflow and groundwater runoff are routed through linear reservoirs lu et al 2014 in the module ci cg are the recession constants of the lower interflow storage and groundwater storage respectively and cs represents recession constant in the lag and route method for routing through the channel system within each sub basin the outflow from each sub basin is finally routed by the muskingum successive reaches model to produce the flow at the outlet of the entire catchment the river reach is normally subdivided into sub reaches in this successive routing scheme there are two parameters to be determined for each sub reach including the muskingum time constant k e and weighting factor x e 3 k xaj model in the following two different methods were used to simulate runoff generation in karst areas and non karst areas in a karst dominated river basin 3 1 runoff generation in karst area in order to simulate discharge of river basins which show significant karst characteristics a karst reservoir v 1 and a karst regulating reservoir v 2 were proposed by cheng et al 1991 to simulate runoff generation in karst areas the structure and parameters of the reservoirs are shown in fig 2 and table 1 each reservoir represents physical storage over the catchment reservoir v 1 represents the karst system aiming at dividing the runoff into three kinds namely rapid karst runoff rks direct karst runoff rkb and karst groundwater runoff rkg fig 3 shows the physical process of each runoff component where rks represents the surface runoff of carbonate rock rkb represents the transverse runoff formed in the fissures and fractures of epikarst the uppermost layer of the carbonate rock and rkg refers to runoff in a karst underground river or conduit reservoir v 2 represents epikarst which is used to regulate the direct karst flow reservoir v 1 has a balance equation 1 s k p e s k 0 r ks r kb r kg where sk0 is the initial water storage of v 1 and sk is the water storage in reservoir 1 the difference between rainfall p and evaporation e was used as the input of reservoir v 1 if the current water storage of reservoir v 1 was greater than the water storage capacity of reservoir v 1 the excess parts would generate rapid runoff rks and the remaining part would generate rkb and rkg according to the linear outflow coefficients kkb and kkg respectively however due to the development of larger fractures and swallowing holes on the surface and in the epikarst larger scale karst systems usually have high infiltration capacities which make the flow in reservoir 1 very small and more water occurs in the form of groundwater thus in order to simulate the feature of karst area a threshold value hk is considered which reflects the development of vertical fractures in the shallow aquifer while sk is greater than hk the direct karst runoff rkb is generated the equations for calculating rks rkb and rkg are given as follows 2 r ks s k k m if s k k m 0 if s k k m 3 r kb k kb k m if s k k m k kb s k h k if h k k m s k 0 if s k h k 4 r kg k kg s k if s k 0 where kkm is the coefficient of the karst reservoir outflow to direct flow and kkg is coefficient of the karst reservoir outflow to groundwater 3 2 runoff generation in non karst area runoff generation was calculated using the traditional xaj model in non karst areas in the impermeable area the precipitation minus evaporation formed the surface runoff rb in the permeable area the generation of surface runoff rs interflow ri and groundwater runoff rg was simulated separately according to the procedures given in the evapotranspiration module the runoff generation module and runoff partition module of the traditional xaj model 3 3 runoff concentration in karst area a combination model namely karst xinanjiang k xaj model as shown in fig 1 was proposed in this study in order to consider runoff generation in both karst area and non karst area in a karst dominated basin the k xaj model was developed where parameter ik was used to denote the weight of the karst area in the whole basin based on the areal weight ik the k xaj model can capture the runoff generation characteristics of both karst and non karst areas in the k xaj model rs calculated by the xaj model was combined with rks calculated by the karst reservoir and rb in the impermeable area to form the total surface runoff qs rg calculated by the xaj model and rkg calculated by the karst reservoir model formed the total groundwater qg since the physical processes are very different for generating ri and rkb in karst and non karst areas ri and rkb were regulated by the linear reservoir in the xaj model and karst reservoir v 2 respectively ri and rkb formed interflow qi and direct karst flow qk respectively the equations for calculating the surface flow qs interflow qi direct karst flow qk and groundwater qg were defined as 5 q s r s r b r ks u 6 q i q i 0 c i r g 1 c i u 7 q k q k 0 c k r kb 1 c k u 8 q g q g 0 c g r g r kg 1 c g u where qi0 qk0 and qg0 are the flow qi qk and qg in the previous period ci ck and cg are the recession constants of interflow direct flow and groundwater respectively and u is the unit conversion coefficient 4 parameter calibration 4 1 model calibration the parameter calibration of hydrological models is normally done considering only a single objective function such as in genetic algorithm ga holland et al 1975 particle swarm optimization algorithm pso kennedy 2010 shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua duan et al 1992 and so on however practical applications indicate that a single objective calibration method is often subjective and inadequate to properly account for all the characteristics of the hydrological system the flood peak volume and hydrograph shape are three basic elements for describing a flood event zhang et al 2018 these elements are an important criterion for calibrating model parameters chen et al 2015 2016 huang et al 2018a b in this study the flood volume error nash sutcliffe efficiency and relative flood peak error were selected as objective functions which are given as follows the objective functions eqs 9 and 10 were evaluated at a daily time step while eq 11 was evaluated for a number of discrete flood events 1 objective function in terms of the flood volume 9 ob j 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i i 1 n q obs i 2 objective function in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency 10a nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 10b ob j 2 1 n s e 3 objective function in terms of flood peak 11 ob j 3 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim i q obs i where q obs i is the observed flow at time i q sim i is the simulated flow at time i n is the length of sequence data q obs is the average value of observed data q obs i is the observed data of flood peak at time i q sim i is the simulated value of flood peak at time i n is the length of the data set and n is the number of flood events guo et al 2013 proposed a multi objective shuffled complex differential evolution moscde for parameter calibration considering multi objectives in which moscde replaced the simplex search used in sce ua with the differential evolution de algorithm the moscde was used to calibrate the parameter of the hydrological models including tank and hymod models by ye et al 2014 and lu et al 2016 and the results proved that the multi objective method can be used for parameter estimation the multi objective function was defined as 12 m i n ob j i θ o b j 2 θ o b j m θ where m is the number of objective functions ob j i θ is the value of objective function for event i and θ is the model parameter the moscde method was used in this study for parameter calibration it is well known that the difficult problem of multi objective calibration is how to get optimal parameters in a series of non inferior optimization solutions generally a weighted sum approach is used to solve this problem where different objective functions are assigned different weights to convert a multi objective problem to single objective problem schoups et al 2005 however the subjective prior selection of weights typically affects the calibrated parameter values thus in this paper the pareto optimization algorithm was adopted for the hydrological model parameter optimization detailed information of the pareto optimization algorithm has been given by khu and madsen 2005 4 2 performance index in order to evaluate the performance of the hydrological model three performance indices including nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse as shown in eqs 10 relative flood peak error rpe as shown in eq 11 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the k xaj model the root mean square error was defined as 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q sim i q obs 2 in addition the chinese flood simulation standard recommends the use of the qualified rate qr to evaluate the flood simulation performance a predicted peak value is regarded as qualified when the relative absolute error rae between the predicted and the observed streamflow values is within a given threshold value ε chen et al 2013 2018c qr can be calculated by 14a qr i 1 n nu m i n 100 where 14b nu m i 1 if r a e i ε 0 otherwise r a e i q obs i q sim i q obs i where raei is the relative absolute error rae of the ith datum numi is set to 1 when rae is less than or equal to the predefined threshold value ε which is regarded as qualified simulation ε was set as 20 in accordance with the accuracy standard established by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2008 5 case study the lijiang river basin as shown in fig 4 located in the southwestern part of china was selected as a case study the lijiang river belongs to the pearl river basin and is a tributary of the xijiang river the basin is in a subtropical monsoon region with distinct seasons humid climate sufficient sunshine and abundant rain the average annual precipitation is about 1700 mm however the annual distribution of rainfall is uneven and the rainy season is from april to september which accounts for more than 70 of the yearly precipitation in the lijiang river basin the exposed rock formations on the surface of the area are mainly carbonate rocks and the climate of the basin is humid and hot climate this basin has a large area of carbonate based tropical karst landforms pingle gauging station is the control station of the lijiang river basin and the catchment area is 12 617 km2 the mainstream of the lijiang river is the darong river and there are four gauging stations along the river namely darong guilin yangshuo and pingle the main tributaries are the gongcheng river and the lipu river and there are two gauging stations along the two tributaries namely gongcheng and lipu gauging stations respectively the precipitation and evaporation data from the guilin yangshuo gongcheng and pingle stations were used as input of the model and the data from the pingle gauging station was used as the output of the hydrological model the data length was from 2001 to 2007 which was divided into two parts the data from the year 2001 to 2005 was used for model calibration and the data from the year 2006 and 2007 was used for model validation 6 results and discussion 6 1 flood simulation results of the k xaj model the proposed xaj model was used for flood simulation in lijiang river basin the moscde algorithm was adopted to calibrate the parameters of the proposed k xaj model and the calibrated parameters are given in table 1 the observed and runoff simulated by k xaj model are shown in fig 5 first the model performance was evaluated at a daily time step the performance indices including nse rmse qr and rpe according to eqs 10 11 13 14 were applied to evaluate the simulation results the performance indices were calculated as shown in table 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse qualified rate of the flood volume qr and relative flood peak error rpe of k xaj model for the validation period were calculated based on the predicted and observed continuous daily streamflow series the results were 90 4 nse 298 rmse 98 5 qr and 18 3 rpe respectively second the model performance was evaluated in terms of a number of discrete flood events the flood events were selected on the basis of the threshold flow which is set to 3000 m3 s when the peak flow is above this threshold value this flood event was selected 13 flood events were chosen in seven years in which 8 events are in calibration period and 5 in validation period we calculated the performance indices of each flood event in terms of the flood peak and volumes and then computed the average value of each performance index in the calibration and validation period respectively the performance results corresponding to the flood events are shown in table 2 as well in which the nse qr rpe of k xaj model for the flood events in the validation period are 89 4 100 and 19 respectively these results demonstrate that the k xaj model simulated runoff well and the model thus reflected the features of the karst area 6 2 comparisons of the k xaj model with the traditional xaj model 6 2 1 comparisons of the performances of the k xaj and xaj models both the xaj and k xaj models were used to simulate rainfall runoff in the lijiang river basin the performance indices were calculated as shown in table 2 it can be seen that the proposed k xaj model was better than the traditional xaj model for both calibration and validation periods the predicted results of the k xaj and xaj models are shown in fig 6 which demonstrates that the flood peak predicted by the xaj model is larger than the observed one compared with the traditional xaj model the proposed k xaj model gave better simulation results 6 2 2 comparisons of parameters of the k xaj and xaj models the traditional xaj model was used for flood simulation in the lijiang river basin the moscde algorithm was adopted to calibrate the parameters of the proposed k xaj model in the xaj model there are sixteen parameters which are divided into sensitive and insensitive parameters the sensitive parameters were k sm kg ki cg ci and cs and the insensitive parameters were um lm dm b im c ex ke and xe in the k xaj model there are six more parameters of which ik kkg kkb and ck are sensitive parameters and hk and km are less sensitive parameters sensitive parameters have a significant influence on the simulation results table 1 presents the calibrated parameter values of the k xaj and xaj models respectively the sensitive parameters ci and cg showed obvious fluctuations compared with the traditional xaj model ci increased and cg decreased which demonstrated that the karst dominated area produced less interflow and much more groundwater runoff these results are consistent with the features of convergence in the karst region 6 2 3 comparisons of performances and parameter of the k xaj and xaj models due to different proportion of karst areas the data from guilin and gongcheng gauging stations which is also the control stations for two sub basins were used as case studies the proportions of the karst area in these two sub catchments are about 10 and 35 respectively the daily streamflow data from the year 2001 to 2007 was used for model calibration and validation the performance indices for k xaj and traditional xaj models were calculated and given in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that for the sub basin controlled by gongcheng gauging station the performance of the proposed k xaj model is better than that of the traditional xaj model for both the calibration and validation periods in the other sub basin controlled by guilin gauging station the karst area accounts only approximately 10 of the total areas compared with the traditional xaj model the performance measured by nse indicates that the k xaj model is slightly better than the traditional xaj model generally with the higher proportion of karst area the k xaj model shows a better simulation efficacy to the contrary corresponding to the lower proportion of the karst area the performance of the two models do not show significant difference table 4 presents the sensitive parameters of the k xaj and xaj models in the three basins the proportions of karst area corresponding to the three basins are approximately 10 35 and 40 respectively based on the observed geographical data k is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to pan evaporation which is related to the air temperature and observed evaporation data so there is no obvious difference ik reflects the ratio of the karst area which is equal to 7 37 and 41 in the k xaj model for the three basins respectively the estimated ik 7 37 and 41 is more or less the same with the observed data 10 35 and 40 which proves the rationality of the proposed method ki and kkb are outflow coefficients of the free water storage to interflow and the karst water storage to direct flow with the increase of the karst areas the interflow and direct karst runoff should decrease according to the results present in table 4 ki and kkb decrease with the increase of the karst areas kg and kkg are outflow coefficients of the free water storage to groundwater with the increase of karst area the total underground runoff should increases according to the calculated results those two parameters also increase cg is the coefficient of groundwater regression the larger the karst area is the faster the groundwater regress and the smaller cg is ci and cs are the regression coefficient of interflow and surface runoff respectively when the karst area increases the interflow should decrease and the surface runoff should increase in the basin according to eqs 6 and 8 and results in table 4 ci increases and cs decreases considering the parameters evaluation in k xaj model due to the change of the proportion of the karst areas it is concluded that the proposed k xaj model can reflect the hydrological characteristics of the karst areas the parameter evolution characteristics of k xaj model are consistent with the features of runoff generation in the karst region 6 2 4 comparisons of simulated surface flow interflow and groundwater by the k xaj and xaj models several typical flood hydrographs for the year 2003 were selected and simulated by the proposed k xaj and xaj models surface runoff interflow and groundwater were calculated as shown in figs 7 9 respectively fig 7 shows that the surface flood peak calculated by the k xaj model was significantly higher than that by the xaj model this was due to the thin soil and little evaporation in the karst area when a heavy rainfall occurs the rainfall minus the evaporation directly flows into the karst reservoir if the current water storage s k of the karst reservoir 1 is greater than the karst storage capacity k m the excess water will generate the rapid karst flow which finally forms surface runoff and causes the flood peak to increase rapidly fig 8 shows that the interflow calculated by the k xaj model is significantly less than that by the xaj model in the karst area due to the exposure of multiple bedrocks and thin soil the water storage capacity of soil layer decreases and the ability of soil layer to redistribute rainfall is weak resulting in a significant decrease in interflow in fig 9 the magnitude of groundwater simulated by the k xaj model was greater than by the traditional xaj model the groundwater concentration speed was faster and the volume was larger in the initial period of rainfall and similarly in the later period the groundwater receded faster due to the development of vertical fractures and swallowing holes in the epikarst the surface flow was often connected to the underground thus precipitation at the beginning of rainfall can rapidly infiltrate into the underground and recharge groundwater since the developed underground multi channels and caves provided sufficient space for the storage of groundwater the development of underground rivers and conduits increased the speed of groundwater recession 6 2 5 comparison of flood recession period simulated by the k xaj and xaj models fig 10 shows the flood hydrograph predicted in 2003 as shown in the dash box of fig 10 the flood recession of the k xaj model was faster than that of the xaj model which was closer to the observed flood recession the reasons are given as follows first the increase in surface runoff and the decrease in the interflow in karst area reduced the time of flood recession second the development of underground rivers and conduits in karst area accelerated the velocity of flood recession 7 conclusion a conceptual coupled hydrological model namely k xaj model has been proposed for modelling rainfall runoff generation in the karstic catchments the conceptual model appears to be a good compromise between an empirical model and a distributed model which has relatively fewer parameters than the distributed model and can generally reflect physical relationships of the karst aquifer the lijiang river basin was selected as a case study both the proposed k xaj and traditional xaj models were used for flood simulation in this region and the simulated results were compared and analyzed the main conclusions are given as follows the main features of the proposed model are a the model is composed of the traditional xaj model and karst reservoirs to simulate rainfall runoff for a karst dominated area b the proposed model can simulate runoff of both the karst area and the non karst area in the karst dominated basin c the proposed karst reservoir can separate runoff into three components which match the physical process of runoff generation in karst areas and d the parameters in the k xaj model can reflect the characteristics of karst aquifers the performance indices and simulated flood hydrographs showed that the proposed k xaj model simulated the rainfall runoff processes well the estimated parameters have physical meaning compared with the traditional xaj model the proposed k xaj model better simulated runoff comparison of surface flow interflow and groundwater simulated by the proposed and traditional xaj models demonstrated that the peak surface flow predicted by the k xaj model was larger than that by the xaj model on the contrary the interflow routed by the k xaj model was significantly less than that by the xaj model the magnitude of groundwater predicted by the k xaj model was greater finally the simulated flood hydrograph in the flood recession period was analyzed results indicated that the flood recession of the k xaj model was faster than that of the xaj model which was closer to the observed flood recession declaration

6530,rainfall runoff processes in the karst dominated regions are of great importance however not all areas in a karst dominated river basin are covered by typical limestone and both limestone and soil cover may exist this study proposes a coupled conceptual hydrological model for simulating the rainfall runoff processes in karst dominated areas the model named as k xaj couples the traditional xinanjiang xaj model and a two reservoir based karst model for simulating runoff in both the karst area and the non karst area in the lijiang river basin simulated results demonstrated that the proposed k xaj model satisfactorily simulated the rainfall runoff processes compared with the traditional xaj model the k xaj model produced better forecasts the peak flow predicted by the k xaj model was larger than that by the xaj model but the interflow routed by the k xaj model was significantly smaller than that by the xaj model the magnitude of groundwater predicted by the k xaj model was greater this study thus provides a new way to simulate rainfall runoff processes in karst areas keywords rainfall runoff simulation karst areas xinanjiang model karst reservoirs lijiang river basin 1 introduction karst is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone dolomite and gypsum and is also characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves karst areas cover about 15 of the world s land area or about 2 2 million km2 and are home for around 1 billion people 17 of the world s population yuan and chai 1988 about 25 of the world s population received its water supply largely or entirely from karst waters including deep carbonate aquifers ford and williams 2007 these areas are located in africa asia europe south and north america and oceania the karst terrain covers nearly 35 of the whole of europe so the karst processes are significant components of the physical geography of mediterranean basins daly et al 2002 one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world is located in yunnan guizhou plateau of southwest china it covers about 540 000 km2 and has a population of nearly 100 million people zhang et al 2010 since the karst areas are so large it is of great importance to study their rainfall runoff processes because of the characteristics of soil rocks and so on the rainfall runoff process in karst areas is very different from that in non karst areas the complex geometry of the network of conduits is sometimes the cause of surface and groundwater flow generating temporal variability of recharge and hydraulic connectivity bonacci 2001 bailly comte et al 2009 generally a karst aquifer is composed of three interacting systems the uppermost layer of the carbonate rock is referred to as the epikarst where fractures develop followed by an infiltration zone to a few meters below the ground surface where both unsaturated and saturated flow may occur and finally the low permanently saturated karst zone composed of a highly organized and hierarchized drainage conduit system in connection with a network of secondary drains labat et al 1999 to simulate the discharge from a karst area a variety of karst models have been developed and applied around the world which can be classified into three kinds 1 empirical 2 distributed and 3 conceptual empirical black box models regard the whole karst system as a black box without considering the structure and characteristics of the karst aquifer and develop a relationship between rainfall and runoff linear as well as non linear functions have been used to establish the relationship between rainfall and runoff dreiss 1989a b labat et al 1999 lambrakis et al 2000 neural networks have also been used to simulate flow dynamics in karst areas paleologos et al 2013 chen et al 2014a b the advantages of empirical models are their ease to implement with fewer parameters and applicability to areas where information is lacking the drawbacks are that the models have no physical meaning and the parameters in the function also can also vary and may themselves be functions of characteristics of the aquifer due to the lack of process representation black box models cannot be used to evaluate and manage the impact of human activities on spring flows the second type is the distributed models which consider temporal and spatial variability wang and brubaker 2014 proposed a non linear modification of groundwater algorithm in swat iswat model that improved recession and low flow simulation nikolaidis et al 2013 developed a reservoir model and linked it with swat to simulate karst behavior and recharge of springs of koiliaris basin in crete recently malago et al 2016 used the kswat model swat model and karst flow model for the quantification of a spatially and temporally explicit hydrologic water balance of karst dominated geomorphology in crete island however this model needs more data sets and contains more parameters that need to be calibrated it is often difficult to obtain enough meteorological data in karst areas which restrict its application in practice the third type is the conceptual models which conceptualizes a karst aquifer as a configuration of internal storages and pathways while physical relationships are not considered explicitly but are represented in general terms through conceptualization of the aquifer shi et al 2013 fleury et al 2007 used a three reservoir model to simulate soil slow discharge and rapid discharge of a karstic aquifer in southern france tritz et al 2011 proposed a two reservoir conceptual model with a hysteretic non linear transfer function to model the behavior of a karst catchment charlier et al 2012 proposed a numerical karst model to simulate discharge as well as concentration of non conservative tracers during flood events in french jura using a conceptual rainfall runoff model jukic et al 2009 simulated groundwater flow in the jadro spring catchment a conceptual model appears to be a good compromise between an empirical model and a distributed model which has relatively fewer parameters than the distributed model and can generally reflect physical relationships of the karst aquifer not all karst areas are covered by typical limestone for example the island of crete in greece has an area of 8336 km2 of which about 2730 km2 representing 30 of the total area is carbonate rocks chartzoulakis et al 2001 koiliaris river watershed with the area of 132 km2 is located in the northwestern part of crete of which the karst area is at least 50 km2 moraetis et al 2010 guizhou province in southwest china has one of the largest and continuous karst areas in the world of which 73 areas are covered by limestone li et al 2003 and li et al 2006 generally both limestone and soil cover exist in the same river basin where runoff generation mechanisms in limestone and soil cover areas are entirely different therefore the runoff generation process in these kinds of areas should be considered separately this paper aims at developing a conceptual hydrological model named karst xinanjiang k xaj model which is suitable for karst areas and reflects the physical characteristics of the karst aquifer for runoff simulation this hydrological model coupled the traditional xinanjiang xaj model and a two reservoir karst model which can simulate runoff in both karst area and non karst areas the parameters of the proposed model were calibrated using a multi objective optimization algorithm the lijiang river basin in southwestern china was selected as a case study and the proposed k xaj model and the traditional xaj model were used to simulate rainfall runoff in karst dominated areas simulated results were compared with observed values 2 review of xaj model the xinanjiang xaj model is a conceptual hydrologic model developed by zhao et al 1980 for flood simulation in the xinan river basin china and has since been widely used in china for flood simulation in humid and semi humid regions zhao 1992 this model has also been used for almost all large river basins in china including the yellow river yangtze river huaihe river and so on usually a large watershed is divided into a set of sub basins to capture the spatial variability of precipitation evaporation and the underlying surface the inputs of the xaj model are the average areal rainfall and evaporation in each sub basin the output of the model is streamflow at the watershed outlet for each sub basin the xaj model is composed of four main modules namely evaporation module runoff generation module runoff partition module and runoff routing module the structure of the xaj model is given in fig 1 the physical meanings of the model parameters are given in table 1 1 evaporation module in this model a three layer evapotranspiration scheme is used the soil is divided into three layers namely upper layer lower layer and deep layer of which actual storage are wu wl wd respectively and the storage capacity of the three layer soil are um lm and dm the actual evapotranspiration e is the sum of evapotranspiration in the upper layer eu evapotranspiration in the lower layer el and evapotrans piration in the deep layer ed eu occurs at the potential rate el occurs at the modified rate which is calculated by multiplying the potential rate and the ratio of wl to lm ed occurs at the modified rate which is computed by multiplying the potential rate and the coefficient of the deep layer c 2 runoff generation module the xaj model divides the basin into permeable and impervious areas by im which is the percentage of impervious and saturated areas in the catchment in the impervious areas runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss in the permeable areas the main feature of the xaj model is the concept of runoff formation on the depletion of storage which means that runoff is not produced until the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches the field capacity and thereafter runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss the runoff producing area is critical for calculating runoff runoff distribution is usually nonuniform across a region because the soil moisture deficit is heterogeneous in order to accommodate the nonuniformity of the soil moisture deficit or the tension water capacity distribution the xaj model adopted the storage capacity curve zhao et al 1980 to calculate the total runoff while the b represents the exponential of the distribution to tension water capacity 3 runoff partition module in the xaj model the total runoff is subdivided into three components by a free reservoir including surface runoff rs interflow ri and groundwater runoff rg sm represents the real mean free water capacity of the surface soil layer and ki kg are outflow coefficients of the free water storage to interflow relationships and groundwater relationships respectively fresh water capacity is usually nonuniform across a region because the runoff producing area of saturated slope flow is constantly changing and the xaj model adopted the free water capacity distribution curve to accommodate the nonuniformity of the fresh water capacity while ex represents the exponent of the free water capacity curve influencing the development of the saturated area 4 runoff routing module the surface runoff is routed directly to the watershed outlet of each sub basin in a source to sink form moore et al 2006 by means of the lag and route method while the interflow and groundwater runoff are routed through linear reservoirs lu et al 2014 in the module ci cg are the recession constants of the lower interflow storage and groundwater storage respectively and cs represents recession constant in the lag and route method for routing through the channel system within each sub basin the outflow from each sub basin is finally routed by the muskingum successive reaches model to produce the flow at the outlet of the entire catchment the river reach is normally subdivided into sub reaches in this successive routing scheme there are two parameters to be determined for each sub reach including the muskingum time constant k e and weighting factor x e 3 k xaj model in the following two different methods were used to simulate runoff generation in karst areas and non karst areas in a karst dominated river basin 3 1 runoff generation in karst area in order to simulate discharge of river basins which show significant karst characteristics a karst reservoir v 1 and a karst regulating reservoir v 2 were proposed by cheng et al 1991 to simulate runoff generation in karst areas the structure and parameters of the reservoirs are shown in fig 2 and table 1 each reservoir represents physical storage over the catchment reservoir v 1 represents the karst system aiming at dividing the runoff into three kinds namely rapid karst runoff rks direct karst runoff rkb and karst groundwater runoff rkg fig 3 shows the physical process of each runoff component where rks represents the surface runoff of carbonate rock rkb represents the transverse runoff formed in the fissures and fractures of epikarst the uppermost layer of the carbonate rock and rkg refers to runoff in a karst underground river or conduit reservoir v 2 represents epikarst which is used to regulate the direct karst flow reservoir v 1 has a balance equation 1 s k p e s k 0 r ks r kb r kg where sk0 is the initial water storage of v 1 and sk is the water storage in reservoir 1 the difference between rainfall p and evaporation e was used as the input of reservoir v 1 if the current water storage of reservoir v 1 was greater than the water storage capacity of reservoir v 1 the excess parts would generate rapid runoff rks and the remaining part would generate rkb and rkg according to the linear outflow coefficients kkb and kkg respectively however due to the development of larger fractures and swallowing holes on the surface and in the epikarst larger scale karst systems usually have high infiltration capacities which make the flow in reservoir 1 very small and more water occurs in the form of groundwater thus in order to simulate the feature of karst area a threshold value hk is considered which reflects the development of vertical fractures in the shallow aquifer while sk is greater than hk the direct karst runoff rkb is generated the equations for calculating rks rkb and rkg are given as follows 2 r ks s k k m if s k k m 0 if s k k m 3 r kb k kb k m if s k k m k kb s k h k if h k k m s k 0 if s k h k 4 r kg k kg s k if s k 0 where kkm is the coefficient of the karst reservoir outflow to direct flow and kkg is coefficient of the karst reservoir outflow to groundwater 3 2 runoff generation in non karst area runoff generation was calculated using the traditional xaj model in non karst areas in the impermeable area the precipitation minus evaporation formed the surface runoff rb in the permeable area the generation of surface runoff rs interflow ri and groundwater runoff rg was simulated separately according to the procedures given in the evapotranspiration module the runoff generation module and runoff partition module of the traditional xaj model 3 3 runoff concentration in karst area a combination model namely karst xinanjiang k xaj model as shown in fig 1 was proposed in this study in order to consider runoff generation in both karst area and non karst area in a karst dominated basin the k xaj model was developed where parameter ik was used to denote the weight of the karst area in the whole basin based on the areal weight ik the k xaj model can capture the runoff generation characteristics of both karst and non karst areas in the k xaj model rs calculated by the xaj model was combined with rks calculated by the karst reservoir and rb in the impermeable area to form the total surface runoff qs rg calculated by the xaj model and rkg calculated by the karst reservoir model formed the total groundwater qg since the physical processes are very different for generating ri and rkb in karst and non karst areas ri and rkb were regulated by the linear reservoir in the xaj model and karst reservoir v 2 respectively ri and rkb formed interflow qi and direct karst flow qk respectively the equations for calculating the surface flow qs interflow qi direct karst flow qk and groundwater qg were defined as 5 q s r s r b r ks u 6 q i q i 0 c i r g 1 c i u 7 q k q k 0 c k r kb 1 c k u 8 q g q g 0 c g r g r kg 1 c g u where qi0 qk0 and qg0 are the flow qi qk and qg in the previous period ci ck and cg are the recession constants of interflow direct flow and groundwater respectively and u is the unit conversion coefficient 4 parameter calibration 4 1 model calibration the parameter calibration of hydrological models is normally done considering only a single objective function such as in genetic algorithm ga holland et al 1975 particle swarm optimization algorithm pso kennedy 2010 shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua duan et al 1992 and so on however practical applications indicate that a single objective calibration method is often subjective and inadequate to properly account for all the characteristics of the hydrological system the flood peak volume and hydrograph shape are three basic elements for describing a flood event zhang et al 2018 these elements are an important criterion for calibrating model parameters chen et al 2015 2016 huang et al 2018a b in this study the flood volume error nash sutcliffe efficiency and relative flood peak error were selected as objective functions which are given as follows the objective functions eqs 9 and 10 were evaluated at a daily time step while eq 11 was evaluated for a number of discrete flood events 1 objective function in terms of the flood volume 9 ob j 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i i 1 n q obs i 2 objective function in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency 10a nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 10b ob j 2 1 n s e 3 objective function in terms of flood peak 11 ob j 3 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim i q obs i where q obs i is the observed flow at time i q sim i is the simulated flow at time i n is the length of sequence data q obs is the average value of observed data q obs i is the observed data of flood peak at time i q sim i is the simulated value of flood peak at time i n is the length of the data set and n is the number of flood events guo et al 2013 proposed a multi objective shuffled complex differential evolution moscde for parameter calibration considering multi objectives in which moscde replaced the simplex search used in sce ua with the differential evolution de algorithm the moscde was used to calibrate the parameter of the hydrological models including tank and hymod models by ye et al 2014 and lu et al 2016 and the results proved that the multi objective method can be used for parameter estimation the multi objective function was defined as 12 m i n ob j i θ o b j 2 θ o b j m θ where m is the number of objective functions ob j i θ is the value of objective function for event i and θ is the model parameter the moscde method was used in this study for parameter calibration it is well known that the difficult problem of multi objective calibration is how to get optimal parameters in a series of non inferior optimization solutions generally a weighted sum approach is used to solve this problem where different objective functions are assigned different weights to convert a multi objective problem to single objective problem schoups et al 2005 however the subjective prior selection of weights typically affects the calibrated parameter values thus in this paper the pareto optimization algorithm was adopted for the hydrological model parameter optimization detailed information of the pareto optimization algorithm has been given by khu and madsen 2005 4 2 performance index in order to evaluate the performance of the hydrological model three performance indices including nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse as shown in eqs 10 relative flood peak error rpe as shown in eq 11 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the k xaj model the root mean square error was defined as 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q sim i q obs 2 in addition the chinese flood simulation standard recommends the use of the qualified rate qr to evaluate the flood simulation performance a predicted peak value is regarded as qualified when the relative absolute error rae between the predicted and the observed streamflow values is within a given threshold value ε chen et al 2013 2018c qr can be calculated by 14a qr i 1 n nu m i n 100 where 14b nu m i 1 if r a e i ε 0 otherwise r a e i q obs i q sim i q obs i where raei is the relative absolute error rae of the ith datum numi is set to 1 when rae is less than or equal to the predefined threshold value ε which is regarded as qualified simulation ε was set as 20 in accordance with the accuracy standard established by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2008 5 case study the lijiang river basin as shown in fig 4 located in the southwestern part of china was selected as a case study the lijiang river belongs to the pearl river basin and is a tributary of the xijiang river the basin is in a subtropical monsoon region with distinct seasons humid climate sufficient sunshine and abundant rain the average annual precipitation is about 1700 mm however the annual distribution of rainfall is uneven and the rainy season is from april to september which accounts for more than 70 of the yearly precipitation in the lijiang river basin the exposed rock formations on the surface of the area are mainly carbonate rocks and the climate of the basin is humid and hot climate this basin has a large area of carbonate based tropical karst landforms pingle gauging station is the control station of the lijiang river basin and the catchment area is 12 617 km2 the mainstream of the lijiang river is the darong river and there are four gauging stations along the river namely darong guilin yangshuo and pingle the main tributaries are the gongcheng river and the lipu river and there are two gauging stations along the two tributaries namely gongcheng and lipu gauging stations respectively the precipitation and evaporation data from the guilin yangshuo gongcheng and pingle stations were used as input of the model and the data from the pingle gauging station was used as the output of the hydrological model the data length was from 2001 to 2007 which was divided into two parts the data from the year 2001 to 2005 was used for model calibration and the data from the year 2006 and 2007 was used for model validation 6 results and discussion 6 1 flood simulation results of the k xaj model the proposed xaj model was used for flood simulation in lijiang river basin the moscde algorithm was adopted to calibrate the parameters of the proposed k xaj model and the calibrated parameters are given in table 1 the observed and runoff simulated by k xaj model are shown in fig 5 first the model performance was evaluated at a daily time step the performance indices including nse rmse qr and rpe according to eqs 10 11 13 14 were applied to evaluate the simulation results the performance indices were calculated as shown in table 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse qualified rate of the flood volume qr and relative flood peak error rpe of k xaj model for the validation period were calculated based on the predicted and observed continuous daily streamflow series the results were 90 4 nse 298 rmse 98 5 qr and 18 3 rpe respectively second the model performance was evaluated in terms of a number of discrete flood events the flood events were selected on the basis of the threshold flow which is set to 3000 m3 s when the peak flow is above this threshold value this flood event was selected 13 flood events were chosen in seven years in which 8 events are in calibration period and 5 in validation period we calculated the performance indices of each flood event in terms of the flood peak and volumes and then computed the average value of each performance index in the calibration and validation period respectively the performance results corresponding to the flood events are shown in table 2 as well in which the nse qr rpe of k xaj model for the flood events in the validation period are 89 4 100 and 19 respectively these results demonstrate that the k xaj model simulated runoff well and the model thus reflected the features of the karst area 6 2 comparisons of the k xaj model with the traditional xaj model 6 2 1 comparisons of the performances of the k xaj and xaj models both the xaj and k xaj models were used to simulate rainfall runoff in the lijiang river basin the performance indices were calculated as shown in table 2 it can be seen that the proposed k xaj model was better than the traditional xaj model for both calibration and validation periods the predicted results of the k xaj and xaj models are shown in fig 6 which demonstrates that the flood peak predicted by the xaj model is larger than the observed one compared with the traditional xaj model the proposed k xaj model gave better simulation results 6 2 2 comparisons of parameters of the k xaj and xaj models the traditional xaj model was used for flood simulation in the lijiang river basin the moscde algorithm was adopted to calibrate the parameters of the proposed k xaj model in the xaj model there are sixteen parameters which are divided into sensitive and insensitive parameters the sensitive parameters were k sm kg ki cg ci and cs and the insensitive parameters were um lm dm b im c ex ke and xe in the k xaj model there are six more parameters of which ik kkg kkb and ck are sensitive parameters and hk and km are less sensitive parameters sensitive parameters have a significant influence on the simulation results table 1 presents the calibrated parameter values of the k xaj and xaj models respectively the sensitive parameters ci and cg showed obvious fluctuations compared with the traditional xaj model ci increased and cg decreased which demonstrated that the karst dominated area produced less interflow and much more groundwater runoff these results are consistent with the features of convergence in the karst region 6 2 3 comparisons of performances and parameter of the k xaj and xaj models due to different proportion of karst areas the data from guilin and gongcheng gauging stations which is also the control stations for two sub basins were used as case studies the proportions of the karst area in these two sub catchments are about 10 and 35 respectively the daily streamflow data from the year 2001 to 2007 was used for model calibration and validation the performance indices for k xaj and traditional xaj models were calculated and given in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that for the sub basin controlled by gongcheng gauging station the performance of the proposed k xaj model is better than that of the traditional xaj model for both the calibration and validation periods in the other sub basin controlled by guilin gauging station the karst area accounts only approximately 10 of the total areas compared with the traditional xaj model the performance measured by nse indicates that the k xaj model is slightly better than the traditional xaj model generally with the higher proportion of karst area the k xaj model shows a better simulation efficacy to the contrary corresponding to the lower proportion of the karst area the performance of the two models do not show significant difference table 4 presents the sensitive parameters of the k xaj and xaj models in the three basins the proportions of karst area corresponding to the three basins are approximately 10 35 and 40 respectively based on the observed geographical data k is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to pan evaporation which is related to the air temperature and observed evaporation data so there is no obvious difference ik reflects the ratio of the karst area which is equal to 7 37 and 41 in the k xaj model for the three basins respectively the estimated ik 7 37 and 41 is more or less the same with the observed data 10 35 and 40 which proves the rationality of the proposed method ki and kkb are outflow coefficients of the free water storage to interflow and the karst water storage to direct flow with the increase of the karst areas the interflow and direct karst runoff should decrease according to the results present in table 4 ki and kkb decrease with the increase of the karst areas kg and kkg are outflow coefficients of the free water storage to groundwater with the increase of karst area the total underground runoff should increases according to the calculated results those two parameters also increase cg is the coefficient of groundwater regression the larger the karst area is the faster the groundwater regress and the smaller cg is ci and cs are the regression coefficient of interflow and surface runoff respectively when the karst area increases the interflow should decrease and the surface runoff should increase in the basin according to eqs 6 and 8 and results in table 4 ci increases and cs decreases considering the parameters evaluation in k xaj model due to the change of the proportion of the karst areas it is concluded that the proposed k xaj model can reflect the hydrological characteristics of the karst areas the parameter evolution characteristics of k xaj model are consistent with the features of runoff generation in the karst region 6 2 4 comparisons of simulated surface flow interflow and groundwater by the k xaj and xaj models several typical flood hydrographs for the year 2003 were selected and simulated by the proposed k xaj and xaj models surface runoff interflow and groundwater were calculated as shown in figs 7 9 respectively fig 7 shows that the surface flood peak calculated by the k xaj model was significantly higher than that by the xaj model this was due to the thin soil and little evaporation in the karst area when a heavy rainfall occurs the rainfall minus the evaporation directly flows into the karst reservoir if the current water storage s k of the karst reservoir 1 is greater than the karst storage capacity k m the excess water will generate the rapid karst flow which finally forms surface runoff and causes the flood peak to increase rapidly fig 8 shows that the interflow calculated by the k xaj model is significantly less than that by the xaj model in the karst area due to the exposure of multiple bedrocks and thin soil the water storage capacity of soil layer decreases and the ability of soil layer to redistribute rainfall is weak resulting in a significant decrease in interflow in fig 9 the magnitude of groundwater simulated by the k xaj model was greater than by the traditional xaj model the groundwater concentration speed was faster and the volume was larger in the initial period of rainfall and similarly in the later period the groundwater receded faster due to the development of vertical fractures and swallowing holes in the epikarst the surface flow was often connected to the underground thus precipitation at the beginning of rainfall can rapidly infiltrate into the underground and recharge groundwater since the developed underground multi channels and caves provided sufficient space for the storage of groundwater the development of underground rivers and conduits increased the speed of groundwater recession 6 2 5 comparison of flood recession period simulated by the k xaj and xaj models fig 10 shows the flood hydrograph predicted in 2003 as shown in the dash box of fig 10 the flood recession of the k xaj model was faster than that of the xaj model which was closer to the observed flood recession the reasons are given as follows first the increase in surface runoff and the decrease in the interflow in karst area reduced the time of flood recession second the development of underground rivers and conduits in karst area accelerated the velocity of flood recession 7 conclusion a conceptual coupled hydrological model namely k xaj model has been proposed for modelling rainfall runoff generation in the karstic catchments the conceptual model appears to be a good compromise between an empirical model and a distributed model which has relatively fewer parameters than the distributed model and can generally reflect physical relationships of the karst aquifer the lijiang river basin was selected as a case study both the proposed k xaj and traditional xaj models were used for flood simulation in this region and the simulated results were compared and analyzed the main conclusions are given as follows the main features of the proposed model are a the model is composed of the traditional xaj model and karst reservoirs to simulate rainfall runoff for a karst dominated area b the proposed model can simulate runoff of both the karst area and the non karst area in the karst dominated basin c the proposed karst reservoir can separate runoff into three components which match the physical process of runoff generation in karst areas and d the parameters in the k xaj model can reflect the characteristics of karst aquifers the performance indices and simulated flood hydrographs showed that the proposed k xaj model simulated the rainfall runoff processes well the estimated parameters have physical meaning compared with the traditional xaj model the proposed k xaj model better simulated runoff comparison of surface flow interflow and groundwater simulated by the proposed and traditional xaj models demonstrated that the peak surface flow predicted by the k xaj model was larger than that by the xaj model on the contrary the interflow routed by the k xaj model was significantly less than that by the xaj model the magnitude of groundwater predicted by the k xaj model was greater finally the simulated flood hydrograph in the flood recession period was analyzed results indicated that the flood recession of the k xaj model was faster than that of the xaj model which was closer to the observed flood recession declaration

6531,in deep excavation engineering the head of the confined aquifer below the excavation bottom must be lowered when the anti uprush safety factor is not satisfied however the drawdown of the confined aquifer may cause ground settlement around the excavation and endanger adjacent buildings tunnels or municipal pipes artificial recharge ar is a measure that has been applied in such situations to recover the water level and control the settlement however practical engineering cases have shown that ar could control only the development of settlement and could hardly recover the settlement caused by long term dewatering therefore three recharge schemes namely recharge first simultaneous pressure relief and recharge and pressure relief first are studied using numerical modeling the results show that the opening timing of the recharge wells and pressure relief wells has a significant impact on the final settlement in different recharge schemes different stress paths of the soil in the confined aquifer and overlying aquitards cause different plastic compressive deformations to reduce plastic deformation recharge should begin at the same time as pressure relief when the surrounding environment of the deep excavation must be strictly protected additionally the case study and numerical simulation both show that the most significant settlement or uplift occurs in the deep soil layer rather than at the ground surface a phenomenon that occurs because the vertical displacement of the soil adjacent to the relief and recharge wells is larger than that in the soil far away leading to a vertical soil arching in the strata above the confined aquifer keywords artificial recharge confined aquifer pressure relief soil arching opening sequence 1 introduction since the 1990s excavation depths have been increasing with the development of cities in china thereby subjecting excavations to the increasing influence of confined aquifers to avoid seepage damage base heave piping etc zheng et al 2016 pressure relief wells are used to lower the head of the confined aquifers below the excavation bottom preene and roberts 2002 however the drawdown of confined aquifers may cause settlement around the excavation and endanger adjacent buildings tunnels or municipal pipes in practice waterproof walls can be designed to cut off the confined aquifer to minimize the settlement induced by dewatering zheng et al 2018a li et al 2018 2019 however waterproof walls are costly and difficult to construct when the excavation is excessively deep if the settlement in the site must be strictly controlled and the confined aquifer is not cut off by a waterproof wall artificial recharge ar is an effective and economical way to control settlement because it can recover the groundwater level drawdown induced by engineering dewatering as a measure taken to raise the head of the confined aquifer ar is typically used to solve long term settlement problems caused by the extraction of groundwater from deep confined aquifers used as water supplies currently ar is widely applied for storing water and controlling regional subsidence in many areas bhusari et al 2016 sarma and xu 2017 kuroda et al 2017 shi et al 2016 many researchers have investigated the effect of ar on deep confined aquifers using long term field studies bouri and dhia 2010 hida 2007 giao et al 1998 however in excavation engineering ar research is mainly used to address local settlement around excavation induced by dewatering compared with ar in deep confined aquifers the duration of ar in shallow confined aquifers is shorter and the influence area is smaller nevertheless because of the high compressibility of shallow strata the deformation of shallow strata is very sensitive to changes in the groundwater level zeng et al 2019 few studies have focused on the recharge of shallow confined aquifers in excavation engineering wang et al 2012 phien wej et al 1998 zhang et al 2017 due to the development of city construction the dewatering of shallow confined aquifers in deep excavation engineering has also become an urban problem the dewatering of confined aquifers can cause long term settlement of the city and lead to water resource shortages therefore further investigation into ar for shallow confined aquifers in excavation engineering is necessary in practical engineering the opening of the ar can control only the development of settlement and cannot recover the settlement after a long duration of dewatering long term pressure relief of the confined aquifer before recharge can induce plastic compressive deformation in the confined aquifer itself and its overlying aquitards such as clay and silty clay layers which cannot recover when the head of the confined aquifer rises chen et al 2018 this problem limits the effect of the recharge to control settlement previous studies have mainly focused on the soil deformation mechanism induced by the dewatering of shallow aquifers powrie and preene 1994 budhu and adiyaman 2010 moon and fernandez 2010 however only a few studies have considered the soil deformation induced by ar therefore the response of soil settlement to the combined action of the recharge and pressure relief of the confined aquifer needs to be clarified to optimize the recharge scheme this study focuses on the unrecoverable settlement and the difference in settlements among different schemes with various opening sequences of the recharge and pressure relief wells first two field tests were introduced to indicate that recharge can cease the development of settlement but cannot recover the settlement then numerical analyses of different recharge schemes were conducted using a verified finite element model fem five cases were performed to analyze the impact of the opening sequence of pressure relief wells and recharge wells on settlement additionally the mechanism controlling the settlement distribution at different depths was discussed 2 hydrogeology and field tests 2 1 hydrogeology in tianjin the geological exploration of 8 sites in tianjin as shown in fig 1 indicated that the shallow groundwater distributions at different sites are similar the shallow groundwater system is composed of three primary aquifers a phreatic aquifer aq0 and two semiconfined aquifers namely the 1st semiconfined aquifer aqi and the 2nd semiconfined aquifer aqii the phreatic aquifer consists of silty clay and silt layers the two semiconfined aquifers aqi and aqii consist of silt and silty sand layers which have lower hydraulic conductivities than the confined aquifer that is composed of sand and gravel layers aquifers are typically separated by aquitards composed of silty clay and clay layers in tianjin the groundwater levels of aqi and aqii are 2 4 m below the ground surface for most of the excavations deeper than 5 m aqi was wholly cut off by waterproof walls therefore the head in aqi had a limited influence on the anti uprush stability of the excavation bottom the confined aquifers below aqii are generally defined as deep aquifers the head of aqiii was 10 15 m below the ground surface and the bottom of this layer was typically at a depth of over 55 m fig 2 presents typical deep excavations and metro stations in tianjin in 2017 generally the excavation depths of the 2 story metro stations range from 16 to 18 m while the excavation depths of the 3 story metro stations are between 22 m and 28 m additionally as the waterproof wall the depth of the diaphragm wall linearly depends on the depth of the excavation and mainly ranges from 30 to 55 m however as the depth of the diaphragm wall increases the cost and duration of construction increase significantly therefore the diaphragm walls are usually not designed to cut off aqii the head and settlement around the excavation are controlled by the ar in aqii zheng et al 2018b when there is an unexpected hydraulic connection to the excavation near the bottom of the waterproof wall ar in aqii is also needed additionally for excavations with a depth of less than 25 m the influence of aqiii on the stability of the excavation bottom is negligible additionally previous studies shen et al 2015 showed that when the maximum drawdown of aqii approached 12 m the water head of aqiii remained constant thus for most excavations there is no need to relieve the pore pressure of aqiii due to its low hydraulic connection with aqii and relatively low groundwater level overall in practical engineering the pressure relief and recharge scheme of aqii was typically the most crucial problem involving confined water therefore aqii was primarily investigated in this study 2 2 field test 1 2 2 1 introduction to the project an excavation in tianjin china was located near a historic building which was supported by 11 m long pile foundations the minimum distance between the excavation and the historic building was 15 m the planar shape of the excavation was an irregular polygon as shown in fig 2 the main excavation depth was 21 m and the partial excavation depth was 24 m the main retaining structure was a series of contiguous bored piles φ1500 1700 and the waterproof walls were trench cutting and remixing deep trd walls at the north west and east sides of the excavation with cement mixing piles located at the other sides because the east side was adjacent to the historic building an additional row of contiguous bored piles and five rows of cement mixing piles were constructed outside the trd wall and the main retaining structure to reduce the deformation of the eastern retaining structure fig 3 presents a typical geological section the water table inside the excavation needed to be lowered to 2 m below the excavation bottom to meet the requirements of anti uprush stability in this project aqii was not cut off by the wall and a hydraulic connection existed between aqi and aqii in the dewatering tests when the soil layers of aq0 and aqi inside the excavation were drained the heads of aqi and aqii around the excavation also decreased therefore to minimize the settlement of the historic building caused by dewatering a row of recharge wells was constructed between the excavation and the building to control the drawdown of the aquifers underneath the building 2 2 2 analysis of the monitoring results the development of the water heads and settlements of the building after the recharge began are shown in fig 4 before the recharge the heads of aqi and aqii had already declined by 3 m the recharge process can be divided into three main stages in the first stage i e from day 0 to day 17 the horizontal displacements of the retaining piles induced by the excavation increased by approximately 10 mm however the settlement of the building did not increase which indicated that the rebound induced by the recharge offset the settlement caused by the excavation in the second stage i e from day 17 to day 33 the displacements of the eastern retaining structures remained constant however because the recharge of wells h1 and h4 stopped on day 17 the heads in the observation wells decreased suddenly consequently the settlement of the building began to increase due to the drawdown in the third stage i e from day 33 to day 45 the displacements of the eastern retaining structures still did not change because the recharge of wells h4 and h1 began on days 33 and 36 respectively the development of the building settlement stopped however when the head increased to the initial head in aqii the settlement was not recovered this site observation demonstrates that after long term dewatering even if the recharge raises the groundwater level a certain amount of settlement could not be recovered therefore recharge should be initiated early to prevent the development of settlement the effect of the opening timing of the ar on the ground settlement and its mechanism will be discussed in the following sections through numerical simulations 2 3 field test 2 2 3 1 project description and soil conditions a series of pumping tests were conducted at site 3 shown in fig 1 and the geological conditions at site 3 are typical of those in tianjin fig 5 shows the layout of the test site including the locations of the 2 pumping wells w2 and w3 and 8 observation wells p1 1 to p3 3 all of which fully penetrated the aquifers dccj01 dccj10 were settlement monitoring points all of which were placed 2 m below the ground surface to eliminate environmental influences such as those caused by passing vehicles there were four layered settlement monitoring points fccj1 fccj4 and four pore pressure monitoring points kxs1 kxs4 three sensors were placed at 4 m 8 m and 12 m below the ground surface at each monitoring point as shown in fig 6 the soil properties were obtained via geotechnical investigation and laboratory testing a series of pumping tests were conducted over 17 days during the pumping tests the settlements at different depths the water levels in different observation wells and the pore pressures in different aquitards were measured table 1 shows the details of the testing in the seven steps of the single pumping tests three different pumping rates i e small medium and large were used in the twin well test both w2 and w3 were involved and the drawdowns of aqi and aqii were fixed at 8 m 2 3 2 field measurements of groundwater level and settlement fig 7 presents the development of groundwater levels in the observation wells and settlements at the monitoring points during the seven steps of the pumping tests note that the lines in fig 7 represent the drawdown and settlement values calculated by the fem which will be introduced in section 3 2 in the first step the water level of aqi decreased rapidly correspondingly the measured settlement at the ground surface and in the deep soil layers showed a similar trend as the pumping rate decreased both the water level and settlement slightly recovered before the fourth step the water levels in some observation wells p2 1 p2 2 and p2 3 had nearly returned to the original levels however the ground surface settlement and layered settlement e g fccj2 3 had not rebounded a large unrecoverable residual deformation in the sandy layer existed after water level recovery from withdrawal zhang et al 2017 the groundwater level of aq0 decreased slightly during w2 pumping indicating a slight hydraulic connection between aq0 and aqi meanwhile the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard between aqi and aqii was relatively low during the entire test process for settlement both cases cases 1 and 2 reported above indicated that after a period of dewatering the soil deformation could not be recovered even if the water level returned to the initial state to evaluate the control effect of ar the fem which was verified by the in situ pumping test of case 2 was adopted in the next section 3 introduction and verification of numerical model 3 1 general numerical model in this study to investigate the mechanism of ground settlement during the pumping and recharge processes the fem software abaqus abaqus 6 11 2011 was used to conduct simulations the hydraulic physical and mechanical parameters of the soil layers in field test 2 were employed in the numerical simulation of this study as listed in fig 6 the soil in the numerical model divided into 8 layers was extended to a depth of 80 m the modified cam clay model was used to model the soil the parameters m λ and κ were obtained by laboratory tests the solid 8 node trilinear displacement and pore pressure elements were adopted in this simulation to consider the soil fluid coupling a sufficiently large calculation range should be used to minimize the boundary effect in the calculation zeng et al 2018 for practical purposes the approximation of the radius of influence is mainly based on empirical formulas which are based on the permeability coefficient or drawdown at the pumping well and observation wells considering the well losses and wellbore clogging a result based on the permeability coefficient such as sichardt s formula zheng et al 2014 is not desirable in this study a graphical method was employed to identify the influence radius of the well the drawdowns in observation wells at different distances r from the pumping well are marked on a semilog chart in fig 8 the intersection point of the curve and the x axis is considered the influence radius as shown in fig 8 the influence radii in the aqi and aqii pumping tests are 448 m and 143 m respectively therefore the dimension of the model was determined to be 1200 m 1200 m the soil was normally consolidated and the coefficient of the lateral earth pressure was derived using jaky s equation the soil parameters used in the simulation are shown in fig 6 the mesh in the pumping and observation well area was refined with a size of 1 m 1 m in plane view enlarging toward the edges of the model shen et al 2015 generally there are three methods that can be used to simulate the dewatering process zheng et al 2014 1 specify a pumping velocity on the water crossing surface wcs 2 set a zero pore water pressure boundary on the wcs or 3 set the drainage only flow dof boundary on the wcs in this study because all pumping tests are constant rate tests the first method was adopted in the simulation 3 2 verification of the numerical model based on field test 2 to verify the numerical model the tests of steps 1 6 in field test 2 were simulated the simulation procedures were the same as those given in table 1 in fig 7 the calculated drawdowns in the observation wells and the calculated layered settlement in steps 1 6 are presented along with the observed results in this figure the calculated drawdowns matched well with the measured results for most of the observation wells in all the aquifers aq0 aqi and aqii the observed and calculated layered settlement followed the same trend and had similar magnitudes during pumping and recovery thus the numerical model was verified to be capable of analyzing the response of groundwater level and ground deformation to the multicycle pumping recovery process in the confined aquifer as shown in fig 7 the settlement continuously increased in step 1 and the maximum settlement approached approximately 7 mm as the pumping rate decreased during steps 2 and 3 there was slight rebound in the measured and calculated settlement generally based on the calculated and measured results after water level recovery from a period of dewatering a considerable proportion of settlement could not recover in addition at the end of steps 2 and 5 the maximum vertical deformation occurred at a depth of 12 m close to the top of aqi rather than at the ground surface as shown in fig 9 this phenomenon can be mainly attributed to the soil arch effect induced by the differential deformation in the soil stratum its mechanism will be discussed in section 4 4 4 analysis of the numerical results in this section to study the settlement control effect of different recharge schemes a series of numerical simulations were conducted using the verified fem based on the analysis in section 2 1 aqii was primarily investigated in this study for relief wells and recharge wells the fluid flow rate along the well screen can be assumed to be uniform in the constant rate test jin et al 2005 the simulation of the recharge wells was similar to that of the pressure relief well described above but the flow velocity was negative the rate of pumping and recharge was assumed to be constant and recharge clogging was not considered pumping and recharge rates were both set to 223 m3 d which was the same as that of the large scale pumping test of aqii in field test 2 the planned layout of recharge wells pressure relief wells and a monitoring point are shown in fig 10 in practical excavation recharge wells were mainly used to protect nearby buildings therefore in this study recharge wells were located between relief wells and monitoring point s1 which represents the location of the protected building changes in the water head and soil deformation at s1 during the simulation were recorded and investigated for comparison 5 cases were simulated using the fem i e recharge first cases 1 and 2 simultaneous pressure relief and recharge case 3 and pressure relief first cases 4 and 5 as listed in table 2 4 1 comparison of the settlements the variation curves of the drawdown and ground settlement at s1 during the simulation processes in different cases are shown in fig 11 for each case the seepage fields approached steady state approximately 3 days after the relief well or recharge wells were opened additionally the drawdowns in different cases tended to be approximately equal after day 13 limited by the permeability of the overlying and underlying aquitards the development of ground settlement was considerably slower than the drawdown speed of the confined aquifer as shown in fig 11 the final settlements in cases 1 2 and 3 were similar in cases 1 and 2 the ground settlement rebounded at first then after the relief wells opened the ground settlement showed a similar trend with the variation in water level and nearly returned to the initial state in case 3 because the water level remained approximately constant from the beginning of the simulation the ground surface also shows a similar trend in cases 4 and 5 the settlement increased rapidly after dewatering began after the recharge wells opened the displacement direction of the ground surface shifted upward however the ground settlement could not recover to the initial state the final settlements after day 15 in different cases indicate that the opening sequence of the ar and relief wells have a significant influence on the control effectiveness of the settlement fig 12 presents the vertical deformation of the strata at settlement monitoring point s1 for different cases the settlement caused by the pressure relief of aqii mainly included the compressive deformation of aqii and the consolidation deformation of the overlying aquitard oa layers above oa generally moved upward or downward following the movement of oa the compressive deformation of aqii mainly caused the differences in the ground settlements among the different cases overall based on the calculated results the pressure relief first scheme caused the largest surface settlement and the ground surface settlement increased with the duration of dewatering before recharge therefore the recharge scheme in case 3 i e simultaneous pressure relief and recharge should be recommended when considering settlement control and water conservation 4 2 analysis of soil stress and strain state the previous section discussed the influence of the opening timing of the recharge wells on the ground settlement in this section changes in the stress strain state in different cases will be analyzed to introduce the influence mechanism of the opening timing of the recharge on the ground settlement 4 2 1 recharge first cases fig 13 presents the development of the vertical displacement additional stress and pore pressure increment of the soil in case 2 when only the recharge wells were operating the pore pressure of the recharged aquifer increased and then the additional vertical stress was reduced due to the increased pore pressure oa and the underlying aquitard ua were recharged from aqii and they were also subjected to additional tensile stress which was similar to that of the aquifer aqii the movement direction of the soil above the bottom of ua was upward but the maximum upward displacement of the soil was located at the middle of oa rather than at the ground surface after 5 days of recharging with the combined action of soil arching and pore pressure dissipation the additional stress at the maximum displacement location mdl was approximately 0 kpa the soil below the mdl and above the bottom of ua experienced vertical tensile strain the arching effect is investigated in section 4 4 after the relief wells were turned on the pore pressure in aqii was first dropped and then stabilized after 5 days limited by the consolidation rate the pore pressure dissipation in oa and ua occurred over a long period as shown in fig 13 the excess pore pressure in oa and ua caused by the recharge still had not entirely dissipated 5 days after the relief wells were turned on following the variation in pore pressure the additional vertical stress in the soil below the mdl and above the bottom of ua increased and the soil was compressed correspondingly as the pore pressure dissipated the compressive deformation increases rapidly and then nearly stopped within 5 days therefore the soil above the bottom of ua moved downward and the upheaving of the ground surface was reduced to a very small movement additionally because the recharge wells were located between the relief wells and monitoring point s1 the water level at s1 was still higher than the initial level after the relief wells were turned on therefore the stress state of aqii at s1 was still tensile and the ground surface still had a small upheaval deformation 4 2 2 simultaneous pressure relief and recharge case fig 14 presents the development of the vertical displacement additional stress and pore pressure of the soil in case 3 because the relief wells and recharge wells were opened simultaneously the variation in the pore pressure was small from the beginning of this case unlike with the recharge first case because the pumping rate was equal to the recharge rate and the location of s1 the total effect at point s1 was recharge therefore the pore pressures in aqii oa and ua all increased thus the effective stresses decreased and the soil rebounded the development of deformation in aqii was fast and nearly did not change after the first half day due to the limited change in the additional stress caused by the pore pressure variation and the arching effect the vertical displacements at the ground surface and in the deep soil were relatively small as with cases 1 and 2 the maximum displacement was located at the middle of oa and vertical tensile strain occurred in the upper soil layer due to soil arching 4 2 3 pressure relief first cases fig 15 presents the development of the vertical displacement additional stress and pore pressure of the soil in case 4 after 5 days of pumping the pore pressure in aqii oa and ua decreased and the maximum settlement 9 5 mm occurred in oa simultaneously the ground surface settlement reached 8 6 mm when recharge began the pore pressure in aqii and oa increased thus their effective stresses decreased as shown in fig 15 after 10 days of recharge the maximum settlement decreased to 6 9 mm the majority of the rebound of the ground surface was induced by that of aqii 2 2 mm only a small portion of the compressive deformation of oa could be recovered when the effective stress was reduced based on the calculation results for the above five cases when the pore pressure of the confined aquifer decreased oa and ua experienced compressive deformation due to the discharge of water due to the soil arching the upper soil layers experienced vertical tensile deformation thus the maximum settlement in the soil was located at the middle of oa the deformation modes of these soil layers reversed when the pore pressure of the confined aquifer increased additionally although the final drawdowns in the different cases were similar the changing paths of the pore pressures were different thus the stress strain paths of the soil were different because the deformation of the soil is path dependent different stress strain paths cause different soil settlements 4 3 stress strain paths of the aquitards in this section the stress strain paths of oa in different cases are analyzed a soil element was adopted for the analysis and the comparative results of the stress strain path of the soil element are shown in fig 16 fig 16 a shows the variation in vertical effective stress and horizontal effective stress for three cases in case 2 due to the recharging a b the vertical and horizontal effective stresses both decreased at first the decrease in the mean stress caused oa to rebound as shown in fig 16 b when the relief wells were turned on b c the pore pressure began to decrease then the mean stress increased which compressed the aquitard in the process of a b c the preload stress was the initial stress state a as the stress state returned to state c both the average main stress and the generalized shear stress almost returned to the initial state near state a a slight vertical tensile deformation was formed as shown in fig 16 b in case 3 a d the preload stress was also the initial stress the evolution of the stress strain path followed a similar manner as that in case 2 in the dewatering process a e of case 4 the increments of the vertical and horizontal effective stresses were positive the consolidation pressure in oa reached the maximum value at point e after the recharge wells turned on e f both the vertical and horizontal effective stress decreased therefore the soil in oa became overconsolidated at point f the vertical effective stress in case 4 was the same as that in cases 2 point c and 3 point d however the horizontal effective stress could not fully recover to the initial state and was much greater than that in cases 2 and 3 therefore the coefficient of lateral pressure k f of the soil at the final state in case 4 point f was greater than that at the final state in cases 2 k c and 3 k d and was also greater than at the initial state k a at point a as shown in fig 16 b the final mean stress in case 4 was much greater than the mean stress in cases 2 and 3 approximately δ p b greater the final vertical strain in case 4 was larger than the vertical strain in cases 2 and 3 by approximately δ ε a δ ε b there were two main reasons for the difference between the settlements in cases 4 and 3 or case 2 as detailed below 1 the difference in the compressive strain δ ε a occurred because the loading and unloading moduli were different the loading modulus was considerably lower than the unloading modulus 2 because the horizontal strain of the aquitard was nearly 0 the difference in the compressive strain δ ε b was equal to the difference in the volumetric strain which was caused by the difference in the mean pressure δ p b as discussed in the third paragraph of this section 4 4 soil arching as discussed in the case study in section 2 and the numerical results in section 4 2 the largest settlement or uplift mdl occur approximately in the middle of oa rather than at the ground surface when the head in aqii decreased the aquifer ua and lower part of oa subsided and experienced vertical compressive deformation however the upper soil above the mdl exhibited vertical tensile deformation an inverse deformation occurred when the head in aqii increased this phenomenon can be explained by the vertical arching effect moradi and abbasnejad 2015 to easily determine the stress transfer mechanism lee et al 2006 zheng et al 2015 the vertical arching ratio can be defined as follows 1 r z δ σ z σ z 100 where δ σ z is the change in the effective vertical stress and σ z is the initial vertical effective stress before the test in this study the vertical arching ratio was used to describe the arching behavior of the upper soil as shown in fig 17 in cross section a a see fig 10 for location when the relief wells were in operation a vertical soil arching formed in the upper soil layer due to the differential settlement of the underlying soil layers the arching zone can be divided into two zones a tensile zone with negative rz and a compressive zone with positive rz in the tensile zone the downward displacement at the top of the upper soil was smaller than the downward displacement at the bottom of the upper soil therefore the maximum downward displacement occurred at the bottom of the upper soil in contrast in the compressive zone the maximum vertical downward displacement occurred at the ground surface as shown in fig 18 in cross section b b see fig 10 for location when the recharge wells were in operation the displacement of aqii and oa was upward in contrast to the above case a vertical soil arching formed due to differential heave the arching zone can also be divided into two zones a compressive zone with positive rz and a tensile zone with negative rz however these two zones have different positions compared with those in fig 17 in the compressive zone the maximum upward displacement occurred at the bottom of the upper soil in the tensile zone the maximum upward displacement occurred at the ground surface in addition due to the different magnitudes of deformation caused by pumping and recharging the tensile zone in fig 17 has a different magnitude than that of the compressive zone in fig 18 5 conclusions in this study two field tests were studied indicating that after long term dewatering a large amount of settlement could not be recovered even if the recharge recovered the groundwater level a 3 dimensional soil fluid coupling model was used to investigate the mechanism of ar in the control of the settlement induced by the pressure relief of the confined aquifer the influence of the opening sequence of the recharge and the pressure relief on the recharge effectiveness and the vertical displacement distribution in the deep soil were primarily examined the following conclusions were drawn from the simulation results 1 limited by the permeability of oa and ua the development of the ground settlement was considerably slower than the speed of the drawdown of the confined aquifer the opening sequence of the recharge wells and relief wells did not considerably affect the final steady drawdown but significantly influenced ground settlement 2 compared to the pressure relief first schemes the simultaneous pressure relief and recharge and recharge first schemes can more effectively control the settlement induced by the pressure relief of the confined aquifer the pressure relief first scheme caused the largest settlement and the settlement increased with the duration of pressure relief before ar the recharge first scheme wastefully and unnecessarily consumes more water resources therefore recharge should begin at the same time as the pressure relief when the surrounding environment must be strictly controlled 3 the settlement differences in different schemes were caused by the different compressive deformations of oa there were two reasons why the compressive deformation was largest in the pressure relief first scheme first the unloading modulus of oa was considerably greater than the compressive modulus the majority of the compressive deformation of oa that occurred before the recharge process cannot be recovered second the final mean pressure of the oa soil in this scheme was greater than the final mean pressure in other schemes because the soil was overconsolidated and had a larger lateral pressure coefficient 4 the differential settlement or heave in the soil at different distances from the wells could induce soil arching in the upper soil layer above oa the soil arching in the upper soil can be divided into two zones namely the compressive zone and the tensile zone in the case of pressure relief in the confined aquifer the tensile zone was close to the relief well and the maximum settlement in this zone occurred at the bottom of the upper soil in the compressive zone the maximum settlement occurred at the ground surface the above phenomenon is reversed in the case of recharge declaration of interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key r d program of china grant no 2017yfc0805407 the national

6531,in deep excavation engineering the head of the confined aquifer below the excavation bottom must be lowered when the anti uprush safety factor is not satisfied however the drawdown of the confined aquifer may cause ground settlement around the excavation and endanger adjacent buildings tunnels or municipal pipes artificial recharge ar is a measure that has been applied in such situations to recover the water level and control the settlement however practical engineering cases have shown that ar could control only the development of settlement and could hardly recover the settlement caused by long term dewatering therefore three recharge schemes namely recharge first simultaneous pressure relief and recharge and pressure relief first are studied using numerical modeling the results show that the opening timing of the recharge wells and pressure relief wells has a significant impact on the final settlement in different recharge schemes different stress paths of the soil in the confined aquifer and overlying aquitards cause different plastic compressive deformations to reduce plastic deformation recharge should begin at the same time as pressure relief when the surrounding environment of the deep excavation must be strictly protected additionally the case study and numerical simulation both show that the most significant settlement or uplift occurs in the deep soil layer rather than at the ground surface a phenomenon that occurs because the vertical displacement of the soil adjacent to the relief and recharge wells is larger than that in the soil far away leading to a vertical soil arching in the strata above the confined aquifer keywords artificial recharge confined aquifer pressure relief soil arching opening sequence 1 introduction since the 1990s excavation depths have been increasing with the development of cities in china thereby subjecting excavations to the increasing influence of confined aquifers to avoid seepage damage base heave piping etc zheng et al 2016 pressure relief wells are used to lower the head of the confined aquifers below the excavation bottom preene and roberts 2002 however the drawdown of confined aquifers may cause settlement around the excavation and endanger adjacent buildings tunnels or municipal pipes in practice waterproof walls can be designed to cut off the confined aquifer to minimize the settlement induced by dewatering zheng et al 2018a li et al 2018 2019 however waterproof walls are costly and difficult to construct when the excavation is excessively deep if the settlement in the site must be strictly controlled and the confined aquifer is not cut off by a waterproof wall artificial recharge ar is an effective and economical way to control settlement because it can recover the groundwater level drawdown induced by engineering dewatering as a measure taken to raise the head of the confined aquifer ar is typically used to solve long term settlement problems caused by the extraction of groundwater from deep confined aquifers used as water supplies currently ar is widely applied for storing water and controlling regional subsidence in many areas bhusari et al 2016 sarma and xu 2017 kuroda et al 2017 shi et al 2016 many researchers have investigated the effect of ar on deep confined aquifers using long term field studies bouri and dhia 2010 hida 2007 giao et al 1998 however in excavation engineering ar research is mainly used to address local settlement around excavation induced by dewatering compared with ar in deep confined aquifers the duration of ar in shallow confined aquifers is shorter and the influence area is smaller nevertheless because of the high compressibility of shallow strata the deformation of shallow strata is very sensitive to changes in the groundwater level zeng et al 2019 few studies have focused on the recharge of shallow confined aquifers in excavation engineering wang et al 2012 phien wej et al 1998 zhang et al 2017 due to the development of city construction the dewatering of shallow confined aquifers in deep excavation engineering has also become an urban problem the dewatering of confined aquifers can cause long term settlement of the city and lead to water resource shortages therefore further investigation into ar for shallow confined aquifers in excavation engineering is necessary in practical engineering the opening of the ar can control only the development of settlement and cannot recover the settlement after a long duration of dewatering long term pressure relief of the confined aquifer before recharge can induce plastic compressive deformation in the confined aquifer itself and its overlying aquitards such as clay and silty clay layers which cannot recover when the head of the confined aquifer rises chen et al 2018 this problem limits the effect of the recharge to control settlement previous studies have mainly focused on the soil deformation mechanism induced by the dewatering of shallow aquifers powrie and preene 1994 budhu and adiyaman 2010 moon and fernandez 2010 however only a few studies have considered the soil deformation induced by ar therefore the response of soil settlement to the combined action of the recharge and pressure relief of the confined aquifer needs to be clarified to optimize the recharge scheme this study focuses on the unrecoverable settlement and the difference in settlements among different schemes with various opening sequences of the recharge and pressure relief wells first two field tests were introduced to indicate that recharge can cease the development of settlement but cannot recover the settlement then numerical analyses of different recharge schemes were conducted using a verified finite element model fem five cases were performed to analyze the impact of the opening sequence of pressure relief wells and recharge wells on settlement additionally the mechanism controlling the settlement distribution at different depths was discussed 2 hydrogeology and field tests 2 1 hydrogeology in tianjin the geological exploration of 8 sites in tianjin as shown in fig 1 indicated that the shallow groundwater distributions at different sites are similar the shallow groundwater system is composed of three primary aquifers a phreatic aquifer aq0 and two semiconfined aquifers namely the 1st semiconfined aquifer aqi and the 2nd semiconfined aquifer aqii the phreatic aquifer consists of silty clay and silt layers the two semiconfined aquifers aqi and aqii consist of silt and silty sand layers which have lower hydraulic conductivities than the confined aquifer that is composed of sand and gravel layers aquifers are typically separated by aquitards composed of silty clay and clay layers in tianjin the groundwater levels of aqi and aqii are 2 4 m below the ground surface for most of the excavations deeper than 5 m aqi was wholly cut off by waterproof walls therefore the head in aqi had a limited influence on the anti uprush stability of the excavation bottom the confined aquifers below aqii are generally defined as deep aquifers the head of aqiii was 10 15 m below the ground surface and the bottom of this layer was typically at a depth of over 55 m fig 2 presents typical deep excavations and metro stations in tianjin in 2017 generally the excavation depths of the 2 story metro stations range from 16 to 18 m while the excavation depths of the 3 story metro stations are between 22 m and 28 m additionally as the waterproof wall the depth of the diaphragm wall linearly depends on the depth of the excavation and mainly ranges from 30 to 55 m however as the depth of the diaphragm wall increases the cost and duration of construction increase significantly therefore the diaphragm walls are usually not designed to cut off aqii the head and settlement around the excavation are controlled by the ar in aqii zheng et al 2018b when there is an unexpected hydraulic connection to the excavation near the bottom of the waterproof wall ar in aqii is also needed additionally for excavations with a depth of less than 25 m the influence of aqiii on the stability of the excavation bottom is negligible additionally previous studies shen et al 2015 showed that when the maximum drawdown of aqii approached 12 m the water head of aqiii remained constant thus for most excavations there is no need to relieve the pore pressure of aqiii due to its low hydraulic connection with aqii and relatively low groundwater level overall in practical engineering the pressure relief and recharge scheme of aqii was typically the most crucial problem involving confined water therefore aqii was primarily investigated in this study 2 2 field test 1 2 2 1 introduction to the project an excavation in tianjin china was located near a historic building which was supported by 11 m long pile foundations the minimum distance between the excavation and the historic building was 15 m the planar shape of the excavation was an irregular polygon as shown in fig 2 the main excavation depth was 21 m and the partial excavation depth was 24 m the main retaining structure was a series of contiguous bored piles φ1500 1700 and the waterproof walls were trench cutting and remixing deep trd walls at the north west and east sides of the excavation with cement mixing piles located at the other sides because the east side was adjacent to the historic building an additional row of contiguous bored piles and five rows of cement mixing piles were constructed outside the trd wall and the main retaining structure to reduce the deformation of the eastern retaining structure fig 3 presents a typical geological section the water table inside the excavation needed to be lowered to 2 m below the excavation bottom to meet the requirements of anti uprush stability in this project aqii was not cut off by the wall and a hydraulic connection existed between aqi and aqii in the dewatering tests when the soil layers of aq0 and aqi inside the excavation were drained the heads of aqi and aqii around the excavation also decreased therefore to minimize the settlement of the historic building caused by dewatering a row of recharge wells was constructed between the excavation and the building to control the drawdown of the aquifers underneath the building 2 2 2 analysis of the monitoring results the development of the water heads and settlements of the building after the recharge began are shown in fig 4 before the recharge the heads of aqi and aqii had already declined by 3 m the recharge process can be divided into three main stages in the first stage i e from day 0 to day 17 the horizontal displacements of the retaining piles induced by the excavation increased by approximately 10 mm however the settlement of the building did not increase which indicated that the rebound induced by the recharge offset the settlement caused by the excavation in the second stage i e from day 17 to day 33 the displacements of the eastern retaining structures remained constant however because the recharge of wells h1 and h4 stopped on day 17 the heads in the observation wells decreased suddenly consequently the settlement of the building began to increase due to the drawdown in the third stage i e from day 33 to day 45 the displacements of the eastern retaining structures still did not change because the recharge of wells h4 and h1 began on days 33 and 36 respectively the development of the building settlement stopped however when the head increased to the initial head in aqii the settlement was not recovered this site observation demonstrates that after long term dewatering even if the recharge raises the groundwater level a certain amount of settlement could not be recovered therefore recharge should be initiated early to prevent the development of settlement the effect of the opening timing of the ar on the ground settlement and its mechanism will be discussed in the following sections through numerical simulations 2 3 field test 2 2 3 1 project description and soil conditions a series of pumping tests were conducted at site 3 shown in fig 1 and the geological conditions at site 3 are typical of those in tianjin fig 5 shows the layout of the test site including the locations of the 2 pumping wells w2 and w3 and 8 observation wells p1 1 to p3 3 all of which fully penetrated the aquifers dccj01 dccj10 were settlement monitoring points all of which were placed 2 m below the ground surface to eliminate environmental influences such as those caused by passing vehicles there were four layered settlement monitoring points fccj1 fccj4 and four pore pressure monitoring points kxs1 kxs4 three sensors were placed at 4 m 8 m and 12 m below the ground surface at each monitoring point as shown in fig 6 the soil properties were obtained via geotechnical investigation and laboratory testing a series of pumping tests were conducted over 17 days during the pumping tests the settlements at different depths the water levels in different observation wells and the pore pressures in different aquitards were measured table 1 shows the details of the testing in the seven steps of the single pumping tests three different pumping rates i e small medium and large were used in the twin well test both w2 and w3 were involved and the drawdowns of aqi and aqii were fixed at 8 m 2 3 2 field measurements of groundwater level and settlement fig 7 presents the development of groundwater levels in the observation wells and settlements at the monitoring points during the seven steps of the pumping tests note that the lines in fig 7 represent the drawdown and settlement values calculated by the fem which will be introduced in section 3 2 in the first step the water level of aqi decreased rapidly correspondingly the measured settlement at the ground surface and in the deep soil layers showed a similar trend as the pumping rate decreased both the water level and settlement slightly recovered before the fourth step the water levels in some observation wells p2 1 p2 2 and p2 3 had nearly returned to the original levels however the ground surface settlement and layered settlement e g fccj2 3 had not rebounded a large unrecoverable residual deformation in the sandy layer existed after water level recovery from withdrawal zhang et al 2017 the groundwater level of aq0 decreased slightly during w2 pumping indicating a slight hydraulic connection between aq0 and aqi meanwhile the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard between aqi and aqii was relatively low during the entire test process for settlement both cases cases 1 and 2 reported above indicated that after a period of dewatering the soil deformation could not be recovered even if the water level returned to the initial state to evaluate the control effect of ar the fem which was verified by the in situ pumping test of case 2 was adopted in the next section 3 introduction and verification of numerical model 3 1 general numerical model in this study to investigate the mechanism of ground settlement during the pumping and recharge processes the fem software abaqus abaqus 6 11 2011 was used to conduct simulations the hydraulic physical and mechanical parameters of the soil layers in field test 2 were employed in the numerical simulation of this study as listed in fig 6 the soil in the numerical model divided into 8 layers was extended to a depth of 80 m the modified cam clay model was used to model the soil the parameters m λ and κ were obtained by laboratory tests the solid 8 node trilinear displacement and pore pressure elements were adopted in this simulation to consider the soil fluid coupling a sufficiently large calculation range should be used to minimize the boundary effect in the calculation zeng et al 2018 for practical purposes the approximation of the radius of influence is mainly based on empirical formulas which are based on the permeability coefficient or drawdown at the pumping well and observation wells considering the well losses and wellbore clogging a result based on the permeability coefficient such as sichardt s formula zheng et al 2014 is not desirable in this study a graphical method was employed to identify the influence radius of the well the drawdowns in observation wells at different distances r from the pumping well are marked on a semilog chart in fig 8 the intersection point of the curve and the x axis is considered the influence radius as shown in fig 8 the influence radii in the aqi and aqii pumping tests are 448 m and 143 m respectively therefore the dimension of the model was determined to be 1200 m 1200 m the soil was normally consolidated and the coefficient of the lateral earth pressure was derived using jaky s equation the soil parameters used in the simulation are shown in fig 6 the mesh in the pumping and observation well area was refined with a size of 1 m 1 m in plane view enlarging toward the edges of the model shen et al 2015 generally there are three methods that can be used to simulate the dewatering process zheng et al 2014 1 specify a pumping velocity on the water crossing surface wcs 2 set a zero pore water pressure boundary on the wcs or 3 set the drainage only flow dof boundary on the wcs in this study because all pumping tests are constant rate tests the first method was adopted in the simulation 3 2 verification of the numerical model based on field test 2 to verify the numerical model the tests of steps 1 6 in field test 2 were simulated the simulation procedures were the same as those given in table 1 in fig 7 the calculated drawdowns in the observation wells and the calculated layered settlement in steps 1 6 are presented along with the observed results in this figure the calculated drawdowns matched well with the measured results for most of the observation wells in all the aquifers aq0 aqi and aqii the observed and calculated layered settlement followed the same trend and had similar magnitudes during pumping and recovery thus the numerical model was verified to be capable of analyzing the response of groundwater level and ground deformation to the multicycle pumping recovery process in the confined aquifer as shown in fig 7 the settlement continuously increased in step 1 and the maximum settlement approached approximately 7 mm as the pumping rate decreased during steps 2 and 3 there was slight rebound in the measured and calculated settlement generally based on the calculated and measured results after water level recovery from a period of dewatering a considerable proportion of settlement could not recover in addition at the end of steps 2 and 5 the maximum vertical deformation occurred at a depth of 12 m close to the top of aqi rather than at the ground surface as shown in fig 9 this phenomenon can be mainly attributed to the soil arch effect induced by the differential deformation in the soil stratum its mechanism will be discussed in section 4 4 4 analysis of the numerical results in this section to study the settlement control effect of different recharge schemes a series of numerical simulations were conducted using the verified fem based on the analysis in section 2 1 aqii was primarily investigated in this study for relief wells and recharge wells the fluid flow rate along the well screen can be assumed to be uniform in the constant rate test jin et al 2005 the simulation of the recharge wells was similar to that of the pressure relief well described above but the flow velocity was negative the rate of pumping and recharge was assumed to be constant and recharge clogging was not considered pumping and recharge rates were both set to 223 m3 d which was the same as that of the large scale pumping test of aqii in field test 2 the planned layout of recharge wells pressure relief wells and a monitoring point are shown in fig 10 in practical excavation recharge wells were mainly used to protect nearby buildings therefore in this study recharge wells were located between relief wells and monitoring point s1 which represents the location of the protected building changes in the water head and soil deformation at s1 during the simulation were recorded and investigated for comparison 5 cases were simulated using the fem i e recharge first cases 1 and 2 simultaneous pressure relief and recharge case 3 and pressure relief first cases 4 and 5 as listed in table 2 4 1 comparison of the settlements the variation curves of the drawdown and ground settlement at s1 during the simulation processes in different cases are shown in fig 11 for each case the seepage fields approached steady state approximately 3 days after the relief well or recharge wells were opened additionally the drawdowns in different cases tended to be approximately equal after day 13 limited by the permeability of the overlying and underlying aquitards the development of ground settlement was considerably slower than the drawdown speed of the confined aquifer as shown in fig 11 the final settlements in cases 1 2 and 3 were similar in cases 1 and 2 the ground settlement rebounded at first then after the relief wells opened the ground settlement showed a similar trend with the variation in water level and nearly returned to the initial state in case 3 because the water level remained approximately constant from the beginning of the simulation the ground surface also shows a similar trend in cases 4 and 5 the settlement increased rapidly after dewatering began after the recharge wells opened the displacement direction of the ground surface shifted upward however the ground settlement could not recover to the initial state the final settlements after day 15 in different cases indicate that the opening sequence of the ar and relief wells have a significant influence on the control effectiveness of the settlement fig 12 presents the vertical deformation of the strata at settlement monitoring point s1 for different cases the settlement caused by the pressure relief of aqii mainly included the compressive deformation of aqii and the consolidation deformation of the overlying aquitard oa layers above oa generally moved upward or downward following the movement of oa the compressive deformation of aqii mainly caused the differences in the ground settlements among the different cases overall based on the calculated results the pressure relief first scheme caused the largest surface settlement and the ground surface settlement increased with the duration of dewatering before recharge therefore the recharge scheme in case 3 i e simultaneous pressure relief and recharge should be recommended when considering settlement control and water conservation 4 2 analysis of soil stress and strain state the previous section discussed the influence of the opening timing of the recharge wells on the ground settlement in this section changes in the stress strain state in different cases will be analyzed to introduce the influence mechanism of the opening timing of the recharge on the ground settlement 4 2 1 recharge first cases fig 13 presents the development of the vertical displacement additional stress and pore pressure increment of the soil in case 2 when only the recharge wells were operating the pore pressure of the recharged aquifer increased and then the additional vertical stress was reduced due to the increased pore pressure oa and the underlying aquitard ua were recharged from aqii and they were also subjected to additional tensile stress which was similar to that of the aquifer aqii the movement direction of the soil above the bottom of ua was upward but the maximum upward displacement of the soil was located at the middle of oa rather than at the ground surface after 5 days of recharging with the combined action of soil arching and pore pressure dissipation the additional stress at the maximum displacement location mdl was approximately 0 kpa the soil below the mdl and above the bottom of ua experienced vertical tensile strain the arching effect is investigated in section 4 4 after the relief wells were turned on the pore pressure in aqii was first dropped and then stabilized after 5 days limited by the consolidation rate the pore pressure dissipation in oa and ua occurred over a long period as shown in fig 13 the excess pore pressure in oa and ua caused by the recharge still had not entirely dissipated 5 days after the relief wells were turned on following the variation in pore pressure the additional vertical stress in the soil below the mdl and above the bottom of ua increased and the soil was compressed correspondingly as the pore pressure dissipated the compressive deformation increases rapidly and then nearly stopped within 5 days therefore the soil above the bottom of ua moved downward and the upheaving of the ground surface was reduced to a very small movement additionally because the recharge wells were located between the relief wells and monitoring point s1 the water level at s1 was still higher than the initial level after the relief wells were turned on therefore the stress state of aqii at s1 was still tensile and the ground surface still had a small upheaval deformation 4 2 2 simultaneous pressure relief and recharge case fig 14 presents the development of the vertical displacement additional stress and pore pressure of the soil in case 3 because the relief wells and recharge wells were opened simultaneously the variation in the pore pressure was small from the beginning of this case unlike with the recharge first case because the pumping rate was equal to the recharge rate and the location of s1 the total effect at point s1 was recharge therefore the pore pressures in aqii oa and ua all increased thus the effective stresses decreased and the soil rebounded the development of deformation in aqii was fast and nearly did not change after the first half day due to the limited change in the additional stress caused by the pore pressure variation and the arching effect the vertical displacements at the ground surface and in the deep soil were relatively small as with cases 1 and 2 the maximum displacement was located at the middle of oa and vertical tensile strain occurred in the upper soil layer due to soil arching 4 2 3 pressure relief first cases fig 15 presents the development of the vertical displacement additional stress and pore pressure of the soil in case 4 after 5 days of pumping the pore pressure in aqii oa and ua decreased and the maximum settlement 9 5 mm occurred in oa simultaneously the ground surface settlement reached 8 6 mm when recharge began the pore pressure in aqii and oa increased thus their effective stresses decreased as shown in fig 15 after 10 days of recharge the maximum settlement decreased to 6 9 mm the majority of the rebound of the ground surface was induced by that of aqii 2 2 mm only a small portion of the compressive deformation of oa could be recovered when the effective stress was reduced based on the calculation results for the above five cases when the pore pressure of the confined aquifer decreased oa and ua experienced compressive deformation due to the discharge of water due to the soil arching the upper soil layers experienced vertical tensile deformation thus the maximum settlement in the soil was located at the middle of oa the deformation modes of these soil layers reversed when the pore pressure of the confined aquifer increased additionally although the final drawdowns in the different cases were similar the changing paths of the pore pressures were different thus the stress strain paths of the soil were different because the deformation of the soil is path dependent different stress strain paths cause different soil settlements 4 3 stress strain paths of the aquitards in this section the stress strain paths of oa in different cases are analyzed a soil element was adopted for the analysis and the comparative results of the stress strain path of the soil element are shown in fig 16 fig 16 a shows the variation in vertical effective stress and horizontal effective stress for three cases in case 2 due to the recharging a b the vertical and horizontal effective stresses both decreased at first the decrease in the mean stress caused oa to rebound as shown in fig 16 b when the relief wells were turned on b c the pore pressure began to decrease then the mean stress increased which compressed the aquitard in the process of a b c the preload stress was the initial stress state a as the stress state returned to state c both the average main stress and the generalized shear stress almost returned to the initial state near state a a slight vertical tensile deformation was formed as shown in fig 16 b in case 3 a d the preload stress was also the initial stress the evolution of the stress strain path followed a similar manner as that in case 2 in the dewatering process a e of case 4 the increments of the vertical and horizontal effective stresses were positive the consolidation pressure in oa reached the maximum value at point e after the recharge wells turned on e f both the vertical and horizontal effective stress decreased therefore the soil in oa became overconsolidated at point f the vertical effective stress in case 4 was the same as that in cases 2 point c and 3 point d however the horizontal effective stress could not fully recover to the initial state and was much greater than that in cases 2 and 3 therefore the coefficient of lateral pressure k f of the soil at the final state in case 4 point f was greater than that at the final state in cases 2 k c and 3 k d and was also greater than at the initial state k a at point a as shown in fig 16 b the final mean stress in case 4 was much greater than the mean stress in cases 2 and 3 approximately δ p b greater the final vertical strain in case 4 was larger than the vertical strain in cases 2 and 3 by approximately δ ε a δ ε b there were two main reasons for the difference between the settlements in cases 4 and 3 or case 2 as detailed below 1 the difference in the compressive strain δ ε a occurred because the loading and unloading moduli were different the loading modulus was considerably lower than the unloading modulus 2 because the horizontal strain of the aquitard was nearly 0 the difference in the compressive strain δ ε b was equal to the difference in the volumetric strain which was caused by the difference in the mean pressure δ p b as discussed in the third paragraph of this section 4 4 soil arching as discussed in the case study in section 2 and the numerical results in section 4 2 the largest settlement or uplift mdl occur approximately in the middle of oa rather than at the ground surface when the head in aqii decreased the aquifer ua and lower part of oa subsided and experienced vertical compressive deformation however the upper soil above the mdl exhibited vertical tensile deformation an inverse deformation occurred when the head in aqii increased this phenomenon can be explained by the vertical arching effect moradi and abbasnejad 2015 to easily determine the stress transfer mechanism lee et al 2006 zheng et al 2015 the vertical arching ratio can be defined as follows 1 r z δ σ z σ z 100 where δ σ z is the change in the effective vertical stress and σ z is the initial vertical effective stress before the test in this study the vertical arching ratio was used to describe the arching behavior of the upper soil as shown in fig 17 in cross section a a see fig 10 for location when the relief wells were in operation a vertical soil arching formed in the upper soil layer due to the differential settlement of the underlying soil layers the arching zone can be divided into two zones a tensile zone with negative rz and a compressive zone with positive rz in the tensile zone the downward displacement at the top of the upper soil was smaller than the downward displacement at the bottom of the upper soil therefore the maximum downward displacement occurred at the bottom of the upper soil in contrast in the compressive zone the maximum vertical downward displacement occurred at the ground surface as shown in fig 18 in cross section b b see fig 10 for location when the recharge wells were in operation the displacement of aqii and oa was upward in contrast to the above case a vertical soil arching formed due to differential heave the arching zone can also be divided into two zones a compressive zone with positive rz and a tensile zone with negative rz however these two zones have different positions compared with those in fig 17 in the compressive zone the maximum upward displacement occurred at the bottom of the upper soil in the tensile zone the maximum upward displacement occurred at the ground surface in addition due to the different magnitudes of deformation caused by pumping and recharging the tensile zone in fig 17 has a different magnitude than that of the compressive zone in fig 18 5 conclusions in this study two field tests were studied indicating that after long term dewatering a large amount of settlement could not be recovered even if the recharge recovered the groundwater level a 3 dimensional soil fluid coupling model was used to investigate the mechanism of ar in the control of the settlement induced by the pressure relief of the confined aquifer the influence of the opening sequence of the recharge and the pressure relief on the recharge effectiveness and the vertical displacement distribution in the deep soil were primarily examined the following conclusions were drawn from the simulation results 1 limited by the permeability of oa and ua the development of the ground settlement was considerably slower than the speed of the drawdown of the confined aquifer the opening sequence of the recharge wells and relief wells did not considerably affect the final steady drawdown but significantly influenced ground settlement 2 compared to the pressure relief first schemes the simultaneous pressure relief and recharge and recharge first schemes can more effectively control the settlement induced by the pressure relief of the confined aquifer the pressure relief first scheme caused the largest settlement and the settlement increased with the duration of pressure relief before ar the recharge first scheme wastefully and unnecessarily consumes more water resources therefore recharge should begin at the same time as the pressure relief when the surrounding environment must be strictly controlled 3 the settlement differences in different schemes were caused by the different compressive deformations of oa there were two reasons why the compressive deformation was largest in the pressure relief first scheme first the unloading modulus of oa was considerably greater than the compressive modulus the majority of the compressive deformation of oa that occurred before the recharge process cannot be recovered second the final mean pressure of the oa soil in this scheme was greater than the final mean pressure in other schemes because the soil was overconsolidated and had a larger lateral pressure coefficient 4 the differential settlement or heave in the soil at different distances from the wells could induce soil arching in the upper soil layer above oa the soil arching in the upper soil can be divided into two zones namely the compressive zone and the tensile zone in the case of pressure relief in the confined aquifer the tensile zone was close to the relief well and the maximum settlement in this zone occurred at the bottom of the upper soil in the compressive zone the maximum settlement occurred at the ground surface the above phenomenon is reversed in the case of recharge declaration of interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key r d program of china grant no 2017yfc0805407 the national

6532,river flows exert dominant controls on in stream biota quantifying linkages between hydrology and biology is important for assessing the effects of flow alteration on ecological functions hydrologic models are often used to quantify these flow ecology relationships and guide management actions traditional model calibration techniques typically focus on a best overall fit criterion that may not be suitable for environmental flow applications where certain elements of the flow regime exert a dominant influence on biotic composition we present an approach for hydrologic model calibration that improves the accuracy of calculated flow metrics known to be significant drivers of ecosystem response first we developed regional flow ecology relationships based on streamflow gage and benthic macroinvertebrate data from southern california to determine which streamflow metrics best explain variability in taxonomic and trait based biotic indices next we developed and calibrated a series of hydrologic models to minimize error in these important flow metrics for our study sites flow flashiness and low flow frequency indicative of drying were found to best explain biotic condition hydrologic models calibrated specifically to minimize errors in these flow metrics predicted macroinvertebrate indices better than models calibrated to maximize fit to the overall flow regime this ecological calibration approach requires some a priori knowledge of flow ecology relationships but it produces results that can improve assessment of the impacts of changing flow regimes on biota and guide the development of strategies to mitigate ecological degradation keywords environmental flows hydrologic modeling flow ecology benthic macroinvertebrates 1 introduction hydrologic alteration of streams is widespread poff et al 2007 1997 walsh et al 2005 often with negative impacts on aquatic and riparian biota bunn and arthington 2002 jacobson et al 2001 konrad and booth 2005 poff et al 2006a these biota are adapted to naturally variable flow regimes poff et al 1997 and alterations to these natural flows from land use change water use dams etc damage stream ecosystems urbanization in particular can result in decreased biodiversity and lost or replaced species paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 as well as diminished ecosystem goods and services arthington et al 2006 quantifying relationships between stream and riparian biota and river flow regimes is essential for proper management one such application is through the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha framework a guide for the development of ecological flow management objectives to support vibrant stream ecosystems poff et al 2010 the eloha framework has been applied across the u s buchanan et al 2013 mcmanamay et al 2013 including southern california mazor et al 2018 sengupta et al 2018 stein et al 2017 in order to evaluate flow ecology relationships including potential consequences of flow alteration regional hydrologic metrics must first be quantified usually using hydrologic modeling hydrologic models are powerful tools that simulate rainfall runoff processes to generate a time series of streamflow given a set of precipitation inputs and watershed properties these models are useful tools for environmental flow analyses for a number of reasons first stream gaging sites are rare worldwide and are not well distributed even in the u s poff et al 2006a hydrologic models on the other hand can produce simulated streamflow at any point on a stream at a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions furthermore these models can be used to estimate historic or pre development hydrographs and simulate future conditions under a variety of management scenarios e g stein et al 2017 hydrologic models however must be calibrated to existing streamflow data since not all model parameters can be calculated directly this is typically done using a best overall fit performance measure such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 these general performance measures however are biased towards large flows can disregard flow timing and show residual autocorrelation beven 2012 bloschl et al 2013 these weaknesses make hydrologic models particularly problematic for accurately capturing biologically relevant flow metrics that may include measures of timing or duration during non storm periods e g seven day minimum flow cassin et al 2005 vis et al 2015 calibrating hydrologic models to accurately simulate the parts of the flow regime that are biologically important can improve the utility of these models for ecological flow modeling cassin et al 2005 murphy et al 2013 sengupta et al 2018 we explore this approach by comparing hydrologic models calibrated to biologically relevant flow criteria to models calibrated to maximize overall best fit nse using regional monitoring data from southern california southern california was chosen for this study for several reasons first there are abundant biomonitoring data california surface water ambient monitoring program and southern california stormwater monitoring coalition regional monitoring program second the region has undergone rapid urbanization leading to significant hydromodification stein et al 2012 and development will likely continue with projected population growth of 33 by 2060 ca department of finance 2014 this rapid urbanization has been shown to significantly increase the magnitude and duration of geomorphically effective flows in coastal southern california streams hawley and bledsoe 2011 with associated degradation of aquatic habitat hawley et al 2012 understanding the effects of urbanization on stream biology in this region and developing tools to help manage these effects is vitally important the objectives of this study were three fold 1 develop flow ecology relationships using benthic macroinvertebrate biomonitoring data and usgs gage data to determine which flow metrics best describe biological condition of southern california streams 2 determine how accurately hydrologic models can be calibrated to meet these pertinent flow regime metrics compared to more traditional best overall fit criteria 3 compare how well model derived flow metrics explain macroinvertebrate condition in southern california streams compared to gage derived flow metrics 2 methods 2 1 study area we used biomonitoring data from 32 sites and flow data from 23 usgs gages in southern california fig 1 study sites range in elevation from 6 to 1120 m above sea level and range in watershed size from 21 to 1877 km2 table 1 this portion of southern california has a mediterranean climate with mild wet winters characterized by frontal storms and hot dry summers often punctuated by wildfires vegetation is predominately sage brush chaparral and conifer forests stein et al 2012 streams included in this study range from seasonally intermittent to fully perennial mean annual flow over periods of record 0 05 2 0 m3 s and are influenced by varying levels of urbanization 0 27 impervious fry et al 2011 streams vary from minimally impacted by contemporary human land uses to engineered stormwater channels that are fully encased concrete we chose to include a variety of stream types and degree of human alteration to test the robustness of our approach under a range of conditions where environmental flow analyses are conducted 2 2 developing flow ecology relationships 2 2 1 matching biomonitoring data to streamflow data we used benthic macroinvertebrate bmi data collected between 1997 and 2011 to investigate flow ecology relationships at sites spanning a range of land uses and elevation bmi samples were collected as part of the california surface water ambient monitoring program swamp and the southern california stormwater monitoring coalition smc regional monitoring program using the programs standard protocols ode 2007 protocols consist of a standard d frame kick net survey using a multi habitat assessment of the instream benthic community along eleven transects covering a 250 m reach of stream bmi are composited and subsampled to 500 count and converted to standard taxonomic effort levels generally genus level identifications except chironomidae which are identified to subfamily richards and rogers 2011 the resultant taxa list and associated abundances are used to calculate the southern california index of biotic integrity see section 2 2 3 biomonitoring sites were matched to nearby usgs streamflow gages with instantaneous flow data such that flow at the stream gage was representative of flow at the biomonitoring site matched sites were required to have differences in watershed area 15 flow data available during the biomonitoring sampling date and no intervening dams diversions or reservoirs multiple biomonitoring sites were matched to the same usgs gage but the converse was not allowed in the end 32 biomonitoring sites were matched to 18 usgs gages fig 1 tables 1 and 2 2 2 2 flow metrics we calculated flow metrics describing flashiness stream drying peak and average conditions as well as timing of peak events table 3 the richards baker flashiness index baker et al 2004 was used rbi t 1 t q t 1 q t t 1 t q t where q is discharge t is the time step and t is the maximum number of time steps higher values of rbi indicate greater flashiness more rapid changes in discharge while smaller values indicate more stable hydrographs unit discharge q discharge divided by bankfull width was used for peak and mean flow metrics to normalize values by stream width and account for differences in stream size timing of peak flow was assigned a day of the water year using the index of hydrologic alteration iha circular method richter et al 1996 sites were divided by flow type perennial or non perennial and bed type sand or gravel to account for the effects of flow permanence and bed substrate on flow ecology relationships non perennial streams were defined as those that lack surface flow for at least several days per year in most years mazor et al 2014 we defined non perennial streams as those that had at least one day of zero flow in 50 or more of the years in the available long term flow record sand bed and gravel bed sites were those with d 50 9 mm and d 50 9 mm respectively this threshold was chosen by examining grain size distributions and shear stresses to differentiate between easily mobilized beds sand versus threshold type channels gravel flow metrics were calculated using daily streamflow data using a flow record from 3 years prior to biological sampling flow metrics from 15 min data and using the entire flow record were also calculated flow metrics from these different data sources were highly correlated we therefore used daily 3 year data because it was the smallest amount of data that accurately represented conditions experienced by stream biota while accounting for interannual variability 2 2 3 biotic indices a set of taxonomic and traits based biotic indices were calculated from the biomonitoring data traits were assigned to macroinvertebrate taxa using a database developed for north american insects poff et al 2006b and based on literature review and expert judgment boris kondratieff leroy poff and matt pyne pers comm these traits based indices can provide insight into the causal relationships between benthic macroinvertebrates and stream environments that general taxonomic indices may miss mcgill et al 2006 poff et al 2006b reach wide sampling results were used from all sites except for seven sites where no sampling method was recorded a regional specific index of biotic integrity southern california index of biotic integrity sc ibi was also calculated for each site ode et al 2005 although the sc ibi has been replaced by the california stream condition index csci we used the sc ibi because it was in use when the macroinvertebrate data were collected and initial analyses were performed biotic indices were reduced to a set of eight using correlation analysis principle component analysis literature review and expert judgment table 4 2 2 4 statistical analysis we used two different statistical tools to determine which hydrologic metrics were most strongly associated with biotic indices spearman s non parametric rank based correlation and redundancy analysis rda rda was performed using the vegan r package oksanen 2013 r core team 2018 on metrics from the full set of sites as well as perennial non perennial sand bed and gravel bed subsets iterative rda was used to identify a reduced set of flow metrics that explained the most variance in biotic indices for the full dataset and each subset 2 3 hydrologic modeling for each usgs gage location rainfall runoff models were created using hec hms version 4 0 hydrologic engineering center 2013 hec hms was chosen because it is a physically based model that is commonly used in stormwater planning and watershed studies to simulate rainfall runoff processes these rainfall runoff models produced hourly discharge time series which were compared to hourly gage data for model calibration we calibrated these models for a 3 year time period water years wy 2005 2007 this time period was chosen because it is long enough to describe biotic condition had sufficient streamflow and precipitation data and includes a wet average and dry year we did not develop hydrologic models for four usgs gage sites with insufficient flow data over the model period this also removed seven matched biomonitoring sites from the analysis leaving a total of 25 biomonitoring sites table 1 we added five additional usgs gages but with no matching biomonitoring data increasing the total number of modeled watersheds to 19 fig 1 table 2 2 3 1 hec hms model inputs the watershed of each of the 19 streamflow gages was delineated in arcgis 10 1 using the national elevation dataset 10 m digital elevation model dem gesch et al 2002 percent imperviousness was computed using 2006 national land cover database nlcd data fry et al 2011 the simple canopy simple surface and deficit and constant loss methods were used to simulate rainfall losses we used the clark unit hydrograph method for surface runoff and the linear reservoir method for baseflow time of

system monitoring station closest to each usgs gage location cimis 2015 an evaporation coefficient of 0 77 calculated at nearby lake elsinore was used for all models chow et al 1988 precipitation data were obtained from a variety of sources noaa national climate data center cimis california data exchange center san diego county flood control district and ventura county watershed protection district the number of precipitation gauges used per watershed ranged from 3 to 23 inverse distance weighting based on the centroid of each basin was used to weight all the precipitation gauges within each model we neglected snowmelt processes due to the coastal southern california climate and the lack of high elevation sites in this study 2 3 2 calibration of rainfall runoff models thirteen model parameters table s1 were manually calibrated to reduce error between modeled and observed streamflow gage data the developed flow ecology relationships suggested that flow flashiness and low flow frequency were both important predictors of biological condition in southern california streams see results below others have also shown that these variables are ecologically important booth et al 2004 kennen et al 2010 and that low flows have been unnaturally inflated in southern california zimmerman et al 2018 furthermore low flows and flashiness are typically not well captured by models calibrated to the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse vis et al 2015 based on these results we chose two ecologically based flow metrics to use for hydrologic model calibration rbi and percent of time with flow 1 cubic feet per second 1 cfs 1 cfs 0 028 m3 s all hydrologic models were calibrated to four separate targets 1 maximize the nse 2 minimize the error of the rbi rbi 3 minimize the error of the percent of time flow is 1 cfs 1 cfs and 4 minimize the average error of 1 cfs and rbi combined calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency ranges from worst to 1 best and is calculated as nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse 1 t 1 t q o t q m t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q o is the mean of observed discharges q m t is modeled discharge at time t q o t is observed discharge at time t and t is the final time step percent error ranges from 0 best to worst and is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between observed and modeled values divided by the observed value 2 3 3 flow metrics we calculated index of hydrologic alteration iha flow metrics for all modeled time series of streamflow to compare with metrics from gage data the purpose of incorporating these additional metrics was to better assess the ability of the ecologically calibrated hydrologic models to accurately predict ecological flow metrics that were not used directly in the calibration i e rbi and 1 cfs iha 7 1 richter et al 1996 was used to compute descriptive environmental flow metrics based on aggregated daily modeled streamflow from hec hms although recent work has proposed new flow metrics which may be better descriptors of biological condition archfield and kennen 2013 carlisle et al 2017 eng et al 2017 we chose iha metrics because of their long history ease of calculation and similarity with the hydrologic metrics used in developing the flow ecology relationships for model calibration nse rbi and the 1 cfs metrics were calculated using hourly flows the model time step but we aggregated the model output to daily flows when calculating iha metrics all hydrologic metrics were also calculated for usgs streamflow gage data from the calibration period wy 2005 2007 and from the three year period antecedent to bioassessment sampling descriptions of selected iha and hourly flow metrics are provided in table 5 2 3 4 statistical analyses biotic indices table 4 were used to compare how flow metrics generated by the four calibration approaches explain biological variation relative to gage data only 14 of the 19 calibrated models were used for these analyses due to the absence of bioassessment data at five sites only iha flow metrics that were significantly correlated p 0 1 between the three year antecedent gage data and biotic indices were used in further analyses multiple regression analysis was then used to find the subset of modeled flow metrics that best predicted each biotic index based on minimum aic selection akaike 1971 all multiple regression models were tested to ensure assumptions were met i e normality of residuals linearity of response and homoscedasticity 3 results 3 1 flow ecology relationships flashiness and low flow flow permanence metrics best described benthic macroinvertebrate data iterative rda analyses indicate flashiness rbi was important for all sites and for subsets of both flow types and gravel bed sites fig 2 b d f in general higher flashiness was associated with more resistant macroinvertebrates those with disturbance related traits duration zero and monthly flows mean february and september flows also explained significant variability in biotic indices low flow metrics duration zero and 1 cfs had the largest number of significant correlations with biotic indices fig 3 these metrics were positively correlated with disturbance desiccation resistance traits and negatively correlated with amphipod and noninsect abundance mean september flows showed essentially the opposite correlations as low flow metrics flashiness was not significantly correlated with many biotic metrics but showed a strong negative relationship with shredder abundance based on the results of the rda and correlation analyses we chose to use flashiness rbi and low flow 1 cfs as targets for hydrologic model calibration although duration zero was another significant low flow metric we chose to use 1 cfs as a threshold to capture effectively dry streams where there might be some residual measured gage or modeled hec hms flow 3 2 hydrologic modeling lowest model calibration errors 2 were achieved when rbi and or 1 cfs was the calibration target fig 4 unsurprisingly rbi and 1 cfs metrics were not accurately quantified in models that were calibrated to other targets e g rbi error was high in the nse and 1 cfs calibration in the combined calibration both rbi and 1 cfs median errors were less than one percent median nse were 0 3 or higher indicating better overall fit for all calibrations except the combined calibration importantly targeting the calibration to nse resulted in high errors in both rbi and 1 cfs we expect low error for metrics that were the target of calibration therefore we also quantified error in an independent set of hydrologic metrics iha generally the combined calibration had the worst overall error in predicting iha flow metrics table s2 however it had the lowest error median 19 2 in replicating low flow metrics this calibration also had high error in daily iha flashiness metrics although it predicted hourly rbi well median 4 6 error results for multiple regression models indicate that model derived hydrologic metrics can explain significant variation in biotic indices of the hydrologic models the combined calibration consistently performs near the top and has the highest mean r2 fig 5 for all multiple regression models and the combined calibration models in particular the three most common significant predictors are rbi 1 cfs and extreme low flow timing fig s1 we expected the antecedent gage data to provide the best results since this is representative of the most recent hydrology the stream and macroinvertebrates have experienced in many cases however modeled flows or wy 2005 2007 gage data yield the same or better regression model performance 4 discussion 4 1 ecologically focused hydrologic modeling better explains biotic variability hydrologic models calibrated to reduce error in both flashiness rbi and low flow frequency indicative of drying 1 cfs produce the best metrics for explaining variation in biotic indices fig 5 the success of this combined calibration approach is encouraging for ecological flow applications models based on this targeted calibration accurately replicated the hydrologic metrics that were shown in the flow ecology analysis to be most important in predicting biotic indices the combined calibration models did not meet traditional standards of success they had poor nse scores and failed to accurately predict a wide range of iha metrics table s2 however the ultimate aim of ecologically focused modeling is to accurately predict the elements of the flow regime that are most influential on biological communities kendy et al 2012 poff et al 2010 and in this these models succeeded other studies in arid regions have also found that flow stability and the duration of low flows were significant controls on macroinvertebrate populations belmar et al 2013 chinnayakanahalli et al 2011 on the other hand mazor et al 2018 found that high flow metrics in addition to flashiness were important predictors of biological integrity in southern california the high flow metrics used in their study represented mean magnitude and duration of high flows which may be more biologically relevant than the peak flows reflected by nse and the iha metrics used in our study 4 2 guidelines for calibrating hydrologic models hydrologic models can never perfectly replicate all hydrologic processes and tradeoffs must be made to prioritize the accuracy of flow regime elements most critical for specific model applications previous research has found that best overall fit criteria including nse are not always the best calibration criteria for hydrologic models beven 2012 cassin et al 2005 jain and sudheer 2008 and may specifically result in poor estimates of ecologically relevant flow metrics vis et al 2015 our results similarly show that calibrating hydrologic models to the nse reduces the ability of modeled flow metrics to explain variance in biological indices in southern california streams calibrating to ecologically relevant targets e g rbi and 1 cfs does not require more effort than calibrating to nse but they provide much more useful results the combined calibration approach was superior to both the rbi and 1 cfs calibrations alone in predicting biotic indices suggesting that multiple criteria should be used simultaneously in hydrologic model calibration others have recommended multiple calibration criteria both generally beven 2012 gupta et al 2008 and specifically for ecological flow studies murphy et al 2013 vis et al 2015 since our combined calibration approach was targeted to flashiness and low flow frequency it is unsurprising that we did not simulate other aspects of the flow regime e g peak flows as accurately a recent ecological flow model calibration used a sequential calibration approach minimizing errors in flashiness and low flow frequency while keeping nse 0 4 sengupta et al 2018 their models tended to predict high flows better than our models suggesting that pairing ecological flow calibration i e minimizing error in flashiness and low flows with overall fit criteria nse may be a better approach for predicting a wide variety of flow metrics the hydrologic models were all calibrated to the same three years of flow data wy 2005 2007 regardless of when the nearby biomonitoring sites were sampled interestingly flow metrics from these gage data and models were often better predictors of biotic indices than the 3 year period directly prior to the biological sampling date wy 2005 2007 were purposefully chosen because they represented wetter than average average and drier than average years it appears that in southern california at least a period of flow that is representative of long term climate in the region is sufficient to explain macroinvertebrate assemblages if this trend holds in other regions it could allow the development or application of flow ecology relationships to areas where flow data around a specific sampling date are not available as long as representative flow data can be obtained 4 3 southern california flow ecology relationships our results suggest that flashiness rbi and frequency of low flows flow permanence e g duration zero and 1 cfs are significant and largely independent predictors of variance in biotic indices in southern california streams these metrics tend to be positively correlated with disturbance related biotic indices e g desiccation and disturbance resistance but negatively correlated with the presence of sensitive taxa ept this suggests that flashiness and low flows tend to lead to more robust and resilient macroinvertebrates while more stable flow regimes favor sensitive species belmar et al 2013 booth et al 2004 others have found that low flows can significantly affect the abundance and type of stream macroinvertebrates bonada et al 2007 kennen et al 2010 and that biotic integrity indices decrease with increasing flashiness degasperi et al 2009 differences in flow metrics across sites are likely driven by watershed land use in our study watersheds flashiness increases with urbanization while low flow frequency 1 cfs decreases fig s2 meanwhile sensitive taxa ept and overall biotic integrity sc ibi also decrease with watershed urbanization but trait based resilience metrics disturbance resilience desiccation resistance etc show little change fig s3 this is likely because urbanization is increasing flow permanence which makes disturbance and desiccation resistant traits less advantageous and increasing flashiness which can reduce the prevalence of sensitive taxa for our study streams however flashiness from daily flow data was not significantly correlated with either ept or sc ibi although rbi was important overall in predicting biotic condition in the redundancy analysis this is possibly because the study streams were all naturally flashy median daily rbi 0 64 max 0 92 or because of the daily time step used in developing the hydrologic metrics naturally flashy streams in north carolina also showed that flashiness was not a good predictor of ept richness or benthic index of biotic integrity b ibi pomeroy 2007 in more inherently stable puget lowlands streams however increased flashiness did lead to a significant decrease in b ibi booth et al 2004 these trends reinforce the fact that local climate is a major control on stream biota and hydromodification can result in different biotic responses in different regions this could also indicate that in our study streams increased flashiness from urbanization may have a smaller effect on ept and sc ibi than other side effects of urbanization e g pollutants or temperature changes cuffney et al 2010 this underscores the need to develop models that resolve heterogeneity in land use effects on both flow flashiness and chemical pollution 4 4 management applications and future research we demonstrated that developing flow ecology relationships from biologic and flow data can guide the development of ecologically focused hydrologic models that better capture relevant parts of the flow regime than more traditional calibration approaches this has significant potential to guide environmental flow management especially within the eloha framework this ecological calibration approach can also be used to quantify relevant hydrologic metrics at ungaged sites application at ungaged sites requires robust model validation which may be difficult in areas without a sufficient number of gaged streams especially in smaller basins poff et al 2006a extending the ecological calibration approach to ungaged sites has already been used in southern california to develop an ensemble of hydrologic models sengupta et al 2018 that were used to guide ecological assessment and planning mazor et al 2018 stein et al 2017 these methods however can also be applied outside this region while recognizing that the same flow metrics found to be important here i e low flow frequency and flashiness may not be important elsewhere carlisle et al 2017 found that metrics describing high flows and flow homogeneity were the best predictors of biotic condition nationally but that the most important metrics varied among regions dominant flow regimes and biotic communities vary regionally poff 1996 and it is likely that the most ecologically important flow metrics and the best metrics for targeted hydrologic model calibration will vary regionally as well in addition to explaining biotic condition the selected flow metrics should also be able to be accurately modeled eng et al 2017 the results of the flow ecology relationship analyses underscore the importance of stratifying biomonitoring sites by flow regime perennial non perennial and bed type sand gravel as recommended by the eloha framework different flow metrics become important for each subset of data fig 2 indicating that geomorphology bed material type and dominant flow regime can significantly influence the type of biologic communities and their responses flow is generally considered a master variable that controls the geomorphology lane 1955 and ecology of streams poff et al 1997 power et al 1995 while this is true the way a given flow is expressed in a channel i e the hydraulics of the flow can differ between reaches anim et al 2018 and may be more representative of the stresses experienced by in stream biota for example a flood in a sinuous gravel bed stream results in very different hydraulic stress than the same flow in a straight incised sand bed stream others have found that hydraulic metrics describing bed mobility e g shear stress relative to the mobilization threshold for sand or gravel substrate are excellent predictors of macroinvertebrate indices cobb et al 1992 townsend et al 1997a and superior to flow metrics derived purely from discharge townsend et al 1997b our trait based disturbance metrics e g disturbance resilience may be especially useful for exploring mechanistic linkages between stream conditions and biota mcgill et al 2006 poff et al 2006b hydraulic metrics currently present some challenges for developing regional flow ecology relationships specifically hydraulic metrics rely on additional site specific data channel slope geometry roughness and grain size which may not be available at all sites and is subject to change as channels evolve in response to hydromodification hawley and bledsoe 2013 purely hydrologic metrics are simple to quantify across a large number of sites and can be computed directly from gage data or hydrologic model outputs but they only provide a coarse representation of the actual hydraulic environments experienced by benthic macroinvertebrates or other biota local site habitat conditions can significantly affect how flows are expressed poff et al 2010 and refined hydraulic and bed mobility metrics have significant potential for developing more mechanistic ecohydraulic biological relationships these in turn could enable ecologically focused calibration of linked rainfall runoff and hydraulic models to better quantify the impacts of flow regime alterations on in stream and riparian biota 5 conclusion we developed flow ecology relationships using macroinvertebrate and usgs gage data for southern california streams spanning a gradient of urbanization this analysis showed that flow flashiness richards baker index and frequency of low flows flow permanence days 1 cfs best explained variability in biotic indices we used these flow metrics as calibration targets in the development of hec hms hydrologic models for the region we compared models calibrated to these biologically relevant flow metrics with models more traditionally calibrated to a best overall fit criteria nse none of the models accurately reproduced all elements of the flow regime but models calibrated to minimize error in both rbi and 1 cfs produced flow metrics that explained the most variability in macroinvertebrate indices we showed that this ecologically focused calibration of hydrologic models is feasible and can be better suited for environmental flow applications than traditional calibration approaches which deemphasize the most biologically influential elements of the flow regime this approach can be applied outside of southern california noting that accurate predictions of other flow metrics will likely be important for describing biological response in other regions ecologically focused model calibration is especially useful for application within the

6532,river flows exert dominant controls on in stream biota quantifying linkages between hydrology and biology is important for assessing the effects of flow alteration on ecological functions hydrologic models are often used to quantify these flow ecology relationships and guide management actions traditional model calibration techniques typically focus on a best overall fit criterion that may not be suitable for environmental flow applications where certain elements of the flow regime exert a dominant influence on biotic composition we present an approach for hydrologic model calibration that improves the accuracy of calculated flow metrics known to be significant drivers of ecosystem response first we developed regional flow ecology relationships based on streamflow gage and benthic macroinvertebrate data from southern california to determine which streamflow metrics best explain variability in taxonomic and trait based biotic indices next we developed and calibrated a series of hydrologic models to minimize error in these important flow metrics for our study sites flow flashiness and low flow frequency indicative of drying were found to best explain biotic condition hydrologic models calibrated specifically to minimize errors in these flow metrics predicted macroinvertebrate indices better than models calibrated to maximize fit to the overall flow regime this ecological calibration approach requires some a priori knowledge of flow ecology relationships but it produces results that can improve assessment of the impacts of changing flow regimes on biota and guide the development of strategies to mitigate ecological degradation keywords environmental flows hydrologic modeling flow ecology benthic macroinvertebrates 1 introduction hydrologic alteration of streams is widespread poff et al 2007 1997 walsh et al 2005 often with negative impacts on aquatic and riparian biota bunn and arthington 2002 jacobson et al 2001 konrad and booth 2005 poff et al 2006a these biota are adapted to naturally variable flow regimes poff et al 1997 and alterations to these natural flows from land use change water use dams etc damage stream ecosystems urbanization in particular can result in decreased biodiversity and lost or replaced species paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 as well as diminished ecosystem goods and services arthington et al 2006 quantifying relationships between stream and riparian biota and river flow regimes is essential for proper management one such application is through the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha framework a guide for the development of ecological flow management objectives to support vibrant stream ecosystems poff et al 2010 the eloha framework has been applied across the u s buchanan et al 2013 mcmanamay et al 2013 including southern california mazor et al 2018 sengupta et al 2018 stein et al 2017 in order to evaluate flow ecology relationships including potential consequences of flow alteration regional hydrologic metrics must first be quantified usually using hydrologic modeling hydrologic models are powerful tools that simulate rainfall runoff processes to generate a time series of streamflow given a set of precipitation inputs and watershed properties these models are useful tools for environmental flow analyses for a number of reasons first stream gaging sites are rare worldwide and are not well distributed even in the u s poff et al 2006a hydrologic models on the other hand can produce simulated streamflow at any point on a stream at a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions furthermore these models can be used to estimate historic or pre development hydrographs and simulate future conditions under a variety of management scenarios e g stein et al 2017 hydrologic models however must be calibrated to existing streamflow data since not all model parameters can be calculated directly this is typically done using a best overall fit performance measure such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 these general performance measures however are biased towards large flows can disregard flow timing and show residual autocorrelation beven 2012 bloschl et al 2013 these weaknesses make hydrologic models particularly problematic for accurately capturing biologically relevant flow metrics that may include measures of timing or duration during non storm periods e g seven day minimum flow cassin et al 2005 vis et al 2015 calibrating hydrologic models to accurately simulate the parts of the flow regime that are biologically important can improve the utility of these models for ecological flow modeling cassin et al 2005 murphy et al 2013 sengupta et al 2018 we explore this approach by comparing hydrologic models calibrated to biologically relevant flow criteria to models calibrated to maximize overall best fit nse using regional monitoring data from southern california southern california was chosen for this study for several reasons first there are abundant biomonitoring data california surface water ambient monitoring program and southern california stormwater monitoring coalition regional monitoring program second the region has undergone rapid urbanization leading to significant hydromodification stein et al 2012 and development will likely continue with projected population growth of 33 by 2060 ca department of finance 2014 this rapid urbanization has been shown to significantly increase the magnitude and duration of geomorphically effective flows in coastal southern california streams hawley and bledsoe 2011 with associated degradation of aquatic habitat hawley et al 2012 understanding the effects of urbanization on stream biology in this region and developing tools to help manage these effects is vitally important the objectives of this study were three fold 1 develop flow ecology relationships using benthic macroinvertebrate biomonitoring data and usgs gage data to determine which flow metrics best describe biological condition of southern california streams 2 determine how accurately hydrologic models can be calibrated to meet these pertinent flow regime metrics compared to more traditional best overall fit criteria 3 compare how well model derived flow metrics explain macroinvertebrate condition in southern california streams compared to gage derived flow metrics 2 methods 2 1 study area we used biomonitoring data from 32 sites and flow data from 23 usgs gages in southern california fig 1 study sites range in elevation from 6 to 1120 m above sea level and range in watershed size from 21 to 1877 km2 table 1 this portion of southern california has a mediterranean climate with mild wet winters characterized by frontal storms and hot dry summers often punctuated by wildfires vegetation is predominately sage brush chaparral and conifer forests stein et al 2012 streams included in this study range from seasonally intermittent to fully perennial mean annual flow over periods of record 0 05 2 0 m3 s and are influenced by varying levels of urbanization 0 27 impervious fry et al 2011 streams vary from minimally impacted by contemporary human land uses to engineered stormwater channels that are fully encased concrete we chose to include a variety of stream types and degree of human alteration to test the robustness of our approach under a range of conditions where environmental flow analyses are conducted 2 2 developing flow ecology relationships 2 2 1 matching biomonitoring data to streamflow data we used benthic macroinvertebrate bmi data collected between 1997 and 2011 to investigate flow ecology relationships at sites spanning a range of land uses and elevation bmi samples were collected as part of the california surface water ambient monitoring program swamp and the southern california stormwater monitoring coalition smc regional monitoring program using the programs standard protocols ode 2007 protocols consist of a standard d frame kick net survey using a multi habitat assessment of the instream benthic community along eleven transects covering a 250 m reach of stream bmi are composited and subsampled to 500 count and converted to standard taxonomic effort levels generally genus level identifications except chironomidae which are identified to subfamily richards and rogers 2011 the resultant taxa list and associated abundances are used to calculate the southern california index of biotic integrity see section 2 2 3 biomonitoring sites were matched to nearby usgs streamflow gages with instantaneous flow data such that flow at the stream gage was representative of flow at the biomonitoring site matched sites were required to have differences in watershed area 15 flow data available during the biomonitoring sampling date and no intervening dams diversions or reservoirs multiple biomonitoring sites were matched to the same usgs gage but the converse was not allowed in the end 32 biomonitoring sites were matched to 18 usgs gages fig 1 tables 1 and 2 2 2 2 flow metrics we calculated flow metrics describing flashiness stream drying peak and average conditions as well as timing of peak events table 3 the richards baker flashiness index baker et al 2004 was used rbi t 1 t q t 1 q t t 1 t q t where q is discharge t is the time step and t is the maximum number of time steps higher values of rbi indicate greater flashiness more rapid changes in discharge while smaller values indicate more stable hydrographs unit discharge q discharge divided by bankfull width was used for peak and mean flow metrics to normalize values by stream width and account for differences in stream size timing of peak flow was assigned a day of the water year using the index of hydrologic alteration iha circular method richter et al 1996 sites were divided by flow type perennial or non perennial and bed type sand or gravel to account for the effects of flow permanence and bed substrate on flow ecology relationships non perennial streams were defined as those that lack surface flow for at least several days per year in most years mazor et al 2014 we defined non perennial streams as those that had at least one day of zero flow in 50 or more of the years in the available long term flow record sand bed and gravel bed sites were those with d 50 9 mm and d 50 9 mm respectively this threshold was chosen by examining grain size distributions and shear stresses to differentiate between easily mobilized beds sand versus threshold type channels gravel flow metrics were calculated using daily streamflow data using a flow record from 3 years prior to biological sampling flow metrics from 15 min data and using the entire flow record were also calculated flow metrics from these different data sources were highly correlated we therefore used daily 3 year data because it was the smallest amount of data that accurately represented conditions experienced by stream biota while accounting for interannual variability 2 2 3 biotic indices a set of taxonomic and traits based biotic indices were calculated from the biomonitoring data traits were assigned to macroinvertebrate taxa using a database developed for north american insects poff et al 2006b and based on literature review and expert judgment boris kondratieff leroy poff and matt pyne pers comm these traits based indices can provide insight into the causal relationships between benthic macroinvertebrates and stream environments that general taxonomic indices may miss mcgill et al 2006 poff et al 2006b reach wide sampling results were used from all sites except for seven sites where no sampling method was recorded a regional specific index of biotic integrity southern california index of biotic integrity sc ibi was also calculated for each site ode et al 2005 although the sc ibi has been replaced by the california stream condition index csci we used the sc ibi because it was in use when the macroinvertebrate data were collected and initial analyses were performed biotic indices were reduced to a set of eight using correlation analysis principle component analysis literature review and expert judgment table 4 2 2 4 statistical analysis we used two different statistical tools to determine which hydrologic metrics were most strongly associated with biotic indices spearman s non parametric rank based correlation and redundancy analysis rda rda was performed using the vegan r package oksanen 2013 r core team 2018 on metrics from the full set of sites as well as perennial non perennial sand bed and gravel bed subsets iterative rda was used to identify a reduced set of flow metrics that explained the most variance in biotic indices for the full dataset and each subset 2 3 hydrologic modeling for each usgs gage location rainfall runoff models were created using hec hms version 4 0 hydrologic engineering center 2013 hec hms was chosen because it is a physically based model that is commonly used in stormwater planning and watershed studies to simulate rainfall runoff processes these rainfall runoff models produced hourly discharge time series which were compared to hourly gage data for model calibration we calibrated these models for a 3 year time period water years wy 2005 2007 this time period was chosen because it is long enough to describe biotic condition had sufficient streamflow and precipitation data and includes a wet average and dry year we did not develop hydrologic models for four usgs gage sites with insufficient flow data over the model period this also removed seven matched biomonitoring sites from the analysis leaving a total of 25 biomonitoring sites table 1 we added five additional usgs gages but with no matching biomonitoring data increasing the total number of modeled watersheds to 19 fig 1 table 2 2 3 1 hec hms model inputs the watershed of each of the 19 streamflow gages was delineated in arcgis 10 1 using the national elevation dataset 10 m digital elevation model dem gesch et al 2002 percent imperviousness was computed using 2006 national land cover database nlcd data fry et al 2011 the simple canopy simple surface and deficit and constant loss methods were used to simulate rainfall losses we used the clark unit hydrograph method for surface runoff and the linear reservoir method for baseflow time of concentration toc for each watershed was calculated using the kirpich method kirpich 1940 toc k l 0 770 s 0 385 where toc is in minutes k is a unit conversion coefficient equal to 0 0078 for us units and 0 0195 for si units l is the channel flow length ft or m and s is the channel slope over the entire watershed m m or ft ft channel flow length and slope were obtained from the 10 m dem the clark unit hydrograph storage coefficient was calculated directly nbs lowry engineers planners and george v sabol consulting engineers 1993 tierra grande international inc and sabol 2008 r 0 37 toc 1 11 l 0 80 a 0 57 where r is the storage coefficient hours toc is the time of concentration hours l is the channel flow length miles and a is the basin area mi2 delineated and computed watershed physical characteristics were cross referenced with data produced by usgs streamstats usgs 2012 monthly average evapotranspiration data were obtained from the california irrigation management information system monitoring station closest to each usgs gage location cimis 2015 an evaporation coefficient of 0 77 calculated at nearby lake elsinore was used for all models chow et al 1988 precipitation data were obtained from a variety of sources noaa national climate data center cimis california data exchange center san diego county flood control district and ventura county watershed protection district the number of precipitation gauges used per watershed ranged from 3 to 23 inverse distance weighting based on the centroid of each basin was used to weight all the precipitation gauges within each model we neglected snowmelt processes due to the coastal southern california climate and the lack of high elevation sites in this study 2 3 2 calibration of rainfall runoff models thirteen model parameters table s1 were manually calibrated to reduce error between modeled and observed streamflow gage data the developed flow ecology relationships suggested that flow flashiness and low flow frequency were both important predictors of biological condition in southern california streams see results below others have also shown that these variables are ecologically important booth et al 2004 kennen et al 2010 and that low flows have been unnaturally inflated in southern california zimmerman et al 2018 furthermore low flows and flashiness are typically not well captured by models calibrated to the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse vis et al 2015 based on these results we chose two ecologically based flow metrics to use for hydrologic model calibration rbi and percent of time with flow 1 cubic feet per second 1 cfs 1 cfs 0 028 m3 s all hydrologic models were calibrated to four separate targets 1 maximize the nse 2 minimize the error of the rbi rbi 3 minimize the error of the percent of time flow is 1 cfs 1 cfs and 4 minimize the average error of 1 cfs and rbi combined calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency ranges from worst to 1 best and is calculated as nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse 1 t 1 t q o t q m t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q o is the mean of observed discharges q m t is modeled discharge at time t q o t is observed discharge at time t and t is the final time step percent error ranges from 0 best to worst and is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between observed and modeled values divided by the observed value 2 3 3 flow metrics we calculated index of hydrologic alteration iha flow metrics for all modeled time series of streamflow to compare with metrics from gage data the purpose of incorporating these additional metrics was to better assess the ability of the ecologically calibrated hydrologic models to accurately predict ecological flow metrics that were not used directly in the calibration i e rbi and 1 cfs iha 7 1 richter et al 1996 was used to compute descriptive environmental flow metrics based on aggregated daily modeled streamflow from hec hms although recent work has proposed new flow metrics which may be better descriptors of biological condition archfield and kennen 2013 carlisle et al 2017 eng et al 2017 we chose iha metrics because of their long history ease of calculation and similarity with the hydrologic metrics used in developing the flow ecology relationships for model calibration nse rbi and the 1 cfs metrics were calculated using hourly flows the model time step but we aggregated the model output to daily flows when calculating iha metrics all hydrologic metrics were also calculated for usgs streamflow gage data from the calibration period wy 2005 2007 and from the three year period antecedent to bioassessment sampling descriptions of selected iha and hourly flow metrics are provided in table 5 2 3 4 statistical analyses biotic indices table 4 were used to compare how flow metrics generated by the four calibration approaches explain biological variation relative to gage data only 14 of the 19 calibrated models were used for these analyses due to the absence of bioassessment data at five sites only iha flow metrics that were significantly correlated p 0 1 between the three year antecedent gage data and biotic indices were used in further analyses multiple regression analysis was then used to find the subset of modeled flow metrics that best predicted each biotic index based on minimum aic selection akaike 1971 all multiple regression models were tested to ensure assumptions were met i e normality of residuals linearity of response and homoscedasticity 3 results 3 1 flow ecology relationships flashiness and low flow flow permanence metrics best described benthic macroinvertebrate data iterative rda analyses indicate flashiness rbi was important for all sites and for subsets of both flow types and gravel bed sites fig 2 b d f in general higher flashiness was associated with more resistant macroinvertebrates those with disturbance related traits duration zero and monthly flows mean february and september flows also explained significant variability in biotic indices low flow metrics duration zero and 1 cfs had the largest number of significant correlations with biotic indices fig 3 these metrics were positively correlated with disturbance desiccation resistance traits and negatively correlated with amphipod and noninsect abundance mean september flows showed essentially the opposite correlations as low flow metrics flashiness was not significantly correlated with many biotic metrics but showed a strong negative relationship with shredder abundance based on the results of the rda and correlation analyses we chose to use flashiness rbi and low flow 1 cfs as targets for hydrologic model calibration although duration zero was another significant low flow metric we chose to use 1 cfs as a threshold to capture effectively dry streams where there might be some residual measured gage or modeled hec hms flow 3 2 hydrologic modeling lowest model calibration errors 2 were achieved when rbi and or 1 cfs was the calibration target fig 4 unsurprisingly rbi and 1 cfs metrics were not accurately quantified in models that were calibrated to other targets e g rbi error was high in the nse and 1 cfs calibration in the combined calibration both rbi and 1 cfs median errors were less than one percent median nse were 0 3 or higher indicating better overall fit for all calibrations except the combined calibration importantly targeting the calibration to nse resulted in high errors in both rbi and 1 cfs we expect low error for metrics that were the target of calibration therefore we also quantified error in an independent set of hydrologic metrics iha generally the combined calibration had the worst overall error in predicting iha flow metrics table s2 however it had the lowest error median 19 2 in replicating low flow metrics this calibration also had high error in daily iha flashiness metrics although it predicted hourly rbi well median 4 6 error results for multiple regression models indicate that model derived hydrologic metrics can explain significant variation in biotic indices of the hydrologic models the combined calibration consistently performs near the top and has the highest mean r2 fig 5 for all multiple regression models and the combined calibration models in particular the three most common significant predictors are rbi 1 cfs and extreme low flow timing fig s1 we expected the antecedent gage data to provide the best results since this is representative of the most recent hydrology the stream and macroinvertebrates have experienced in many cases however modeled flows or wy 2005 2007 gage data yield the same or better regression model performance 4 discussion 4 1 ecologically focused hydrologic modeling better explains biotic variability hydrologic models calibrated to reduce error in both flashiness rbi and low flow frequency indicative of drying 1 cfs produce the best metrics for explaining variation in biotic indices fig 5 the success of this combined calibration approach is encouraging for ecological flow applications models based on this targeted calibration accurately replicated the hydrologic metrics that were shown in the flow ecology analysis to be most important in predicting biotic indices the combined calibration models did not meet traditional standards of success they had poor nse scores and failed to accurately predict a wide range of iha metrics table s2 however the ultimate aim of ecologically focused modeling is to accurately predict the elements of the flow regime that are most influential on biological communities kendy et al 2012 poff et al 2010 and in this these models succeeded other studies in arid regions have also found that flow stability and the duration of low flows were significant controls on macroinvertebrate populations belmar et al 2013 chinnayakanahalli et al 2011 on the other hand mazor et al 2018 found that high flow metrics in addition to flashiness were important predictors of biological integrity in southern california the high flow metrics used in their study represented mean magnitude and duration of high flows which may be more biologically relevant than the peak flows reflected by nse and the iha metrics used in our study 4 2 guidelines for calibrating hydrologic models hydrologic models can never perfectly replicate all hydrologic processes and tradeoffs must be made to prioritize the accuracy of flow regime elements most critical for specific model applications previous research has found that best overall fit criteria including nse are not always the best calibration criteria for hydrologic models beven 2012 cassin et al 2005 jain and sudheer 2008 and may specifically result in poor estimates of ecologically relevant flow metrics vis et al 2015 our results similarly show that calibrating hydrologic models to the nse reduces the ability of modeled flow metrics to explain variance in biological indices in southern california streams calibrating to ecologically relevant targets e g rbi and 1 cfs does not require more effort than calibrating to nse but they provide much more useful results the combined calibration approach was superior to both the rbi and 1 cfs calibrations alone in predicting biotic indices suggesting that multiple criteria should be used simultaneously in hydrologic model calibration others have recommended multiple calibration criteria both generally beven 2012 gupta et al 2008 and specifically for ecological flow studies murphy et al 2013 vis et al 2015 since our combined calibration approach was targeted to flashiness and low flow frequency it is unsurprising that we did not simulate other aspects of the flow regime e g peak flows as accurately a recent ecological flow model calibration used a sequential calibration approach minimizing errors in flashiness and low flow frequency while keeping nse 0 4 sengupta et al 2018 their models tended to predict high flows better than our models suggesting that pairing ecological flow calibration i e minimizing error in flashiness and low flows with overall fit criteria nse may be a better approach for predicting a wide variety of flow metrics the hydrologic models were all calibrated to the same three years of flow data wy 2005 2007 regardless of when the nearby biomonitoring sites were sampled interestingly flow metrics from these gage data and models were often better predictors of biotic indices than the 3 year period directly prior to the biological sampling date wy 2005 2007 were purposefully chosen because they represented wetter than average average and drier than average years it appears that in southern california at least a period of flow that is representative of long term climate in the region is sufficient to explain macroinvertebrate assemblages if this trend holds in other regions it could allow the development or application of flow ecology relationships to areas where flow data around a specific sampling date are not available as long as representative flow data can be obtained 4 3 southern california flow ecology relationships our results suggest that flashiness rbi and frequency of low flows flow permanence e g duration zero and 1 cfs are significant and largely independent predictors of variance in biotic indices in southern california streams these metrics tend to be positively correlated with disturbance related biotic indices e g desiccation and disturbance resistance but negatively correlated with the presence of sensitive taxa ept this suggests that flashiness and low flows tend to lead to more robust and resilient macroinvertebrates while more stable flow regimes favor sensitive species belmar et al 2013 booth et al 2004 others have found that low flows can significantly affect the abundance and type of stream macroinvertebrates bonada et al 2007 kennen et al 2010 and that biotic integrity indices decrease with increasing flashiness degasperi et al 2009 differences in flow metrics across sites are likely driven by watershed land use in our study watersheds flashiness increases with urbanization while low flow frequency 1 cfs decreases fig s2 meanwhile sensitive taxa ept and overall biotic integrity sc ibi also decrease with watershed urbanization but trait based resilience metrics disturbance resilience desiccation resistance etc show little change fig s3 this is likely because urbanization is increasing flow permanence which makes disturbance and desiccation resistant traits less advantageous and increasing flashiness which can reduce the prevalence of sensitive taxa for our study streams however flashiness from daily flow data was not significantly correlated with either ept or sc ibi although rbi was important overall in predicting biotic condition in the redundancy analysis this is possibly because the study streams were all naturally flashy median daily rbi 0 64 max 0 92 or because of the daily time step used in developing the hydrologic metrics naturally flashy streams in north carolina also showed that flashiness was not a good predictor of ept richness or benthic index of biotic integrity b ibi pomeroy 2007 in more inherently stable puget lowlands streams however increased flashiness did lead to a significant decrease in b ibi booth et al 2004 these trends reinforce the fact that local climate is a major control on stream biota and hydromodification can result in different biotic responses in different regions this could also indicate that in our study streams increased flashiness from urbanization may have a smaller effect on ept and sc ibi than other side effects of urbanization e g pollutants or temperature changes cuffney et al 2010 this underscores the need to develop models that resolve heterogeneity in land use effects on both flow flashiness and chemical pollution 4 4 management applications and future research we demonstrated that developing flow ecology relationships from biologic and flow data can guide the development of ecologically focused hydrologic models that better capture relevant parts of the flow regime than more traditional calibration approaches this has significant potential to guide environmental flow management especially within the eloha framework this ecological calibration approach can also be used to quantify relevant hydrologic metrics at ungaged sites application at ungaged sites requires robust model validation which may be difficult in areas without a sufficient number of gaged streams especially in smaller basins poff et al 2006a extending the ecological calibration approach to ungaged sites has already been used in southern california to develop an ensemble of hydrologic models sengupta et al 2018 that were used to guide ecological assessment and planning mazor et al 2018 stein et al 2017 these methods however can also be applied outside this region while recognizing that the same flow metrics found to be important here i e low flow frequency and flashiness may not be important elsewhere carlisle et al 2017 found that metrics describing high flows and flow homogeneity were the best predictors of biotic condition nationally but that the most important metrics varied among regions dominant flow regimes and biotic communities vary regionally poff 1996 and it is likely that the most ecologically important flow metrics and the best metrics for targeted hydrologic model calibration will vary regionally as well in addition to explaining biotic condition the selected flow metrics should also be able to be accurately modeled eng et al 2017 the results of the flow ecology relationship analyses underscore the importance of stratifying biomonitoring sites by flow regime perennial non perennial and bed type sand gravel as recommended by the eloha framework different flow metrics become important for each subset of data fig 2 indicating that geomorphology bed material type and dominant flow regime can significantly influence the type of biologic communities and their responses flow is generally considered a master variable that controls the geomorphology lane 1955 and ecology of streams poff et al 1997 power et al 1995 while this is true the way a given flow is expressed in a channel i e the hydraulics of the flow can differ between reaches anim et al 2018 and may be more representative of the stresses experienced by in stream biota for example a flood in a sinuous gravel bed stream results in very different hydraulic stress than the same flow in a straight incised sand bed stream others have found that hydraulic metrics describing bed mobility e g shear stress relative to the mobilization threshold for sand or gravel substrate are excellent predictors of macroinvertebrate indices cobb et al 1992 townsend et al 1997a and superior to flow metrics derived purely from discharge townsend et al 1997b our trait based disturbance metrics e g disturbance resilience may be especially useful for exploring mechanistic linkages between stream conditions and biota mcgill et al 2006 poff et al 2006b hydraulic metrics currently present some challenges for developing regional flow ecology relationships specifically hydraulic metrics rely on additional site specific data channel slope geometry roughness and grain size which may not be available at all sites and is subject to change as channels evolve in response to hydromodification hawley and bledsoe 2013 purely hydrologic metrics are simple to quantify across a large number of sites and can be computed directly from gage data or hydrologic model outputs but they only provide a coarse representation of the actual hydraulic environments experienced by benthic macroinvertebrates or other biota local site habitat conditions can significantly affect how flows are expressed poff et al 2010 and refined hydraulic and bed mobility metrics have significant potential for developing more mechanistic ecohydraulic biological relationships these in turn could enable ecologically focused calibration of linked rainfall runoff and hydraulic models to better quantify the impacts of flow regime alterations on in stream and riparian biota 5 conclusion we developed flow ecology relationships using macroinvertebrate and usgs gage data for southern california streams spanning a gradient of urbanization this analysis showed that flow flashiness richards baker index and frequency of low flows flow permanence days 1 cfs best explained variability in biotic indices we used these flow metrics as calibration targets in the development of hec hms hydrologic models for the region we compared models calibrated to these biologically relevant flow metrics with models more traditionally calibrated to a best overall fit criteria nse none of the models accurately reproduced all elements of the flow regime but models calibrated to minimize error in both rbi and 1 cfs produced flow metrics that explained the most variability in macroinvertebrate indices we showed that this ecologically focused calibration of hydrologic models is feasible and can be better suited for environmental flow applications than traditional calibration approaches which deemphasize the most biologically influential elements of the flow regime this approach can be applied outside of southern california noting that accurate predictions of other flow metrics will likely be important for describing biological response in other regions ecologically focused model calibration is especially useful for application within the

6533,a novel form of coupled curvilinear lattice boltzmann model cclbm for solving the solute transport in shallow water flows imposed by the complex geometry is developed and applied shallow water equations transformed into curvilinear coordinate system are solved using the lattice boltzmann equation with multiple relaxation time mrt lbm while the curvilinear form of the 2d advection diffusion equation is solved applying the bhatnagar gross krook bgk lbm approach corresponding forms of equilibrium distribution function for both the shallow water and the advection diffusion equation is derived using the d2q9 lattice the physical flow domain of arbitrary geometry in the horizontal plane is covered with adequate curvilinear mesh while the calculation procedure for flow and transport is carried out in the d2q9 square lattice applying the basic form of the boundary condition method on water solid and open boundaries as well the coupled flow and pollution transport is tested using a straight inclined channel irrigation channel with a parabolic cross section in a 90 bend and a segment of the danube river in the cases of the straight inclined channels analytic solution is used as a comparative base while for the bent channel previously obtained velocity measurements are utilized for flow calibration where a mathematical model based on traditional cfd procedures is used for pollution transport validation unsteady flow and salinity transport in the danube river is calibrated and modelled using velocity and salinity measurements along with the results obtained by the traditionally based cfd model the high level of agreement between the results obtained by the proposed model and the corresponding analytical values and measurements indicates that the presented curvilinear form of the lbm is capable of solving very complex environmental problems keywords mrt bgk lattice boltzmann method shallow water equations advection diffusion equation curvilinear coordinates complex geometry 1 introduction transport mechanism in open channel flow includes various different processes from pollution and sediment transport which from environmental and engineering point of view are the two most significant matter transported in open channel flows up to the temperature and different chemical constituents important for the chemical and biological status of the natural water bodies due to their composite nature reactive chemicals transport of grain sized suspended and bed load sediment followed by the connection to the complex fluid flow imposed by natural geometry conduction of short long term predictions implies usage of sophisticated and efficient mathematical models for example if sediment transport is modelled suspension concentration is divided in different grain size fractions introducing as many additional computational variables as grain size fraction intervals furthermore mutual correlations are additional processes that is need to be solved as a consequence robust and massive computational model is established therefore adequate and efficient numerical procedures are required in this paper novel lattice boltzmann method for solute transport driven by the shallow water flow in natural water bodies is introduced transport of any kind of matter in fluid is modelled in general by the advection diffusion equation ade extended by appropriate source terms some early attempts to solve this equation using the standard bgk lbm rivet and boon 2001 rothman and zaleski 1997 wolf gladrow 2001 can be found in calí et al 1992 kingdon and schofield 1992 guo et al 1999 wolf gladrow 1995 and dawson et al 1993 where the linear ade is primarily solved by using the basic square lattice form advection and anisotropic dispersion equations aade is modeled by ginzburg 2005 and yoshida and nagaoka 2010 by applying two relaxation time trt and multiple relaxation time mrt approach respectively while authors van der sman and ernsty 2011 and zhou 2011 showed that the use of a single relaxation time in the lattice boltzmann equation on a rectangular lattice can correctly recover the advection and anisotropic dispersion equation aade with a variable dispersion tensor it should be noted that the trt collision equals the bgk collision in terms of computational time and simplicity where in case of the trt model the diffusion coefficient is built with only one of the relaxation rate the one corresponds to the anti symmetric modes while the second rate is required to adjust the second order boundary accuracy and the truncation corrections ginzburg 2005 the coordinate transformation of the aade from the rectangular to the cuboid computational grid by using the anisotropic rescaling of the convection diffusion terms is done by ginzburg 2006 while simulation of the convection diffusion equation transformed in curvilinear grid system is introduced by yoshida and nagaoka 2014 furthermore application of the poisson s equation on arbitrary geometry by using curvilinear transformation approach is introduced by budinski et al 2015 and budinski et al 2015 in order to model temperature evolution in actual flow field simulation of the rayleigh bénard convection using the lattice boltzmann method for the convection diffusion equation coupled with the navier stokes equation is done by shan 1997 guo et al 2002 and huang et al 2011 flow in natural water bodies rivers irrigation channels lakes is mainly described by the shallow water equations application of the lattice boltzmann method for shallow water flows can be found in zhou 2004 ghidaoui and li 2003 thömmes et al 2007 zhou and borthwick 2011 and liu et al 2009 while implementation of the coupled lattice boltzmann model using the pure advection diffusion equation no source terms can be found in li and huang 2008 li and huang 2009 zhou 2009 peng et al 2011 liu et al 2013 banda et al 2009 and klar et al 2008 however the lbm for the shallow water transport system presently available in the literature use only standard square or rectangular lattice forms without providing any calibration and verification analysis for qualitative validation of the mathematical models when natural water systems are considered being one of distinctive features of natural water bodies arbitrary geometry inevitably imposes complex flow and transport patterns making this task from the cfd point of view very changeling and computationally demanding standard procedures for managing computational domains characterized by arbitrary geometry in frame of the lbm are mostly based on a multi reflection schemes linear schemes filippova and hänel 1998 ginzburg 2005 li et al 2013 guo and zheng 2002 chang et al 2009 and parabolic schemes ginzburg 2005 additional techniques like for example meshless approach derived by shu et al 2001 are also available however reflection schemes inevitably introduce additional computational steps which to some extent destroy the basic nature of the method and partially deteriorate the efficiency of the overall procedure on the other hand the complex flow and the scale ratio of the computational domain often negatively influence stability of the mostly used bgk lbm model bhatnagar et al 1954 requiring therefore application of the more stable mrt lbm model lallemand and luo 2000 d humieres et al 2002 tubbs and tsai 2011 li and huang 2008 to eliminate the negative features of the lbm when flow and solute transport in natural water bodies is considered in this paper a novel coupled lattice boltzmann model for the shallow water contamination system based on curvilinear transformation cclbm is proposed applying the complete transformation of the shallow water equations where both depended and independent variables are transformed into alternative curvilinear coordinate system flow is solved by using the established curvilinear mrt lbm budinski 2014 this way the physical domain is covered by a curvilinear mesh which can be easily fitted to the flow area while the calculation is performed on a unit square grid within the scope of the curvilinear coordinate system implementation of the boundary conditions now becomes straightforward eliminating therefore additional steps and improving the overall efficiency the same approach is applied on the depth averaged mass conservation equation the advection diffusion equation is transformed into curvilinear coordinate system and then coupled with the flow model by using the nine velocity bgk lattice boltzmann model in order to establish coupled lbm for the shallow water contamination system suitable for practical application when natural water system are considered the model is tested using a schematized channel irrigation channel with a parabolic cross section in a 90 bend and a segment of the danube river unsteady flow and transport of conservative matter along the danube river is calibrated and verified by using the actual velocity and salinity measurements 2 governing equations transformed in a curvilinear coordinate system 2 1 shallow water equations transformed in curvilinear coordinate system the basic flow equations are the depth averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations written herein in tensor notation the depth averaged mass conservation equation is 1 h t h u j x j 0 and the depth averaged momentum conservation equations are 2 u i t u j u i x j g z b h x i 1 ρ h τ ji h x j 1 ρ h τ wi τ bi τ fi where t time x i i coordinate direction u i i direction component of the depth averaged flow velocity h flow depth z b bed surface elevation ρ density of water g is the gravitational acceleration τ ji i direction component of the depth averaged turbulent diffusion stress and τ wi τ bi τ fi i direction components of the free surface the bed shear stress and the shear stresses along the solid boundary zhou 2004 respectively since domains of complex geometry are in most cases characterized by arbitrary boundaries which do not coincide with the directions of the preferred cartesian coordinates describing such domains of interest using the curvilinear method is more suitable in this case the physical domain defined in the cartesian coordinate system is covered by curvilinear mesh which can be easily fitted to the flow area while the calculation is performed on a unit square grid within the scope of the curvilinear coordinate system this is done by establishing a metric function between the physical and computational domains as x x ξ η y y ξ η and the corresponding inverse function as ξ ξ x y η η x y applying transformation procedure as described in detail in budinski 2014 shallow water equations transformed in curvilinear coordinate system are obtained 3 j 2 h t j 2 hu ξ j 2 hv

implementing the boundary conditions in case of arbitrary geometry domains presents one of the major advantages of the curvilinear lb method using only the essential lbm techniques for derivation of the boundary conditions like the bounce back method or the elastic collision scheme the sum of the particle momentum normal to the solid wall is zero curvilinear form of the lb method for shallow water equations manages to derive no slip or slip conditions near the solid and on the open boundaries hence in the following case studies the standard form of the elastic collision scheme is applied to the slip condition rivet and boon 2001 rothman and zaleski 1997 wolf gladrow 2001 while in case of a open boundary the method proposed by zou and he 1997 is used to estimate the unknown distribution function for example unknown depth and distribution functions on the west open boundary can be calculated as 34 h f 0 f 3 f 7 2 f 4 f 5 f 6 j 2 1 0 u e f 1 f 5 2 j 2 hu 3 e f 8 f 4 f 3 f

computational mesh was generated by using the appropriate software for grid generation where the corresponding geometrical terms are calculated using the classic finite difference method particularly second order scheme hence the first derivative is calculated as 36 s ξ s i 1 j s i 1 j 2 δ ξ o δ ξ 2 s η s i j 1 s i j 1 2 δ η o δ η 2 while the second derivative is approximated as 37 2 s ξ 2 s i 1 j

calculations are conducted only once prior to the main calculation procedure accordingly this technique is utilized for all test cases 4 numerical analysis in order to the validate coupled lattice boltzmann method of the shallow water equations and depth averaged advection diffusion equation transformed in curvilinear coordinates three test examples are utilized the 1d advection diffusion is tested using a straight inclined prismatic channel while the 2d pollution transport is modelled using an irrigation channel having parabolic cross section in a 90 bend and a segment of the danube river the analytic solution an alternative mathematical model and corresponding measurements are used for calibration and validation of the model 4 1 1d pollution transport in a straight inclined channel for the first test example 1d pollution transport in a simple straight channel with an inclination of 45 is modelled the channel is l 100 0 m long and b 10 0 m wide while for the bottom slope value s 0 0 0002 is used for this geometry two different mesh configurations equidistant and non equidistant are utilized cell dimensions δ x δ y 1 0 m are used for the equidistant mesh 102 10 while cell coarsening in longitudinal direction where values δ x 0 56 m and δ x 2 28 m are set at channel inlet and outlet 82 10 respectively is adopted in case of the non equidistant mesh in addition straight channel parallel to the x axis with the same two mesh configurations has been modelled for the purpose of comparison applying discharge q 1 5 m3 s as upstream boundary condition and constant water level z s 0 407 as downstream boundary condition setting the manning roughness coefficient and kinematic viscosity to n 0 02 m 1 3 s and ν 0 0500 m2 s respectively normal depth h n 0 407 m and velocity u 0 37 m s are obtained the corresponding froude number is fr 0 081 while the reynolds number takes value of re 1 506 10 5 for the water solid boundary the slip condition is applied to ensure stability of the flow model different values for time step δ t and parameters s 2 s 3 s 5 s 7 s 8 s 9 1 τ have been used for different mesh configurations therefore values δ t 0 1 s s 2 1 3 s 3 0 9 s 5 1 3 s 7 1 3 and s 8 s 9 1 τ where τ is calculated using eq 16 are used for the equidistant mesh while values δ t 0 22 s s 2 1 0 s 3 0 8 s 5 1 0 and s 7 1 0 have been adopted for the non equidistant mesh in case of the advection diffusion model relaxation time τ a 0 8 is set for the equidistant mesh and τ a 0 65 is used for the non equidistant mesh while unique value for diffusion coefficient d 0 1 m2 s is used for both mesh configurations non degradable contamination distribution defined as huang 1996 38 c x t c 0 d π t 0 t exp x ut x 0 2 4 d t 0 t where c 0 100 0 g m2 t 0 5 0 s t 0 0 s and x

meshes and analytic solution based on eq 34 is for time levels t 50 100 150 200 s presented in fig 1 excellent agreement between the compared values is achieved 4 2 2d pollution transport in a straight inclined channel in the second test example 2d pollution transport is modelled using the same inclined channel configuration flow and model parameters utilized in the previous example the problem is defined as huang 1996 39 c x y t m h 1 4 π dt exp x ut x 0 2 y vt y 0 2 4 dt where m 40 0 g is the mass of the pollutant and x 0 52 05 and y 0 75 51 denote location coordinates where the contamination is introduced into the channel numerical simulation is conducted using instantaneous drop of pollution at point located l p 12 0 m from the inlet and s p 17 43 m from the right bank as initial condition zero concentration is imposed along the rest of the channel while zero concentration and zero gradient are utilized at the inlet and at the outlet respectively furthermore stability of the coupled model both for equidistant and non equidistant configurations is achieved using the parameters established in the previous example the results for t 60 s and t 160 s are depicted in figs 2 and 3 while the validation is conducted using the equation for global relative error r in form 40 r i c i c ai 2 i c ai 2 where c i and c ai denote the numerical and analytical solution respectively hence for time level t 60 s the relative errors for equidistant and non equidistant mesh are r eq 2 46 10 2 and r neq 3 03 10 2 respectively while in case t 160 s global errors take values r eq 3 02 10 2 and r neq 2 80 10 2 again good agreement is confirmed 4 3 2d pollution transport in a channel of parabolic cross section in a 90 bend in order to try the proposed coupled model on flows characterized by natural geometry a 27 0 m long section of an irrigation channel of parabolic cross section in a 90 bend has been considered fig 4 the width of the parabolic shape cross section is b 1 6 m while the longitudinal bed slope is i b 0 001 applying the same approach for generating the calculation mesh used in the previous examples channel geometry is covered with curvilinear mesh having cell sizes δ x δ y 0 05 m along the straight section and δ x δ y 0 04 m and δ x δ y 0 057 m along the inner and outer wall of the bend respectively a portion of the generated mesh having 556 35 computational points over the whole domain is shown in fig 4 for the flow model the discharge of q 0 0540 m3 s and free surface elevation z s 0 1685 m have been applied to the upstream boundary while free surface elevation z s 0 1430 m has been adopted at the downstream boundary regarding the parabolic cross section geometry at the water solid boundary the zero velocity condition in the form of the simple bounce back method is applied the following values of model and flow parameters have been adopted n 0 022 m 1 3 s ν 0 000250 m2 s δ t 0 0106 s s 2 1 35 s 3 0 90 s 5 1 35 s 7 1 35 and s 8 s 9 1 τ the corresponding froude number is fr 0 18 while the reynolds number takes value of re 3 23 10 4 comparison of the derived results in form of tangential velocities with the measured ones and with the results obtained by the alternative model based on fractional step approach model fsa where the advection term is solved using the method of characteristics mc and propagation diffusion step is modelled using the finite difference fd crank nicolson scheme with the alternating direction implicit adi method is presented by fig 5 very good agreement between the compared values has been achieved parabolic distribution of velocity across the cross section has been confirmed along the whole computational domain both in the straight and curved sections of the channel following the flow field established a 1000 0 g of pollution was instantly added into channel at location x 0 1 42 m y 0 11 41 m for the diffusion coefficient value of d 0 002 m2 s has been used while the relaxation time of τ a 0 75 is utilized in order to maintain stability of the model since in this case appropriate pollution measurements did not exist validation of the cclbm was conducted using the previously mentioned fsa model also capable of simulating the transport phenomena in open channel systems furthermore similar numerical technique used for solving the shallow water equations is also applied for the advection diffusion equation the advection is modelled using the method of characteristics while the crank nicolson scheme and the adi model is applied for the diffusion part the comparison of results obtained by the coupled curvilinear lbm and fsa model are for t 20 and 50s is shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively a satisfactory match between the compared results is obtained 4 4 2d salinity transport in the danube river since practical application and implementation of the lbm on natural water systems is one of the major goals of the proposed cclbm for the forth test example salinity transport along a section of the danube river is chosen the experimental reach is located between mohacs in hungary and bezdan in serbia i e between river sections 1438and 1432 km flow and salinity data was collected during may 23 27 2011 along seven cross sections denoted as range 1 to range 7 in fig 8 the data set contained adcp velocity measurements obtained from a stationary vessel in each data vertical furthermore discharge water level measurements and bathymetry measurements the distance between the transect lines was approximately 100 0 m and conductivity measurements salinity was further obtained by using the established correlation relations the experimental reach with the corresponding cross sections and data verticals is shown in fig 8 curvilinear mesh with average cell size dimensions of 10 10 m therefore 438 31 computational points were generated the location of the upstream and downstream boundary line coincides with the positions of range 1 and range 7 respectively since the simulation period is identical to the data collection period having duration of five days from may 23th to may 27th the collected data at the upstream boundary range 1 and the downstream boundary range 7 show certain unsteady behaviour therefore the corresponding hydrograph given in fig 9 a is adopted as upstream boundary condition while stage curve presented in fig 9b is used as the downstream boundary condition for the advection diffusion model constant value for salinity s 0 19 psu is imposed on the upstream boundary while zero gradient is used as downstream boundary condition for the simulation of unsteady flow and salinity transport in the considered five day period the following values of model and flow parameters have been adopted n 0 017 m 1 3 s ν 0 05 m2 s δ t 0 70 s s 2 1 30 s 3 0 90 s 5 1 30 s 7 1 30 and s 8 s 9 1 τ d 0 60 m2 s τ a 0 75 where relaxation time τ is calculated by eq 16 over the whole domain furthermore the simulations are performed using cuda parallel computing platform on a single workstation dell precision t7500 with two nvidia teslatm c2050 computing processors each having 14 multiprocessors running with 448 cuda cores the data transfer between the two tesla gpu s is managed by peer to peer communication where best performance for cuda is achieved when block configuration 64 1 1 is used prior to the unsteady flow simulation steady state is obtained after 50000time steps by using constant discharge q 1676 00 m3 s at the inlet and free water surface level z s 81 69 m at the outlet the non dimensionless froude and reynolds numbers are fr 0 045 and re 5 2 10 6 respectively the unsteady simulation is performed for a 5 day period which corresponds to 617143time steps as already mentioned adcp velocity values in corresponding data verticals were acquired in different time instances which required post processing in the same time levels therefore velocity values in all data verticals were acquired according to the time of sampling and then compared with the corresponding depth averaged adcp velocity measurements the same methodology is used in the comparison of the measured and computed salinity data hence comparison of the measured and calculated depth averaged velocity components and salinity for ranges 3 6 are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively while the resulting velocity field and spatial distribution of salinity for time level t 1 87 day is presented in fig 12 very good agreement between the compared results is achieved 5 conclusions to create an effective tool for modelling flow and solute transport induced by arbitrary geometry of natural water bodies the two dimensional coupled lattice boltzmann method for solute transport based on curvilinear technique is considered in this paper for modelling the shallow water flow equations fully transformed into a curvilinear coordinate system the mrt lbm is used while in order to minimize the computational costs of the general flow transport model the curvilinear form of the advection diffusion equation is solved by applying the standard bgk lbm introducing the coordinate transformation approach into the lattice boltzmann model where appropriate form of fully transformed equations in curvilinear coordinate system are solved using the standard square lattice pattern and the basic form of boundary conditions significant improvement in handling complex geometry domains in terms of efficiency and simplicity is achieved similarly to the traditional finite difference method often used in the domain of river hydraulics the complex geometry of natural water bodies is first covered by mesh made up of curvilinear lines which fit the best to the considered geometry and then solution is reached by applying the standard lattice boltzmann approach this way the basic features of the lattice boltzmann method like computational efficiency coming from parallel processing and simplicity in implementing boundary conditions are fully maintained this was verified not only by the standard schematic test but through real natural cases as well the very good agreement between the computed and measured values achieved in all test cases confirms the capability of the proposed cclbm model to simulate flow and flow related processes efficiently in natural water bodies therefore making the cclbm fully competitive compared to the presently available computational models 
6533,a novel form of coupled curvilinear lattice boltzmann model cclbm for solving the solute transport in shallow water flows imposed by the complex geometry is developed and applied shallow water equations transformed into curvilinear coordinate system are solved using the lattice boltzmann equation with multiple relaxation time mrt lbm while the curvilinear form of the 2d advection diffusion equation is solved applying the bhatnagar gross krook bgk lbm approach corresponding forms of equilibrium distribution function for both the shallow water and the advection diffusion equation is derived using the d2q9 lattice the physical flow domain of arbitrary geometry in the horizontal plane is covered with adequate curvilinear mesh while the calculation procedure for flow and transport is carried out in the d2q9 square lattice applying the basic form of the boundary condition method on water solid and open boundaries as well the coupled flow and pollution transport is tested using a straight inclined channel irrigation channel with a parabolic cross section in a 90 bend and a segment of the danube river in the cases of the straight inclined channels analytic solution is used as a comparative base while for the bent channel previously obtained velocity measurements are utilized for flow calibration where a mathematical model based on traditional cfd procedures is used for pollution transport validation unsteady flow and salinity transport in the danube river is calibrated and modelled using velocity and salinity measurements along with the results obtained by the traditionally based cfd model the high level of agreement between the results obtained by the proposed model and the corresponding analytical values and measurements indicates that the presented curvilinear form of the lbm is capable of solving very complex environmental problems keywords mrt bgk lattice boltzmann method shallow water equations advection diffusion equation curvilinear coordinates complex geometry 1 introduction transport mechanism in open channel flow includes various different processes from pollution and sediment transport which from environmental and engineering point of view are the two most significant matter transported in open channel flows up to the temperature and different chemical constituents important for the chemical and biological status of the natural water bodies due to their composite nature reactive chemicals transport of grain sized suspended and bed load sediment followed by the connection to the complex fluid flow imposed by natural geometry conduction of short long term predictions implies usage of sophisticated and efficient mathematical models for example if sediment transport is modelled suspension concentration is divided in different grain size fractions introducing as many additional computational variables as grain size fraction intervals furthermore mutual correlations are additional processes that is need to be solved as a consequence robust and massive computational model is established therefore adequate and efficient numerical procedures are required in this paper novel lattice boltzmann method for solute transport driven by the shallow water flow in natural water bodies is introduced transport of any kind of matter in fluid is modelled in general by the advection diffusion equation ade extended by appropriate source terms some early attempts to solve this equation using the standard bgk lbm rivet and boon 2001 rothman and zaleski 1997 wolf gladrow 2001 can be found in calí et al 1992 kingdon and schofield 1992 guo et al 1999 wolf gladrow 1995 and dawson et al 1993 where the linear ade is primarily solved by using the basic square lattice form advection and anisotropic dispersion equations aade is modeled by ginzburg 2005 and yoshida and nagaoka 2010 by applying two relaxation time trt and multiple relaxation time mrt approach respectively while authors van der sman and ernsty 2011 and zhou 2011 showed that the use of a single relaxation time in the lattice boltzmann equation on a rectangular lattice can correctly recover the advection and anisotropic dispersion equation aade with a variable dispersion tensor it should be noted that the trt collision equals the bgk collision in terms of computational time and simplicity where in case of the trt model the diffusion coefficient is built with only one of the relaxation rate the one corresponds to the anti symmetric modes while the second rate is required to adjust the second order boundary accuracy and the truncation corrections ginzburg 2005 the coordinate transformation of the aade from the rectangular to the cuboid computational grid by using the anisotropic rescaling of the convection diffusion terms is done by ginzburg 2006 while simulation of the convection diffusion equation transformed in curvilinear grid system is introduced by yoshida and nagaoka 2014 furthermore application of the poisson s equation on arbitrary geometry by using curvilinear transformation approach is introduced by budinski et al 2015 and budinski et al 2015 in order to model temperature evolution in actual flow field simulation of the rayleigh bénard convection using the lattice boltzmann method for the convection diffusion equation coupled with the navier stokes equation is done by shan 1997 guo et al 2002 and huang et al 2011 flow in natural water bodies rivers irrigation channels lakes is mainly described by the shallow water equations application of the lattice boltzmann method for shallow water flows can be found in zhou 2004 ghidaoui and li 2003 thömmes et al 2007 zhou and borthwick 2011 and liu et al 2009 while implementation of the coupled lattice boltzmann model using the pure advection diffusion equation no source terms can be found in li and huang 2008 li and huang 2009 zhou 2009 peng et al 2011 liu et al 2013 banda et al 2009 and klar et al 2008 however the lbm for the shallow water transport system presently available in the literature use only standard square or rectangular lattice forms without providing any calibration and verification analysis for qualitative validation of the mathematical models when natural water systems are considered being one of distinctive features of natural water bodies arbitrary geometry inevitably imposes complex flow and transport patterns making this task from the cfd point of view very changeling and computationally demanding standard procedures for managing computational domains characterized by arbitrary geometry in frame of the lbm are mostly based on a multi reflection schemes linear schemes filippova and hänel 1998 ginzburg 2005 li et al 2013 guo and zheng 2002 chang et al 2009 and parabolic schemes ginzburg 2005 additional techniques like for example meshless approach derived by shu et al 2001 are also available however reflection schemes inevitably introduce additional computational steps which to some extent destroy the basic nature of the method and partially deteriorate the efficiency of the overall procedure on the other hand the complex flow and the scale ratio of the computational domain often negatively influence stability of the mostly used bgk lbm model bhatnagar et al 1954 requiring therefore application of the more stable mrt lbm model lallemand and luo 2000 d humieres et al 2002 tubbs and tsai 2011 li and huang 2008 to eliminate the negative features of the lbm when flow and solute transport in natural water bodies is considered in this paper a novel coupled lattice boltzmann model for the shallow water contamination system based on curvilinear transformation cclbm is proposed applying the complete transformation of the shallow water equations where both depended and independent variables are transformed into alternative curvilinear coordinate system flow is solved by using the established curvilinear mrt lbm budinski 2014 this way the physical domain is covered by a curvilinear mesh which can be easily fitted to the flow area while the calculation is performed on a unit square grid within the scope of the curvilinear coordinate system implementation of the boundary conditions now becomes straightforward eliminating therefore additional steps and improving the overall efficiency the same approach is applied on the depth averaged mass conservation equation the advection diffusion equation is transformed into curvilinear coordinate system and then coupled with the flow model by using the nine velocity bgk lattice boltzmann model in order to establish coupled lbm for the shallow water contamination system suitable for practical application when natural water system are considered the model is tested using a schematized channel irrigation channel with a parabolic cross section in a 90 bend and a segment of the danube river unsteady flow and transport of conservative matter along the danube river is calibrated and verified by using the actual velocity and salinity measurements 2 governing equations transformed in a curvilinear coordinate system 2 1 shallow water equations transformed in curvilinear coordinate system the basic flow equations are the depth averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations written herein in tensor notation the depth averaged mass conservation equation is 1 h t h u j x j 0 and the depth averaged momentum

flow depth z b bed surface elevation ρ density of water g is the gravitational acceleration τ ji i direction component of the depth averaged turbulent diffusion stress and τ wi τ bi τ fi i direction components of the free surface the bed shear stress and the shear stresses along the solid boundary zhou 2004 respectively since domains of complex geometry are in most cases characterized by arbitrary boundaries which do not coincide with the directions of the preferred cartesian coordinates describing such domains of interest using the curvilinear method is more suitable in this case the physical domain defined in the cartesian coordinate system is covered by curvilinear mesh which can be easily fitted to the flow area while the calculation is performed on a unit square grid within the scope of the curvilinear coordinate system this is done by establishing a metric function between the physical and computational domains as x x ξ η y y ξ η and the corresponding inverse function as ξ ξ x y η η x y applying transformation procedure as described in detail in budinski 2014 shallow water equations transformed in curvilinear coordinate system are obtained 3 j 2 h t j 2 hu ξ j 2 hv

implementing the boundary conditions in case of arbitrary geometry domains presents one of the major advantages of the curvilinear lb method using only the essential lbm techniques for derivation of the boundary conditions like the bounce back method or the elastic collision scheme the sum of the particle momentum normal to the solid wall is zero curvilinear form of the lb method for shallow water equations manages to derive no slip or slip conditions near the solid and on the open boundaries hence in the following case studies the standard form of the elastic collision scheme is applied to the slip condition rivet and boon 2001 rothman and zaleski 1997 wolf gladrow 2001 while in case of a open boundary the method proposed by zou and he 1997 is used to estimate the unknown

channel for the first test example 1d pollution transport in a simple straight channel with an inclination of 45 is modelled the channel is l 100 0 m long and b 10 0 m wide while for the bottom slope value s 0 0 0002 is used for this geometry two different mesh configurations equidistant and non equidistant are utilized cell dimensions δ x δ y 1 0 m are used for the equidistant mesh 102 10 while cell coarsening in longitudinal direction where values δ x 0 56 m and δ x 2 28 m are set at channel inlet and outlet 82 10 respectively is adopted in case of the non equidistant mesh in addition straight channel parallel to the x axis with the same two mesh configurations has been modelled for the purpose of comparison applying discharge q 1 5 m3 s as upstream boundary condition and constant water level z s 0 407 as downstream boundary condition setting the manning roughness coefficient and kinematic viscosity to n 0 02 m 1 3 s and ν 0 0500 m2 s respectively normal depth h n 0 407 m and velocity u 0 37 m s are obtained the corresponding froude number is fr 0 081 while the reynolds number takes value of re 1 506 10 5 for the water solid boundary the slip condition is applied to ensure stability of the flow model different values for time step δ t and parameters s 2 s 3 s 5 s 7 s 8 s 9 1 τ have been used for different mesh configurations therefore values δ t 0 1 s s 2 1 3 s 3 0 9 s 5 1 3 s 7 1 3 and s 8 s 9 1 τ where τ is calculated using eq 16 are used for the equidistant mesh while values δ t 0 22 s s 2 1 0 s 3 0 8 s 5 1 0 and s 7 1 0 have been adopted for the non equidistant mesh in case of the advection diffusion model relaxation time τ a 0 8 is set for the equidistant mesh and τ a 0 65 is used for the non equidistant mesh while unique value for diffusion coefficient d 0

meshes and analytic solution based on eq 34 is for time levels t 50 100 150 200 s presented in fig 1 excellent agreement between the compared values is achieved 4 2 2d pollution transport in a straight inclined channel in the second test example 2d pollution transport is modelled using the same inclined channel configuration flow and model parameters utilized in the previous example the problem is defined as huang 1996 39 c x y t m h 1 4 π dt exp x ut x 0 2 y vt y 0 2 4 dt where m 40 0 g is the mass of the pollutant and x 0 52 05 and y 0 75 51 denote location coordinates where the contamination is introduced into the channel numerical simulation is conducted using instantaneous drop of pollution at point located l p 12 0 m from the inlet and s p 17 43 m from the right bank as initial condition zero concentration is imposed along the rest of the channel while zero concentration and zero gradient are utilized at the inlet and at the outlet respectively furthermore stability of the coupled model both for equidistant and non equidistant configurations is achieved using the parameters established in the previous example the results for t 60 s and t 160 s are depicted in figs 2 and 3 while the validation is conducted using the equation for global relative error r in form 40 r i c i c ai 2 i c ai 2 where c i and c ai denote the numerical and analytical solution respectively hence for time level t 60 s the relative errors for equidistant and non equidistant mesh are r eq 2 46 10 2 and r neq 3 03 10 2 respectively while in case t 160 s global errors take values r eq 3 02 10 2 and r neq 2 80 10 2 again good agreement is confirmed 4 3 2d pollution transport in a channel of parabolic cross section in a 90 bend in order to try the proposed coupled model on flows characterized by natural geometry a 27 0 m long section of an irrigation channel of parabolic cross section in a 90 bend has been considered fig 4 the width of the parabolic shape cross section is b 1 6 m while the longitudinal bed slope is i b 0 001 applying the same approach for generating the calculation mesh used in the previous examples channel geometry is covered with curvilinear mesh having cell sizes δ x δ y 0 05 m along the straight section and δ x δ y 0 04 m and δ x δ y 0 057 m along the inner and outer wall of the bend respectively a portion of the generated mesh having 556 35 computational points over the whole domain is shown in fig 4 for the flow model the discharge of q 0 0540 m3 s and free surface elevation z s 0 1685 m have been applied to the upstream boundary while free surface elevation z s 0 1430 m has been adopted at the downstream boundary regarding the parabolic cross section geometry at the water solid boundary the zero velocity

1 35 s 7 1 35 and s 8 s 9 1 τ the corresponding froude number is fr 0 18 while the reynolds number takes value of re 3 23 10 4 comparison of the derived results in form of tangential velocities with the measured ones and with the results obtained by the alternative model based on fractional step approach model fsa where the advection term is solved using the method of characteristics mc and propagation diffusion step is modelled using the finite difference fd crank nicolson scheme with the alternating direction implicit adi method is presented by fig 5 very good agreement between the compared values has been achieved parabolic distribution of velocity across the cross section has been confirmed along the whole computational domain both in the straight and curved sections of the channel following the flow field established a 1000 0 g of pollution was instantly added into channel at location x 0 1 42 m y 0 11 41 m for the diffusion coefficient value of d 0 002 m2 s has been used while the relaxation time of τ a 0 75 is utilized in order to maintain stability of the model since in this case appropriate pollution measurements did not exist validation of the cclbm was conducted using the previously mentioned fsa model also capable of simulating the transport phenomena in open channel systems furthermore similar numerical technique used for solving the shallow water equations is also applied for the advection diffusion equation the advection is modelled using the method of characteristics while the crank nicolson scheme and the adi model is applied for the diffusion part the comparison of results obtained by the coupled curvilinear lbm and fsa model are for t 20 and 50s is shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively a satisfactory match between the compared results is obtained 4 4 2d salinity transport in the danube river since practical application and implementation of the lbm on natural water systems is one of the major goals of the proposed cclbm for the forth test example salinity transport along a section of the danube river is chosen the experimental reach is located between mohacs in hungary and bezdan in serbia i e between river sections 1438and 1432 km flow and salinity data was collected during may 23 27 2011 along seven cross sections denoted as range 1 to range 7 in fig 8 the data set contained adcp velocity measurements obtained from a stationary vessel in each data vertical furthermore discharge water level measurements and bathymetry measurements the distance between the transect lines was approximately 100 0 m and conductivity measurements salinity was further obtained by using the established correlation relations the experimental reach with the corresponding cross sections and data verticals is shown in fig 8 curvilinear mesh with average cell size dimensions of 10 10 m therefore 438 31 computational points were generated the location of the upstream and downstream boundary line coincides with the positions of range 1 and range 7 respectively since the simulation period is identical to the data collection period having duration of five days from may 23th to may 27th the collected data at the upstream boundary range 1 and the downstream boundary range 7 show certain unsteady behaviour therefore the corresponding hydrograph given in fig 9 a is adopted as upstream boundary condition while stage curve presented in fig 9b is used as the downstream boundary condition for the advection diffusion model constant value for salinity s 0 19 psu is imposed on the upstream boundary while zero gradient is used as downstream boundary condition for the simulation of unsteady flow and salinity transport in the considered five day period the following values of model and flow parameters have been adopted n 0 017 m 1 3 s ν 0 05 m2 s δ t 0 70 s s 2 1 30 s 3 0 90 s 5 1 30 s 7 1 30 and s 8 s 9 1 τ d 0 60 m2 s τ a 0 75 where relaxation time τ is calculated by eq 16 over the whole domain furthermore the simulations are performed using cuda parallel computing platform on a single workstation dell precision t7500 with two nvidia teslatm c2050 computing processors each having 14 multiprocessors running with 448 cuda cores the data transfer between the two tesla gpu s is managed by peer to peer communication where best performance for cuda is achieved when block configuration 64 1 1 is used prior to the unsteady flow simulation steady state is obtained after 50000time steps by using constant discharge q 1676 00 m3 s at the inlet and free water surface level z s 81 69 m at the outlet the non dimensionless froude and reynolds numbers are fr 0 045 and re 5 2 10 6 respectively the unsteady simulation is performed for a 5 day period which corresponds to 617143time steps as already mentioned adcp velocity values in corresponding data verticals were acquired in different time instances which required post processing in the same time levels therefore velocity values in all data verticals were acquired according to the time of sampling and then compared with the corresponding depth averaged adcp velocity measurements the same methodology is used in the comparison of the measured and computed salinity data hence comparison of the measured and calculated depth averaged velocity components and salinity for ranges 3 6 are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively while the resulting velocity field and spatial distribution of salinity for time level t 1 87 day is presented in fig 12 very good agreement between the compared results is achieved 5 conclusions to create an effective tool for modelling flow and solute transport induced by arbitrary geometry of natural water bodies the two dimensional coupled lattice boltzmann method for solute transport based on curvilinear technique is considered in this paper for modelling the shallow water flow equations fully transformed into a curvilinear coordinate system the mrt lbm is used while in order to minimize the computational costs of the general flow transport model the curvilinear form of the advection diffusion equation is solved by applying the standard bgk lbm introducing the coordinate transformation approach into the lattice boltzmann model where appropriate form of fully transformed equations in curvilinear coordinate system are solved using the standard square lattice pattern and the basic form of boundary conditions significant improvement in handling complex geometry domains in terms of efficiency and simplicity is achieved similarly to the traditional finite difference method often used in the domain of river hydraulics the complex geometry of natural water bodies is first covered by mesh made up of curvilinear lines which fit the best to the considered geometry and then solution is reached by applying the standard lattice boltzmann approach this way the basic features of the lattice boltzmann method like computational efficiency coming from parallel processing and simplicity in implementing boundary conditions are fully maintained this was verified not only by the standard schematic test but through real natural cases as well the very good agreement between the computed and measured values achieved in all test cases confirms the capability of the proposed cclbm model to simulate flow and flow related processes efficiently in natural water bodies therefore making the cclbm fully competitive compared to the presently available computational models

ca p is a relatively stable fraction of the sedimentary p during the dynamic processes of contamination of the surface sediment and the nonapatite p gets released from the surface sediment during the summer effects of p concentration of the surface water and that of ph on tps variability are not discernable in the current study these results will be useful for controlling phosphorus contamination at river confluences and in river networks keywords river confluence phosphorus surface sediment flocculation sediment contamination 1 introduction river confluences are key nodes where significant changes can occur in hydraulics sediment transport water quality and ecology in a river network because of their importance in a river network a large number of laboratory and field experiments have been done to investigate the flow structures e g mosley 1976 sediment transport e g best 1988 hydro morphological processes e g guillén ludeña et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 pollutant transport e g tang et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 and ecological impacts gualtieri et al 2017 at river confluences over the past 40 years an understanding on the transport mechanism of pollutants at a river confluence is important for the assessment of the water quality and water environment management of a river network because the surface sediment can adsorb desorb or precipitate dissolute nutrient and metal elements sediment effects on the transport of pollutants cannot be ignored as they are responsible for the secondary pollution in a river network therefore this study focuses on the dynamic characteristics of phosphorus p contamination on surface sediment at a river confluence flow and sediment are important agents for p transport and transformation flow at river confluences is characterized by flow stagnation flow deflection flow separation maximum velocity gradual flow recovery shear layers and helical cells best 1987 1988 of particular research interest is the separation zone e g best reid 1984 the shear layer e g rhoads sukhodolov 2004 2008 and the helical flow cells rhoads kenworthy 1995 rhoads et al 2009 bed discordance the difference in bed elevation between two channels and the large lateral advection of the mean flow associated with helical motions can result in distortion of the shear layer biron et al 1996 rhoads sukhodolov 2008 yuan et al 2016 characteristic bed morphology at river confluences mainly consists of a scour hole avalanche faces sediment deposition within the stagnation zone and bars formed within the flow separation zone at the downstream junction corner or mid stream in the post confluence river best 1987 1988 leite ribeiro et al 2012 guillén ludeña et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 qualitative as well as quantitative observations suggest that sediment gets transported essentially in the neighborhood of the scour hole and this acts to maintain the scour mosley 1976 best 1988 szupiany et al 2009 there have been some studies on pollutant transport at river confluences the mixing rate at the downstream side of the junction has been used to explain the mixing processes at confluences for a typical river morphology with a channel width to depth ratio ranging from 10 to 100 complete mixing requires a distance of 100 1000 times the river width however gaudet and roy 1995 observed much faster mixing within 25 channel widths at discordant bed confluences a large discharge ratio and the bed morphology could lead to an increase in mixing intensity tang et al 2018 nonetheless previous studies seldom considered the effects of sediment on the pollutant transport at river confluences xiao et al 2017 attempted to observe the distribution of pollutants on the surface sediment at a confluence in a flume but their experiment contained many limitations and only the impacts of hydrodynamics were considered eutrophication has become a major environmental problem worldwide due to significant alteration in nitrogen n and p cycles gireeshkumar et al 2013 allison et al 2014 anthropogenic activities such as agriculture industrialization and urban development have been linked to increased inputs of nutrients and organic matter into rivers lakes and estuaries which can adversely affect water quality productivity and trophic structure rast thornton 1996 chen et al 2016 primary production is usually limited by p in freshwater and n in seawater gireeshkumar et al 2013 many studies have been done on the effects of sediment on p transformation the amount of phosphate po4 3 in a water body depends on external p loading and its release and retention on sediment garcía de iorio 2003 the mechanisms involved can be chemical adsorption de sorption and precipitation dissolution or biological uptake or release by bacteria and algae excretion by macrofauna in nature jarvie et al 2005 garcía de iorio 2003 sediment properties such as particle size organic matter content ionic strength iron fe and aluminum al oxides cation exchange capacity and the hydrodynamics larrose et al 2010 house et al 1995 also influence the transport of phosphorus some studies have dealt with the spatial adsorption of p in bed sediment particularly in estuaries chomicki et al 2016 mentioned that along shore currents could affect the spatial distribution of p near the mouth of the grand river gireeshkumar et al 2013 investigated the p contamination in the cochin estuary and found the spatial and seasonal variations of calcium bound p ca p and acid soluble organic p were mainly controlled by sediment texture and the organic carbon content the distribution of iron bonded p was mainly controlled by sediment redox conditions and the total p tp content of the surface sediment was mainly controlled by the terrigenous input of organic p the deposition of contaminated suspended sediment in river sections where the bed shear stress and turbulence level are low results in temporary storage of contaminants on the riverbed which can affect bottom dwelling aquatic organisms and other organisms of the food chain rhoads cahill 1999 the current investigation addresses the dynamic characteristics of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence of the huai river china where water and sediment contamination is severe and causes many problems affecting the health of residents and economic losses to the fishery xu et al 2018 the results supplement the existing database on confluence dynamics to include surface sediment contamination they provide an opportunity to identify and analyze the comprehensive influence of river confluences not only confluent flow but also confluent sediment on the water environment of a river network the paper aims to identify the main factors influencing p variability and establish the temporal spatial variability of p the potential influence of sediment flocculation is discussed and a conceptual model of the dynamic processes of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence is presented 2 collection and analysis of field data 2 1 study site the huai river is one of the most important rivers in china spanning between latitudes 30 36 n and longitudes 111 121 e with a catchment area of 270 000 km2 the river originates from tongbai mountain in henan province and flows through henan anhui and jiangsu provinces from west to east before reaching the outlet at the lake hongze the guo river and shaying river are the two major tributaries of the huai river fig 1 the huai river basin is seriously polluted and has been impacted by intensive anthropogenic perturbations with the river itself heavily regulated by dams and sluices zhai et al 2017 a number of large scale water pollution incidents have occurred in the huai river basin endangering the safety of drinking water for approximately 10 million local residents especially over the period from 1992 to 1995 xu et al 2018 the water pollution problem poses a serious threat to the regional social and economic development and has drawn great concern from the government for instance highly polluting factories were closed in order to reduce point source pollution numerous sewage treatment plants were constructed in order to reduce contaminant loads from sewage outfalls through the ninth 1997 2000 tenth 2001 2005 eleventh 2006 2010 and twelfth 2011 2015 five year plans since p is the most severe pollutant in the huai river basin dou et al 2016 the current study has focused on analyzing temporal and spatial patterns of p on the surface sediment a confluence of the huiji river and the guo river in the huai river basin is selected for the field survey fig 1 the huiji river is the largest tributary of the guo river the huiji river receives sewage from kaifeng city henan province and it usually has poorer water quality than the guo river to understand the spatial temporal distribution of p contamination on the surface sediment at the confluence five measuring cross sections including 16 measuring points s1 to s16 were selected fig 1 where two sections c1 and c2 were located upstream of the junction and the remaining three sections c3 c4 and c5 were located downstream of the junction additionally 16 measuring points s17 to s32 were fixed in the main stream of the huai river to compare their contaminant values with the sediment contamination at the river confluence fig 1 2 2 sampling and analysis nine field experiments r1 to r9 were done at the confluence from march 5 2016 to april 15 2017 table 1 in each experiment sixteen surface sediment samples were retrieved at the confluence by a bottom sampler acc to ekman birge 437 210 box size 15 15 20 cm grasping area 225 cm2 weight 7 5 kg at the sampling points marked in fig 1 the top 10 cm of the sediment was recovered using a spatula and then it was immediately placed in polyethylene bags and stored at 4 c in the dark prior to further treatment in the laboratory aliquots were retrieved for grain size analyses using the malvern laser granulometer size range 0 05 878 μm malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd for p analyses a second aliquot was dried to a constant weight in an oven at 50 c powdered and then homogenized with an agate mortar crushed sediment was sealed in polyethylene double sampling bags until analysis was done the amount of tp on sediment tps was measured according to the standards measurement and testing smt programme of the european commission medeiros et al 2005 one additional experiment ar1 was done at the confluence on june 28 2016 for grain size analysis of surface sediment table 1 meanwhile near bottom water samples were collected at the same sites for the measurement of srp soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations using the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method uv 2450 shimadzu based on the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods mepprc 2002 which was done by the huai river basin water resources protection bureau see li li 2003 for quality control procedures dissolved oxygen do ph and water temperature t were measured using a thermo scientific orion star a326 portable ph rdo do meter relative accuracy 0 002 0 2 mg l and 0 1 c for ph do and t respectively the water depth h was measured using a portable ultra sonic depth finder fw sfcc maximum water depth 100 m accuracy 0 3 the bed morphology was measured using a sontec adcp m9 on april 25 2018 at the sampling points shown in fig 1 selective sequential fractioning of p in the sediment samples which was collected on september 15 2016 was done according to the method recommended by zhang 2000 to gain insight into the p in sediment of the study site the following stepwise extraction scheme was used soluble and loosely bound p s l p aluminum al bound p al p iron fe bound p fe p reductant soluble p rs p and ca bound p ca p were selectively extracted by ammonium chloride nh4cl ammonium fluoride nh4f sodium hydroxide naoh sodium dithionite na2s2o4 and sulfuric acid h2so4 respectively see zhang 2000 for details each extraction of p fractionation was repeated three times in addition five field experiments were done along the main stream of the huai river sites s17 to s32 for the measurement of srp and tps before and after the flood season as the flood season in the huai river usually occurs during july and august measurements were done on june 12 and november 11 2014 june 1 and september 5 2016 and june 12 2017 table 1 2 3 investigation on sediment flocculation in order to prove the potential flocculation of sediment from the huiji river and the guo rive an additional experiment was done two 5 l bottles of water containing sediment were sampled close to the bed surface from both upstream tributaries on april 25 2018 the bottles were carried to the laboratory and a 1000 ml water sample was poured into a measuring cup from one of the bottles after allowing it to stand for 10 min in order to get rid of coarse sediment 800 ml of surface water was poured into another measuring cup for formal experiments this sample was exposed to ultrasonic waves using a malvern mastersizer 2000 to break the potential aggregation and flocculation of sediment particles and then the grain sizes of sediment also were obtained using the malvern mastersizer 2000 after exposure to ultrasonic waves the campbell obs 3a monitoring system campbell scientific shepshed loughborough uk maximum concentration range 0 4 5000 mg l for mud turbidity measurement range 0 4 4000 ntu was used to measure the turbidity of the 800 ml water sample after standing for one minute the variation of turbidity was recorded for 20 h the measurement of turbidity was repeated thrice and the results showed consistency the same procedure was applied to the water sample for the other tributary afterwards 400 ml of water sample from both the aforementioned 800 ml water samples already previously exposed to ultrasonic waves was poured into another measuring cup mixed well and exposed to ultrasonic waves using a malvern mastersizer 2000 the same procedure of turbidity measurement was applied to the mixed sample the measurements also were repeated thrice and the results showed this variation also was consistent 2 4 analysis analysis of variance anova correlation analysis and multidimensional scaling mds were done using the statistical package for social sciences version 23 0 the one way anova was done to examine whether there were significant spatial and temporal variations in sedimentary parameters mds was done to compare and establish relations between results for the sampling sites the linear regression and random forests methods were done to evaluate the importance of different factors influencing the spatial and temporal variability of tps by using the r package functions relaimpo and randomforests respectively linear regression is a classical parametric method for the determination of a ranking of the independent variables or an explicit quantification of the relative importance of each independent variable on the response variable grömping 2006 four metrics lmg variable importance assessment by the averaging of r 2 over orderings proposed by lindeman merenda and gold 1980 proportional marginal variance decomposition pmvd feldman 2005 first and last from different regression processes are applied for variable importance assessment a tree based regression approach is useful when variable interactions and complex nonlinear relations between independent variables and the response variable are expected the random forests method is an extension of traditional single tree method from the field of machine learning that combines the predictions of hundreds or thousands of trees to improve stability of prediction accuracy and better cope with the bias and inter correlation among variables breiman 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 p contamination on surface sediment at the confluence values of tps and srp for all experiments in the confluence and the main stream of the huai river are shown in fig 2 the surface sediment in the confluence contained 76 more p than that in the main stream and their values of tps were 0 81 0 41 and 0 46 0 14 mg g respectively where 0 41 and 0 14 mg g are the standard deviations the large range of tps values at the confluence indicates a large temporal and spatial variation in tps there however tps values in the main stream have a much smaller range which could be attributed to the comparatively stable flow and sediment features in the main stream compared with tps the difference of srp between the confluence and the main stream is much smaller the surface water at the confluence contained 32 more p than that in the main stream and their values of srp were 0 145 0 099 and 0 110 0 028 mg l respectively the mds was done to compare the time averaged tps values at different sites s1 s32 the result of the mds analysis fig 3 clearly indicates that three groups can be identified the first one includes sites s17 s32 located along the main stream with low tps values the contamination in the main stream has been strenuously controlled since 1997 when the first of the five year plans in the huai river basin were implemented xu et al 2018 the second one includes sites s1 s9 s13 and s14 and the third group includes sites s10 12 s15 and s16 as stated previously sediment contamination is more severe at the river confluence the second group than in the main stream which may be associated with different flow structures and grain sizes of surface sediment the sites in the third group mainly are located along the thalweg the line of the lowest elevation within the river at post confluence locations it seems that the confluence of rivers promoted contaminant accumulation on the surface sediment as discussed in section 3 5 the sediment samples which were collected on september 15 2016 were used for selective sequential fractionation of p to gain insight into the p in the sediment of the site fig 4 shows that the amount of different forms of p follows the order of ca p rs p fe p s l p al p notably ca p accounts for about 80 of tps on sediments while fe p and al p together account for only about 3 which is critical for p enrichment of sediment wang et al 2009 september 2016 was the month when the sediment was the least contaminated among the 10 field experiments which resulted from the low occurrence of fe p and al p despite a large difference in the grain sizes of sediment samples collected at different sites minimum of median grain size mgs 29 μm maximum of mgs 112 μm the ca p concentration is maintained at a stable level of about 0 27 mg g and is a relatively stable fraction of sedimentary p which has also been suggested by kaiserli et al 2002 3 2 assessment of importance and partial dependence of tps four linear regression metrics lmg pmvd last and first see the r package relaimpo grömping 2006 have been used to assess the importance of variables that may affect the contamination of the surface sediment at the confluence fig 5 a shows that do and mgs may significantly affect p contamination on surface sediment at the confluence r 2 39 66 and the rank of importance follows the order of do mgs h ph t srp in the four models the random forests method has been applied to assess the importance of variables that may nonlinearly affect the p contamination on surface sediment at the confluence a total of one thousand trees are grown and the oob out of bag results are not sensitive to the number of trees when it exceeds 300 fig 5b shows that water temperature t is the most important factor affecting tps variability the underestimation of the effect of t in linear regression can be attributed to a nonlinear relation between t and tps the rank of importance obtained by the random forests method follows the order of t do mgs ph srp h again do and mgs are assessed as important factors that may significantly affect tps at the confluence partial dependence plots describing the relations between the independent variables t do mgs ph srp and h and the response variable tps are shown in fig 6 there is a steep drop in the plot of partial dependence of tps on t when t is about 25 c the total phosphorous tps was high when t is lower than 25 c tps suddenly decreased by about 40 when t was higher than 25 c the influence of water temperature on tps also was demonstrated by jensen and andersen 1992 and wu et al 2014 this phenomenon seems inconsistent with some previous work e g muljadi et al 1966 zhang and huang 2011 as they found increasing temperature increased the phosphate adsorption on sediment these seemingly contradictory conclusions can be related to different composition of sediment and the ambient water environment wu et al 2014 it is also possible that biological activity may play a role on p contamination at high temperatures during summer high temperature can increase the biological activities that consume phosphate leading to a lower phosphate concentration in the water column and promote the desorption of p from the sediment tang and maggi 2016 wu et al 2014 discuss in detail the probable reasons that high temperature is conducive to p release 1 increasing temperatures increase the solubility product of various insoluble compounds and resulting in p release coffman and kildsig 1996 2 rising temperatures lessen the p adsorption capacity of sediments and increase organismal and microbial activities of the sediments to promote biological disturbance and mineralization cornelissen et al 1997 3 increasing temperatures decrease the thickness of the oxidized surface layer and thereby induce release of fe bound p jensen and andersen 1992 4 increasing temperature enhances mineralization of organic matter more co2 is released then more caco3 is expected to precipitate resulting in ca bound p release and 5 decomposing organic matters would produce organic acids most of which have complex effects the chemistry and physics of metal clusters or colloids attracting great and diverse interest that would promote the release of p from sediments gächter and meyer 1993 wu et al 2014 also found that p release was much more pronounced at 30 c than that at other temperatures examined 10 c and 20 c in the current study 25 c was the critical water temperature for p contamination on the surface sediment a similar steep rising step also is seen in the plot of partial dependence of tps on do the critical value of do is about 9 8 mg l as do increases from 5 to 9 8 mg l tps increases gradually from 0 65 to 0 72 mg g whereas tps increases sharply to 0 93 mg g and then remains at a constant level when do is larger than 9 8 mg l variation of do in the water may also be related to increased or decreased biological microbial activity however considering the aerobic or even supersaturated nature of this confluence during the whole year the influence of do on tps should not be significant the influence of do on tps shown in fig 6 is ascribed to the effects of t as do is directly related to t tps decreases exponentially with increasing sediment particle size tps shows a strong dependence on mgs when mgs is smaller than 20 μm silt and clay in line with larrose et al 2010 the results of this study also show that smaller size sediment carries more p these silts and clays are expected to have higher p adsorption capacity than sands due to their larger specific surface area and more active components such as fe al and manganese mn oxides fang et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that for equilibrium the adsorption amount of p on sediment and the adsorption rate in the initial stages increase as the srp concentration in the overlying water increases wang et al 2009 nonetheless the influence of srp on tps is not evident in the current study notably ph also has no significant effect on tps which may be due to its small temporal and spatial variability in this field study however previous studies showed that high ph promoted the release of p bound to metal oxides mainly al and fe which was exchangeable with hydroxide oh and other soluble inorganic p compounds low ph could also promote the release of p bound to the carbonates and hydrolysable organic p jin et al 2006 3 3 temporal variability of p contamination on sediment a one way anova technique was used to study the temporal variation of tps and other factors tps displayed significant temporal variation during the whole year f 29 3 p 0 01 the factors which also displayed significant temporal variation are do f 120 4 p 0 01 t f 1796 8 p 0 01 ph f 13 4 p 0 01 mgs f 6 2 p 0 01 and srp f 5 9 p 0 01 as stated previously do t and mgs were the most important factors influencing tps and are therefore analyzed together with tps temporal variation of these four physical variables is presented in this section fig 7 in general the tps is high in spring and it decreases dramatically to a very low level in summer and increases gradually in autumn and winter although the value of the pearson correlation coefficient cor between tps and t is small cor 0 19 it is known that the relation between them is nonlinear according to the variable importance assessment using the random forests method and t has a significant effect on tps high temperature is conducive to p release whereas low temperature promotes p enrichment tps and do have a much higher pearson correlation coefficient cor 0 68 saturated do in water decreases as t increases the oxygen level in water was at the maximum in march r1 and r8 march 5 2016 and march 15 2017 and the supersaturated do condition occurred which might be due to the strong photosynthesis by algae tps and mgs have a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 47 local maximum mgs occurred at r3 and r5 june 2 and september 15 2016 more so at r5 the temporal variation of mgs can be attributed to the fluvial processes at the river confluence with a larger flow during the flood season the finer sediment gets washed away and leaving coarser sediment at the confluence two flood events occurred during the observation period one in april flood 1 in fig 8 and the other in august flood 2 in fig 8 the flood peak can reach 40 45 m3 s which is at least twice the discharge at other times the local largest grain sizes were found at r3 and r5 rather than at r2 and r4 april 24 and august 2 2016 which were immediately after the floods the peak of sediment transport usually lags that of flow discharge which is common in fluvial processes flood 2 lasts for a longer duration and has a higher peak fig 8 which can be responsible for the maximum mgs value at r5 fig 9 shows the distribution of sand silt and clay in the surface sediment at the confluence from june 2 2016 to december 15 2016 because of flood 1 the surface sediment coarsened on june 2 especially in the tributaries s1 s4 fig 9 however on june 28 and august 2 the surface sediment seemed to recover gradually and the surface sediment became finer fig 7 even in the tributaries the amount of silt and clay was about 50 60 of the total surface sediment because of flood 2 the amount of silt and clay decreased at almost every site and their percentages decreased to 30 40 in the tributaries strong flow and turbulence decrease the content of silt and clay from 42 55 to 20 27 respectively in the post confluence main stream fig 9 in october and december the amount of silt and clay was gradually recovered in the deep water area of the post confluence reach accounting for 50 60 of the surface sediment at sites s10 s11 s15 and s16 respectively this process illustrates the transport of sediment and variation of the surface sediment texture fig 10 shows the temporal variability of tps and mgs for the the two tributaries sites s1 s4 and the scour hole sites s10 and s11 because of flood 1 the surface sediment coarsened in the tributaries in r3 and the tps in the tributaries decreased tps in the deep hole area substantially increased in r2 and r3 in addition the sediment particle sizes remain largely unchanged as a consequence of flood 2 the sediment coarsened and caused a decrease in the tps at all the sites these observations indicate that the first flood conveys more contaminated sediment particles which have continuously been contaminated from the earlier accumulation period i e last winter to the confluence from the two upstream tributaries where changes in the sediment sizes had taken place however in general the first flood decreased the p contamination of the surface sediment fig 7 the second flood made the surface sediment coarsen and tps decrease at all the sites due to the flood s much longer duration coupled with a larger discharge such a variability of tps can deteriorate the water quality downstream in the river especially during the low floods 3 4 spatial variability of p contamination on sediment the principal morphological features proposed by best 1988 have also been identified at this confluence including a scour hole bank attached lateral bars tributary mouth bars and a region of sediment accumulation near the upstream confluence corner fig 1 table 2 lists the time averaged data of tps and its potential influencing factors fig 1 shows that the huiji river is about 4 m deeper than the upstream guo river the thalweg of the huiji river is closer to the left bank and that of the post confluence channel is closer to the right bank a deep scour hole is observed in the midstream of cross section c4 which is about 3 4 m deeper than the ambient bed surface srp in the huiji river is higher than that in the guo river their difference is still pronounced at c3 and c4 while the transverse mixing of the two confluent flows leads to a uniform concentration at c5 their values of t differ by about 1 c and ph values differ by about 0 4 however both turn uniform transversely after the confluence of the two tributaries at c3 do values of the two incoming flows differ by 1 mg l and the difference gradually decreases downstream and almost disappears at c4 it is noted that water in the post confluence reach has higher do values than the upstream values ahead of the confluence especially at c4 and c5 flow confluence strengthens the turbulence of the water body and can cause more reaeration the sediment distributed in the deep water regions is finer than the sediment distributed close to the river banks the influencing variables of the two upstream rivers are compared with the variables in the post confluence reach to show the effects of the confluence the variables of the two tributaries are averaged to represent the status before the confluence the variable values at c4 are used to represent the status after the confluence due to the confluence tps increased by 26 5 from 0 68 mg g to 0 86 mg g that is the confluence enhances the p contamination on the surface sediment compared to the temporal influence the spatial influence of t and do on tps is not apparent in section 3 1 the samples at the confluence have been divided into two groups s10 s12 s15 and s16 for one group with higher tps and the others in the second group with lower tps as shown in table 2 the pearson correlation coefficients show the strongest linear relation between time averaged data of h and tps cor 0 79 and there is a milder negative linear correlation between time averaged data of mgs and tps cor 0 37 therefore only the spatial variations of tps h and mgs are discussed the two parameters h and mgs are location dependent variables in general a high amount of p accumulates on the surface sediment in the local deep water areas or main stream zone where comparatively finer sediment gets deposited the spatial variation of p is a manifestation of the effects of bed morphology water flow and sediment characteristics and its transportation xiao et al 2017 found that downwelling flow accompanied by high flow velocity could induce more p to get absorbed onto the bed sediment at a confluence in a flume experiment the explanation was that downwelling flow improves the hyporheic exchange and increases the contact of srp and sediment however this conjecture could not explain why fine sediment tends to accumulate in the deep water areas detailed discussion on this phenomenon is included in section 3 5 3 5 discussion on potential influence of sediment flocculation on tps the surface sediment in the scour hole sites s10 and s11 was finer than that in the two upstream tributaries sites s1 s4 except in september the phenomenon cannot be fully explained by hydro sedimentology since the flow velocity in the scour hole is higher than or at least equal to that in the upstream tributaries therefore the grain sizes in the scour hole should not be finer than that in the upstream tributaries yuan et al 2018 this feature is related to other factors e g flocculation of suspended sediment however it is very difficult to directly observe the sediment flocculation krishnappan 2000 the additional experiment was done section 2 3 in order to prove the foregoing conjecture the mgs of the huiji river guo river and the mixed sample measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 were 6 1 13 2 and 10 3 μm respectively fig 11 a the turbidity of the sample from the huiji river was much higher than that from the guo river which was consistent with the higher concentration of suspended load in the huiji river the variation of the turbidity of the mixed sample with time was very interesting fig 11b the turbidity of the mixed sample should be between the two separate upstream samples throughout the experiment if no physical and or chemical changes occurred fig 11b shows that this is true only for the first 16 min after which the turbidity of the mixed sample was higher than both separate upstream samples the increase of the grain sizes of sediment can cause an increase in the turbidity using an optical backscatter obs device when the concentration of suspended load remains unchanged thus sediment flocculation can occur and grain sizes can increase when samples from the two tributaries are mixed about 20 h later the turbidity of the huiji river guo river and the mixed sample is 36 5 8 6 and 22 4 ntu respectively not shown in fig 11b which seems to be reasonable that is sediment flocculation lasts for a longer duration and makes the turbidity of the mixed sample larger than for the huiji river and the guo river however after a sufficiently long period of time sediment flocs settle to the bottom and the influence of sediment flocculation on turbidity disappears and thus the turbidity of the mixed sample becomes smaller than that in the huiji river for measuring in situ sediment flocculation other than recording the turbidity more advanced techniques can be adopted in future e g macdonald and mullarney 2015 3 6 dynamics of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence in the non flood season flow rates and flow velocities are low silts and clays grain sizes 20 μm are well distributed in the river with the finer sediment occurring as suspended load and the coarser sediment on the river bed as the bedload fig 12 the suspended silts and clays usually carry a larger tp concentration than the bedload as they are finer in size the suspended loads from the upstream tributary are carried downstream by the low water flow when two streams join at the confluence a weak turbulence and shearing of flow occur causing the two flows to mix weak turbulence brings about the collision of silt particles which may result in flocculation and desorption of the suspended load the weak shear flow may not be able to break the flocs formed small velocities allow the sediment flocs to settle onto the river bed within a small streamwise distance settling of these silt particles yields grain sizes of bed sediment in the post confluence reach that are smaller than those upstream in the two tributaries therefore the tp concentration at the river confluence is much higher than in the two tributaries flow rate and velocity are much higher in the flood season than in the non flood season the silts and clays can get distributed in the surface water as suspended load but mainly sand grain sizes 20 μm remains on the river bed as bedload fig 12 the bedload in the flood season usually carries a much smaller tp concentration than in the non flood season due to the prevailing large grain sizes most of the p in these bedloads is in the form of ca p and ca p is a relatively stable fraction of the sedimentary p which contributes to the permanent storage of p in the sediment kaiserli et al 2002 when two stream flows join at a river confluence a strong turbulence and shear flow occur and the two flows mix thoroughly strong turbulence and shear flow are conducive to collision of silt particles but not conducive to flocculation of the suspended loads even if flocculation occurs high flow velocities can carry the suspension over a long distance moreover high temperature during summer can increase biological activities and increased microbial activity in warmer water can alter the flocculation of suspended sediment by decreasing the settling velocity maggi and tang 2015 this may also decrease the sedimentation of particulate p the strong turbulence and the presence of helical motion yuan et al 2018 can cause the erosion of bed sediment in the post confluence reach this will result in much larger grain sizes being present in the post confluence reach than those prevailing in the two upstream tributaries however the main form of p in the bedload is stable ca p and these sediment particles share the same source for causing the ca p concentration in sediment to be comparable therefore the tps at the confluence is similar to the tps in the two upstream tributaries the first flood often can convey more contaminated sediment downstream the subsequent large floods can make the surface sediment coarsen and the tps decrease the water temperature is one of the main external factors affecting the interaction of sediment with p and higher water temperatures cause a large increase in the solubility of some insoluble compounds thereby releasing p therefore low water temperatures 25 c in the winter and spring promote p enrichment on the bed sediment on the other hand high water temperatures 25 c in summer promote p mainly non apatite p release from the bed sediment 4 conclusions the dynamic characteristics of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence has been investigated through a field survey the important conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 phosphorus contamination of the surface sediment at a river confluence is more severe than that of the main streams of the river network to which the river confluence belongs and it is independent of the p contamination of the surface water 2 a river confluence promotes the immobilization of p onto the surface sediment especially in the deep water areas where flocculation and settling of the contaminated suspended sediment takes place 3 flocculation of suspended sediment at a river confluence can decrease the grain sizes of the surface sediment in the deep water areas the exception being in the flood season 4 in the annual water cycle the first flood often can convey more contaminated sediment to the downstream of the river whereas the subsequent larger flood can cause the coarsening of the surface sediment decreasing the tp amount on the sediment 5 during floods sorting of the sediment occurs resulting in coarse grains at the river confluence especially in the deep water area due to the strong shear flow and turbulence the high water temperature coupled with coarsening of sediment cause the lowest p contamination of the surface sediment in the summer 6 the texture of the surface sediment i e the proportion of fine 20 μm and coarse sediment is important for the temporal and spatial distribution of tp on the surface sediment 7 water temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the temporal variability of tp on the surface sediment at a river confluence the critical value of water temperature is 25 c and higher p amounts get adsorbed onto the surface of sediment particles when water temperature is lower i e in winter and spring 8 ca p is a relatively stable fraction of sedimentary p in the dynamic processes of p contamination at a river confluence and the non apatite p can get released from the surface sediment during the summer 9 the temporal and spatial variability of ph is very small and its influence on the tps is not discernable from the current field study the effects of srp concentration in the surface water also are not discernable either in the river confluence or in the main stream of the huai river basin although these results are obtained at a specific river confluence they may be applicable for other similar river confluences furthermore some of these results can be applied to other water bodies like estuaries and lakes as regards the effects of water temperature on the temporal variability of p in the surface sediment declaration of interests the authors

6534,river confluences are key features of a river network and their effects on contaminant transport and transformation need to be understood to control the contamination of a river network this paper investigates the dynamic characteristics of phosphorus p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence of the huai river china where water and sediment contamination is severe the results highlight that p contamination of the surface sediment at a river confluence is more severe than that of the main stream of the river network to which the river confluence belongs floods have critical impact on the transport of sediment and its surface texture in the annual water cycle the initial small flood can convey much more contaminated sediment and pollute the downstream river whereas the subsequent large flood leads to the coarsening of the surface sediment and decrease of the total p tp content on the surface sediment tps water temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the temporal variability of the tps at the river confluence higher p amounts are adsorbed on the surface sediment during lower water temperatures in winter and spring calcium bound p ca p is a relatively stable fraction of the sedimentary p during the dynamic processes of contamination of the surface sediment and the nonapatite p gets released from the surface sediment during the summer effects of p concentration of the surface water and that of ph on tps variability are not discernable in the current study these results will be useful for controlling phosphorus contamination at river confluences and in river networks keywords river confluence phosphorus surface sediment flocculation sediment contamination 1 introduction river confluences are key nodes where significant changes can occur in hydraulics sediment transport water quality and ecology in a river network because of their importance in a river network a large number of laboratory and field experiments have been done to investigate the flow structures e g mosley 1976 sediment transport e g best 1988 hydro morphological processes e g guillén ludeña et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 pollutant transport e g tang et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 and ecological impacts gualtieri et al 2017 at river confluences over the past 40 years an understanding on the transport mechanism of pollutants at a river confluence is important for the assessment of the water quality and water environment management of a river network because the surface sediment can adsorb desorb or precipitate dissolute nutrient and metal elements sediment effects on the transport of pollutants cannot be ignored as they are responsible for the secondary pollution in a river network therefore this study focuses on the dynamic characteristics of phosphorus p contamination on surface sediment at a river confluence flow and sediment are important agents for p transport and transformation flow at river confluences is characterized by flow stagnation flow deflection flow separation maximum velocity gradual flow recovery shear layers and helical cells best 1987 1988 of particular research interest is the separation zone e g best reid 1984 the shear layer e g rhoads sukhodolov 2004 2008 and the helical flow cells rhoads kenworthy 1995 rhoads et al 2009 bed discordance the difference in bed elevation between two channels and the large lateral advection of the mean flow associated with helical motions can result in distortion of the shear layer biron et al 1996 rhoads sukhodolov 2008 yuan et al 2016 characteristic bed morphology at river confluences mainly consists of a scour hole avalanche faces sediment deposition within the stagnation zone and bars formed within the flow separation zone at the downstream junction corner or mid stream in the post confluence river best 1987 1988 leite ribeiro et al 2012 guillén ludeña et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 qualitative as well as quantitative observations suggest that sediment gets transported essentially in the neighborhood of the scour hole and this acts to maintain the scour mosley 1976 best 1988 szupiany et al 2009 there have been some studies on pollutant transport at river confluences the mixing rate at the downstream side of the junction has been used to explain the mixing processes at confluences for a typical river morphology with a channel width to depth ratio ranging from 10 to 100 complete mixing requires a distance of 100 1000 times the river width however gaudet and roy 1995 observed much faster mixing within 25 channel widths at discordant bed confluences a large discharge ratio and the bed morphology could lead to an increase in mixing intensity tang et al 2018 nonetheless previous studies seldom considered the effects of sediment on the pollutant transport at river confluences xiao et al 2017 attempted to observe the distribution of pollutants on the surface sediment at a confluence in a flume but their experiment contained many limitations and only the impacts of hydrodynamics were considered eutrophication has become a major environmental problem worldwide due to significant alteration in nitrogen n and p cycles gireeshkumar et al 2013 allison et al 2014 anthropogenic activities such as agriculture industrialization and urban development have been linked to increased inputs of nutrients and organic matter into rivers lakes and estuaries which can adversely affect water quality productivity and trophic structure rast thornton 1996 chen et al 2016 primary production is usually limited by p in freshwater and n in seawater gireeshkumar et al 2013 many studies have been done on the effects of sediment on p transformation the amount of phosphate po4 3 in a water body depends on external p loading and its release and retention on sediment garcía de iorio 2003 the mechanisms involved can be chemical adsorption de sorption and precipitation dissolution or biological uptake or release by bacteria and algae excretion by macrofauna in nature jarvie et al 2005 garcía de iorio 2003 sediment properties such as particle size organic matter content ionic strength iron fe and aluminum al oxides cation exchange capacity and the hydrodynamics larrose et al 2010 house et al 1995 also influence the transport of phosphorus some studies have dealt with the spatial adsorption of p in bed sediment particularly in estuaries chomicki et al 2016 mentioned that along shore currents could affect the spatial distribution of p near the mouth of the grand river gireeshkumar et al 2013 investigated the p contamination in the cochin estuary and found the spatial and seasonal variations of calcium bound p ca p and acid soluble organic p were mainly controlled by sediment texture and the organic carbon content the distribution of iron bonded p was mainly controlled by sediment redox conditions and the total p tp content of the surface sediment was mainly controlled by the terrigenous input of organic p the deposition of contaminated suspended sediment in river sections where the bed shear stress and turbulence level are low results in temporary storage of contaminants on the riverbed which can affect bottom dwelling aquatic organisms and other organisms of the food chain rhoads cahill 1999 the current investigation addresses the dynamic characteristics of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence of the huai river china where water and sediment contamination is severe and causes many problems affecting the health of residents and economic losses to the fishery xu et al 2018 the results supplement the existing database on confluence dynamics to include surface sediment contamination they provide an opportunity to identify and analyze the comprehensive influence of river confluences not only confluent flow but also confluent sediment on the water environment of a river network the paper aims to identify the main factors influencing p variability and establish the temporal spatial variability of p the potential influence of sediment flocculation is discussed and a conceptual model of the dynamic processes of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence is presented 2 collection and analysis of field data 2 1 study site the huai river is one of the most important rivers in china spanning between latitudes 30 36 n and longitudes 111 121 e with a catchment area of 270 000 km2 the river originates from tongbai mountain in henan province and flows through henan anhui and jiangsu provinces from west to east before reaching the outlet at the lake hongze the guo river and shaying river are the two major tributaries of the huai river fig 1 the huai river basin is seriously polluted and has been impacted by intensive anthropogenic perturbations with the river itself heavily regulated by dams and sluices zhai et al 2017 a number of large scale water pollution incidents have occurred in the huai river basin endangering the safety of drinking water for approximately 10 million local residents especially over the period from 1992 to 1995 xu et al 2018 the water pollution problem poses a serious threat to the regional social and economic development and has drawn great concern from the government for instance highly polluting factories were closed in order to reduce point source pollution numerous sewage treatment plants were constructed in order to reduce contaminant loads from sewage outfalls through the ninth 1997 2000 tenth 2001 2005 eleventh 2006 2010 and twelfth 2011 2015 five year plans since p is the most severe pollutant in the huai river basin dou et al 2016 the current study has focused on analyzing temporal and spatial patterns of p on the surface sediment a confluence of the huiji river and the guo river in the huai river basin is selected for the field survey fig 1 the huiji river is the largest tributary of the guo river the huiji river receives sewage from kaifeng city henan province and it usually has poorer water quality than the guo river to understand the spatial temporal distribution of p contamination on the surface sediment at the confluence five measuring cross sections including 16 measuring points s1 to s16 were selected fig 1 where two sections c1 and c2 were located upstream of the junction and the remaining three sections c3 c4 and c5 were located downstream of the junction additionally 16 measuring points s17 to s32 were fixed in the main stream of the huai river to compare their contaminant values with the sediment contamination at the river confluence fig 1 2 2 sampling and analysis nine field experiments r1 to r9 were done at the confluence from march 5 2016 to april 15 2017 table 1 in each experiment sixteen surface sediment samples were retrieved at the confluence by a bottom sampler acc to ekman birge 437 210 box size 15 15 20 cm grasping area 225 cm2 weight 7 5 kg at the sampling points marked in fig 1 the top 10 cm of the sediment was recovered using a spatula and then it was immediately placed in polyethylene bags and stored at 4 c in the dark prior to further treatment in the laboratory aliquots were retrieved for grain size analyses using the malvern laser granulometer size range 0 05 878 μm malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd for p analyses a second aliquot was dried to a constant weight in an oven at 50 c powdered and then homogenized with an agate mortar crushed sediment was sealed in polyethylene double sampling bags until analysis was done the amount of tp on sediment tps was measured according to the standards measurement and testing smt programme of the european commission medeiros et al 2005 one additional experiment ar1 was done at the confluence on june 28 2016 for grain size analysis of surface sediment table 1 meanwhile near bottom water samples were collected at the same sites for the measurement of srp soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations using the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method uv 2450 shimadzu based on the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods mepprc 2002 which was done by the huai river basin water resources protection bureau see li li 2003 for quality control procedures dissolved oxygen do ph and water temperature t were measured using a thermo scientific orion star a326 portable ph rdo do meter relative accuracy 0 002 0 2 mg l and 0 1 c for ph do and t respectively the water depth h was measured using a portable ultra sonic depth finder fw sfcc maximum water depth 100 m accuracy 0 3 the bed morphology was measured using a sontec adcp m9 on april 25 2018 at the sampling points shown in fig 1 selective sequential fractioning of p in the sediment samples which was collected on september 15 2016 was done according to the method recommended by zhang 2000 to gain insight into the p in sediment of the study site the following stepwise extraction scheme was used soluble and loosely bound p s l p aluminum al bound p al p iron fe bound p fe p reductant soluble p rs p and ca bound p ca p were selectively extracted by ammonium chloride nh4cl ammonium fluoride nh4f sodium hydroxide naoh sodium dithionite na2s2o4 and sulfuric acid h2so4 respectively see zhang 2000 for details each extraction of p fractionation was repeated three times in addition five field experiments were done along the main stream of the huai river sites s17 to s32 for the measurement of srp and tps before and after the flood season as the flood season in the huai river usually occurs during july and august measurements were done on june 12 and november 11 2014 june 1 and september 5 2016 and june 12 2017 table 1 2 3 investigation on sediment flocculation in order to prove the potential flocculation of sediment from the huiji river and the guo rive an additional experiment was done two 5 l bottles of water containing sediment were sampled close to the bed surface from both upstream tributaries on april 25 2018 the bottles were carried to the laboratory and a 1000 ml water sample was poured into a measuring cup from one of the bottles after allowing it to stand for 10 min in order to get rid of coarse sediment 800 ml of surface water was poured into another measuring cup for formal experiments this sample was exposed to ultrasonic waves using a malvern mastersizer 2000 to break the potential aggregation and flocculation of sediment particles and then the grain sizes of sediment also were obtained using the malvern mastersizer 2000 after exposure to ultrasonic waves the campbell obs 3a monitoring system campbell scientific shepshed loughborough uk maximum concentration range 0 4 5000 mg l for mud turbidity measurement range 0 4 4000 ntu was used to measure the turbidity of the 800 ml water sample after standing for one minute the variation of turbidity was recorded for 20 h the measurement of turbidity was repeated thrice and the results showed consistency the same procedure was applied to the water sample for the other tributary afterwards 400 ml of water sample from both the aforementioned 800 ml water samples already previously exposed to ultrasonic waves was poured into another measuring cup mixed well and exposed to ultrasonic waves using a malvern mastersizer 2000 the same procedure of turbidity measurement was applied to the mixed sample the measurements also were repeated thrice and the results showed this variation also was consistent 2 4 analysis analysis of variance anova correlation analysis and multidimensional scaling mds were done using the statistical package for social sciences version 23 0 the one way anova was done to examine whether there were significant spatial and temporal variations in sedimentary parameters mds was done to compare and establish relations between results for the sampling sites the linear regression and random forests methods were done to evaluate the importance of different factors influencing the spatial and temporal variability of tps by using the r package functions relaimpo and randomforests respectively linear regression is a classical parametric method for the determination of a ranking of the independent variables or an explicit quantification of the relative importance of each independent variable on the response variable grömping 2006 four metrics lmg variable importance assessment by the averaging of r 2 over orderings proposed by lindeman merenda and gold 1980 proportional marginal variance decomposition pmvd feldman 2005 first and last from different regression processes are applied for variable importance assessment a tree based regression approach is useful when variable interactions and complex nonlinear relations between independent variables and the response variable are expected the random forests method is an extension of traditional single tree method from the field of machine learning that combines the predictions of hundreds or thousands of trees to improve stability of prediction accuracy and better cope with the bias and inter correlation among variables breiman 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 p contamination on surface sediment at the confluence values of tps and srp for all experiments in the confluence and the main stream of the huai river are shown in fig 2 the surface sediment in the confluence contained 76 more p than that in the main stream and their values of tps were 0 81 0 41 and 0 46 0 14 mg g respectively where 0 41 and 0 14 mg g are the standard deviations the large range of tps values at the confluence indicates a large temporal and spatial variation in tps there however tps values in the main stream have a much smaller range which could be attributed to the comparatively stable flow and sediment features in the main stream compared with tps the difference of srp between the confluence and the main stream is much smaller the surface water at the confluence contained 32 more p than that in the main stream and their values of srp were 0 145 0 099 and 0 110 0 028 mg l respectively the mds was done to compare the time averaged tps values at different sites s1 s32 the result of the mds analysis fig 3 clearly indicates that three groups can be identified the first one includes sites s17 s32 located along the main stream with low tps values the contamination in the main stream has been strenuously controlled since 1997 when the first of the five year plans in the huai river basin were implemented xu et al 2018 the second one includes sites s1 s9 s13 and s14 and the third group includes sites s10 12 s15 and s16 as stated previously sediment contamination is more severe at the river confluence the second group than in the main stream which may be associated with different flow structures and grain sizes of surface sediment the sites in the third group mainly are located along the thalweg the line of the lowest elevation within the river at post confluence locations it seems that the confluence of rivers promoted contaminant accumulation on the surface sediment as discussed in section 3 5 the sediment samples which were collected on september 15 2016 were used for selective sequential fractionation of p to gain insight into the p in the sediment of the site fig 4 shows that the amount of different forms of p follows the order of ca p rs p fe p s l p al p notably ca p accounts for about 80 of tps on sediments while fe p and al p together account for only about 3 which is critical for p enrichment of sediment wang et al 2009 september 2016 was the month when the sediment was the least contaminated among the 10 field experiments which resulted from the low occurrence of fe p and al p despite a large difference in the grain sizes of sediment samples collected at different sites minimum of median grain size mgs 29 μm maximum of mgs 112 μm the ca p concentration is maintained at a stable level of about 0 27 mg g and is a relatively stable fraction of sedimentary p which has also been suggested by kaiserli et al 2002 3 2 assessment of importance and partial dependence of tps four linear regression metrics lmg pmvd last and first see the r package relaimpo grömping 2006 have been used to assess the importance of variables that may affect the contamination of the surface sediment at the confluence fig 5 a shows that do and mgs may significantly affect p contamination on surface sediment at the confluence r 2 39 66 and the rank of importance follows the order of do mgs h ph t srp in the four models the random forests method has been applied to assess the importance of variables that may nonlinearly affect the p contamination on surface sediment at the confluence a total of one thousand trees are grown and the oob out of bag results are not sensitive to the number of trees when it exceeds 300 fig 5b shows that water temperature t is the most important factor affecting tps variability the underestimation of the effect of t in linear regression can be attributed to a nonlinear relation between t and tps the rank of importance obtained by the random forests method follows the order of t do mgs ph srp h again do and mgs are assessed as important factors that may significantly affect tps at the confluence partial dependence plots describing the relations between the independent variables t do mgs ph srp and h and the response variable tps are shown in fig 6 there is a steep drop in the plot of partial dependence of tps on t when t is about 25 c the total phosphorous tps was high when t is lower than 25 c tps suddenly decreased by about 40 when t was higher than 25 c the influence of water temperature on tps also was demonstrated by jensen and andersen 1992 and wu et al 2014 this phenomenon seems inconsistent with some previous work e g muljadi et al 1966 zhang and huang 2011 as they found increasing temperature increased the phosphate adsorption on sediment these seemingly contradictory conclusions can be related to different composition of sediment and the ambient water environment wu et al 2014 it is also possible that biological activity may play a role on p contamination at high temperatures during summer high temperature can increase the biological activities that consume phosphate leading to a lower phosphate concentration in the water column and promote the desorption of p from the sediment tang and maggi 2016 wu et al 2014 discuss in detail the probable reasons that high temperature is conducive to p release 1 increasing temperatures increase the solubility product of various insoluble compounds and resulting in p release coffman and kildsig 1996 2 rising temperatures lessen the p adsorption capacity of sediments and increase organismal and microbial activities of the sediments to promote biological disturbance and mineralization cornelissen et al 1997 3 increasing temperatures decrease the thickness of the oxidized surface layer and thereby induce release of fe bound p jensen and andersen 1992 4 increasing temperature enhances mineralization of organic matter more co2 is released then more caco3 is expected to precipitate resulting in ca bound p release and 5 decomposing organic matters would produce organic acids most of which have complex effects the chemistry and physics of metal clusters or colloids attracting great and diverse interest that would promote the release of p from sediments gächter and meyer 1993 wu et al 2014 also found that p release was much more pronounced at 30 c than that at other temperatures examined 10 c and 20 c in the current study 25 c was the critical water temperature for p contamination on the surface sediment a similar steep rising step also is seen in the plot of partial dependence of tps on do the critical value of do is about 9 8 mg l as do increases from 5 to 9 8 mg l tps increases gradually from 0 65 to 0 72 mg g whereas tps increases sharply to 0 93 mg g and then remains at a constant level when do is larger than 9 8 mg l variation of do in the water may also be related to increased or decreased biological microbial activity however considering the aerobic or even supersaturated nature of this confluence during the whole year the influence of do on tps should not be significant the influence of do on tps shown in fig 6 is ascribed to the effects of t as do is directly related to t tps decreases exponentially with increasing sediment particle size tps shows a strong dependence on mgs when mgs is smaller than 20 μm silt and clay in line with larrose et al 2010 the results of this study also show that smaller size sediment carries more p these silts and clays are expected to have higher p adsorption capacity than sands due to their larger specific surface area and more active components such as fe al and manganese mn oxides fang et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that for equilibrium the adsorption amount of p on sediment and the adsorption rate in the initial stages increase as the srp concentration in the overlying water increases wang et al 2009 nonetheless the influence of srp on tps is not evident in the current study notably ph also has no significant effect on tps which may be due to its small temporal and spatial variability in this field study however previous studies showed that high ph promoted the release of p bound to metal oxides mainly al and fe which was exchangeable with hydroxide oh and other soluble inorganic p compounds low ph could also promote the release of p bound to the carbonates and hydrolysable organic p jin et al 2006 3 3 temporal variability of p contamination on sediment a one way anova technique was used to study the temporal variation of tps and other factors tps displayed significant temporal variation during the whole year f 29 3 p 0 01 the factors which also displayed significant temporal variation are do f 120 4 p 0 01 t f 1796 8 p 0 01 ph f 13 4 p 0 01 mgs f 6 2 p 0 01 and srp f 5 9 p 0 01 as stated previously do t and mgs were the most important factors influencing tps and are therefore analyzed together with tps temporal variation of these four physical variables is presented in this section fig 7 in general the tps is high in spring and it decreases dramatically to a very low level in summer and increases gradually in autumn and winter although the value of the pearson correlation coefficient cor between tps and t is small cor 0 19 it is known that the relation between them is nonlinear according to the variable importance assessment using the random forests method and t has a significant effect on tps high temperature is conducive to p release whereas low temperature promotes p enrichment tps and do have a much higher pearson correlation coefficient cor 0 68 saturated do in water decreases as t increases the oxygen level in water was at the maximum in march r1 and r8 march 5 2016 and march 15 2017 and the supersaturated do condition occurred which might be due to the strong photosynthesis by algae tps and mgs have a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 47 local maximum mgs occurred at r3 and r5 june 2 and september 15 2016 more so at r5 the temporal variation of mgs can be attributed to the fluvial processes at the river confluence with a larger flow during the flood season the finer sediment gets washed away and leaving coarser sediment at the confluence two flood events occurred during the observation period one in april flood 1 in fig 8 and the other in august flood 2 in fig 8 the flood peak can reach 40 45 m3 s which is at least twice the discharge at other times the local largest grain sizes were found at r3 and r5 rather than at r2 and r4 april 24 and august 2 2016 which were immediately after the floods the peak of sediment transport usually lags that of flow discharge which is common in fluvial processes flood 2 lasts for a longer duration and has a higher peak fig 8 which can be responsible for the maximum mgs value at r5 fig 9 shows the distribution of sand silt and clay in the surface sediment at the confluence from june 2 2016 to december 15 2016 because of flood 1 the surface sediment coarsened on june 2 especially in the tributaries s1 s4 fig 9 however on june 28 and august 2 the surface sediment seemed to recover gradually and the surface sediment became finer fig 7 even in the tributaries the amount of silt and clay was about 50 60 of the total surface sediment because of flood 2 the amount of silt and clay decreased at almost every site and their percentages decreased to 30 40 in the tributaries strong flow and turbulence decrease the content of silt and clay from 42 55 to 20 27 respectively in the post confluence main stream fig 9 in october and december the amount of silt and clay was gradually recovered in the deep water area of the post confluence reach accounting for 50 60 of the surface sediment at sites s10 s11 s15 and s16 respectively this process illustrates the transport of sediment and variation of the surface sediment texture fig 10 shows the temporal variability of tps and mgs for the the two tributaries sites s1 s4 and the scour hole sites s10 and s11 because of flood 1 the surface sediment coarsened in the tributaries in r3 and the tps in the tributaries decreased tps in the deep hole area substantially increased in r2 and r3 in addition the sediment particle sizes remain largely unchanged as a consequence of flood 2 the sediment coarsened and caused a decrease in the tps at all the sites these observations indicate that the first flood conveys more contaminated sediment particles which have continuously been contaminated from the earlier accumulation period i e last winter to the confluence from the two upstream tributaries where changes in the sediment sizes had taken place however in general the first flood decreased the p contamination of the surface sediment fig 7 the second flood made the surface sediment coarsen and tps decrease at all the sites due to the flood s much longer duration coupled with a larger discharge such a variability of tps can deteriorate the water quality downstream in the river especially during the low floods 3 4 spatial variability of p contamination on sediment the principal morphological features proposed by best 1988 have also been identified at this confluence including a scour hole bank attached lateral bars tributary mouth bars and a region of sediment accumulation near the upstream confluence corner fig 1 table 2 lists the time averaged data of tps and its potential influencing factors fig 1 shows that the huiji river is about 4 m deeper than the upstream guo river the thalweg of the huiji river is closer to the left bank and that of the post confluence channel is closer to the right bank a deep scour hole is observed in the midstream of cross section c4 which is about 3 4 m deeper than the ambient bed surface srp in the huiji river is higher than that in the guo river their difference is still pronounced at c3 and c4 while the transverse mixing of the two confluent flows leads to a uniform concentration at c5 their values of t differ by about 1 c and ph values differ by about 0 4 however both turn uniform transversely after the confluence of the two tributaries at c3 do values of the two incoming flows differ by 1 mg l and the difference gradually decreases downstream and almost disappears at c4 it is noted that water in the post confluence reach has higher do values than the upstream values ahead of the confluence especially at c4 and c5 flow confluence strengthens the turbulence of the water body and can cause more reaeration the sediment distributed in the deep water regions is finer than the sediment distributed close to the river banks the influencing variables of the two upstream rivers are compared with the variables in the post confluence reach to show the effects of the confluence the variables of the two tributaries are averaged to represent the status before the confluence the variable values at c4 are used to represent the status after the confluence due to the confluence tps increased by 26 5 from 0 68 mg g to 0 86 mg g that is the confluence enhances the p contamination on the surface sediment compared to the temporal influence the spatial influence of t and do on tps is not apparent in section 3 1 the samples at the confluence have been divided into two groups s10 s12 s15 and s16 for one group with higher tps and the others in the second group with lower tps as shown in table 2 the pearson correlation coefficients show the strongest linear relation between time averaged data of h and tps cor 0 79 and there is a milder negative linear correlation between time averaged data of mgs and tps cor 0 37 therefore only the spatial variations of tps h and mgs are discussed the two parameters h and mgs are location dependent variables in general a high amount of p accumulates on the surface sediment in the local deep water areas or main stream zone where comparatively finer sediment gets deposited the spatial variation of p is a manifestation of the effects of bed morphology water flow and sediment characteristics and its transportation xiao et al 2017 found that downwelling flow accompanied by high flow velocity could induce more p to get absorbed onto the bed sediment at a confluence in a flume experiment the explanation was that downwelling flow improves the hyporheic exchange and increases the contact of srp and sediment however this conjecture could not explain why fine sediment tends to accumulate in the deep water areas detailed discussion on this phenomenon is included in section 3 5 3 5 discussion on potential influence of sediment flocculation on tps the surface sediment in the scour hole sites s10 and s11 was finer than that in the two upstream tributaries sites s1 s4 except in september the phenomenon cannot be fully explained by hydro sedimentology since the flow velocity in the scour hole is higher than or at least equal to that in the upstream tributaries therefore the grain sizes in the scour hole should not be finer than that in the upstream tributaries yuan et al 2018 this feature is related to other factors e g flocculation of suspended sediment however it is very difficult to directly observe the sediment flocculation krishnappan 2000 the additional experiment was done section 2 3 in order to prove the foregoing conjecture the mgs of the huiji river guo river and the mixed sample measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 were 6 1 13 2 and 10 3 μm respectively fig 11 a the turbidity of the sample from the huiji river was much higher than that from the guo river which was consistent with the higher concentration of suspended load in the huiji river the variation of the turbidity of the mixed sample with time was very interesting fig 11b the turbidity of the mixed sample should be between the two separate upstream samples throughout the experiment if no physical and or chemical changes occurred fig 11b shows that this is true only for the first 16 min after which the turbidity of the mixed sample was higher than both separate upstream samples the increase of the grain sizes of sediment can cause an increase in the turbidity using an optical backscatter obs device when the concentration of suspended load remains unchanged thus sediment flocculation can occur and grain sizes can increase when samples from the two tributaries are mixed about 20 h later the turbidity of the huiji river guo river and the mixed sample is 36 5 8 6 and 22 4 ntu respectively not shown in fig 11b which seems to be reasonable that is sediment flocculation lasts for a longer duration and makes the turbidity of the mixed sample larger than for the huiji river and the guo river however after a sufficiently long period of time sediment flocs settle to the bottom and the influence of sediment flocculation on turbidity disappears and thus the turbidity of the mixed sample becomes smaller than that in the huiji river for measuring in situ sediment flocculation other than recording the turbidity more advanced techniques can be adopted in future e g macdonald and mullarney 2015 3 6 dynamics of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence in the non flood season flow rates and flow velocities are low silts and clays grain sizes 20 μm are well distributed in the river with the finer sediment occurring as suspended load and the coarser sediment on the river bed as the bedload fig 12 the suspended silts and clays usually carry a larger tp concentration than the bedload as they are finer in size the suspended loads from the upstream tributary are carried downstream by the low water flow when two streams join at the confluence a weak turbulence and shearing of flow occur causing the two flows to mix weak turbulence brings about the collision of silt particles which may result in flocculation and desorption of the suspended load the weak shear flow may not be able to break the flocs formed small velocities allow the sediment flocs to settle onto the river bed within a small streamwise distance settling of these silt particles yields grain sizes of bed sediment in the post confluence reach that are smaller than those upstream in the two tributaries therefore the tp concentration at the river confluence is much higher than in the two tributaries flow rate and velocity are much higher in the flood season than in the non flood season the silts and clays can get distributed in the surface water as suspended load but mainly sand grain sizes 20 μm remains on the river bed as bedload fig 12 the bedload in the flood season usually carries a much smaller tp concentration than in the non flood season due to the prevailing large grain sizes most of the p in these bedloads is in the form of ca p and ca p is a relatively stable fraction of the sedimentary p which contributes to the permanent storage of p in the sediment kaiserli et al 2002 when two stream flows join at a river confluence a strong turbulence and shear flow occur and the two flows mix thoroughly strong turbulence and shear flow are conducive to collision of silt particles but not conducive to flocculation of the suspended loads even if flocculation occurs high flow velocities can carry the suspension over a long distance moreover high temperature during summer can increase biological activities and increased microbial activity in warmer water can alter the flocculation of suspended sediment by decreasing the settling velocity maggi and tang 2015 this may also decrease the sedimentation of particulate p the strong turbulence and the presence of helical motion yuan et al 2018 can cause the erosion of bed sediment in the post confluence reach this will result in much larger grain sizes being present in the post confluence reach than those prevailing in the two upstream tributaries however the main form of p in the bedload is stable ca p and these sediment particles share the same source for causing the ca p concentration in sediment to be comparable therefore the tps at the confluence is similar to the tps in the two upstream tributaries the first flood often can convey more contaminated sediment downstream the subsequent large floods can make the surface sediment coarsen and the tps decrease the water temperature is one of the main external factors affecting the interaction of sediment with p and higher water temperatures cause a large increase in the solubility of some insoluble compounds thereby releasing p therefore low water temperatures 25 c in the winter and spring promote p enrichment on the bed sediment on the other hand high water temperatures 25 c in summer promote p mainly non apatite p release from the bed sediment 4 conclusions the dynamic characteristics of p contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence has been investigated through a field survey the important conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 phosphorus contamination of the surface sediment at a river confluence is more severe than that of the main streams of the river network to which the river confluence belongs and it is independent of the p contamination of the surface water 2 a river confluence promotes the immobilization of p onto the surface sediment especially in the deep water areas where flocculation and settling of the contaminated suspended sediment takes place 3 flocculation of suspended sediment at a river confluence can decrease the grain sizes of the surface sediment in the deep water areas the exception being in the flood season 4 in the annual water cycle the first flood often can convey more contaminated sediment to the downstream of the river whereas the subsequent larger flood can cause the coarsening of the surface sediment decreasing the tp amount on the sediment 5 during floods sorting of the sediment occurs resulting in coarse grains at the river confluence especially in the deep water area due to the strong shear flow and turbulence the high water temperature coupled with coarsening of sediment cause the lowest p contamination of the surface sediment in the summer 6 the texture of the surface sediment i e the proportion of fine 20 μm and coarse sediment is important for the temporal and spatial distribution of tp on the surface sediment 7 water temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the temporal variability of tp on the surface sediment at a river confluence the critical value of water temperature is 25 c and higher p amounts get adsorbed onto the surface of sediment particles when water temperature is lower i e in winter and spring 8 ca p is a relatively stable fraction of sedimentary p in the dynamic processes of p contamination at a river confluence and the non apatite p can get released from the surface sediment during the summer 9 the temporal and spatial variability of ph is very small and its influence on the tps is not discernable from the current field study the effects of srp concentration in the surface water also are not discernable either in the river confluence or in the main stream of the huai river basin although these results are obtained at a specific river confluence they may be applicable for other similar river confluences furthermore some of these results can be applied to other water bodies like estuaries and lakes as regards the effects of water temperature on the temporal variability of p in the surface sediment declaration of interests the authors
