15200,anthropogenic conversion of forests and wetlands to agricultural and urban landcovers impacts dissolved organic matter dom within streams draining these catchments research on how landcover conversion impacts dom molecular level composition and bioavailability however is lacking in the upper mississippi river basin umrb water from low order streams and rivers draining one of three dominant landcovers forest agriculture urban was incubated for 28 days to determine bioavailable doc bdoc concentrations and changes in dom composition the bdoc concentration averaged 0 49 0 30 mg l 1 across all samples and was significantly higher in streams draining urban catchments 0 72 0 34 mg l 1 compared to streams draining agricultural 0 28 0 15 mg l 1 and forested 0 47 0 17 mg l 1 catchments percent bdoc was significantly greater in urban 10 4 4 streams compared to forested streams 5 6 3 2 corresponding with greater relative abundances of aliphatic and n containing aliphatic compounds in urban streams aliphatic compound relative abundance decreased across all landcovers during the bioincubation average 4 1 10 whereas polyphenolics and condensed aromatics increased in relative abundance across all landcovers average of 1 4 5 9 and 1 8 10 respectively overall the conversion of forested to urban landcover had a larger impact on stream dom bioavailability in the umrb compared to conversion to agricultural landcover future research examining the impacts of anthropogenic landcover conversion on stream dom composition and bioavailability needs to be expanded to a

crucial component of the global carbon cycle composed of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds derived from terrestrial and aquatic sources hopkinson et al 1998 raymond and spencer 2015 decomposition of riverine dom by aquatic microbial communities leads to the preferential biodegradation of bioavailable dom and the accumulation of less bioavailable dom during downstream transport kim et al 2006 kellerman et al 2018 rivers also receive bioavailable organic matter from anthropogenic sources derived from agricultural and urban landcovers e g wilson and xenopoulos 2009 hosen et al 2014 drake et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 which when combined with increasing agricultural and urban lands with a continuously increasing human population could lead to greater riverine dom bioavailability globally and potentially increased greenhouses gas emissions graeber et al 2015 drake et al 2019 in the upper mississippi river basin umrb where population growth has led to extensive cropland expansion and increased urbanization eathington 2010 wright and wimberly 2013 we demonstrated streams draining agricultural or urban landcovers had lower dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and higher relative abundances of compounds characteristic of autochthonous e g algae phytoplankton bacteria and anthropogenic dom sources compared to streams draining forested and wetland landcovers referred hereafter as forested vaughn et al 2021 autochthonous and anthropogenic dom is generally considered to be more bioavailable than dom derived from terrestrial plants and organic rich soils d andrilli et al 2015 riedel et al 2016 textor et al 2018 however it is unknown whether differences in landcover significantly alters overall stream dom bioavailability with regards to amount and molecular level composition e g changes in relative contributions of aliphatic and condensed aromatic compounds additionally most research on stream dom composition and bioavailability compares streams draining forested landcovers to streams draining either agricultural or urban landcovers rarely both here we investigated dom bioavailability in the umrb using bioincubation experiments to measure potential microbial utilization of dom in streams draining one of three dominant landcovers forested agriculture and urban doc loss during the bioincubation represents bioavailable doc bdoc often used to assess dom bioavailability wickland et al 2007 guillemette and del giorgio 2011 we also utilized fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which can differentiate thousands of molecular formulae in a single dom sample d andrilli et al 2015 ware et al 2022 to assess differences in dom molecular signatures between pre and post bioincubation samples textor et al 2018 drake et al 2019 we hypothesized dom in streams draining agricultural and urban catchments in the umrb would have greater bdoc than streams draining forested catchments due to greater contributions of bioavailable compounds derived from autochthonous and anthropogenic sources we also hypothesized the proportion of less bioavailable compounds e g condensed aromatics polyphenolics following the bioincubation would increase in all landcovers as bioavailable dom is degraded which will have important implications for what types of compounds are transported to downstream ecosystems and water treatment 2 methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the umrb is defined here as the area drained by the mississippi river at wabasha mn fig 1 streams and rivers within the umrb flow through geologies of variable glacial influence blumentritt et al 2009 and drain a wide range of landcovers forested agricultural wetland and urban table s1 agricultural lands of the umrb support row crops i e corn and soybeans and many agricultural practices used in the umrb have been linked to alterations in river discharge and water quality e g tile drainage fertilizer use and changes in crop type raymond et al 2008 nine low order streams and rivers in the umrb having distinct landcover were selected for the study fig 1 table s1 detailed explanations of the watershed classifications for each stream and river can be found in vaughn et al 2021 and in the supplemental material three streams drain predominantly urban landcover bassett creek minnehaha creek and shingle creek three streams rivers drain predominantly agricultural landcover como creek trout creek and red cedar river and three streams rivers drain predominantly forested landcover allequash creek chippewa river and flambeau river streams and rivers were sampled on five occasions over a 1 5 year period table s2 and more detailed sampling methods can be found in vaughn et al 2021

bottles bioincubation or acid cleaned polycarbonate high density polyethylene bottles chemical analyses unfiltered water for bioincubation inoculation was collected in pre combusted 60 ml amber glass bottles samples for doc concentration were kept cool 4 c and in the dark ft icr ms samples were frozen within 12 h of collection until further processing 2 2 bioincubation experiments bioincubations were set up the same day as sample collection filtered water 0 45 μm 0 5 l was inoculated with 5 ml of water filtered through pre rinsed 1 6 μm glass fiber syringe filters gently mixed for one minute then divided as 50 ml aliquots into six 100 ml pre combusted amber glass serum bottles leaving 50 ml of headspace serum bottles were capped with teflon lined stoppers and sealed with crimps three bottles were immediately injected with 1 ml of 50 h3po4 as a preservative and designated as t 0 days all bottles were stored in the dark at ambient temperature until returning to the laboratory bioincubation serum bottles acidified at t 0 days n 3 per site per date were refrigerated at 4 c upon returning to the laboratory unacidified bottles n 3 per site per date were kept in the dark in an incubator set at 20 c for 28 days from initiation at t 28 days the unacidified bottles were acidified with 1 ml of 50 h3po4 and stored in the dark at 4 c to halt biodegradation wickland et al 2007 2 3 dissolved organic carbon concentration doc samples t 0 and t 28 days were analyzed on a shimadzu toc l cph detailed in vaughn et al 2021 and in the supplemental material the amount of bdoc mg c l 1 was calculated as the loss of doc during the bioincubation between mean initial t 0 days and mean final t 28 days doc concentrations percent doc loss or the portion of doc that is bioavailable bdoc was calculated as mean doc loss divided by the mean initial doc concentrations and multiplied by one hundred to obtain a percentage eq 1 1 δ d o c d o c i n i t i a l d o c f i n a l d o c i n i t i a

community during the bioincubation details on sample preparation for analysis on the 21 t ft icr ms at the national high magnetic field laboratory nhmfl tallahassee fl and details on molecular formulae assignments can be found in vaughn et al 2021 and in the supplemental material briefly formulae were assigned with elemental combinations of c1 45h1 100n0 4o1 25s0 2 and then classified based on their elemental stoichiometries the number of formulae detected here is referred throughout as molecular richness the modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated for each formula following koch

high o c aliphatics and n aliphatics stenson et al 2003 kellerman et al 2015 relative abundance was calculated for each compound class and for different elemental combinations cho chon chos and chons following methods detailed in vaughn et al 2021 and in the supplemental material changes in relative abundance δ ra during the bioincubations were calculated following eq 2 where the differences between initial t 0 days and final t 28 days relative abundance are divided by the initial relative abundance and then multiplied by one hundred to obtain a percentage 2 δ r a r a f i n a l r a i n i

samples t0 46 of total assigned formulae and 11 803 formulae in post bioincubation samples t28 43 of total assigned formulae with bdoc which when plotted in van krevelen space showed two distinct

and 93 for t0 and t28 respectively while most t0 formulae with positive significant spearman correlations to bdoc were heteroatomic formulae chon chos and chons 83 and 86 for t0 and t28 respectively additionally all initial t0 aliphatic formulae most initial n aliphatic formulae 99 and all final t28 aliphatic and n aliphatic formulae with significant spearman correlations to bdoc had positive correlations to bdoc when bdoc was compared with percent relative abundance aliphatics from pre bioincubation t0 samples there was a significant increase in bdoc with increasing aliphatic relative

with landcover variability in the umrb we quantified changes in doc concentration and looked at shifts in dom composition during a 28 day bioincubation doc concentrations significantly declined during the bioincubations 0 49 0 30 mg l 1 table 1 fig 2a concurrent with significant losses in aliphatic compound relative abundance across all samples table 2 fig 4e energy rich aliphatic compounds are often characteristic of autochthonous dom production e g dom produced from algal phytoplankton bacteria growth williams et al 2010 graeber et al 2015 kellerman et al 2018 and anthropogenic dom inputs wilson and xenopoulos 2009 hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 and were likely preferentially utilized by the microbial community during the bioincubation e g sun et al 1997 spencer et al 2015 this was supported by h c significantly declining between pre and post bioincubation samples p 0 001 fig 5a suggesting a decline in the abundance of saturated aliphatic compounds d andrilli et al 2015 seidel et al 2015 kamjunke et al 2019 additionally aliphatic formulae had significant positive spearman correlations to bdoc fig 6 and initial aliphatic relative abundance had significant positive correlations to bdoc across all samples and across each landcover type fig s2c this indicated streams with greater relative abundance of aliphatic compounds also had greater portions of bdoc within their dom interestingly n aliphatic formulae did not significantly change in relative abundance during the bioincubation however most n aliphatic formulae 99 in pre bioincubation samples and 100 in post bioincubation samples had significant positive spearman correlations to bdoc this may suggest n aliphatic compounds were not as degraded as aliphatic compounds during the bioincubation in contrast to aliphatics hup high o c condensed aromatics and polyphenolics all considered to be less bioavailable compounds and characteristic of terrestrial plant and organic rich soil sources williams et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 did not significantly change in relative abundance during the bioincubation table 2 figs 4a 4c and 4d the lack of change in the relative abundance of these compounds during the bioincubation along with their negative spearman correlations to bdoc suggest these compounds were not readily degraded during the bioincubation most cho formulae 87 and 93 for pre and post bioincubation respectively also had significant negative spearman correlations with bdoc suggesting most cho formulae were not degraded during the bioincubation additionally streams associated with urban catchments had significant increases in the relative abundance for cho formulae from pre to post bioincubation p 0 005 related to the decrease in the relative abundance of heteroatomic compounds chon chos chons as these compounds are degraded during the bioincubation n and s containing compounds are considered highly bioavailable and have been associated with microbial degradation in urban catchments ye et al 2019 reid et al 2020 gong et al 2022 4 1 greater impact of urbanization on bioavailable doc bdoc anthropogenically impacted streams in the umrb including streams draining urban and agricultural lands had greater doc loss and more bioavailable dom contributions compared to streams draining forested lands the increase in bdoc for anthropogenically impacted streams in the umrb was similar to bdoc increases in other urban petrone et al 2009 hosen et al 2014 knapik et al 2015 parr et al 2015 shi et al 2016 begum et al 2019 li et al 2020 and agricultural watersheds royer and david 2005 petrone et al 2009 shang et al 2018 drake et al 2019 higher bdoc in agricultural and urban streams compared to forested streams may be due to greater proportions of bioavailable dom i e greater relative abundance of aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds vaughn et al 2021 in these anthropogenically impacted streams derived from autochthonous e g algal phytoplankton williams et al 2010 graeber et al 2015 kellerman et al 2018 and anthropogenic e g fertilizer animal manure wastewater sources wilson and xenopoulos 2009 hosen et al 2014 kamjunke et al 2019 this was further supported by h c ratios significantly declining between pre and post incubation in the agricultural and urban landcovers p 0 001 figs 5c and 5d e g sun et al 1997 seidel et al 2015 but not in forested landcovers despite agricultural and urban streams having greater bdoc contributions to their overall doc only urban streams in the umrb had significantly greater bdoc compared to forested streams additionally urban streams had significantly higher bdoc concentrations compared to agricultural and forested streams this all suggests urban landcover likely has a greater impact on stream dom bioavailability compared to agricultural landcover which may result from significantly higher initial relative abundance of aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds in urban streams table 2 vaughn et al 2021 urban streams in the umrb also had significantly greater initial relative abundance of s containing formulae chos and chons table 2 vaughn et al 2021 which has been susceptible to microbial degradation in other urbanized streams ye et al 2019 reid et al 2020 gong et al 2022 previous studies looking at urban impacts on stream and riverine dom bioavailability have found similar results of increased bioavailability at the convergence of the yangtze river with discharge from a wastewater treatment plant in china there was greater metabolism of bioavailable amino acids by the local microbial communities compared to upstream locations with less urban influences li et al 2020 in maryland and maine increased algal primary production associated with urbanized streams increased the degradation of doc and stimulated bacterial enzyme activity hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 dom bioavailability has also been linked with increasing percentages of impervious surfaces and development associated with urban areas in new hampshire coble et al 2022 although streams draining agricultural landcover did not significantly differ in bdoc compared to streams draining forested landcovers in the umrb other research looking at the impacts of agriculture on dom bioavailability globally have found greater stream dom bioavailability with increasing agriculture activity e g shang et al 2018 drake et al 2019 the increase in agricultural dom bioavailability has also been accompanied by increases in aliphatic compounds n containing formulae and formulae with higher h c ratios drake et al 2019 in contrast streams within the lower chesapeake bay watershed in virginia lu et al 2013 australia giling et al 2014 and in southern ontario canada kadjeski et al 2020 showed no impact of agricultural landcover on dom bioavailability overall dom within streams draining agricultural landcovers could have significantly greater bioavailability than forested wetland streams but the drivers e g different types of agricultural practices differences in historical landuse sources e g types of fertilizer and product produced and other external factors e g nutrient availability water residence time for such differences in dom may vary by location for forested streams low mean bdoc combined with higher initial contributions from less bioavailable dom compounds e g polyphenolic and high o c hup compounds and lower initial contributions of more bioavailable dom compounds e g aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds table 2 could suggest dom in umrb forested streams may have already been extensively degraded in soils and upstream aquatic environments e g textor et al 2018 the forested streams in this study had some of the largest drainage areas which may support greater dom degradation and lower bdoc fig s2a however the regression between bdoc and drainage area was not significant fig s1b p 0 05 forested streams also had higher flow rates compared to urban and agricultural streams table s1 which could reduce their residence times and potential dom degradation despite the decrease in bdoc with increasing doc concentrations fig s2a forested streams with high initial doc concentrations produced higher bdoc concentrations compared to agricultural streams with low initial doc concentrations fig s2b this suggests there is a high concentration of bdoc transported in these forested streams which can be delivered to microbial communities downstream and potentially degraded additionally while we did not study anthropogenic impacts on forest structure much of the umrb forested area was logged in the 1800s and 1900s and is now covered by secondary forest growth stark et al 2000 secondary forest growth can produce more bioavailable proteinaceous dom compared to old growth forests with less bioavailable aromatic dom associated with deeper o horizons beggs and summers 2011 fegel et al 2021 thus future work on the impacts of land management activities on forested stream dom bioavailability is worth consideration 4 2 microbial consumption of compounds independent of landcover while landcover appears to impact the stream bdoc as well as the relative abundance of compound classes hosen et al 2014 drake et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 there is no indication landcover significantly impacts what types of compounds local microbial communities degrade in stream dom or how much of each type they degrade this was indicated by the lack of significant differences between landcovers in how dom composition changed during the bioincubation table 2 figs 3 and 4 one exception to this was the percent change in the relative abundance of chos formulae being significantly higher in agricultural streams which had an increase in chos relative abundance compared to forested streams p 0 05 which had a decrease in chos relative abundance both landcovers also had decreases in the number of assigned chos formulae suggesting some microbial consumption of chos formulae during the bioincubation the increase in agricultural chos relative abundance during the bioincubation may have resulted from the loss of assigned chon formulae and decrease in chon relative abundance table 2 fig 3b both of which were likely higher than the dom in forested streams due to anthropogenic nutrient inputs such as fertilizer and animal manure stark et al 2000 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 for the forested streams the relative abundance and number of assigned chon formulae increased following the bioincubation which could reflect the preferential consumption of chos formulae ye et al 2019 and the formation of n containing metabolic intermediates or products during the bioincubations d andrilli et al 2015 like chon formulae chons formulae also decreased in relative abundance and in the number of assigned formulae during the bioincubation for agricultural streams however chons formulae had smaller relative abundance compared to all other formulae table 2 vaughn et al 2021 and thus likely had less influence on the relative abundance of chos formulae 5 conclusions very few studies exist comparing the potential impacts of forest urban and agricultural landcovers on stream dom molecular level composition and bioavailability which hinders our understanding of how anthropogenic landcover modifications may impact in stream organic matter cycling through a 28 day bioincubation we found significant losses in doc in stream samples collected across all three landcovers in the umrb and significantly greater bdoc in streams draining urban catchments compared to streams draining forested catchments this pattern in bdoc followed other studies looking at the impact of landcovers on stream dom bioavailability for other anthropogenically impacted watersheds in isolation e g stanley et al 2012 hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 kamjunke et al 2019 however insignificant difference in bdoc between agricultural and forested streams suggests the conversion of forested catchments to urban catchments in the umrb has a bigger impact on stream dom bioavailability compared to the conversion from forested to agriculture in the umrb greater bdoc in urban catchments likely reflected high relative abundance of aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds prior to the bioincubation and the subsequent degradation of these compounds by microbial consumption during the bioincubation while we found landcover to impact initial contributions of compound classes to stream dom drake et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 and to the proportions of bdoc within streams landcover did not appear to impact what compounds microbes degrade given the paucity of studies relating agricultural and urban impacts to stream dom molecular level composition and bioavailability more data are needed from additional stream networks impacted by anthropogenic activity to assess whether our findings are applicable to other locations knowing the impacts of agricultural and urban landcovers on stream dom is a necessity as agricultural and urban areas continue to grow to match the needs of a continuously growing

relative abundance across all landcovers average of 1 4 5 9 and 1 8 10 respectively overall the conversion of forested to urban landcover had a larger impact on stream dom bioavailability in the umrb compared to conversion to agricultural landcover future research examining the impacts of anthropogenic landcover conversion on stream dom composition and bioavailability needs to be expanded to a

crucial component of the global carbon cycle composed of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds derived from terrestrial and aquatic sources hopkinson et al 1998 raymond and spencer 2015 decomposition of riverine dom by aquatic microbial communities leads to the preferential biodegradation of bioavailable dom and the accumulation of less bioavailable dom during downstream transport kim et al 2006 kellerman et al 2018 rivers also receive bioavailable organic matter from anthropogenic sources derived from agricultural and urban landcovers e g wilson and xenopoulos 2009 hosen et al 2014 drake et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 which when combined with increasing agricultural and urban lands with a continuously increasing human population could lead to greater riverine dom bioavailability globally and potentially increased greenhouses gas emissions graeber et al 2015 drake et al 2019 in the upper mississippi river basin umrb where population growth has led to extensive cropland expansion and increased urbanization eathington 2010 wright and wimberly 2013 we demonstrated streams draining agricultural or urban landcovers had lower dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and higher relative abundances of compounds characteristic of autochthonous e g algae phytoplankton bacteria and anthropogenic dom sources compared to streams draining forested and wetland landcovers referred hereafter as forested vaughn et al 2021 autochthonous and anthropogenic dom is generally considered to be more bioavailable than dom derived from terrestrial plants and organic rich soils d andrilli et al 2015 riedel et al 2016 textor et al 2018 however it is unknown whether differences in landcover significantly alters overall stream dom bioavailability with regards to amount and molecular level composition e g changes in relative contributions of aliphatic and condensed aromatic compounds additionally most research on stream dom composition and bioavailability compares streams draining forested landcovers to streams draining either agricultural or urban landcovers rarely both here we investigated dom bioavailability in the umrb using bioincubation experiments to measure potential microbial utilization of dom in streams draining one of three dominant landcovers forested agriculture and urban doc loss during the bioincubation represents bioavailable doc bdoc often used to assess dom bioavailability wickland et al 2007 guillemette and del giorgio 2011 we also utilized fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which can differentiate thousands of molecular formulae in a single dom sample d andrilli et al 2015 ware et al 2022 to assess differences in dom molecular signatures between pre and post bioincubation samples textor et al 2018 drake et al 2019 we hypothesized dom in streams draining agricultural and urban catchments in the umrb would have greater bdoc than streams draining forested catchments due to greater contributions of bioavailable compounds derived from autochthonous and anthropogenic sources we also hypothesized the proportion of less bioavailable compounds e g condensed aromatics polyphenolics following the bioincubation would increase in all landcovers as bioavailable dom is degraded which will have important implications for what types of compounds are transported

et al 2015 kamjunke et al 2019 additionally aliphatic formulae had significant positive spearman correlations to bdoc fig 6 and initial aliphatic relative abundance had significant positive correlations to bdoc across all samples and across each landcover type fig s2c this indicated streams with greater relative abundance of aliphatic compounds also had greater portions of bdoc within their dom interestingly n aliphatic formulae did not significantly change in relative abundance during the bioincubation however most n aliphatic formulae 99 in pre bioincubation samples and 100 in post bioincubation samples had significant positive spearman correlations to bdoc this may suggest n aliphatic compounds were not as degraded as aliphatic compounds during the bioincubation in contrast to aliphatics hup high o c condensed aromatics and polyphenolics all considered to be less bioavailable compounds and characteristic of terrestrial plant and organic rich soil sources williams et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 did not significantly change in relative abundance during the bioincubation table 2 figs 4a 4c and 4d the lack of change in the relative abundance of these compounds during the bioincubation along with their negative spearman correlations to bdoc suggest these compounds were not readily degraded during the bioincubation most cho formulae 87 and 93 for pre and post bioincubation respectively also had significant negative spearman correlations with bdoc suggesting most cho formulae were not degraded during the bioincubation additionally streams associated with urban catchments had significant increases in the relative abundance for cho formulae from pre to post bioincubation p 0 005 related to the decrease in the relative abundance of heteroatomic compounds chon chos chons as these compounds are degraded during the bioincubation n and s containing compounds are considered highly bioavailable and have been associated with microbial degradation in urban catchments ye et al 2019 reid et al 2020 gong et al 2022 4 1 greater impact of urbanization on bioavailable doc bdoc anthropogenically impacted streams in the umrb including streams draining urban and agricultural lands had greater doc loss and more bioavailable dom contributions compared to streams draining forested lands the increase in bdoc for anthropogenically

agricultural watersheds royer and david 2005 petrone et al 2009 shang et al 2018 drake et al 2019 higher bdoc in agricultural and urban streams compared to forested streams may be due to greater proportions of bioavailable dom i e greater relative abundance of aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds vaughn et al 2021 in these anthropogenically impacted streams derived from autochthonous e g algal phytoplankton williams et al 2010 graeber et al 2015 kellerman et al 2018 and anthropogenic e g fertilizer animal manure wastewater sources wilson and xenopoulos 2009 hosen et al 2014 kamjunke et al 2019 this was further supported by h c ratios significantly declining between pre and post incubation in the agricultural and urban landcovers p 0 001 figs 5c and 5d e g sun et al 1997 seidel et al 2015 but not in forested landcovers despite agricultural and urban streams having greater bdoc contributions to their overall doc only urban streams in the umrb had significantly greater bdoc compared to forested streams additionally urban streams had significantly higher bdoc concentrations compared to agricultural and forested streams this all suggests urban landcover likely has a greater impact on stream dom bioavailability compared to agricultural landcover which may result from significantly higher initial relative abundance of aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds in urban streams table 2 vaughn et al 2021 urban streams in the umrb also had significantly greater initial relative abundance of s containing formulae chos and chons table 2 vaughn et al 2021 which has been susceptible to microbial degradation in other urbanized streams ye et al 2019 reid et al 2020 gong et al 2022 previous studies looking at urban impacts on stream and riverine dom bioavailability have found similar results of increased bioavailability at the convergence of the yangtze river with discharge from a wastewater treatment plant in china there was greater metabolism of bioavailable amino acids by the local microbial communities compared to upstream locations with less urban influences li et al 2020 in maryland and maine increased algal primary production associated with urbanized streams increased the degradation of doc and stimulated bacterial enzyme activity hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 dom bioavailability has also been linked with increasing percentages of impervious surfaces and development associated with urban areas in new hampshire coble et al 2022 although streams draining agricultural landcover did not significantly differ in bdoc compared to streams draining forested landcovers in the umrb other research looking at the impacts of agriculture on dom bioavailability globally have found greater stream dom bioavailability with increasing agriculture activity e g shang et al 2018 drake et al 2019 the increase in agricultural dom bioavailability has also been accompanied by increases in aliphatic compounds n containing formulae and formulae with higher h c ratios drake et al 2019 in contrast streams within the lower chesapeake bay watershed in virginia lu et al 2013 australia giling et al 2014 and in southern ontario canada kadjeski et al 2020 showed no impact of agricultural landcover on dom bioavailability overall dom within streams draining agricultural landcovers could have significantly greater bioavailability than forested wetland streams but the drivers e g different types of agricultural practices differences in historical landuse sources e g types of fertilizer and product produced and other external factors e g nutrient availability water residence time for such differences in dom may vary by location for forested streams low mean bdoc combined with higher initial contributions from less bioavailable dom compounds e g polyphenolic and high o c hup compounds and lower initial contributions of more bioavailable dom compounds e g aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds table 2 could suggest dom in umrb forested streams may have already been extensively degraded in soils and upstream aquatic environments e g textor et al 2018 the forested streams in this study had some of the largest drainage areas which may support greater dom degradation and lower bdoc fig s2a however the regression between bdoc and drainage area was not significant fig s1b p 0 05 forested streams also had higher flow rates compared to urban and agricultural streams table s1 which could reduce their residence times and potential dom degradation despite the decrease in bdoc with increasing doc concentrations fig s2a forested streams with high initial doc concentrations produced higher bdoc concentrations compared to agricultural streams with low initial doc concentrations fig s2b this suggests there is a high concentration of bdoc transported in these forested streams which can be delivered to microbial communities downstream and potentially degraded additionally while we did not study anthropogenic impacts on forest structure much of the umrb forested area was logged in the 1800s and 1900s and is now covered by secondary forest growth stark et al 2000 secondary forest growth can produce more bioavailable proteinaceous dom compared to old growth forests with less bioavailable aromatic dom associated with deeper o horizons beggs and summers 2011 fegel et al 2021 thus future work on the impacts of land management activities on forested stream dom bioavailability is worth consideration 4 2 microbial consumption of compounds independent of landcover while landcover appears to impact the stream bdoc as well as the relative abundance of compound classes hosen et al 2014 drake et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 there is no indication landcover significantly impacts what types of compounds local microbial communities degrade in stream dom or how much of each type they degrade this was indicated by the lack of significant differences between landcovers in how dom composition changed during the bioincubation table 2 figs 3 and 4 one exception to this was the percent change in the relative abundance of chos formulae being significantly higher in agricultural streams which had an increase in chos relative abundance compared to forested streams p 0 05 which had a decrease in chos relative abundance both landcovers also had decreases in the number of assigned chos formulae suggesting some microbial consumption of chos formulae during the bioincubation the increase in agricultural chos relative abundance during the bioincubation may have resulted from the loss of assigned chon formulae and decrease in chon relative abundance table 2 fig 3b both of which were likely higher than the dom in forested streams due to anthropogenic nutrient inputs such as fertilizer and animal manure stark et al 2000 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 for the forested streams the relative abundance and number of assigned chon formulae increased following the bioincubation which could reflect the preferential consumption of chos formulae ye et al 2019 and the formation of n containing metabolic intermediates or products during the bioincubations d andrilli et al 2015 like chon formulae chons formulae also decreased in relative abundance and in the number of assigned formulae during the bioincubation for agricultural streams however chons formulae had smaller relative abundance compared to all other formulae table 2 vaughn et al 2021 and thus likely had less influence on the relative abundance of chos formulae 5 conclusions very few studies exist comparing the potential impacts of forest urban and agricultural landcovers on stream dom molecular level composition and bioavailability which hinders our understanding of how anthropogenic landcover modifications may impact in stream organic matter cycling through a 28 day bioincubation we found significant losses in doc in stream samples collected across all three landcovers in the umrb and significantly greater bdoc in streams draining urban catchments compared to streams draining forested catchments this pattern in bdoc followed other studies looking at the impact of landcovers on stream dom bioavailability for other anthropogenically impacted watersheds in isolation e g stanley et al 2012 hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 kamjunke et al 2019 however insignificant difference in bdoc between agricultural and forested streams suggests the conversion of forested catchments to urban catchments in the umrb has a bigger impact on stream dom bioavailability compared to the conversion from forested to agriculture in the umrb greater bdoc in urban catchments likely reflected high relative abundance of aliphatic and n aliphatic compounds prior to the bioincubation and the subsequent degradation of these compounds by microbial consumption during the bioincubation while we found landcover to impact initial contributions of compound classes to stream dom drake et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 and to the proportions of bdoc within streams landcover did not appear to impact what compounds microbes degrade given the paucity of studies relating agricultural and urban impacts to stream dom molecular level composition and bioavailability more data are needed from additional stream networks impacted by anthropogenic activity to assess whether our findings are applicable to other locations knowing the impacts of agricultural and urban landcovers on stream dom is a necessity as agricultural and urban areas continue to grow to match the needs of a continuously growing

15201,sensors used for control have become widespread in water resources recovery facilities during the strive for resource efficient operations however their accuracy is reliant on uncertain laboratory measurements which are used for calibration and in turn to correct for sensor drift at the same time current sensor calibration practices are lacking clear theoretical understanding of how measurement uncertainties impact the final control action the effects of a customarily and ad hoc applied calibration threshold are unknown leading to the current situation where many wastewater treatment processes are controlled by measurements with unknown accuracy to study how sensor accuracy is affected by calibration including varying calibration thresholds we developed a simple theoretical model with closed form expressions based on the variance and bias in sensor and laboratory measurements the model was then simulated to yield the results which showed no practical gain of using a calibration threshold apart from the situation when calibration is more time consuming than validation by contrast the best accuracy was obtained when consistently executing calibration which opposes common practice further the sensor calibration error was shown to be transferred to the process causing a similar deviation from the setpoint when the same sensor was used for control this emphasizes the importance of minimizing laboratory measurement uncertainties during calibration which otherwise directly impact operations due to these findings we strongly advice shifting mindset from considering calibration as a sequential detection and correction approach towards an estimation approach aiming to estimate bias magnitude and drift speed keywords sensor maintenance process control wastewater treatment plant measurement error condition based maintenance interlaboratory test data availability the model used for producing the simulation and related data is available as supplementary materials 1 introduction biased sensors operating in a feedback control loop have been shown to have negative impact on the treatment and resource efficiency in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs samuelsson et al 2021 at the same time on line sensors and advanced control are technologies that enable optimized resource efficient operations stentoft et al 2021 the challenge is to manage the increasing abundance of sensor data and in particular their accuracy we here refer to accuracy as the combination of trueness lack of systematic errors bias and precision lack of random errors in line with standardized nomenclature international organization for standardization 1994 the evaluation of sensor measurement quality and accuracy is known as validation which is commonly followed by calibration these are the most important actions for reaching a high accuracy in practice together with the mandatory sensor cleaning routines the aim of this paper is to show how validation and calibration impact the sensor accuracy and whether these actions can be tailored to achieve a desired accuracy sensor calibration in wrrfs can be conducted by linear regression rieger et al 2005 this is also a widely accepted method in general when the measurement used for validation also denoted reference measurement has a low precision as compared to the sensor bipm 2008 alternative methods exist that consider precision in both sensor and reference orear 1982 although they are scarce in practice a drawback with the linear regression approach is that at least two reference samples are needed preferably three or more samples are desired that should further be spread out in the full measurement range possibly due to these time consuming requirements a simpler approach has become standard in the wrrf domain which is described next the current practice for sensor calibration is a two step sequence commonly executed on a fixed time interval this approach applies to most sensors such as total suspended solids tss ammonium nitrate and dissolved oxygen do the first step validation is conducted by comparing the sensor value with a reference measurement in practice the more common reference is a grab sample e g for tss ammonium and nitrate it is possible to also use a standard solution with a known concentration if this is available common for ph sensors this study focuses on evaluating current practices and we here assume that the reference measurement is a grab sample the validation step is intended to decide whether the sensor provided a good enough measurement or needs calibration what good enough means is subjective and application specific and is encoded in a so called calibration threshold γ henceforth referred to as the threshold it is common to only calibrate the sensor when the difference during validation exceeds the threshold the adjustment is then executed via the sensor signal processing unit which we here assume to consist of a simple offset adjustment despite the prevalent usage of thresholds we have to the best of our knowledge not seen a theoretical explanation for how the threshold γ should be selected to produce a desired accuracy on the contrary we have seen a wide range of thresholds in practice instead motivated by practical experience ad hoc procedures or by sensor supplier information unpublished results by andersson 2019 a common suggestion is that a too tight threshold or even omitting the threshold would lead to excessive calibrations with increased variations in the measured signal because of the more frequent calibrations thus the threshold is not only intended to control the desired accuracy a second challenge with the current validation and calibration practice is that uncertainties in the reference measurement are not considered in a systematic manner one or two grab laboratory lab samples are commonly used for validation and calibration lab samples contain both systematic and random errors through the sampling and analytical procedures eurachem 2019 for example a systematic error is present if the concentration always differs between two measurement points such as the surface of an activated sludge tank and 0 5 m below the surface similarly influent variations causing dynamic variations in the tank concentration would induce a random sampling error if the sensor and lab sample are not taken simultaneously at the same location however these errors are not quantified or considered during the validation and calibration procedure therefore the final sensor accuracy after calibration is unclear this leads to the situation where the treatment process is controlled based on measurements with unknown accuracy this further lowers the incentive to improve existing calibration routines since any improvement would go unnoticed ultimately current calibration practices are lacking a clear theoretical understanding of how the lab uncertainties impact the final sensor accuracy and whether a threshold can be applied to improve or control the accuracy therefore we analysed calibration from both a practical and theoretical perspective to clarify what an optimal threshold value may be then we analysed the impact from the uncertainties during calibration and how these are transferred to the sensor as well as the process when the sensor is used in a feedback control loop or for monitoring more specifically we developed a model describing the instant steps during calibration which was then simulated and analysed theoretically the calibration model was illustrated with a fictive total suspended solids sensor used to control a constant total suspended solids concentration in an activated sludge tank 2 materials and methods a general discrete time model for calibration is introduced in section 2 2 which is illustrated by an example containing a tss sensor measuring in an activated sludge tank section 2 1 the calibration model was then simulated and evaluated as described in section 2 3 to assess the impact of threshold values on the sensor accuracy and indirectly the controlled tss concentration 2 1 example system and limitations the calibration model is illustrated with a tss sensor used for monitoring and control of the tss in the bioreactor of an activated sludge process the results are also applicable to a general sensor control system where sensor validation and calibration is conducted with uncertain reference measurements a deliberate limitation is that we here only considered off set calibration which is sufficient to correct a constant error i e an error that is independent of the measured value however for a sensitivity error slope error where the error magnitude depends on the measured value two or multipoint calibration is needed e g an ultraviolet light sensor the implications of this limitation with relation to the results are discussed in section 4 it should be noted that available calibration methods differ among sensor makes it is also common to have the choice of either conducting an off set or slope calibration this study is exemplified by a tss sensor calibrated with an offset which resembles e g a cerlic itx sensor a list of the used model variables and related abbreviations is given in table 1 2 2 sensor validation and calibration model a model for the sequential steps of sensor validation and calibration is successively introduced in this section together with an overview of how the model was simulated section 2 2 10 an important model feature is that one time step k in the model corresponds to one validation calibration sequence henceforth referred to as a calibration occasion this is commonly executed at a fixed interval weekly or monthly although this is not a requirement for the method 2 2 1 true concentration update the true concentration x t was assumed to be constant between two calibration occasions k and k 1 apart from an adjustment δ c 1 x t k 1 x t k δ c k the adjustment δ c represents the effect of the control signal on the true concentration the control signal can either be manual or automatically executed via a feedback controller and corresponds here to a change in amount of wasted activated sludge for simplicity other disturbances acting on the true sludge concentrations such as variability in influent flow rate concentrations temperature and operational changes in the return activated sludge flow were excluded it is however straightforward to extend the model with such additional factors 2 2 2 reference measurement in general the so called accepted reference value is the most accurate reference value that can be used for comparison i e sensor validation and calibration international organization for standardization 1994 here the concentration was assumed to be measured with one or several lab measurements in the media close to the sensor i e the sensor s ambient water we use the iso nomenclature and the term reference measurement for such lab measurements the reference measurement 2 x r k x t k b r v r k x r k v r k was modelled with a bias b r and measurement noise v r which is assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and variance r r furthermore x r is the noise free but biased reference measurement the measurement noise is the sum of all random errors including sampling and analytical errors similarly we assumed systematic errors due to sampling and analysis to be summed in the bias term b r 2 2 3 sensor measurement the sensor measurement 3 x s k x s k v s k was also modelled with a noise free component x s and white gaussian noise v s with variance r s note that the noise variance is measured with respect to k and not conventional time t in 3 therefore r s represents the sensor variance between validation occasions the apparent measurement noise is the conventional measurement noise and is the variance when reading the sensor value used for the validation commonly the sensor value during a validation is obtained by manually reading the sensor display during a short time interval mathematically the apparent sensor measurement noise r s a σ r n 2 is a function of the n sensor measurements executed to assess the sensor mean value during one validation occasion where σ r is the standard deviation of r s a hence r s a approaches zero when n in addition to the apparent sensor noise random errors may add due to the so called repeatability and reproducibility of the sensor validation the repeatability is the minimum variance for repeated measurements at constant conditions the reproducibility is the maximum variance of the precision when different sensor and operator individuals reproduce equivalent measurements in the same media therefore the repeatability r s m i n sets the lower bound and the reproducibility r s m a x the upper bound for the added variance thus the total variance r s lies between r s a r s m i n r s r s a r s m a x depending on the sensor validation routines for example well trained staff executing documented routines with a high reproducibility r s m a x r s m i n would yield lower random errors as compared to ad hoc actions conducted without caring for the sensor s condition the sensor was further assumed to get a bias b s between each calibration occasion k and k 1 4 x s k 1 x s k b s x t k 1 x t k where x t k 1 x t k from 1 shows the change in true concentration due to the impact of the control signal note that when the true concentration is constant i e x t k 1 x t k the sensor measurement is only changed by b s between the calibration occasions to simplify the bias b s was assumed to reach the same value between each calibration occasion although a time varying bias b s k is likely and could straightforwardly be included in the model 2 2 4 validation during sensor validation the noisy sensor measurement is compared with the reference measurement the difference δ d was identified as 5 δ d k x r k x s k x t k b r v r k x s k v s k 2 2 5 calibration having identified δ d the sensor was adjusted with a constant δ a if the difference was larger than a user defined calibration threshold γ 6a δ d k γ δ a k δ d k 6b δ d k γ δ a k 0 the adjustment δ a in 6a is known as an off set calibration and provides a calibrated sensor x s c a l i b k as 7a x s calib k x s k δ a k recall from 4 that between every calibration occasion the sensor gets a bias in addition to the change in true concentration 7b x s k 1 x s calib k b s δ c k x s k δ a k b s δ c k eq 7b describes how the sensor signal changes when calibration is applied by including δ a k as compared to 4 in which the sensor is not calibrated but only validated i e δ a k 0 2 2 6 sensor calibration in a feedback control loop as described in 1 the true concentration was changed via the effect of a manual or automatic control signal δ c for the situation with feedback control e g using a pi controller the sensor s accuracy will impact the true concentration via the controller as described below first the controller setpoint s p was assumed to be met prior each calibration occasion that is 8 x s k s p i e a perfect control without constraints on the control signal note that in 8 we used the noise free measurement in 3 and assume that the sensor measurement noise does not influence the controller s ability to reach the setpoint this assumption is valid for pi controllers when the sensor s apparent measurement noise frequency is much larger than the controller s speed i e its integration time which is the case for most controlled and slow wastewater treatment processes the main consequence of 8 is that δ c k will depend on the sensor drift and the adjustment during calibration 9 δ c k sp x s k δ a k b s this can be understood by recalling the sequence of made changes in the sensor during one calibration occasion first the sensor x s k was adjusted during calibration with δ a k as described by 6a 7a next the sensor receives a bias 7b and the controller compensates for the changes to fulfil 8 that is x s k 1 s p finally the impact on the true concentration with a feedback controller is again described by 1 with δ c from 9 for validation omitting calibration 9 was revised by simply setting δ a k to zero according to 6b 2 2 7 validation and calibration errors during monitoring and feedback control the final expressions for how calibration 7b or only validation 4 impact sensor accuracy is given by 10 and 11 based on 1 9 with a complete derivation in appendix a sensor used for monitoring when the sensor is only used for monitoring and not control the validation and calibration errors were here defined as the difference between the true and measured concentration validation error no calibration 10a x t k 1 x s k 1 x t k x s k b s v s k 1 calibration error calibration 10b x t k 1 x s k 1 b r v r k v s k b s v s k 1 sensor used for feedback control for a sensor operating in a feedback control loop the validation and calibration errors are instead defined as the difference between the true and desired setpoint concentration i e how the sensor error is transferred to the process validation error no calibration 11a x t k 1 s p x t k x s k b s calibration error calibration 11b x t k 1 s p b r v r k v s k b s note that the only difference between 10 and 11 is the sensor noise v s k 1 which is part of the sensor monitoring example but not the feedback control example this is a direct consequence of the assumption made in 8 2 2 8 calibration rule the decision to calibrate or not to calibrate can be answered by assessing the error magnitudes in 10 and 11 when the error is larger during validation than for calibration the sensor should be calibrated and vice versa interestingly the same simple decision rule was obtained for both 10 and 11 namely 12 x t k x s k b r v r k v s k calibrate x t k x s k b r v r k v s k validate that is when the absolute sensor bias x t k x s k is larger than the bias in the reference measurement plus the noise realizations calibration should be executed taking expectation of the right side of 12 yields 13 e b r v r k v s k e b r which demonstrates the logic decision to only calibrate when the reference measurement is more accurate than the sensor however the expected value of the left side of 12 is not obvious and depend on the calibration threshold in 6 for this reason the model was simulated as described in the next sections 2 2 9 motivation of model parameters to the best of our knowledge we have not found any studies or practical validation results that provide error estimates of the needed model parameters that is the bias and variance of tss sensor and reference measurements therefore these parameter values were assumed according to our reasoning in the next paragraphs firstly the reference measurement variance was assumed to be the sum of the analytical and sampling error variance for a lab measurement a typical standardized analytical protocol specifies 10 15 measurement uncertainty for tss which includes both systematic and random errors the sampling errors are less studied and the only example we found was rossi et al 2011 which indicates a 20 100 sampling error depending on flow conditions here we selected a variance error for the reference measurement of 150 mg l this corresponds to a 10 measurement uncertainty completely based on random errors which is a deliberate underestimation of the true value based on the limited data about systematic proportion of sampling and analytical errors we used the same error value for both the reference bias as for the variance secondly the sensor noise variance was assumed to be smaller than the reference measurement variance as indicated in section 2 2 3 the sensor variance can be reduced when performing a careful measurement e g during constant conditions in a bucket with wastewater and during an extended time we selected the sensor noise variance to one third of the assumed of reference measurement variance lastly we considered two bias levels 100 mg l and 350 mg l these correspond to values that would be considered small requiring no action and large needing a calibration in practice although this study uses the tss sensor as example the challenge to assess random and systematic errors is general for most water quality sensors 2 2 10 model simulations and software the simulated actions during one calibration occasion i e the simulated calibration model are outlined in table 3 with related parameter values in table 2 the model was implemented in matlab version r2020 and is available as supplementary materials 2 3 performance evaluation how well δ d measures the true difference x t x s i e whether a bias can be detected was analysed with the receiver operating characteristics roc and a two sample z test the improvement in accuracy by conducting several repeated lab measurements for the reference measurement replicates as well as for the sensor was analysed for one three and five repeated samples the roc visualizes the detection and false alarm rates as a function of calibration threshold value kay 1998 the impact from calibration thresholds on the true concentration was analysed by simulating the calibration model for k 1 000 time steps and m 10 000 monte carlo repetitions with the settings in table 2 the root mean squared error rmse 14a r m s e 1 m m 1 m 1 k k 1 k x t k s p 2 for a sensor used for control was then used to assess the accuracy and impact from calibration thresholds of the calibration and validation error in 11 the rmse was also analysed by its bias and variance proportions in general the mean squared error mse is the sum of the squared bias and variance see e g gustafsson 2000 14b m s e x e x 2 e x e x 2 further the impact from calibration thresholds on the variation in true concentration x t and controller correction δ c was evaluated by their respective standard deviations during the simulations finally the expected value of 11 when γ 0 was derived as reference to the numerical estimate in 13 obtained from the simulations 3 results the results are presented in the same order as calibration is executed in practice that is first the bias detection performance during sensor validation is analysed section 3 1 next the selection of an optimal calibration threshold is studied section 3 2 last the impact from calibration thresholds on the process variations is analysed section 3 3 3 1 sensor bias detection during validation the calibration rule in 12 requires that the difference x t k x s k can be quantified i e that the sensor bias can be detected this is in practice assessed via the validation and the difference δ d k x r k x s k in 5 how well bias of 100 and 350 mg l were detected during sensor validation with simulations and the settings in table 2 is shown in fig 1 a as the receiver operating characteristics in fig 1 a a false alarm is when the difference during validation calls for a calibration although there is no true difference i e no bias the opposite situation is denoted detection i e when a bias is correctly detected during validation the optimal detection performance is when the detection ratio is one and the false alarm rate is zero for all threshold values the lowest acceptable performance is indicated by the diagonal grey line in fig 1 a which is obtained when the decision to calibrate is decided randomly it is possible to get an even lower performance if deliberately violating the goal of validation however as a benchmark we should expect any validation method to be better than just flipping a coin the detection performance high detection rate and low false alarm rate increased with an increasing bias fig 1 a thus it was easier to correctly detect a large bias which is expected likewise a lowered threshold value improved the detection rate but at the cost of an increased false alarm rate this is indicated by the arrow in fig 1 a when the threshold was at its minimum i e zero the detection and false alarm rate matched the random detection performance upper right corner in fig 1 a that is both the maximum detection and false alarm rates were obtained with equal proportions of detections as false alarms close to optimal detection performance was obtained when three replicate measurements were taken during validation for a 350 mg l bias thick black solid line in fig 1 a an alternative to the roc is to adopt a statistical test framework and evaluate sensor validation in the view of a statistical hypothesis test in this regard the detection rate is known as the test s power and the false alarm rate equals the significance level kay 1998 an appropriate test was to assess the absolute difference during validation like a two sample z test the null hypothesis h0 was that there is no difference between the sensor and reference measurement no bias or a too small bias the alternative hypothesis h1 was that a certain difference exists e g that the bias equals 350 mg l or above fig 1 b illustrates the probability distributions for such test with the same settings as used in fig 1 a where a bias of 350 mg l was assumed to be present when the alternative hypothesis is true fig 1 b explains the difference in detection performance for the three black lines in fig 1 a first the power approaches one as the threshold is lowered to cover h1 see the arrow in fig 1 b next if h0 and h1 are perfectly separated e g due to an assumed large bias in h1 350 mg l optimal detection performance can be obtained with power one and zero significance level last the overlap between h0 and h1 is also decreased if the variance of either hypothesis is decreased this was the reason for the improved detection performance with three repeated measurements in fig 1 a in general the standard deviation of a gaussian decreases with σ n when replicate samples are taken where σ is the original standard deviation and n is the number of replicate samples table 4 shows the dramatic improvement in power when three or more samples were used ultimately fig 1 and table 4 indicates that a sufficiently large bias 350 mg l or repeated measurements during validation are needed for a reliable detection a power above 0 8 is commonly required in statistical tests for the settings in table 2 3 2 identifying the optimal calibration threshold how the calibration threshold comes into play and impact the sensor accuracy and true concentration is now analysed by evaluating simulations with the settings in table 2 also the impact from different threshold values with respect to the root mean squared error rmse is analysed 3 2 1 simulating the calibration model the output from simulating the calibration model with the sensor operating in a feedback control loop is shown in fig 2 which is intended to demonstrate that the calibration model produced logic results the top part fig 2 a shows the that the sensor measurement varies around the setpoint regardless of the true concentration the reference measurement varies around the true concentration but with an offset equal to its bias the true concentration drops in line with the accumulated sensor drift further fig 2 b shows that the periods with no sensor adjustments or controller corrections e g k 3 6 coincides with the consistent sensor drift in fig 2 a when the true concentration has dropped low enough so that the difference between the sensor and the reference is larger than the calibration threshold the sensor is adjusted during calibration e g k 7 and k 12 a complete set of figures describing the scenarios where the sensor was used for monitoring and with without bias and with without noise in the sensor and reference measurements are provided as complement in the supplementary materials 3 2 2 root mean squared error for different threshold values the impact of rmse with different threshold values when the sensor was used for feedback control is shown in fig 3 a b the rmse increased with increasing threshold fig 3 a the rmse consists of a bias and a variance part these are however more easily analysed in terms of their relative proportions of the mean squared error mse since the mse is the sum of these two components recall 14b the bias proportion of the error can thus be obtained by computing the ratio between the bias and the mse the bias proportion was constantly about 75 of the mse regardless of the threshold value this result indicates that the squared bias and variance errors increased equally much when the threshold was increased i e that the variance proportion did not increase for a zero threshold value when the sensor was biased however the mse bias proportion dramatically dropped for γ 400 mg l in fig 3 b which illustrates the same situation as in fig 3 a but with an unbiased sensor this observation simply reflects that the unbiased sensor never will be calibrated if a sufficiently large threshold is applied recall table 3 and that the true concentration and the sensor was initialized to x s x t s p b r b s this was also the only situation when a lower rmse was obtained with a calibration threshold larger than zero i e to keep the sensor as is when the sensor is perfect there is no gain in calibrating it with uncertain reference measurement recall the calibration decision rule in 12 ultimately the results in fig 3 a b indicate that the lowest rmse and thus the highest accuracy was obtained when calibration was consistently executed in this respect the optimal threshold value was zero when the impact from a biased sensor operating in feedback control should be minimized during calibration the one exception to the best of our knowledge for when a calibration threshold may be favourable was when the sensor trueness was better than what can be obtained from a calibration and when bias drift is not expected the actual sensor accuracy is studied in the next section 3 2 3 using a threshold to control the calibration error the deviation in true concentration and rmse in fig 3 a b was induced by the sensor and reference measurement errors as described by 11b and denoted calibration error similarly the calibration error for the sensor i e its accuracy was described in 10b how the sensor s accuracy was affected by different thresholds and replicate samples is shown in table 5 the sensor s accuracy reflected the accuracy of the controlled true concentration table 5 this was expected since the model is based on similar expressions compare 10 and 11 where only the sensor noise differs further table 5 shows that an increasing threshold corresponds to an increased rmse which was also shown in fig 3 however the threshold s absolute value does not necessarily reflect the achieved accuracy more specifically the rmse decreased with decreasing variance error increasing number of samples see table 5 further the threshold was shown to only impact the false alarm rate fig 1 altogether these results indicate that a threshold cannot control the sensor accuracy although it will have a direct negative impact on the final sensor accuracy the only exception where a threshold can decrease rmse can be seen in fig 3 b which applies for the case with an unbiased sensor applying γ 800 mg l indicates a rmse equal to zero fig 3 b this corresponds to a sufficiently large threshold where no calibrations are executed due to random variations in the sensor and reference measurements complementary computations data not shown showed a linear correlation between the total sensor and reference standard deviation and the threshold producing zero rmse as γ 4 8 r r r s r2 99 74 thus as a rule of thumb a threshold needs to be at least five time times larger than the standard deviation of the random errors if calibration on noise should be avoided note for such large threshold the detection rate is below the random detector performance fig 1 a b and incapable of detecting a bias of 350 mg l 3 2 4 expected values for zero threshold value the rmse for a zero threshold obtained from simulations can be verified by comparing the expected value for the calibration error in 10b and 11b with the rmse value for γ 0 mg l in fig 3 a b as hastie et al 2009 describe the standard expression for the mean squared error is m s e x e x 2 e x e x 2 which can then be used to quantify the accuracy in 10b and 11b as 15a r m s e x t k 1 x s k 1 b r b s 2 r r 2 r s 15b r m s e x t k 1 s p b r b s 2 r r r s where the bias proportion of the mse is b r b s 2 and the variance part is r r 2 r s for the sensor accuracy and r r r s for the controlled concentration due to the assumption in 8 note that 15 provides a closed form expression that quantifies the accuracy as a function of the bias and variance of sensor and reference samples when no threshold is used 3 3 process variations due to sensor calibration one hypothesized complication of using γ 0 mg l mentioned in section 1 was the potential variations in the true concentration or in the change induced by the control signal δ c fig 3 c d shows how the variance in δ c and the true concentration were affected by different calibration thresholds in the range 0 1 000 mg l similarly as for the rmse the variance in both the true concentration and δ c increased with increasing threshold values in fig 3 c in the end neither a decreased rmse nor an increased variance was indicated as an issue when omitting the calibration threshold 4 discussion 4 1 targeting sensor bias detection or estimation not surprisingly the results showed that it is challenging to detect a small bias when the reference measurement has a large uncertainty the detection rate could be increased by lowering the calibration threshold and optimally reached one when set to zero at the expense of an increased false alarm rate then the detection performance approached the random detector s performance with 50 false alarms half of the executed calibrations would then be carried out despite that the sensor is unbiased and hence in no need for calibration in practice this would be a poor strategy if calibration is time consuming or costly however for most water quality sensors the preceding validation and reference measurement sample is the more costly action the calibration effort only amounts to manually entering the validation data in the sensor s digital processing unit and even this step has been automated in some swedish wrrfs in the end negligible negative effects can be assumed from excessive calibrations in practice the logic calibration rule in 12 13 stated that calibration should only be executed when the reference measurement is more accurate than in the sensor one such situation in practice when bias detection as a pre step for calibration could be motivated is when a sensor has been calibrated to a very high accuracy e g when directly supplied from the supplier one example is airflow rate sensors which can be adjusted to a high accuracy in factory where a good reference sensor is available then calibrating the same sensor with on site routines lower accuracy would deteriorate the supplier calibration in line with eq 15 and the results for the unbiased sensor fig 3 b if instead a calibration threshold value is used the sensor should only be calibrated when it has lost its supplier provided accuracy and obtained a sufficiently large bias then the rule of thumb in section 3 2 3 could be used to select a sufficiently large threshold note however that a large bias is required for a reliable detection when the reference measurement has a low accuracy fig 1 thus it would be a gamble and a guess to know when the sensor has lost enough accuracy to gain from on site calibration disregarding the unlikely situation in the previous paragraph the results showed that both the highest accuracy as well as the smallest variation in true concentration were obtained when no threshold was applied i e when calibration always was executed this contrasts the common perception that a calibration threshold can be used to somehow improve the accuracy in the sensor or reduce the variations induced during calibration it is unclear why the usage of calibration thresholds has reached wide acceptance in the wastewater domain one reason could be saving time if validation is quicker than calibration another reason could be that it is a consequence of considering validation as a bias detection test and assess whether calibration is needed i e a detection problem in this regard statistical hypothesis testing is a widely taught method that produces a threshold via the decided significance level however a statistical test is commonly executed for more than one observation when the mean and variances are estimated from data this can cause confusion for how such a test should be executed for one sample which is common practice during validation and may be one reason for the lack of documented procedures for choosing the optimal threshold the results showed that the significance level and the false alarm rate could be controlled by the threshold but not the detection rate or the sensor accuracy an alternative view is to instead consider validation and calibration as an estimation problem this is logical since most water quality sensors are indirect measurements and rely on calibration estimation via reference measurements in such estimation viewpoint all efforts are focused around estimating the bias and maximizing the sensor accuracy for the given data rather than worrying about whether the sensor is sufficiently biased or not by continuously using all available data for calibrating the sensor the lowest rmse is obtained on average fig 3 while accepting that variations in the adjustments in fig 2 b are a natural consequence from the uncertain reference measurement and calibration procedure it also becomes clear in the estimation viewpoint why thresholds can be problematic for example excluding part of the measurements in a dataset used during estimation by applying a threshold would violate the best estimation practice and bias the training dataset it is only customary to remove outliers this is the opposite effect to what a threshold induces for example when applying a 310 mg l threshold only values and outliers outside this limit are used for calibration the reason for these outliers is more likely caused by inaccurate reference measurement and not a large sensor bias also reference measurements close to the sensor s within the threshold range are not used for calibration and effectively wastes part of the available data for estimation in the end we could ask what the main goal with sensor validation and calibration is do we want to know whether the sensor has a bias yes no or do we want to produce a sensor measurement as accurately as possible we recommend the latter and to shift our mindset towards regarding sensor validation and calibration as an estimation problem rather than a detection problem 4 2 optimizing the practical trade off in accuracy when regarding calibration as an estimation problem a natural follow up question is what the optimal trade off is with regards to achieved accuracy for spent resources the 15 gave a closed form expression for the final accuracy depending on the noise and bias errors in the sensor and the reference measurement first the equation is a good tool to assure that the desired accuracy is reached for example a previous simulation study showed that the bias above 500 mg l in a total suspended solids sensor was problematic for the nitrogen removal efficiency samuelsson et al 2021 the equation can be used to decide the maximum acceptable bias and variance in the sensor and reference measurement to maintain the desired treatment efficiency cost can be traded for accuracy during calibration and thereby identify the minimum needed effort for example the improved accuracy from triplicate reference samples can be compared to the increased analysis cost or an alternative action the improvements for revised calibration strategies can be analysed through the bias and variance components in 15 a good example is the frequently debated bucket approach and whether it is worth the efforts during calibration the bucket approach refers to when the sensor validation and calibration measurements are taken in a bucket filled with wastewater instead of directly from the process when analysing the bucket approach from 15 we can see that it improves the accuracy in several ways first the sensor s apparent noise can be reduced to zero if the wastewater concentration is constant and the measurement is conducted sufficiently long recall the sensor measurement eq 3 second the lab sampling error decreases as compared to when a grab sample is taken in the process as a reference the sampling error in sewers is indicated to be between 20 good turbulent sampling conditions and up to 100 laminar flow in rossi et al 2011 last note that a reduced sampling error impacts both the bias and variance in the reference measurement when the sampling error contributes to both b r and r r however a remaining key challenge is to quantify the sampling errors as well as the bias and variance proportions in the analytical errors without good error estimates also the estimated accuracy in 15 becomes unreliable therefore we recommend both on site and academic research efforts to bridge the knowledge gap in lab sample error quantification the following actions are recommended 1 routinely execute interlaboratory assessments round robin to identify systematic and random errors in the analytical chain 2 quantify the sensor validation variance r s in practice via the reproducibility and repeatability for the used validation approach 3 assess the variation in different sampling methods using e g the variogram approach as described in petersen and esbensen 2005 4 differentiate between systematic and random errors in the analyses when assessing the lab coverage factor confidence interval this may require new uncertainty quantification methods 4 3 aiming towards a best sensor calibration practice an assumption in the calibration model was that the same bias was obtained at each calibration occasion k this reflects the ideal situation when calibration is executed just in time to maintain a desired accuracy a challenge which was not considered here amounts to estimate the drift speed in practice the sensor drift varies for different reasons although only few studies have made detailed assessments about the exact relationships cecconi and rosso 2021 ohmura et al 2019 samuelsson et al 2018 further the calibration interval k is commonly fixed leading to different bias values for a fixed time depending on the drift speed thus assessing the time to reach a certain bias is critical in addition to the actual bias quantification a good thing is that the drift speed can be estimated from historic calibration data when including validation measurements information about how the sensor signal was adjusted during calibration tracking these so called metadata are essential for assessing the sensor s condition today routines are unfortunately lacking in practice on how to fully exploit the values in metadata which could when used be a game changer for best sensor calibration practices the importance of this topic is emphasized by the on going task group on metadata collection and organization metaco supported by international water association iwa assuming an ideal situation with quantified lab sample uncertainties metadata governance systems in place and extending the results and discussions in this study we can sketch a simple six step recipe best calibration practice for mitigating sensor drift with off set calibrations 1 decide the needed sensor accuracy using process expertise or simulations 2 assess and quantify the errors in 15 3 decide the most cost effective way to achieve the needed accuracy in step 1 e g by replicate samples during calibration or tailored sampling approaches 4 execute calibrations at an initially fixed interval e g monthly and record the estimated sensor drift speed during different seasons 5 extrapolate the drift speed and identify the calibration interval corresponding to the maximum accepted bias and desired accuracy 6 iterate step 4 5 and continuously improve the calibration routine while evaluating the metadata produced during calibration the calibration practice could also be adopted for a slope calibration if one expects the bias to vary with varying concentrations this would require adjustments of step 1 2 and step 5 in how the bias and variance are computed the bias may change depending on the considered concentration regardless of calibration method the suggested calibration strategy aims at correcting slow and minor sensor drift which will likely result in extended calibration intervals as a complement to the low frequency calibration we suggest using data driven methods such as the software sensor based approaches reviewed in haimi et al 2013 for high frequency real time monitoring and to detect sudden large bias 4 4 limitations and future work on the calibration model the calibration model assumes an offset calibration which is also used for the assumed tss sensor make such calibration is appropriate for an offset error i e an offset bias when the bias is instead caused by a slope error or a nonlinearity in the sensor an offset correction will only fully correct the bias at the specific concentration where the calibration is executed this is true when the controller is perfect and maintains the concentration at the setpoint which applies for the studied model however in practice the controller will not be perfect and an offset calibration will be inappropriate for a slope error further the bias direction may shift between positive and negative direction as well as with different magnitudes e g depending on season altogether the effects of these realistic issues need to be further analysed especially during the time between the calibration occasions that were not considered here for such analysis dynamic simulations are desired it is likely that these issues will induce deviations in the desired true concentration and potentially also create larger variations in the control signal still we hypothesize that such negative effects won t be reduced by applying a calibration threshold in the light of the presented results in this study rather executing the correct mitigating action such as a slope calibration for a slope error should be strived for such informed decision is reliant upon accurate validation data and metadata as described in the previous sections note that 15 is generally applicable regardless of calibration strategy here an offset calibration was assumed but also a slope calibration for a slope error would give the same results as long as the bias is corrected during the calibration this is because we here evaluated the rmse at the calibration instants however as a complement it would be interesting to also study how the rmse differs when the time between calibration occasions is considered then the effects of using an appropriate calibration strategy could be studied in a dynamic model where the time to attain the ideal setpoint in 8 would impact the results an additional and timely study would analyse how the errors in reference measurements and the inherited sensor calibration errors are transferred during model calibration assessing model accuracy is becoming a burning question when real time process models gaining wide spread usage popularly denoted digital twins there are similarities between model and sensor calibration but more reference measurements and constraints during model calibration complicates assessment of the final model accuracy it would therefore be interesting to see whether the findings here could be extended and revised to also benefit model calibration 5 conclusion uncertainties in the lab measurements used for sensor calibration induced errors in the sensor as well as the process controlled by a controller with the very same sensor this calibration error could not be mitigated by using a calibration threshold which on the contrary decreased the sensor accuracy for large threshold values thus the best choice to reach maximum sensor accuracy was to violate current practices and skip the calibration threshold and instead consistently execute calibration the only realistic situation that motivated a threshold was when the needed time for calibration was large as compared to validation setting the calibration threshold to zero did neither increase variations in the process nor in the control signals which has been a common concern further the sensor s calibration error was transferred to the process as a similar deviation between the setpoint and true concentration when controlled by a feedback control loop the transfer of calibration errors was seen in simulations as well as demonstrated analytically the expected sensor accuracy and the errors transferred to the process were quantified via a closed form expression when the bias and variance are known for the sensor and reference measurement this provides a theoretical tool to assess and improve calibration strategies in practice finally the bias detection rate during validation was low due to the uncertainties in the lab measurement more knowledge about the proportions of random and systematic sampling and measurement errors are needed to optimize both validation and calibration procedures because of the findings we argue that the current calibration viewpoint needs to shift focus from the existing sequential detection and correction approach towards an estimation approach with the goal to instead estimate bias magnitude and drift speed in this respect methods for automatically quantifying the apparent measurement errors based on metadata

15201,sensors used for control have become widespread in water resources recovery facilities during the strive for resource efficient operations however their accuracy is reliant on uncertain laboratory measurements which are used for calibration and in turn to correct for sensor drift at the same time current sensor calibration practices are lacking clear theoretical understanding of how measurement uncertainties impact the final control action the effects of a customarily and ad hoc applied calibration threshold are unknown leading to the current situation where many wastewater treatment processes are controlled by measurements with unknown accuracy to study how sensor accuracy is affected by calibration including varying calibration thresholds we developed a simple theoretical model with closed form expressions based on the variance and bias in sensor and laboratory measurements the model was then simulated to yield the results which showed no practical gain of using a calibration threshold apart from the situation when calibration is more time consuming than validation by contrast the best accuracy was obtained when consistently executing calibration which opposes common practice further the sensor calibration error was shown to be transferred to the process causing a similar deviation from the setpoint when the same sensor was used for control this emphasizes the importance of minimizing laboratory measurement uncertainties during calibration which otherwise directly impact operations due to these findings we strongly advice shifting mindset from considering calibration as a sequential detection and correction approach towards an estimation approach aiming to estimate bias magnitude and drift speed keywords sensor maintenance process control wastewater treatment plant measurement error condition based maintenance interlaboratory test data availability the model used for producing the simulation and related data is available as supplementary materials 1 introduction biased sensors operating in a feedback control loop have been shown to have negative impact on the treatment and resource efficiency in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs samuelsson et al 2021 at the same time on line sensors and advanced control are technologies that enable optimized resource efficient operations stentoft et al 2021 the challenge is to manage the increasing abundance of sensor data and in particular their accuracy we here refer to accuracy as the combination of trueness lack of systematic errors bias and precision lack of random errors in line with standardized nomenclature international organization for standardization 1994 the evaluation of sensor measurement quality and accuracy is known as validation which is commonly followed by calibration these are the most important actions for reaching a high accuracy in practice together with the mandatory sensor cleaning routines the aim of this paper is to show how validation and calibration impact the sensor accuracy and whether these actions can be tailored to achieve a desired accuracy sensor calibration in wrrfs can be conducted by linear regression rieger et al 2005 this is also a widely accepted method in general when the measurement used for validation also denoted reference measurement has a low precision as compared to the sensor bipm 2008 alternative methods exist that consider precision in both sensor and reference orear 1982 although they are scarce in practice a drawback with the linear regression approach is that at least two reference samples are needed preferably three or more samples are desired that should further be spread out in the full measurement range possibly due to these time consuming requirements a simpler approach has become standard in the wrrf domain which is described next the current practice for sensor calibration is a two step sequence commonly executed on a fixed time interval this approach applies to most sensors such as total suspended solids tss ammonium nitrate and dissolved oxygen do the first step validation is conducted by comparing the sensor value with a reference measurement in practice the more common reference is a grab sample e g for tss ammonium and nitrate it is possible to also use a standard solution with a known concentration if this is available common for ph sensors this study focuses on evaluating current practices and we here assume that the reference measurement is a grab sample the validation step is intended to decide whether the sensor provided a good enough measurement or needs calibration what good enough means is subjective and application specific and is encoded in a so called calibration threshold γ henceforth referred to as the threshold it is common to only calibrate the sensor when the difference during validation exceeds the threshold the adjustment is then executed via the sensor signal processing unit which we here assume to consist of a simple offset adjustment despite the prevalent usage of thresholds we have to the best of our knowledge not seen a theoretical explanation for how the threshold γ should be selected to produce a desired accuracy on the contrary we have seen a wide range of thresholds in practice instead motivated by practical experience ad hoc procedures or by sensor supplier information unpublished results by andersson 2019 a common suggestion is that a too tight threshold or even omitting the threshold would lead to excessive calibrations with increased variations in the measured signal because of the more frequent calibrations thus the threshold is not only intended to control the desired accuracy a second challenge with the current validation and calibration practice is that uncertainties in the reference measurement are not considered in a systematic manner one or two grab laboratory lab samples are commonly used for validation and calibration lab samples contain both systematic and random errors through the sampling and analytical procedures eurachem 2019 for example a systematic error is present if the concentration always differs between two measurement points such as the surface of an activated sludge tank and 0 5 m below the surface similarly influent variations causing dynamic variations in the tank concentration would induce a random sampling error if the sensor and lab sample are not taken simultaneously at the same location however these errors are not quantified or considered during the validation and calibration procedure therefore the final sensor accuracy after calibration is unclear this leads to the situation where the treatment process is controlled based on measurements with unknown accuracy this further lowers the incentive to improve existing calibration routines since any improvement would go unnoticed ultimately current calibration practices are lacking a clear theoretical understanding of how the lab uncertainties impact the final sensor accuracy and whether a threshold can be applied to improve or control the accuracy therefore we analysed calibration from both a practical and theoretical perspective to clarify what an optimal threshold value may be then we analysed the impact from the uncertainties during calibration and how these are transferred to the sensor as well as the process when the sensor is used in a feedback control loop or for monitoring more specifically we developed a model describing the instant steps during calibration which was then simulated and analysed theoretically the calibration model was illustrated with a fictive total suspended solids sensor used to control a constant total suspended solids concentration in an activated sludge tank 2 materials and methods a general discrete time model for calibration is introduced in section 2 2 which is illustrated by an example containing a tss sensor measuring in an activated sludge tank section 2 1 the calibration model was then simulated and evaluated as described in section 2 3 to assess the impact of threshold values on the sensor accuracy and indirectly the controlled tss concentration 2 1 example system and limitations the calibration model is illustrated with a tss sensor used for monitoring and control of the tss in the bioreactor of an activated sludge process the results are also applicable to a general sensor control system where sensor validation and calibration is conducted with uncertain reference measurements a deliberate limitation is that we here only considered off set calibration which is sufficient to correct a constant error i e an error that is independent of the measured value however for a sensitivity error slope error where the error magnitude depends on the measured value two or multipoint calibration is needed e g an ultraviolet light sensor the implications of this limitation with relation to the results are discussed in section 4 it should be noted that available calibration methods differ among sensor makes it is also common to have the choice of either conducting an off set or slope calibration this study is exemplified by a tss sensor calibrated with an offset which resembles e g a cerlic itx sensor a list of the used model variables and related abbreviations is given in table 1 2 2 sensor validation and calibration model a model for the sequential steps of sensor validation and calibration is successively introduced in this section together with an overview of how the model was simulated section 2 2 10 an important model feature is that one time step k in the model corresponds to one validation calibration sequence henceforth referred to as a calibration occasion this is commonly executed at a fixed interval weekly or monthly although this is not a requirement for the method 2 2 1 true concentration update the true concentration x t was assumed to be constant between two calibration occasions k and k 1 apart from an adjustment δ c 1 x t k 1 x t k δ c k the adjustment δ c represents the effect of the control signal on the true concentration the control signal can either be manual or automatically executed via a feedback controller and corresponds here to a change in amount of wasted activated sludge for simplicity other disturbances acting on the true sludge concentrations such as variability in influent flow rate concentrations temperature and operational changes in the return activated sludge flow were excluded it is however straightforward to extend the model with such additional factors 2 2 2 reference measurement in general the so called accepted reference value is the most accurate reference value that can be used for comparison i e sensor validation and calibration international organization for standardization 1994 here the concentration was assumed to be measured with one or several lab measurements in the media close to the sensor i e the sensor s ambient water we use the iso nomenclature and the term reference measurement for such lab measurements the reference measurement 2 x r k x t k b r v r k x r k v r k was modelled with a bias b r and measurement noise v r which is assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and variance r r furthermore x r is the noise free but biased reference measurement the measurement noise is the sum of all random errors including sampling and analytical errors similarly we assumed systematic errors due to sampling and analysis to be summed in the bias term b r 2 2 3 sensor measurement the sensor measurement 3 x s k x s k v s k was also modelled with a noise free component x s and white gaussian noise v s with variance r s note that the noise variance is measured with respect to k and not conventional time t in 3 therefore r s represents the sensor variance between validation occasions the apparent measurement noise is the conventional measurement noise and is the variance when reading the sensor value used for the validation commonly the sensor value during a validation is obtained by manually reading the sensor display during a short time interval mathematically the apparent sensor measurement noise r s a σ r n 2 is a function of the n sensor measurements executed to assess the sensor mean value during one validation occasion where σ r is the standard deviation of r s a hence r s a approaches zero when n in addition to the apparent sensor noise random errors may add due to the so called repeatability and reproducibility of the sensor validation the repeatability is the minimum variance for repeated measurements at constant conditions the reproducibility is the maximum variance of the precision when different sensor and operator individuals reproduce equivalent measurements in the same media therefore the repeatability r s m i n sets the lower bound and the reproducibility r s m a x the upper bound for the added variance thus the total variance r s lies between r s a r s m i n r s r s a r s m a x depending on the sensor validation routines for example well trained staff executing documented routines with a high reproducibility r s m a x r s m i n would yield lower random errors as compared to ad hoc actions conducted without caring for the sensor s condition the sensor was further assumed to get a bias b s between each calibration occasion k and k 1 4 x s k 1 x s k b s x t k 1 x t k where x t k 1 x t k from 1 shows the change in true concentration due to the impact of the control signal note that when the true concentration is constant i e x t k 1 x t k the sensor measurement is only changed by b s between the calibration occasions to simplify the bias b s was assumed to reach the same value between each calibration occasion although a time varying bias b s k is likely and could straightforwardly be included in the model 2 2 4 validation during sensor validation the noisy sensor measurement is compared with the reference measurement the difference δ d was identified as 5 δ d k x r k x s k x t k b r v r k x s k v s k 2 2 5 calibration having identified δ d the sensor was adjusted with a constant δ a if the difference was larger than a user defined calibration threshold γ 6a δ d k γ δ a k δ d k 6b δ d k γ δ a k 0 the adjustment δ a in 6a is known as an off set calibration and provides a calibrated sensor x s c a l i b k as 7a x s calib k x s k δ a k recall from 4 that between every calibration occasion the sensor gets a bias in addition to the change in true concentration 7b x s k 1 x s calib k b s δ c k x s k δ a k b s δ c k eq 7b describes how the sensor signal changes when calibration is applied by including δ a k as compared to 4 in which the sensor is not calibrated but only validated i e δ a k 0 2 2 6 sensor calibration in a feedback control loop as described in 1 the true concentration was changed via the effect of a manual or automatic control signal δ c for the situation with feedback control e g using a pi controller the sensor s accuracy will impact the true concentration via the controller as described below first the controller setpoint s p was assumed to be met prior each calibration occasion that is 8 x s k s p i e a perfect control without constraints on the control signal note that in 8 we used the noise free measurement in 3 and assume that the sensor measurement noise does not influence the controller s ability to reach the setpoint this assumption is valid for pi controllers when the sensor s apparent measurement noise frequency is much larger than the controller s speed i e its integration time which is the case for most controlled and slow wastewater treatment processes the main consequence of 8 is that δ c k will depend on the sensor drift and the adjustment during calibration 9 δ c k sp x s k δ a k b s this can be understood by recalling the sequence of made changes in the sensor during one calibration occasion first the sensor x s k was adjusted during calibration with δ a k as described by 6a 7a next the sensor receives a bias 7b and the controller compensates for the changes to fulfil 8 that is x s k 1 s p finally the impact on the true concentration with a feedback controller is again described by 1 with δ c from 9 for validation omitting calibration 9 was revised by simply setting δ a k to zero according to 6b 2 2 7 validation and calibration errors during monitoring and feedback control the final expressions for how calibration 7b or only validation 4 impact sensor accuracy is given by 10 and 11 based on 1 9 with a complete derivation in appendix a sensor used for monitoring when the sensor is only used for monitoring and not control the validation and calibration errors were here defined as the difference between the true and measured concentration validation error no

noise v s k 1 which is part of the sensor monitoring example but not the feedback control example this is a direct consequence of the assumption made in 8 2 2 8 calibration rule the decision to calibrate or not to calibrate can be answered by assessing the error magnitudes in 10 and 11 when the error is larger during validation than for calibration the sensor should be calibrated and vice versa interestingly the same simple decision rule was obtained for both 10 and 11 namely 12 x t k x s k b r v r k v s k calibrate x t k x s k b r v r k v s k validate that is when the absolute sensor bias x t k x s k is larger than the bias in the reference measurement plus the noise realizations calibration should be executed taking expectation of the right side of 12 yields 13 e b r v r k v s k e b r which demonstrates the logic decision to only calibrate when the reference measurement is more accurate than the sensor however the expected value of the left side of 12 is not obvious and depend on the calibration threshold in 6 for this reason the model was simulated as described in the next sections 2 2 9 motivation of model parameters to the best of our knowledge we have not found any studies or practical validation results that provide error estimates of the needed model parameters that is the bias and variance of tss sensor and reference measurements therefore these parameter values were assumed according to our reasoning in the next paragraphs firstly the reference measurement variance was assumed to be the sum of the analytical and sampling error variance for a lab measurement a typical standardized analytical protocol specifies 10 15 measurement uncertainty for tss which includes both systematic and random errors the sampling errors are less studied and the only example we found was rossi et al 2011 which indicates a 20 100 sampling error depending on flow conditions here we selected a variance error for the reference measurement of 150 mg l this corresponds to a 10 measurement uncertainty completely based on random errors which is a deliberate underestimation of the true value based on the limited data about systematic proportion of sampling and analytical errors we used the same error value for both the reference bias as for the variance secondly the sensor noise variance was assumed to be smaller than the reference measurement variance as indicated in section 2 2 3 the sensor variance can be reduced when performing a careful measurement e g during constant conditions in a bucket with wastewater and during an extended time we selected the sensor noise variance to one third of the assumed of reference measurement variance lastly we considered two bias levels 100 mg l and 350 mg l these correspond to values that would be considered small requiring no action and large needing a calibration in practice although this study uses the tss sensor as example the challenge to assess random and systematic errors is general for most water quality sensors 2 2 10 model simulations and software the simulated actions during one calibration occasion i e the simulated calibration model are outlined in table 3 with related parameter values in table 2 the model was implemented in matlab version r2020 and is available as supplementary materials 2 3 performance evaluation how well δ d measures the true difference x t x s i e whether a bias can be detected was analysed with the receiver operating characteristics roc and a two sample z test the improvement in accuracy by conducting several repeated lab measurements for the reference measurement replicates as well as for the sensor was analysed for one three and five repeated samples the roc visualizes the detection and false alarm rates as a function of calibration threshold value kay 1998 the impact from calibration thresholds on the true concentration was analysed by simulating the calibration model for k 1 000 time steps and m 10 000 monte carlo repetitions with the settings in table 2 the root mean squared error rmse 14a r m s e 1 m m 1 m 1 k k 1 k x t k s p 2 for a sensor used for control was then used to assess the accuracy and impact from calibration thresholds of the calibration and validation error in 11 the rmse was also analysed by its bias and variance proportions in general the mean squared error mse is the sum of the squared bias and variance see e g gustafsson 2000 14b m s e x e x 2 e x e x 2 further the impact from calibration thresholds on the variation in true concentration x t and controller correction δ c was evaluated by their respective standard deviations during the simulations finally the expected value of 11 when γ 0 was derived as reference to the numerical estimate in 13 obtained from the simulations 3 results the results are presented in the same order as calibration is executed in practice that is first the bias detection performance during sensor validation is analysed section 3 1 next the selection of an optimal calibration threshold is studied section 3 2 last the impact from calibration thresholds on the process variations is analysed section 3 3 3 1 sensor bias detection during validation the calibration rule in 12 requires that the difference x t k x s k can be quantified i e that the sensor bias can be detected this is in practice assessed via the validation and the difference δ d k x r k x s k in 5 how well bias of 100 and 350 mg l were detected during sensor validation with simulations and the settings in table 2 is shown in fig 1 a as the receiver operating characteristics in fig 1 a a false alarm is when the difference during validation calls for a calibration although there is no true difference i e no bias the opposite situation is denoted detection i e when a bias is correctly detected during validation the optimal detection performance is when the detection ratio is one and the false alarm rate is zero for all threshold values the lowest acceptable performance is indicated by the diagonal grey line in fig 1 a which is obtained when the decision to calibrate is decided randomly it is possible to get an even lower performance if deliberately violating the goal of validation however as a benchmark we should expect any validation method to be better than just flipping a coin the detection performance high detection rate and low false alarm rate increased with an increasing bias fig 1 a thus it was easier to correctly detect a large bias which is expected likewise a lowered threshold value improved the detection rate but at the cost of an increased false alarm rate this is indicated by the arrow in fig 1 a when the threshold was at its minimum i e zero the detection and false alarm rate matched the random detection performance upper right corner in fig 1 a that is both the maximum detection and false alarm rates were obtained with equal proportions of detections as false alarms close to optimal detection performance was obtained when three replicate measurements were taken during validation for a 350 mg l bias thick black solid line in fig 1 a an alternative to the roc is to adopt a statistical test framework and evaluate sensor validation in the view of a statistical hypothesis test in this regard the detection rate is known as the test s power and the false alarm rate equals the significance level kay 1998 an appropriate test was to assess the absolute difference during validation like a two sample z test the null hypothesis h0 was that there is no difference between the sensor and reference measurement no bias or a too small bias the alternative hypothesis h1 was that a certain difference exists e g that the bias equals 350 mg l or above fig 1 b illustrates the probability distributions for such test with the same settings as used in fig 1 a where a bias of 350 mg l was assumed to be present when the alternative hypothesis is true fig 1 b explains the difference in detection performance for the three black lines in fig 1 a first the power approaches one as the threshold is lowered to cover h1 see the arrow in fig 1 b next if h0 and h1 are perfectly separated e g due to an assumed large bias in h1 350 mg l optimal detection performance can be obtained with power one and zero significance level last the overlap between h0 and h1 is also decreased if the variance of either hypothesis is decreased this was the reason for the improved detection performance with three repeated measurements in fig 1 a in general the standard deviation of a gaussian decreases with σ n when replicate samples are taken where σ is the original standard deviation and n is the number of replicate samples table 4 shows the dramatic improvement in power when three or more samples were used ultimately fig 1 and table 4 indicates that a sufficiently large bias 350 mg l or repeated measurements during validation are needed for a reliable detection a power above 0 8 is commonly required in statistical tests for the settings in table 2 3 2 identifying the optimal calibration threshold how the calibration threshold comes into play and impact the sensor accuracy and true concentration is now analysed by evaluating simulations with the settings in table 2 also the impact from different threshold values with respect to the root mean squared error rmse is analysed 3 2 1 simulating the calibration model the output from simulating the calibration model with the sensor operating in a feedback control loop is shown in fig 2 which is intended to demonstrate that the calibration model produced logic results the top part fig 2 a shows the that the sensor measurement varies around the setpoint regardless of the true concentration the reference measurement varies around the true concentration but with an offset equal to its bias the true concentration drops in line with the accumulated sensor drift further fig 2 b shows that the periods with no sensor adjustments or controller corrections e g k 3 6 coincides with the consistent sensor drift in fig 2 a when the true concentration has dropped low enough so that the difference between the sensor and the reference is larger than the calibration threshold the sensor is adjusted during calibration e g k 7 and k 12 a complete set of figures describing the scenarios where the sensor was used for monitoring and with without bias and with without noise in the sensor and reference measurements are provided as complement in the supplementary materials 3 2 2 root mean squared error for different threshold values the impact of rmse with different threshold values when the sensor was used for feedback control is shown in fig 3 a b the rmse increased with increasing threshold fig 3 a the rmse consists of a bias and a variance part these are however more easily analysed in terms of their relative proportions of the mean squared error mse since the mse is the sum of these two components recall 14b the bias proportion of the error can thus be obtained by computing the ratio between the bias and the mse the bias proportion was constantly about 75 of the mse regardless of the threshold value this result indicates that the squared bias and variance errors increased equally much when the threshold was increased i e that the variance proportion did not increase for a zero threshold value when the sensor was biased however the mse bias proportion dramatically dropped for γ 400 mg l in fig 3 b which illustrates the same situation as in fig 3 a but with an unbiased sensor this observation simply reflects that the unbiased sensor never will be calibrated if a sufficiently large threshold is applied recall table 3 and that the true concentration and the sensor was initialized to x s x t s p b r b s this was also the only situation when a lower rmse was obtained with a calibration threshold larger than zero i e to keep the sensor as is when the sensor is perfect there is no gain in calibrating it with uncertain reference measurement recall the calibration decision rule in 12 ultimately the results in fig 3 a b indicate that the lowest rmse and thus the highest accuracy was obtained when calibration was consistently executed in this respect the optimal threshold value was zero when the impact from a biased sensor operating in feedback control should be minimized during calibration the one exception to the best of our knowledge for when a calibration threshold may be favourable was when the sensor trueness was better than what can be obtained from a calibration and when bias drift is not expected the actual sensor accuracy is studied in the next section 3 2 3 using a threshold to control the calibration error the deviation in true concentration and rmse in fig 3 a b was induced by the sensor and reference measurement errors as described by 11b and denoted calibration error similarly the calibration error for the sensor i e its accuracy was described in 10b how the sensor s accuracy was affected by different thresholds and replicate samples is shown in table 5 the sensor s accuracy reflected the accuracy of the controlled true concentration table 5 this was expected since the model is based on similar expressions compare 10 and 11 where only the sensor noise differs further table 5 shows that an increasing threshold corresponds to an increased rmse which was also shown in fig 3 however the threshold s absolute value does not necessarily reflect the achieved accuracy more specifically the rmse decreased with decreasing variance error increasing number of samples see table 5 further the threshold was shown to only impact the false alarm rate fig 1 altogether these results indicate that a threshold cannot control the sensor accuracy although it will have a direct negative impact on the final sensor accuracy the only exception where a threshold can decrease rmse can be seen in fig 3 b which applies for the case with an unbiased sensor applying γ 800 mg l indicates a rmse equal to zero fig 3 b this corresponds to a sufficiently large threshold where no calibrations are executed due to random variations in the sensor and reference measurements complementary computations data not shown showed a linear correlation between the total sensor and reference standard deviation and the threshold producing zero rmse as γ 4 8 r r r s r2 99 74 thus as a rule of thumb a threshold needs to be at least five time times larger than the standard deviation of the random errors if calibration on noise should be avoided note for such large threshold the detection rate is below the random detector performance fig 1 a b and incapable of detecting a bias of 350 mg l 3 2 4 expected values for zero threshold value the rmse for a zero threshold obtained from simulations can be verified by comparing the expected value for the calibration error in 10b and 11b with the rmse value for γ 0 mg l in fig 3 a b as hastie et al 2009 describe the standard expression for the mean squared error is m s e x e x 2 e x e x 2 which can then be used to quantify the accuracy in 10b and 11b as 15a r m s e x t k 1 x s k 1 b r b s 2 r r 2 r s 15b r m s e x t k 1 s p b r b s 2 r r r s where the bias proportion of the mse is b r b s 2 and the variance part is r r 2 r s for the sensor accuracy and r r r s for the controlled concentration due to the assumption in 8 note that 15 provides a closed form expression that quantifies the accuracy as a function of the bias and variance of sensor and reference samples when no threshold is used 3 3 process variations due to sensor calibration one hypothesized complication of using γ 0 mg l mentioned in section 1 was the potential variations in the true concentration or in the change induced by the control signal δ c fig 3 c d shows how the variance in δ c and the true concentration were affected by different calibration thresholds in the range 0 1 000 mg l similarly as for the rmse the variance in both the true concentration and δ c increased with increasing threshold values in fig 3 c in the end neither a decreased rmse nor an increased variance was indicated as an issue when omitting the calibration threshold 4 discussion 4 1 targeting sensor bias detection or estimation not surprisingly the results showed that it is challenging to detect a small bias when the reference measurement has a large uncertainty the detection rate could be increased by lowering the calibration threshold and optimally reached one when set to zero at the expense of an increased false alarm rate then the detection performance approached the random detector s performance with 50 false alarms half of the executed calibrations would then be carried out despite that the sensor is unbiased and hence in no need for calibration in practice this would be a poor strategy if calibration is time consuming or costly however for most water quality sensors the preceding validation and reference measurement sample is the more costly action the calibration effort only amounts to manually entering the validation data in the sensor s digital processing unit and even this step has been automated in some swedish wrrfs in the end negligible negative effects can be assumed from excessive calibrations in practice the logic calibration rule in 12 13 stated that calibration should only be executed when the reference measurement is more accurate than in the sensor one such situation in practice when bias detection as a pre step for calibration could be motivated is when a sensor has been calibrated to a very high accuracy e g when directly supplied from the supplier one example is airflow rate sensors which can be adjusted to a high accuracy in factory where a good reference sensor is available then calibrating the same sensor with on site routines lower accuracy would deteriorate the supplier calibration in line with eq 15 and the results for the unbiased sensor fig 3 b if instead a calibration threshold value is used the sensor should only be calibrated when it has lost its supplier provided accuracy and obtained a sufficiently large bias then the rule of thumb in section 3 2 3 could be used to select a sufficiently large threshold note however that a large bias is required for a reliable detection when the reference measurement has a low accuracy fig 1 thus it would be a gamble and a guess to know when the sensor has lost enough accuracy to gain from on site calibration disregarding the unlikely situation in the previous paragraph the results showed that both the highest accuracy as well as the smallest variation in true concentration were obtained when no threshold was applied i e when calibration always was executed this contrasts the common perception that a calibration threshold can be used to somehow improve the accuracy in the sensor or reduce the variations induced during calibration it is unclear why the usage of calibration thresholds has reached wide acceptance in the wastewater domain one reason could be saving time if validation is quicker than calibration another reason could be that it is a consequence of considering validation as a bias detection test and assess whether calibration is needed i e a detection problem in this regard statistical hypothesis testing is a widely taught method that produces a threshold via the decided significance level however a statistical test is commonly executed for more than one observation when the mean and variances are estimated from data this can cause confusion for how such a test should be executed for one sample which is common practice during validation and may be one reason for the lack of documented procedures for choosing the optimal threshold the results showed that the significance level and the false alarm rate could be controlled by the threshold but not the detection rate or the sensor accuracy an alternative view is to instead consider validation and calibration as an estimation problem this is logical since most water quality sensors are indirect measurements and rely on calibration estimation via reference measurements in such estimation viewpoint all efforts are focused around estimating the bias and maximizing the sensor accuracy for the given data rather than worrying about whether the sensor is sufficiently biased or not by continuously using all available data for calibrating the sensor the lowest rmse is obtained on average fig 3 while accepting that variations in the adjustments in fig 2 b are a natural consequence from the uncertain reference measurement and calibration procedure it also becomes clear in the estimation viewpoint why thresholds can be problematic for example excluding part of the measurements in a dataset used during estimation by applying a threshold would violate the best estimation practice and bias the training dataset it is only customary to remove outliers this is the opposite effect to what a threshold induces for example when applying a 310 mg l threshold only values and outliers outside this limit are used for calibration the reason for these outliers is more likely caused by inaccurate reference measurement and not a large sensor bias also reference measurements close to the sensor s within the threshold range are not used for calibration and effectively wastes part of the available data for estimation in the end we could ask what the main goal with sensor validation and calibration is do we want to know whether the sensor has a bias yes no or do we want to produce a sensor measurement as accurately as possible we recommend the latter and to shift our mindset towards regarding sensor validation and calibration as an estimation problem rather than a detection problem 4 2 optimizing the practical trade off in accuracy when regarding calibration as an estimation problem a natural follow up question is what the optimal trade off is with regards to achieved accuracy for spent resources the 15 gave a closed form expression for the final accuracy depending on the noise and bias errors in the sensor and the reference measurement first the equation is a good tool to assure that the desired accuracy is reached for example a previous simulation study showed that the bias above 500 mg l in a total suspended solids sensor was problematic for the nitrogen removal efficiency samuelsson et al 2021 the equation can be used to decide the maximum acceptable bias and variance in the sensor and reference measurement to maintain the desired treatment efficiency cost can be traded for accuracy during calibration and thereby identify the minimum needed effort for example the improved accuracy from triplicate reference samples can be compared to the increased analysis cost or an alternative action the improvements for revised calibration strategies can be analysed through the bias and variance components in 15 a good example is the frequently debated bucket approach and whether it is worth the efforts during calibration the bucket approach refers to when the sensor validation and calibration measurements are taken in a bucket filled with wastewater instead of directly from the process when analysing the bucket approach from 15 we can see that it improves the accuracy in several ways first the sensor s apparent noise can be reduced to zero if the wastewater concentration is constant and the measurement is conducted sufficiently long recall the sensor measurement eq 3 second the lab sampling error decreases as compared to when a grab sample is taken in the process as a reference the sampling error in sewers is indicated to be between 20 good turbulent sampling conditions and up to 100 laminar flow in rossi et al 2011 last note that a reduced sampling error impacts both the bias and variance in the reference measurement when the sampling error contributes to both b r and r r however a remaining key challenge is to quantify the sampling errors as well as the bias and variance proportions in the analytical errors without good error estimates also the estimated accuracy in 15 becomes unreliable therefore we recommend both on site and academic research efforts to bridge the knowledge gap in lab sample error quantification the following actions are recommended 1 routinely execute interlaboratory assessments round robin to identify systematic and random errors in the analytical chain 2 quantify the sensor validation variance r s in practice via the reproducibility and repeatability for the used validation approach 3 assess the variation in different sampling methods using e g the variogram approach as described in petersen and esbensen 2005 4 differentiate between systematic and random errors in the analyses when assessing the lab coverage factor confidence interval this may require new uncertainty quantification methods 4 3 aiming towards a best sensor calibration practice an assumption in the calibration model was that the same bias was obtained at each calibration occasion k this reflects the ideal situation when calibration is executed just in time to maintain a desired accuracy a challenge which was not considered here amounts to estimate the drift speed in practice the sensor drift varies for different reasons although only few studies have made detailed assessments about the exact relationships cecconi and rosso 2021 ohmura et al 2019 samuelsson et al 2018 further the calibration interval k is commonly fixed leading to different bias values for a fixed time depending on the drift speed thus assessing the time to reach a certain bias is critical in addition to the actual bias quantification a good thing is that the drift speed can be estimated from historic calibration data when including validation measurements information about how the sensor signal was adjusted during calibration tracking these so called metadata are essential for assessing the sensor s condition today routines are unfortunately lacking in practice on how to fully exploit the values in metadata which could when used be a game changer for best sensor calibration practices the importance of this topic is emphasized by the on going task group on metadata collection and organization metaco supported by international water association iwa assuming an ideal situation with quantified lab sample uncertainties metadata governance systems in place and extending the results and discussions in this study we can sketch a simple six step recipe best calibration practice for mitigating sensor drift with off set calibrations 1 decide the needed sensor accuracy using process expertise or simulations 2 assess and quantify the errors in 15 3 decide the most cost effective way to achieve the needed accuracy in step 1 e g by replicate samples during calibration or tailored sampling approaches 4 execute calibrations at an initially fixed interval e g monthly and record the estimated sensor drift speed during different seasons 5 extrapolate the drift speed and identify the calibration interval corresponding to the maximum accepted bias and desired accuracy 6 iterate step 4 5 and continuously improve the calibration routine while evaluating the metadata produced during calibration the calibration practice could also be adopted for a slope calibration if one expects the bias to vary with varying concentrations this would require adjustments of step 1 2 and step 5 in how the bias and variance are computed the bias may change depending on the considered concentration regardless of calibration method the suggested calibration strategy aims at correcting slow and minor sensor drift which will likely result in extended calibration intervals as a complement to the low frequency calibration we suggest using data driven methods such as the software sensor based approaches reviewed in haimi et al 2013 for high frequency real time monitoring and to detect sudden large bias 4 4 limitations and future work on the calibration model the calibration model assumes an offset calibration which is also used for the assumed tss sensor make such calibration is appropriate for an offset error i e an offset bias when the bias is instead caused by a slope error or a nonlinearity in the sensor an offset correction will only fully correct the bias at the specific concentration where the calibration is executed this is true when the controller is perfect and maintains the concentration at the setpoint which applies for the studied model however in practice the controller will not be perfect and an offset calibration will be inappropriate for a slope error further the bias direction may shift between positive and negative direction as well as with different magnitudes e g depending on season altogether the effects of these realistic issues need to be further analysed especially during the time between the calibration occasions that were not considered here for such analysis dynamic simulations are desired it is likely that these issues will induce deviations in the desired true concentration and potentially also create larger variations in the control signal still we hypothesize that such negative effects won t be reduced by applying a calibration threshold in the light of the presented results in this study rather executing the correct mitigating action such as a slope calibration for a slope error should be strived for such informed decision is reliant upon accurate validation data and metadata as described in the previous sections note that 15 is generally applicable regardless of calibration strategy here an offset calibration was assumed but also a slope calibration for a slope error would give the same results as long as the bias is corrected during the calibration this is because we here evaluated the rmse at the calibration instants however as a complement it would be interesting to also study how the rmse differs when the time between calibration occasions is considered then the effects of using an appropriate calibration strategy could be studied in a dynamic model where the time to attain the ideal setpoint in 8 would impact the results an additional and timely study would analyse how the errors in reference measurements and the inherited sensor calibration errors are transferred during model calibration assessing model accuracy is becoming a burning question when real time process models gaining wide spread usage popularly denoted digital twins there are similarities between model and sensor calibration but more reference measurements and constraints during model calibration complicates assessment of the final model accuracy it would therefore be interesting to see whether the findings here could be extended and revised to also benefit model calibration 5 conclusion uncertainties in the lab measurements used for sensor calibration induced errors in the sensor as well as the process controlled by a controller with the very same sensor this calibration error could not be mitigated by using a calibration threshold which on the contrary decreased the sensor accuracy for large threshold values thus the best choice to reach maximum sensor accuracy was to violate current practices and skip the calibration threshold and instead consistently execute calibration the only realistic situation that motivated a threshold was when the needed time for calibration was large as compared to validation setting the calibration threshold to zero did neither increase variations in the process nor in the control signals which has been a common concern further the sensor s calibration error was transferred to the process as a similar deviation between the setpoint and true concentration when controlled by a feedback control loop the transfer of calibration errors was seen in simulations as well as demonstrated analytically the expected sensor accuracy and the errors transferred to the process were quantified via a closed form expression when the bias and variance are known for the sensor and reference measurement this provides a theoretical tool to assess and improve calibration strategies in practice finally the bias detection rate during validation was low due to the uncertainties in the lab measurement more knowledge about the proportions of random and systematic sampling and measurement errors are needed to optimize both validation and calibration procedures because of the findings we argue that the current calibration viewpoint needs to shift focus from the existing sequential detection and correction approach towards an estimation approach with the goal to instead estimate bias magnitude and drift speed in this respect methods for automatically quantifying the apparent measurement errors based on metadata

15202,widespread attention has been given to understanding the effect of the landscape pattern on river water quality however which spatial scale riparian zone versus sub basin has the greater impact on water quality has long been controversial since the key metrics that affect water quality varied with spatial scale thus quantifying the spatial scale effects of key landscape metrics on water quality is critical to clarifying which scale of landscape pattern is more conducive to water quality conservation here we adopted variation partitioning analysis vpa and random forest models to quantify the landscape pattern impact on water quality at northern erhai lake during the 2019 rainy season early mid and late and comprehensively analyze the key landscape metrics on different scales the results revealed that the riparian zone and sub basin scale landscape patterns explained similar water quality variations difference only 0 9 in the mid august and late rainy season october but exhibited a large difference 24 1 during the early rainy season june furthermore rivers were primarily stressed by nitrogen pollution maintaining the grassland ed 27 99 m ha grassland lpi 4 19 farmland lsi 3 2 in the riparian zone and construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 farmland pladj 89 0 at the sub basin scale could significantly reduce the tn concentration in the stream meanwhile managing of these metrics can effectively prevent rapid increases of tn in rivers moreover due to the low phosphorus concentration in the rivers none of the landscape metrics significantly explained the variation in tp this study explored the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality and revealed the driving factors of nutrient variation this study will provide a scientific basis for aquatic environmental management in plateau watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landscape pattern water quality spatial scale effects nitrogen and phosphorus abrupt change thresholds data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction river water quality is the foundation for public health and socioeconomic sustainability castrillo and garcía 2020 which is significantly influenced by the surrounding landscape patterns since streams are the primary sink of pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems allan 2004 hobbie et al 2017 with anthropogenic activities dramatically altering river surrounding landscape patterns huang et al 2021 the effect of landscape patterns on aquatic environments has gradually received additional attention li et al 2021 especially in the process of watershed management effective watershed management such as best management practices bmps relies on using the landscape pattern effects chang et al 2021 there remains considerable uncertainty however in managing which scale of landscape pattern is more conducive to water quality conservation clément et al 2017 stets et al 2020 therefore clarifying the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality will provide insight into the deterioration mechanism of aquatic ecosystems spatial scales refer to the distance between river and landscape patches and are usually quantification into two scales riparian zone and sub basin mainali et al 2019 however the controversy regarding whether managing riparian zone landscape patterns or sub basin scale landscape patterns has greater effects on water quality preservation has persisted enormous efforts have been made on the scale design such as different types strips and circular and widths buffers to identify the critical scale of landscape pattern impact on water quality li et al 2018 nelson mwaijengo et al 2020 there is still no consensus on the critical scale of landscape pattern management laudon et al 2018 in previous studies the 100 m 300 m 500 m 1000 m buffer strips and even sub basins have been considered to be the critical scales that have the strongest influence on water quality pratt and chang 2012 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2012 in fact the coupling relationship between landscape patterns and river water quality varies with spatial scale extend from riparian buffers to sub basins ding et al 2016 and this characteristic has been ignored for a long time thus identifying the critical landscape pattern characteristics based on spatial scale shifts and quantifying their impact on water quality is conducive to clarifying the critical scale at which managing landscape patterns to mitigate water quality deterioration ecologists define landscape patterns as the spatial structure arrangement and placement of land use patches shehab et al 2021 and quantify them through landscape and class level metrics they consider the patch spatial characteristics of the entire landscape or a single land use type respectively zhang et al 2017 numerous studies have suggested that the class level metrics are more predictable in water pollution and have practical significance to quantify the ecological process of landscape patterns amiri and nakane 2009 shen et al 2014 uuemaa et al 2005 however due to the multicollinearity and cross scale instability among these landscape metrics not all metrics provide useful information to describe landscape patterns xu et al 2020 for example in construction land and farmland only regulating the landscape shape index lsi patch density pd and largest patch index lsi can effectively reduce river pollutants li et al 2021 therefore screening the relatively independent class level metrics that significantly impact river conditions is vital for understanding the ecological functions of landscape patterns considering the abruptly changing relationship between landscape patterns and stream water quality huo et al 2015 the destruction of natural landscape patterns by anthropogenic activities will not immediately deteriorate the aquatic environment unless the change in landscape metrics exceeds the abrupt change point the abrupt change point assembly is defined as the abrupt threshold beyond which water quality will rapid deterioration due to changes in landscape metrics wu and lu 2021 most studies evaluated the abrupt thresholds of landscape metrics at the sub basin scale clément et al 2017 wu and lu 2019 and less is known about landscape metric change points in the riparian zone where conservation districts are concentrated huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in a previous study the abrupt thresholds of various class level metrics in the watershed lacked comprehensive consideration shen et al 2015 hence evaluating the abrupt thresholds at different scales for key class level metrics is beneficial to developing more effective water quality management measures water pollution in china especially lake eutrophication has been responsible for water scarcity huang et al 2021 erhai lake as one of the new three lakes key protected lakes is an important source of drinking water for dali city in yunnan china lin et al 2020 rivers in the study area are the source rivers of the northern part of erhai lake which are generally impaired by excessive nutrients liu et al 2019 accelerating the transformation of erhai lake from mediotrophic to eutrophic li et al 2020 therefore revealing the regulatory mechanism of landscape patterns on nutrients in the study area is helpful to formulate management measures to alleviate the water quality degradation of erhai lake thus our objectives of this study are to 1 identify the critical scale of the landscape patterns on stream water quality 2 screen the key class level landscape metrics that explain the variation in stream nutrients tn tp and 3 quantify the abrupt threshold of the key landscape metrics this study hopes to provide scientific support for sustainable landscape management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the typical plateau watershed located in yunnan province southwest china fig 1 b which is composed of the fengyu river basin f1 f10 the mici river basin mc1 mc12 and the miju river basin mj1 mj9 fig 1a the drainage basin covers a total area of 1 310 km2 and has a total length of 71 1 km the mean annual precipitation is 1 048 mm and the mean annual temperature is 15 1 c importantly the rainfall of the rainy season from may to october accounts for 85 of the yearly precipitation due to a large amount of rainfall during the rainy season the rivers in the study area were connected in june the water level reached its highest depth in august and dropped in october notably the three rivers are connected during the rainy season to form the largest river entering the lake in the north of erhai lake meanwhile this season is also the most crucial time for water pollution in the study area and has the greatest impact on erhai lake water quality liu et al 2019 2 2 water sampling and analytical methods we established 31 sampling sites located in the mainstream and tributaries of the north erhai lake basin each sampling site is established based on the following three principles 1 the gradient distribution of landscape 2 the hydrological characteristics of the sub basin and 3 the sub basin area and belonged to an outlet of the independent catchment since the lack of recharge during the dry season the study area river breaks to form three streams fengyu river mici river miju river thus the surface water samples i e the top 50 cm were collected from the 31 sampling sites in this study after the three streams were connected during the rainy season to reduce the instability of the impact of landscape patterns on water quality caused by single sampling this study conducted three samplings during the rainy season and each sampling process took one week furthermore samples were collected during a consecutive week without rainfall to alleviate the effects of rainfall and runoff on the relationship between landscape patterns and water quality the samples were collected in a 500 ml polythene bottle and stored at 4 c until analysis nine parameters were chosen for measurement to reflect water quality the total carbon tc dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic values were measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5050a japan the nitrate and ammonia nitrogen no3 n nh4 n total nitrogen tn total dissolved nitrogen tdn total phosphorus tp and total dissolved phosphorus tdp were determined by an automatic discontinuous analyzer smartchem 200 brookfield usa the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter jinlong china before doc dic tdn and tdp were determined 2 3 spatial scale and landscape metrics to explore the spatial scale effects of the landscape pattern on water quality we divided the basin into the riparian zone fig 1d and the sub basin scale fig 1e the riparian zone ranges from dozens of meters to 100 m in the section of the study area combined previous studies park et al 2021 sliva and dudley williams 2001 and fieldwork to determine that a 100 m buffer strip is the most suitable scale for characterizing riparian zones in the entire watershed the boundaries of the sub basin were outlined first by the arcswat software using a digital elevation model dem with a 30 30 m grid resolution fig 1c considering the spatial autocorrelation can interfere with the connection between landscape patterns and water quality lintern et al 2018 mainali and chang 2020 the watershed was divided into 31 sub basins with sampling points as outlets and the sub basin corresponds to all of the catchment areas upstream of the sampling sites fig s1 meanwhile the 100 m wide buffer strips on both stream sides were extracted by arcgis 10 2 software the study area land use map for 2020 was derived from the national catalogue service for geographic information www globalland30 com doi 10 11769 the data include farmland forestland grassland shrubland water areas construction land wetland and bare land wetland and bare land accounted for less than 1 of the total area and were thus excluded from subsequent analyses class level landscape metrics comprehensively reflect the spatial distribution and allocation of various land use patches however from a practical planning standpoint fewer have application values therefore we selected the six most commonly used class level metrics among the area and edge metrics shape metrics and diversity metrics table 1 these metrics were calculated by the fragstat 4 2 software based on the eight neighbor cell rule all the landscape metrics are extracted at both the riparian zone and sub basin scales 2 4 statistical analyses the shapiro wilk test was used to test the normality of the water quality variables before analysis the one way anova test non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and ward clustering were used to determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of water quality then pearson correlation analysis and the bioenv function clarke 1993 was used to select the core land use and landscape metrics data respectively the significance level of the bioenv correlation coefficients was calculated by the mantel test p 0 05 n 999 furthermore non linearly independent metric combinations were selected to represent the landscape pattern in the riparian zone and the sub basin scale according to the results of the bioenv analysis and the mantel test meanwhile corresponding metrics were combined into the variance partitioning analysis vpa model borcard dp 1992 økland and eilertsen 1994 to quantify the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality the above analysis was carried out using the vegan package oksanen et al 2007 not all landscape metrics are critical for mediating nutrient cycles thus based on the bioenv results the random forest randomforest package model was used to estimate the importance of landscape metrics on tn and tp loss random forests rfs result in a robust model that can generate internal error estimates and measure the importance of variables francke et al 2008 the percentage increases in the mse mean squared error of variables higher incmse values imply more important variables breiman 2001 moreover the significance of each landscape metric on the response variables was assessed with the rfpermute package jiao et al 2018 then the metrics that passed the significance test can be used as key landscape metrics to predict the variation in nutrient concentration nonparametric changepoint analysis ncpa is very useful for calculating the location of change points relevant to water quality parameters and landscape metrics wu and lu 2021 thus the ncpa was used to quantify the change point of the key landscape metrics further information on ncpa algorithm can be found in huo et al 2015 commonly the availability of actual observation data is limited therefore the ncpa was combined with the bootstrap method to estimate the frequency distribution of change points qian et al 2004 since ncpa has a premise assumption that the water quality data series should cover all from healthy to pollution tn and tp were the main factors in the china environmental quality standard for surface water and tc toc no3 n were not concluded thus this study focused on the variation of tn and tp we extracted 1000 random samples of raw tn and tp parameter key landscape metric dataset by the bootstrap method furthermore using the bias corrected and accelerated bca method corrects for bias and skewness in the distribution of bootstrap estimates and improves the accuracy of the frequency distribution of change point estimation accordingly the 95 confidence interval of each change point bootstrap package n 1000 was evaluated all statistical analyses were conducted in r v 4 1 1 and the schematic structure of the statistical analysis framework is shown in fig s2 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variation in water quality the river water quality parameters in the study area had significant temporal differences p 0 05 the pollution was most severe in the mid rainy season fig s3 and table s1 nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations tn tdn nh4 n and tp were higher in the early and mid rainy seasons and decreased significantly during the late rainy season the average concentrations of nh4 n and tp in the river were well below the type iii surface water environmental quality standards gb3838 2002 applicable to centralized living drinking water nh4 n 1 mg l and tp 0 2 mg l the spatial variability in water quality was significant in the early and late rainy seasons figs 2 and s4 during the early rainy season the fenyu river f and mici river mc water quality was distinct from the lower miju river mj water quality and their difference was reduced in the late rainy season 3 2 variations in land use and landscape metrics and their correlation with water quality the core land use such as farmland forestland grassland and construction land had a significant impact on water quality in this study fig s5 their compositions varied greatly at the riparian zone and sub basin scales fig 3 the average proportion of farmland in the riparian zone reached 51 3 but decreased to 27 0 on the sub basin scale in turn the average proportion of forestland and grassland in the riparian zone was 24 0 and 8 0 but increased to 38 5 and 18 6 on the sub basin scale respectively the riparian zone vegetation fragmentation was high and the pd ed metrics were much higher than those of other land use types fig 4 meanwhile the density of forestland and grassland patches pd in the riparian zone was significantly and negatively correlated with tn which shows that high density of vegetation patches helps to intercept nitrogen entering the river fig 5 furthermore the landscape shape index lsi of farmland and construction land was significantly and positively correlated with most indicators of water quality at both scales indicating that irregular farmland and construction land are important sources of river pollutants in addition there is a time dependent water quality on landscape metrics with the correlation of most water quality parameters and landscape metrics reaching significant levels in the early and middle rainy season but almost no significant correlation in the late rainy season 3 3 effects of landscape pattern at different scales on water quality bioenv analysis and the mantel test demonstrated that the landscape metrics dominating water quality variation were different at the riparian zone and sub basin scales table 2 furthermore the vpa model quantified the spatial scale effect of various land use patterns on water quality fig 6 the results indicated that landscape patterns had no significant scale dependence on the ability to explain water quality variations the water quality variation explained by the riparian zone and sub basin landscape patterns ranged from 32 7 to 50 1 and 26 0 to 47 4 respectively the different scales of landscape patterns explain water quality variations were almost identical 0 9 difference during the mid and late rainy seasons only in the early rainy season did the riparian zone landscape pattern explain more water quality variation with a difference up to 24 1 3 4 abrupt thresholds of the key landscape metrics on tn and tp based on the bioenv analysis results this study further screened the key landscape metrics that could significantly explain the variation in nutrients in the river using the random forest model fig 7 the grassland ed grassland lpi forestland pladj and farmland lsi metrics had significant predictive power for tn in the riparian zone while the construction ed construction lsi and farmland pladj metrics had significant predictive power for tn at the sub basin scale the interesting result was that landscape metrics had no significant ability to predict changes in tp in this study area the ncpa results indicated the tendency of the riparian zone and sub basin scale tn concentration to abruptly change in response to landscape metrics table 3 obtained the abrupt change threshold with a 95 confidence interval combining the results of the correlation analysis between landscape metrics and water quality fig 5 we discovered that maintaining grassland lpi 4 19 grassland ed 28 0 m ha forestland pladj 82 6 and farmland lsi 3 2 in the riparian zone while regulating sub basin scale construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 and farmland pladj 89 0 could effectively reduce the tn concentration in the river 4 discussion 4 1 spatial scale effects of landscape pattern on water quality it has long been controversial which spatial scale landscape pattern riparian versus sub basin scale has a greater influence on river water quality sliva and dudley williams 2001 song et al 2021 hille et al 2018 and shi et al 2017 emphasized that the riparian buffer was a critical scale for the interception and processing of pollutants via runoff ding et al 2016 and zhou et al 2012 however supported that landscape patterns at the sub basin scale were more important for water environment regulation because nutrient loading and retention usually occurred over a large spatial range previous studies consider the critical spatial scale depending on the water quality parameters studied whereas this study indicated that the riparian zone and sub basin scale landscape patterns explained water quality variation fairly similarly especially in the mid and late rainy seasons and their difference was only 0 9 fig 6 the influence of landscape patterns on water quality was equally important at the riparian zone and sub basin scales these results were inconsistent with the past views liu et al 2018 shehab et al 2021 which may be related to the selection of different landscape metric combinations to represent landscape patterns in this study previous studies in the different scales riparian zone and sub basin used the same landscape metrics to quantify the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality shen et al 2015 song et al 2021 which could not comprehensively exhibit the impact of spatial scale shifts on the relationship between landscape patterns and water quality for example when the spatial scale changed from the riparian scale to the sub basin scale the critical metric of forest landscape pattern affecting water quality changed from forestland lsi to forestland lpi clément et al 2017 wu and lu 2021 this study also found similar conclusions taking farmland landscape pattern as an example the combination of ed pd and lsi metrics in the riparian zone was the most important while the combination of lsi enn mn and pladj metrics in the sub basins scale was the most important table 3 thus selecting suitable landscape pattern metrics based on the spatial scale can effectively reduce redundant indicators and improve the interpretation accuracy of landscape patterns on water quality change our results avoid the interference of redundant metrics and confirm that managing corresponding landscape patterns at different scales is equally important for water quality conservation unexpectedly the riparian zone landscape pattern explained more water quality variation than the sub basin scale the difference reached 24 1 in the early rainy season in this study fig 6 the reason may be related to runoff generation and confluence mechanisms the area of the landscape patches and their distance from the river can affect the runoff generation and confluence processes chen et al 2016 li and sivapalan 2011 mounirou et al 2020 large landscape patches produce less overland flow per unit area than small patches since their greater internal retention and absorption capacity furthermore the surface runoff confluence process extends with the expansion of the spatial scale the riparian zone parcel with a small surface area is close to the river the riparian landscape pattern acts as a pollutant filter during the rapid inflow of massive runoff into the river which can effectively explain more water quality changes liu et al 2014 in contrast the sub basin scale patches are large and far from the river with lengthy runoff generation and confluence processes which caused the impact of sub basin landscape patterns hysteresis behind the direct impact of riparian zone landscapes on water quality wu et al 2021 wu and lu 2021 consequently sub basin scale landscape patterns explained less water quality variation when the runoff produced by the sub basin patches did not fully converge into the river during the early rainy season in addition this hysteresis effect has led previous researchers to underestimate the ability to protect water quality through landscape pattern management at the sub basin scale therefore although the relationship between landscape pattern and water quality can be established with a single sampling it is recommended to conduct multiple samplings during the rainy season to clarify the spatial scale effect of landscape pattern on water quality 4 2 prediction of nutrient pollution changes by key landscape metrics this work demonstrated that riparian zone grassland ed and lpi and sub basin scale construction land ed and lsi could effectively explain the variation in tn fig 7 the ed metrics represent the patch boundary change caused by land use transformations which can enhance or disrupt the flow rate of nutrients between spatial patches based on the firmness of edges liu et al 2021 the lsi and lpi metrics reflect the degree of irregular patches and the single largest patch in the watershed the riparian grassland metrics ed and lpi were significantly negatively correlated with the tn concentration in the river suggesting that the complex grassland patch boundary promoted the sink effect on nutrient flow clément et al 2017 meanwhile the larger the grassland patch is the higher the interception and absorption of nutrient pollutants zhang et al 2019 contrary to grassland the construction land ed and lsi metrics were significantly positively associated with river tn concentrations fig 5b the complex boundaries and irregular shapes expand the range of impervious surfaces increasing the flow rate of nutrients li et al 2015 shen et al 2015 thus establishing new grassland patches at the intersection areas of different landscape patches in the riparian zone and planning a tidy development pattern of construction land at the sub basin scale can effectively reduce tn in the stream the random forest results indicated that the farmland lsi metrics and farmland pladj metrics efficiently forecast the variation in tn at the riparian zone and sub basin scales respectively fig 7 farmland is the primary source of nutrients in rivers and its patterns have a considerable impact on water quality bu et al 2014 large patches of irregular farmland in the riparian zone fig 4 increase the risk of nitrogen export ding et al 2016 ouyang et al 2018 the farmland pladj metric indicated the probability of a similar patch appearing around a farmland patch the higher the value of this metric is the better the connectivity of the farmland thus the higher farmland pladj metric enhances the ability of farmland long distance nutrient flow diffusion and centralized output amiri and nakane 2009 huang et al 2013 therefore uniform riparian cropland shape and increased vegetation area around sub basin scale cropland could reduce nitrogen emissions by blocking the nutrient flow in addition our results showed that the riparian zone forestland pladj was positively correlated with tn fig 5a meaning that the higher the density of the forestland was the worse the nitrogen pollution this is somewhat in contrast to other studies that have found the higher forestland pladj metric can efficiently filter polluted runoff shi et al 2017 xu et al 2020 this may be related to the coexistence of vegetation and ditches in the watershed fig s6 this study uses land use data classified at the first level with 30 m accuracy so the ditches as critical source landscape patches are often replaced by vegetation in calculating the landscape metrics furthermore the ditches also provide a transport pathway for nitrogen generated by leaf litter decomposition in watersheds bratt et al 2017 liu et al 2014 hence ditch drainage disturbed the sink effect of the riparian forestland pladj metric on nutrients and we do not recommend using this metric as a key predictor for the variation in tn phosphorus is relatively stable in soils compared to nitrogen but once soil phosphorus exceeds environmental thresholds the risk of phosphorus loss to streams increases rapidly shigaki et al 2007 withers and jarvie 2008 the effective phosphorus in chinese agricultural soils has increased from 7 4 mg kg in the early 1980s to over 20 7 mg kg in 2021 huang et al 2021 soil phosphorus accumulation has become the largest potential contributor to water quality deterioration hua et al 2017 our results found that the average concentrations of tp in the study river were well below the type iii surface water environmental quality standards gb3838 2002 table s1 consistent with the findings of liu et al 2019 the soil phosphorus accumulation concentrations in the study area remained at a relatively modest level the effect of landscape patterns on water quality mainly focused on the regulation of runoff into the river indirectly affecting water quality because of the low runoff phosphorus concentration fig 5 however the landscape pattern has minor effects on phosphorus consequently no key landscape metrics could significantly reflect the variation in tp at different scales 4 3 management of key landscape metrics abrupt change points the abrupt change point of the landscape pattern determines the upper limit of the environment carrying capacity for anthropogenic activities ma et al 2019 identifying the change point can help the planning department balance economic development and environmental concerns in land use development several studies have shown that forestland ed 36 m ha clément et al 2017 farmland lpi 7 wu and lu 2021 and construction pd 30 40 n 100 ha shen et al 2015 aid in protecting water quality but they can only investigate a few metrics change points since there is information redundancy within the landscape metrics furthermore the effects of landscape metrics on varied water quality parameters were different and the abrupt change threshold was also different shen et al 2015 thus selecting key landscape metrics based on water quality conditions assists in reflecting the pattern process relationship between landscape patterns and water quality liu et al 2021 the study area rivers were primarily stressed by nitrogen pollution sustaining riparian zone grassland lpi 4 19 grassland ed 27 99 m ha farmland lsi 3 2 and sub basin scale construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 farmland pladj 89 0 effectively reduced tn concentration in the stream anthropogenic activities disrupt natural landscape patterns causing environmental degradation huang et al 2021 although these activities achieve a specific economic purpose the resultant ecological crisis and disasters directly affect regional landscape patterns and sustainable development ma et al 2019 there is a growing recognition that a more sustainable approach to planning and managing landscapes is needed botequilha leitão and ahern 2002 above all specific and quantifiable metrics are needed to apply sustainability principles to planning and management fang et al 2015 this study proposes a research paradigm of screening metrics and quantifying the thresholds of abrupt change which can provide a reference for related studies and a basis for future ecological planning criteria 5 conclusions variations in landscape patterns will inevitably affect the water quality in a watershed but the spatial scale effects of landscape patterns on river water quality remain contentious here we summarize previous research paradigms propose the key landscape metrics affecting water quality vary with scale quantify the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality and dig the new idea that riparian zones and sub basins are both important for water quality changes in particular maintained the grassland grassland lpi 4 19 grassland ed 27 99 m ha farmland farmland lsi 3 2 farmland pladj 89 0 and construction land patterns construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 efficiently reduced the tn concentration in the stream we also reveal that these metrics effectively explained the variations in tn which could provide practical references for watershed landscape management and a basis for future ecological planning criteria the relationship between the landscape pattern and the water quality in receiving water bodies is complicated and will be influenced by spatial scale shifts our results contribute to understanding the influence mechanisms of landscape patterns on water quality at varied scales and how to more effectively protect river water quality

15202,widespread attention has been given to understanding the effect of the landscape pattern on river water quality however which spatial scale riparian zone versus sub basin has the greater impact on water quality has long been controversial since the key metrics that affect water quality varied with spatial scale thus quantifying the spatial scale effects of key landscape metrics on water quality is critical to clarifying which scale of landscape pattern is more conducive to water quality conservation here we adopted variation partitioning analysis vpa and random forest models to quantify the landscape pattern impact on water quality at northern erhai lake during the 2019 rainy season early mid and late and comprehensively analyze the key landscape metrics on different scales the results revealed that the riparian zone and sub basin scale landscape patterns explained similar water quality variations difference only 0 9 in the mid august and late rainy season october but exhibited a large difference 24 1 during the early rainy season june furthermore rivers were primarily stressed by nitrogen pollution maintaining the grassland ed 27 99 m ha grassland lpi 4 19 farmland lsi 3 2 in the riparian zone and construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 farmland pladj 89 0 at the sub basin scale could significantly reduce the tn concentration in the stream meanwhile managing of these metrics can effectively prevent rapid increases of tn in rivers moreover due to the low phosphorus concentration in the rivers none of the landscape metrics significantly explained the variation in tp this study explored the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality and revealed the driving factors of nutrient variation this study will provide a scientific basis for aquatic environmental management in plateau watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landscape pattern water quality spatial scale effects nitrogen and phosphorus abrupt change thresholds data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction river water quality is the foundation for public health and socioeconomic sustainability castrillo and garcía 2020 which is significantly influenced by the surrounding landscape patterns since streams are the primary sink of pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems allan 2004 hobbie et al 2017 with anthropogenic activities dramatically altering river surrounding landscape patterns huang et al 2021 the effect of landscape patterns on aquatic environments has gradually received additional attention li et al 2021 especially in the process of watershed management effective watershed management such as best management practices bmps relies on using the landscape pattern effects chang et al 2021 there remains considerable uncertainty however in managing which scale of landscape pattern is more conducive to water quality conservation clément et al 2017 stets et al 2020 therefore clarifying the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality will provide insight into the deterioration mechanism of aquatic ecosystems spatial scales refer to the distance between river and landscape patches and are usually quantification into two scales riparian zone and sub basin mainali et al 2019 however the controversy regarding whether managing riparian zone landscape patterns or sub basin scale landscape patterns has greater effects on water quality preservation has persisted enormous efforts have been made on the scale design such as different types strips and circular and widths buffers to identify the critical scale of landscape pattern impact on water quality li et al 2018 nelson mwaijengo et al 2020 there is still no consensus on the critical scale of landscape pattern management laudon et al 2018 in previous studies the 100 m 300 m 500 m 1000 m buffer strips and even sub basins have been considered to be the critical scales that have the strongest influence on water quality pratt and chang 2012 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2012 in fact the coupling relationship between landscape patterns and river water quality varies with spatial scale extend from riparian buffers to sub basins ding et al 2016 and this characteristic has been ignored for a long time thus identifying the critical landscape pattern characteristics based on spatial scale shifts and quantifying their impact on water quality is conducive to clarifying the critical scale at which managing landscape patterns to mitigate water quality deterioration ecologists define landscape patterns as the spatial structure arrangement and placement of land use patches shehab et al 2021 and quantify them through landscape and class level metrics they consider the patch spatial characteristics of the entire landscape or a single land use type respectively zhang et al 2017 numerous studies have suggested that the class level metrics are more predictable in water pollution and have practical significance to quantify the ecological process of landscape patterns amiri and nakane 2009 shen et al 2014 uuemaa et al 2005 however due to the multicollinearity and cross scale instability among these landscape metrics not all metrics provide useful information to describe landscape patterns xu et al 2020 for example in construction land and farmland only regulating the landscape shape index lsi patch density pd and largest patch index lsi can effectively reduce river pollutants li et al 2021 therefore screening the relatively independent class level metrics that significantly impact river conditions is vital for understanding the ecological functions of landscape patterns considering the abruptly changing relationship between landscape patterns and stream water quality huo et al 2015 the destruction of natural landscape patterns by anthropogenic activities will not immediately deteriorate the aquatic environment unless the change in landscape metrics exceeds the abrupt change point the abrupt change point assembly is defined as the abrupt threshold beyond which water quality will rapid deterioration due to changes in landscape metrics wu and lu 2021 most studies evaluated the abrupt thresholds of landscape metrics at the sub basin scale clément et al 2017 wu and lu 2019 and less is known about landscape metric change points in the riparian zone where conservation districts are concentrated huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in a previous study the abrupt thresholds of various class level metrics in the watershed lacked comprehensive consideration shen et al 2015 hence evaluating the abrupt thresholds at different scales for key class level metrics is beneficial to developing more effective water quality management measures water pollution in china especially lake eutrophication has been responsible for water scarcity huang et al 2021 erhai lake as one of the new three lakes key protected lakes is an important source of drinking water for dali city in yunnan china lin et al 2020 rivers in the study area are the source rivers of the northern part of erhai lake which are generally impaired by excessive nutrients liu et al 2019 accelerating the transformation of erhai lake from mediotrophic to eutrophic li et al 2020 therefore revealing the regulatory mechanism of landscape patterns on nutrients in the study area is helpful to formulate management measures to alleviate the water quality degradation of erhai lake thus our objectives of this study are to 1 identify the critical scale of the landscape patterns on stream water quality 2 screen the key class level landscape metrics that explain the variation in stream nutrients tn tp and 3 quantify the abrupt threshold of the key landscape metrics this study hopes to provide scientific support for sustainable landscape management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the typical plateau watershed located in yunnan province southwest china fig 1 b which is composed of the fengyu river basin f1 f10 the mici river basin mc1 mc12 and the miju river basin mj1 mj9 fig 1a the drainage basin covers a total area of 1 310 km2 and has a total length of 71 1 km the mean annual precipitation is 1 048 mm and the mean annual temperature is 15 1 c importantly the rainfall of the rainy season from may to october accounts for 85 of the yearly precipitation due to a large amount of rainfall during the rainy season the rivers in the study area were connected in june the water level reached its highest depth in august and dropped in october notably the three rivers are connected during the rainy season to form the largest river entering the lake in the north of erhai lake meanwhile this season is also the most crucial time for water pollution in the study area and has the greatest impact on erhai lake water quality liu et al 2019 2 2 water sampling and analytical methods we established 31 sampling sites located in the mainstream and tributaries of the north erhai lake basin each sampling site is established based on the following three principles 1 the gradient distribution of landscape 2 the hydrological characteristics of the sub basin and 3 the sub basin area and belonged to an outlet of the independent catchment since the lack of recharge during the dry season the study area river breaks to form three streams fengyu river mici river miju river thus the surface water samples i e the top 50 cm were collected from the 31 sampling sites in this study after the three streams were connected during the rainy season to reduce the instability of the impact of landscape patterns on water quality caused by single sampling this study conducted three samplings during the rainy season and each sampling process took one week furthermore samples were collected during a consecutive week without rainfall to alleviate the effects of rainfall and runoff on the relationship between landscape patterns and water quality the samples were collected in a 500 ml polythene bottle and stored at 4 c until analysis nine parameters were chosen for measurement to reflect water quality the total carbon tc dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic values were measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5050a japan the nitrate and ammonia nitrogen no3 n nh4 n total nitrogen tn total dissolved nitrogen tdn total phosphorus tp and total dissolved phosphorus tdp were determined by an automatic discontinuous analyzer smartchem 200 brookfield usa the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter jinlong china before doc dic tdn and tdp were determined 2 3 spatial scale and landscape metrics to explore the spatial scale effects of the landscape pattern on water quality we divided the basin into the riparian zone fig 1d and the sub basin scale fig 1e the riparian zone ranges from dozens of meters to 100 m in the section of the study area combined previous studies park et al 2021 sliva and dudley williams 2001 and fieldwork to determine that a 100 m buffer strip is the most suitable scale for characterizing riparian zones in the entire watershed the boundaries of the sub basin were outlined first by the arcswat software using a digital elevation model dem with a 30 30 m grid resolution fig 1c considering the spatial autocorrelation can interfere with the connection between landscape patterns and water quality lintern et al 2018 mainali and chang 2020 the watershed was divided into 31 sub basins with sampling points as outlets and the sub basin corresponds to all of the catchment areas upstream of the sampling sites fig s1 meanwhile the 100 m wide buffer strips on both stream sides were extracted by arcgis 10 2 software the study area land use map for 2020 was derived from the national catalogue service for geographic information www globalland30 com doi 10 11769 the data include farmland forestland grassland shrubland water areas construction land wetland and bare land wetland and bare land accounted for less than 1 of the total area and were thus excluded from subsequent analyses class level landscape metrics comprehensively reflect the spatial distribution and allocation of various land use patches however from a practical planning standpoint fewer have application values therefore we selected the six most commonly used class level metrics among the area and edge metrics shape metrics and diversity metrics table 1 these metrics were calculated by the fragstat 4 2 software based on the eight neighbor cell rule all the landscape metrics are extracted at both the riparian zone and sub basin scales 2 4 statistical analyses the shapiro wilk test was used to test the normality of the water quality variables before analysis the one way anova test non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and ward clustering were used to determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of water quality then pearson correlation analysis and the bioenv function clarke 1993 was used to select the core land use and landscape metrics data respectively the significance level of the bioenv correlation coefficients was calculated by the mantel test p 0 05 n 999 furthermore non linearly independent metric combinations were selected to represent the landscape pattern in the riparian zone and the sub basin scale according to the results of the bioenv analysis and the mantel test meanwhile corresponding metrics were combined into the variance partitioning analysis vpa model borcard dp 1992 økland and eilertsen 1994 to quantify the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality the above analysis was carried out using the vegan package oksanen et al 2007 not all landscape metrics are critical for mediating nutrient cycles thus based on the bioenv results the random forest randomforest package model was used to estimate the importance of landscape metrics on tn and tp loss random forests rfs result in a robust model that can generate internal error estimates and measure the importance of variables francke et al 2008 the percentage increases in the mse mean squared error of variables higher incmse values imply more important variables breiman 2001 moreover the significance of each landscape metric on the response variables was assessed with the rfpermute package jiao et al 2018 then the metrics that passed the significance test can be used as key landscape metrics to predict the variation in nutrient concentration nonparametric changepoint analysis ncpa is very useful for calculating the location of change points relevant to water quality parameters and landscape metrics wu and lu 2021 thus the ncpa was used to quantify the change point of the key landscape metrics further information on ncpa algorithm can be found in huo et al 2015 commonly the availability of actual observation data is limited therefore the ncpa was combined with the bootstrap method to estimate the frequency distribution of change points qian et al 2004 since ncpa has a premise assumption that the water quality data series should cover all from healthy to pollution tn and tp were the main factors in the china environmental quality standard for surface water and tc toc no3 n were not concluded thus this study focused on the variation of tn and tp we extracted 1000 random samples of raw tn and tp parameter key landscape metric dataset by the bootstrap method furthermore using the bias corrected and accelerated bca method corrects for bias and skewness in the distribution of bootstrap estimates and improves the accuracy of the frequency distribution of change point estimation accordingly the 95 confidence interval of each change point bootstrap package n 1000 was evaluated all statistical analyses were conducted in r v 4 1 1 and the schematic structure of the statistical analysis framework is shown in fig s2 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variation in water quality the river water quality parameters in the study area had significant temporal differences p 0 05 the pollution was most severe in the mid rainy season fig s3 and table s1 nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations tn tdn nh4 n and tp were higher in the early and mid rainy seasons and decreased significantly during the late rainy season the average concentrations of nh4 n and tp in the river were well below the type iii surface water environmental quality standards gb3838 2002 applicable to centralized living drinking water nh4 n 1 mg l and tp 0 2 mg l the spatial variability in water quality was significant in the early and late rainy seasons figs 2 and s4 during the early rainy season the fenyu river f and mici river mc water quality was distinct from the lower miju river mj water quality and their difference was reduced in the late rainy season 3 2 variations in land use and landscape metrics and their correlation with water quality the core land use such as farmland forestland grassland and construction land had a significant impact on water quality in this study fig s5 their compositions varied greatly at the riparian zone and sub basin scales fig 3 the average proportion of farmland in the riparian zone reached 51 3 but decreased to 27 0 on the sub basin scale in turn the average proportion of forestland and grassland in the riparian zone was 24 0 and 8 0 but increased to 38 5 and 18 6 on the sub basin scale respectively the riparian zone vegetation fragmentation was high and the pd ed metrics were much higher than those of other land use types fig 4 meanwhile the density of forestland and grassland patches pd in the riparian zone was significantly and negatively correlated with tn which shows that high density of vegetation patches helps to intercept nitrogen entering the river fig 5 furthermore the landscape shape index lsi of farmland and construction land was significantly and positively correlated with most indicators of water quality at both scales indicating that irregular farmland and construction land are important sources of river pollutants in addition there is a time dependent water quality on landscape metrics with the correlation of most water quality parameters and landscape metrics reaching significant levels in the early and middle rainy season but almost no significant correlation in the late rainy season 3 3 effects of landscape pattern at different scales on water quality bioenv analysis and the mantel test demonstrated that the landscape metrics dominating water quality variation were different at the riparian zone and sub basin scales table 2 furthermore the vpa model quantified the spatial scale effect of various land use patterns on water quality fig 6 the results indicated that landscape patterns had no significant scale dependence on the ability to explain water quality variations the water quality variation explained by the riparian zone and sub basin landscape patterns ranged from 32 7 to 50 1 and 26 0 to 47 4 respectively the different scales of landscape patterns explain water quality variations were almost identical 0 9 difference during the mid and late rainy seasons only in the early rainy season did the riparian zone landscape pattern explain more water quality variation with a difference up to 24 1 3 4 abrupt thresholds of the key landscape metrics on tn and tp based on the bioenv analysis results this study further screened the key landscape metrics that could significantly explain the variation in nutrients in the river using the random forest model fig 7 the grassland ed grassland lpi forestland pladj and farmland lsi metrics had significant predictive power for tn in the riparian zone while the construction ed construction lsi and farmland pladj metrics had significant predictive power for tn at the sub basin scale the interesting result was that landscape metrics had no significant ability to predict changes in tp in this study area the ncpa results indicated the tendency of the riparian zone and sub basin scale tn concentration to abruptly change in response to landscape metrics table 3 obtained the abrupt change threshold with a 95 confidence interval combining the results of the correlation analysis between landscape metrics and water quality fig 5 we discovered that maintaining grassland lpi 4 19 grassland ed 28 0 m ha forestland pladj 82 6 and farmland lsi 3 2 in the riparian zone while regulating sub basin scale construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 and farmland pladj 89 0 could effectively reduce the tn concentration in the river 4 discussion 4 1 spatial scale effects of landscape pattern on water quality it has long been controversial which spatial scale landscape pattern riparian versus sub basin scale has a greater influence on river water quality sliva and dudley williams 2001 song et al 2021 hille et al 2018 and shi et al 2017 emphasized that the riparian buffer was a critical scale for the interception and processing of pollutants via runoff ding et al 2016 and zhou et al 2012 however supported that landscape patterns at the sub basin scale were more important for water environment regulation because nutrient loading and retention usually occurred over a large spatial range previous studies consider the critical spatial scale depending on the water quality parameters studied whereas this study indicated that the riparian zone and sub basin scale landscape patterns explained water quality variation fairly similarly especially in the mid and late rainy seasons and their difference was only 0 9 fig 6 the influence of landscape patterns on water quality was equally important at the riparian zone and sub basin scales these results were inconsistent with the past views liu et al 2018 shehab et al 2021 which may be related to the selection of different landscape metric combinations to represent landscape patterns in this study previous studies in the different scales riparian zone and sub basin used the same landscape metrics to quantify the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality shen et al 2015 song et al 2021 which could not comprehensively exhibit the impact of spatial scale shifts on the relationship between landscape patterns and water quality for example when the spatial scale changed from the riparian scale to the sub basin scale the critical metric of forest landscape pattern affecting water quality changed from forestland lsi to forestland lpi clément et al 2017 wu and lu 2021 this study also found similar conclusions taking farmland landscape pattern as an example the combination of ed pd and lsi metrics in the riparian zone was the most important while the combination of lsi enn mn and pladj metrics in the sub basins scale was the most important table 3 thus selecting suitable landscape pattern metrics based on the spatial scale can effectively reduce redundant indicators and improve the interpretation accuracy of landscape patterns on water quality change our results avoid the interference of redundant metrics and confirm that managing corresponding landscape patterns at different scales is equally important for water quality conservation unexpectedly the riparian zone landscape pattern explained more water quality variation than the sub basin scale the difference reached 24 1 in the early rainy season in this study fig 6 the reason may be related to runoff generation and confluence mechanisms the area of the landscape patches and their distance from the river can affect the runoff generation and confluence processes chen et al 2016 li and sivapalan 2011 mounirou et al 2020 large landscape patches produce less overland flow per unit area than small patches since their greater internal retention and absorption capacity furthermore the surface runoff confluence process extends with the expansion of the spatial scale the riparian zone parcel with a small surface area is close to the river the riparian landscape pattern acts as a pollutant filter during the rapid inflow of massive runoff into the river which can effectively explain more water quality changes liu et al 2014 in contrast the sub basin scale patches are large and far from the river with lengthy runoff generation and confluence processes which caused the impact of sub basin landscape patterns hysteresis behind the direct impact of riparian zone landscapes on water quality wu et al 2021 wu and lu 2021 consequently sub basin scale landscape patterns explained less water quality variation when the runoff produced by the sub basin patches did not fully converge into the river during the early rainy season in addition this hysteresis effect has led previous researchers to underestimate the ability to protect water quality through landscape pattern management at the sub basin scale therefore although the relationship between landscape pattern and water quality can be established with a single sampling it is recommended to conduct multiple samplings during the rainy season to clarify the spatial scale effect of landscape pattern on water quality 4 2 prediction of nutrient pollution changes by key landscape metrics this work demonstrated that riparian zone grassland ed and lpi and sub basin scale construction land ed and lsi could effectively explain the variation in tn fig 7 the ed metrics represent the patch boundary change caused by land use transformations which can enhance or disrupt the flow rate of nutrients between spatial patches based on the firmness of edges liu et al 2021 the lsi and lpi metrics reflect the degree of irregular patches and the single largest patch in the watershed the riparian grassland metrics ed and lpi were significantly negatively correlated with the tn concentration in the river suggesting that the complex grassland patch boundary promoted the sink effect on nutrient flow clément et al 2017 meanwhile the larger the grassland patch is the higher the interception and absorption of nutrient pollutants zhang et al 2019 contrary to grassland the construction land ed and lsi metrics were significantly positively associated with river tn concentrations fig 5b the complex boundaries and irregular shapes expand the range of impervious surfaces increasing the flow rate of nutrients li et al 2015 shen et al 2015 thus establishing new grassland patches at the intersection areas of different landscape patches in the riparian zone and planning a tidy development pattern of construction land at the sub basin scale can effectively reduce tn in the stream the random forest results indicated that the farmland lsi metrics and farmland pladj metrics efficiently forecast the variation in tn at the riparian zone and sub basin scales respectively fig 7 farmland is the primary source of nutrients in rivers and its patterns have a considerable impact on water quality bu et al 2014 large patches of irregular farmland in the riparian zone fig 4 increase the risk of nitrogen export ding et al 2016 ouyang et al 2018 the farmland pladj metric indicated the probability of a similar patch appearing around a farmland patch the higher the value of this metric is the better the connectivity of the farmland thus the higher farmland pladj metric enhances the ability of farmland long distance nutrient flow diffusion and centralized output amiri and nakane 2009 huang et al 2013 therefore uniform riparian cropland shape and increased vegetation area around sub basin scale cropland could reduce nitrogen emissions by blocking the nutrient flow in addition our results showed that the riparian zone forestland pladj was positively correlated with tn fig 5a meaning that the higher the density of the forestland was the worse the nitrogen pollution this is somewhat in contrast to other studies that have found the higher forestland pladj metric can efficiently filter polluted runoff shi et al 2017 xu et al 2020 this may be related to the coexistence of vegetation and ditches in the watershed fig s6 this study uses land use data classified at the first level with 30 m accuracy so the ditches as critical source landscape patches are often replaced by vegetation in calculating the landscape metrics furthermore the ditches also provide a transport pathway for nitrogen generated by leaf litter decomposition in watersheds bratt et al 2017 liu et al 2014 hence ditch drainage disturbed the sink effect of the riparian forestland pladj metric on nutrients and we do not recommend using this metric as a key predictor for the variation in tn phosphorus is relatively stable in soils compared to nitrogen but once soil phosphorus exceeds environmental thresholds the risk of phosphorus loss to streams increases rapidly shigaki et al 2007 withers and jarvie 2008 the effective phosphorus in chinese agricultural soils has increased from 7 4 mg kg in the early 1980s to over 20 7 mg kg in 2021 huang et al 2021 soil phosphorus accumulation has become the largest potential contributor to water quality deterioration hua et al 2017 our results found that the average concentrations of tp in the study river were well below the type iii surface water environmental quality standards gb3838 2002 table s1 consistent with the findings of liu et al 2019 the soil phosphorus accumulation concentrations in the study area remained at a relatively modest level the effect of landscape patterns on water quality mainly focused on the regulation of runoff into the river indirectly affecting water quality because of the low runoff phosphorus concentration fig 5 however the landscape pattern has minor effects on phosphorus consequently no key landscape metrics could significantly reflect the variation in tp at different scales 4 3 management of key landscape metrics abrupt change points the abrupt change point of the landscape pattern determines the upper limit of the environment carrying capacity for anthropogenic activities ma et al 2019 identifying the change point can help the planning department balance economic development and environmental concerns in land use development several studies have shown that forestland ed 36 m ha clément et al 2017 farmland lpi 7 wu and lu 2021 and construction pd 30 40 n 100 ha shen et al 2015 aid in protecting water quality but they can only investigate a few metrics change points since there is information redundancy within the landscape metrics furthermore the effects of landscape metrics on varied water quality parameters were different and the abrupt change threshold was also different shen et al 2015 thus selecting key landscape metrics based on water quality conditions assists in reflecting the pattern process relationship between landscape patterns and water quality liu et al 2021 the study area rivers were primarily stressed by nitrogen pollution sustaining riparian zone grassland lpi 4 19 grassland ed 27 99 m ha farmland lsi 3 2 and sub basin scale construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 farmland pladj 89 0 effectively reduced tn concentration in the stream anthropogenic activities disrupt natural landscape patterns causing environmental degradation huang et al 2021 although these activities achieve a specific economic purpose the resultant ecological crisis and disasters directly affect regional landscape patterns and sustainable development ma et al 2019 there is a growing recognition that a more sustainable approach to planning and managing landscapes is needed botequilha leitão and ahern 2002 above all specific and quantifiable metrics are needed to apply sustainability principles to planning and management fang et al 2015 this study proposes a research paradigm of screening metrics and quantifying the thresholds of abrupt change which can provide a reference for related studies and a basis for future ecological planning criteria 5 conclusions variations in landscape patterns will inevitably affect the water quality in a watershed but the spatial scale effects of landscape patterns on river water quality remain contentious here we summarize previous research paradigms propose the key landscape metrics affecting water quality vary with scale quantify the spatial scale effect of landscape patterns on water quality and dig the new idea that riparian zones and sub basins are both important for water quality changes in particular maintained the grassland grassland lpi 4 19 grassland ed 27 99 m ha farmland farmland lsi 3 2 farmland pladj 89 0 and construction land patterns construction ed 1 69 m ha construction lsi 2 46 efficiently reduced the tn concentration in the stream we also reveal that these metrics effectively explained the variations in tn which could provide practical references for watershed landscape management and a basis for future ecological planning criteria the relationship between the landscape pattern and the water quality in receiving water bodies is complicated and will be influenced by spatial scale shifts our results contribute to understanding the influence mechanisms of landscape patterns on water quality at varied scales and how to more effectively protect river water quality

15203,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox represents an energy efficient process for biological nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater however there are mechanistic issues unsolved regarding the low microbial electron transfer and undesired accumulation of nitrate in treated water limiting its widespread engineering applications we found that the addition of pyrite 1 g l 1 reactor an earth abundant iron bearing sulfide mineral to the anammox system significantly improved the nitrogen removal rate by 52 in long term operation at a high substrate shock loading 3 86 kg n m 3 d 1 two lines of evidence were presented to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the pyrite induced enhancement physiochemical evidence indicated that an increase of cytochromes c and fe s protein was responsible for the accelerated electron transfer among metabolic enzymes multi omics evidence showed that the depletion of nitrate was attributed to the fe n s cycle driven by nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation and s based denitrification this study deepens our understanding of the roles of electron transfer and the fe n s cycle in anammox systems providing a fundamental basis for the development of mediators in the anammox process for practical implications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological nitrogen removal iron mineral multi omics autotrophic system s based denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria oxidized ammonium nh4 to dinitrogen gas n2 using nitrite no2 as an electron acceptor under anoxic conditions eq 1 it is an advanced biological nitrogen removal pathway with lower sludge production no requirement for organic matter and substantial energy savings zekker et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however the autotrophic anammox bacteria possessed an extremely low growth rate and cellular yield easily inhibited by substrate and other inhibitory substances limiting the further improvement of anammox performance jin et al 2013 both nh4 and no2 may inhibit anammox performance when their concentration exceeds the tolerance threshold of anammox consortia zekker et al 2015 ma et al 2017 such substrate shock loading may plummet the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr generally there are two feasible methods to enhance the tnrr related to the anammox pathway accelerate substrate nh4 and no2 removal by improving anammox activity and increase byproduct no3 removal by amplifying nitrogen removal pathways 1 nh4 1 31no2 0 066hco3 0 13h n2 0 26no3 0 066ch2o0 5n0 15 2h2o tang et al 2018 reported that the activity of anammox consortia could be improved by increasing electron transfer recent research has shown that mediators electron shuttles and conductive materials can promote microbial activity by enhancing electron transfer liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 electron shuttles can act as electron carriers helping electron transfer from cell surface to electron acceptor including cell excreted small molecules e g flavins and exogenous mediators e g anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds aeppli et al 2022 conductive materials such as granular activated carbon and iron bearing minerals can assist extracellular electron transfer due to their high conductivity wang et al 2021 in addition fe ii can further enhance the concentration and activity of related iron containing enzymes e g cytochromes and fe s protein playing a crucial role in electron transfer feng et al 2022 in anoxic and circumneutral ph environments fe ii is predominantly embedded within the structure of fe ii rich clays or minerals like siderite feco3 and pyrite fes2 jakus et al 2021 offering a possible cost effective opportunity for promoting tnrr via electron transfer enhancement at a process level wang et al 2022 reported that fe iii mineral additions increased the cellular processes in the anammox system besides the relevant studies on the utilization of iron minerals for enhanced anammox performance are limited to study potential enhancement mechanisms we developed a hypothesis that iron bearing minerals as a mediator and iron containing enzyme facilitator may enhance the electron transfer rate thus ultimately enhancing the activity of anammox consortia furthermore the reduced iron and sulfur also account for nitrogen removal via autotrophic denitrification by introducing more reducing equivalents thus expanding the nitrogen removal pathway in the anammox system pelivano et al 2022 generally fe and s cycles are linked by microbially mediated no3 reduction coupled to iron bearing sulfide mineral oxidation melton et al 2014 which was also summarized previously feng et al 2022 pyrite whose unit cell contains four fes2 molecular formulas is one of the most abundant sulfide minerals with a high content of fe ii feng et al 2022 theoretically pyrite could have a great potential to amplify the nitrogen removal pathway by coupling the fe n s cycle and thus ultimately consume the byproduct nitrate nevertheless the mechanisms have yet to be explored one remaining question is whether pyrite can serve as the electron transfer accelerator and fe s supplier for enhancing nitrogen removal of the anammox process complex and dynamic networks of organisms are involved in the anammox system owing to the cooperation of unculturable pure anammox accompanied by symbiotic heterogeneous bacteria it is challenging to unravel the fe n s cycle of anammox consortia merely based on traditional techniques as a result the microbial interaction in anammox consortia caused by the fe n s cycle and a clearer picture of the nitrogen removal pathways remain poorly understood elucidation of a genotype performance relationship is critical to understand anammox consortia at the whole system level multi omics are the most universal and powerful approaches to tracking microbial community and activity at the genetic level becoming increasingly popular in biological research consequently multi omics analyses may bring new insights into the interactions between pyrite and anammox therefore this study proposes that pyrite could act as a mediator to facilitate the electron transfer and a fe s supplier to couple with the fe n s cycle ultimately achieving an increase in anammox performance the contribution of the fe n s cycle to tnrr was investigated by comparing the anammox performance dosing with pyrite and that of aqds the common mediators without fe and s moreover the possibility of anammox enhancement and the underlying mechanisms are explored by using physiochemical and multi omics approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of mediators by batch test to clarify the promotion effect of the mediator and the fe n s cycle on anammox performance the mediator pyrite and aqds with without fe and s were selected for comparative study the specific anammox activity saa test was used to evaluate the nitrogen removal performance and the experimental details are described in the supporting information we compared the performances of 4 kinds of mediators i activated carbon ii riboflavin iii aqds and iv pyrite including mediators without i iii with iv fe and s 2 2 long term bioreactor operation seeded sludge the anammox granular sludge was taken from the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor which had been successfully operated for a year in the laboratory with a nitrogen loading rate nlr higher than 1 1 kg n m 3 d 1 the relative abundance of anammox bacteria was 21 with the dominant genus candidatus kuenenia 15 operation strategy to investigate how anammox performance changes with pyrite and aqds dosing three identical bioreactors fig s1a with a

calcein am as the fluorescent probes according to the instructions jiang et al 2020 exposed to this ester it can penetrate the cell membrane and reacts with cytosolic esterase and then creates highly charged iron probe calcein which is a fluorochrome calcein fluorescence can be quenched following the chelation of iron and the degree of quenching gives an estimate of the amount of intracellular iron pre treatment of anammox sludge was applied to obtain a free cell suspension suitable for flow cytometry analysis firstly the anammox sludge was washed with pbs 0 1 m ph 7 0 3 times and resuspended in pbs the free cell suspension was then filtered with a 40 µm cell strainer to eliminate coarse particles that may clog the flow cytometer s nozzle in the subsequent flow cytometry analysis furthermore the data were analyzed by flowjo each treatment was analyzed in triplicate 2 5 other analytical methods the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations of supernatant samples were

nitrate nitrogen removal rate nitrr are listed in the supporting information the cell membrane integrity of bacteria was characterized by ldh activity the heme c concentration was determined by measuring the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of the pyridine hemochrome using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 23 97 the fe concentrations in the effluent of bioreactors were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 2000 perkin elmer enterprise management co ltd china the fe distribution was conducted according to jiang et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance the nitrogen removal performance of the three reactors control pyrite and aqds are recorded in figs 1 and s4 based on influent substrate concentration the entire operation period can be divided into performance improvement stage i days 1 54 high substrate shock loading stage ii days 55 71 recovery stage iii days 72 85 and secondary shock loading stages stage iv days 86 96 direct evidence of the promotion effect of the mediator was obtained at a relatively higher nlr stage ii i e a 30 tnrr increase was achieved at 3 86 kg n m 3 d 1 with pyrite dosing during stage iii the fold changes of tnrr and arr of the treatment groups to the control group fluctuated between 1 0 1 3 further indicating that the addition of mediators enhanced the nitrogen removal performance the most apparent reinforcement by dosing mediators was obtained in stage iv when the high substrate shock loading resulted in the deterioration of anammox performance in the control group the values of the fold change treatment control in the maximum tnrr were 2 33 pyrite control and 1 82 aqds control respectively it suggested that mediators were effective in resisting high substrate shock loading pyrite was a more effective anammox reinforcer than aqds in promoting arr and tnrr based on both anammox and denitrification pathways the contribution of mediators to nitrogen removal in stage iv is quantified in fig 1c compared to the control group a 30 tnrr increase and 22 arr increase were achieved by dosing aqds whereas for the pyrite group an extra 22 tnrr and 16 arr increases were achieved over the aqds group in total adding pyrite significantly enhanced arr nitrr and tnrr by 38 14 and 52 respectively generally anammox is the only ammonium removal way under the tested anoxic system the higher arr suggested a better anammox performance in the pyrite group theoretically the improvement ratio of tnrr should be equal to that of arr if pyrite only acts as a mediator to enhance anammox bacteria however the nitrr tnrr arr in the pyrite group was 1 79 fold compared to the control group this significantly excessive nitrr with pyrite dosing may result from the multi nitrogen removal pathways such as autotrophic denitrification due to the fe and s releasing this hypothesis was further explored in the following 3 2 enhancement of microbial metabolism 3 2 1 increasing microbial community diversity the diversity of the community structure laid a good foundation for the reactor to resist the impact of the external environment i e a high loading rate the results from high throughput sequencing analysis suggested that the shannon index increased from 1 34 control to 1 85 pyrite and 1 79 aqds and chao diversity indexes increased as well in contrast the simpson estimator showed the opposite trend fig s5 it indicated the increasing microbial community diversity confirmed by tem analysis fig s6 presenting various morphologies of microorganisms in the pyrite and aqds group more information on microbial community diversity was discussed in detail in section 3 4 3 2 2 protecting cell membrane integrity as an indicator of cell membrane integrity the increasing ldh activity positively reflects cell damage or lysis wan et al 2016 along with the elevated nlr the ldh activity increased from stage i to stage iii fig 2 a c it suggested that the microorganism was susceptible to high substrate shock loading which destroyed the membrane integrity of anammox bacteria however the ldh activity was only 46 and 73 of the control in the pyrite and aqds groups respectively suggesting that the presence of mediators protected the membrane from damage except for the increasing microbial community diversity membrane integrity might partially result from metabolism enhancement especially the addition of pyrite may promote the metabolic activity of microorganisms fig s7 the sem results in fig s6 confirmed the anammox bacteria in the pyrite group maintained intact cell morphology with no collapse it confirmed that pyrite addition improved the microbial resistance i e substrate shock loading 3 2 3 up regulating functional metabolism genes mediators also overcame the stress of increasing substrate loading by up regulating nitrogen metabolism genes to improve cell endurance and reduce cell injury the normalized anammox 16s rrna genes constituted a 2 7 fold pyrite and 3 2 fold aqds up regulation compared to the value obtained in the control group fig 2d therefore the more anammox bacteria contributed to higher nitrogen removal performances with pyrite or aqds addition the significant up regulation of narg fig 2e and nirs fig 2f with pyrite and aqds addition also contribute to the higher nitrr during the anammox process to further clarify the promotion effect of mediators on nitrogen metabolism systematically anammox sludge with the best promotion effect of tnrr at the end of stage iv was selected for an in depth study by metagenomic and metatranscriptomics analyses the nmds plot based on sequences at an otu level 97 similarity showed a clear separation of the community composition between the control and treatment pyrite or aqds groups fig s8 revealing apparent changes in the community structure with different mediators microorganisms involved in nitrogen removal were determined based on their genus compositions fig s9 metagenomic sequencing approach revealed that candidatus kuenenia was the dominant anammox genus in the three reactors with mean abundances of 23 5 control 26 6 pyrite and 24 8 aqds respectively furthermore metatranscriptomics analysis suggested that candidatus kuenenia showed the highest expression activity functional enzymes related to nitrogen transformation were screened to reveal the biological mechanism of nitrogen metabolism under different mediator treatments microorganisms can convert nitrogen compounds spanning redox states from 3 to 5 using several discrete redox reactions kuypers et al 2018 in total 18 functional enzymes were coupled with 5 nitrogen transformation processes namely nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia anra and anammox fig 3 the transcription level of hydrazine synthase subunit hzs was the highest in the whole nitrogen metabolism followed by hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh table s6 they are 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than other genes meaning that anammox is the main nitrogen removal path in this study transcriptional activity analysis showed that pyrite enhanced nitrogen removal performance by improving nitrogen metabolism fig 3 nitrate reduction is an important way to remove the byproducts of anammox nitrate prefers to be reduced by anra and denitrification instead of dnra with pyrite addition because of the assimilatory nitrate reductases in the cytoplasm nitrate assimilation requires nitrate transport into the cell by atp dependent transporters the up regulation of anra expression also suggests that pyrite provides more energy for nitrogen removal this result was also consistent with the nitrogen removal performance in long term bioreactor operation in which the pyrite group obtained a higher tnrr followed by the aqds group 3 3 enhancement of electron transfer ability of anammox the growth rate of anammox consortia could be accelerated by increasing electron transfer zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2018 the electron transfer was investigated by fe s protein synthesis heme c ccx gene and other associated putative electron transfer proteins 3 3 1 increasing heme c content and up regulating ccx gene expression as a strong indicator of anammox performance evaluation heme c plays a vital role in electron transfer and storage ma et al 2019 in fig 4 a the content of heme c increased by 49 pyrite and 16 5 aqds compared to the control group the ccx gene is responsible for electron transfer and membrane associated energy conservation up regulating 9 9 and 5 0 fold in the pyrite and aqds groups respectively compared to the control group fig 4b cytochromes c are essential associated electron transfer proteins responsible for the increasing electron transfer the increase of heme c and the up regulation of ccx expression with pyrite or aqds dosing might increase cytochromes c enhancing electron transfer among metabolic enzymes kartal et al 2013 ferousi et al 2017 3 3 2 facilitating iron acquisition and promoting fe s protein synthesis iron is the most abundant transition metal in biological systems where it is employed as an essential cofactor in electron transfer reactions ferousi et al 2017 the extracellular iron must be transported into the cell before the bacteria can utilize it as reported the nitrogen removal performance improves as the iron inward transport capacity increases jiang et al 2020 intracellular iron concentration was detected to elucidate the pyrite induced nitrogen removal enhancement in the anammox system we found that the ability of iron to be transported from the solution to the cell was enhanced by pyrite dosing fig 4d f resulting in the evident increase of intracellular iron from 0 15 to 0 32 mg gvss 1 fig 4c and f the increase in intracellular iron may favor the fe s proteins synthesis as reported fe s proteins were prominent members of the redox center involved in electron transfer processes liu et al 2014 and they were essential for anammox bacteria metabolism multi omics results indicated that pyrite dosing greatly increased the transcriptional activity of fe s protein related genes the transcriptional activity of the rrf2 family transcriptional regulator fe s cluster assembly cytochrome b6 f complex iron sulfur subunit and fe s cluster assembly protein in the pyrite group constituted a 6 94 3 27 and 3 16 fold increase compared to the values obtained in the control group fig s10a thereby with the fe released from pyrite the increase of intracellular iron enhanced electron transfer by enriching fe s proteins conversely aqds cannot provide exogenous fe or s and thus cannot promote the electron transfer ability through the improving function of fe s protein fig s10a 3 3 3 stimulating the extracellular electron transfer dependent anaerobic oxidation of ammonium shaw et al 2020 revealed the potential of anammox bacteria to use solid state electron acceptors as the terminal electron sink the transcriptional activities of the genes participating in the putative extracellular electron transfer metabolic pathway were up regulated with pyrite and aqds addition fig s11 specifically the membrane bound formate dehydrogenase fdh possibly involved in the pathway to respire insoluble minerals in anammox bacteria shaw et al 2020 up regulated in the pyrite group accounting for 201 and 217 of the control and aqds groups fig s11 furthermore central carbon metabolism iron metabolism and respiratory complexes of anammox in extracellular electron transfer dependent anammox including ferredoxin oxidoreductase acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase biopolymer transport protein and dehydrogenase were all generally up regulated fig 6 the evidence suggested that pyrite addition might also provide another nh4 n removal pathway via extracellular electron transfer as reported the electron transfer is greatly enhanced from fe ii to cytochromes c of bacteria through the conduction band of semiconductive minerals i e pyrite in this study liu et al 2020 in contrast with aqds pyrite was likely to serve as a conduit xu et al 2020 due to its semi conduction further increasing the extracellular electron transfer to achieve a higher nitrogen removal rate in general in addition to the role of associated electron transfer enzymes pyrite might also act as a fe s supplier to promote extra intracellular electron transfer through enriching fe s protein and act as an electron conduit to improve extra extracellular electron transfer achieving a higher electron transfer and nitrogen removal rate than that in the aqds group 3 4 enhancement of nitrate removal with fe n s cycle the undesired accumulation of the nitrate in treated water could be removed by other nitrogen removal pathways attributed to the fe n s cycle such as nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation nh4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction feammox and s based denitrification therefore this work aims to verify this assumption by multi omics evidence 3 4 1 enriching fe and s related nitrogen removal pathways the possible roles of fe and s in the anammox system were further investigated to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the pyrite induced nitrogen removal enhancement with aqds dosing only electron transfer related enzymes increased 69 obviously fig 5 a accounting for the tnrr enhancement in the aqds group however with pyrite addition the gene expression of fe n s and electron transfer related enzymes significantly increased by 56 93 67 and 89 respectively fig 5a suggesting a higher tnrr was likely owing to the extra fe and s related nitrogen removal pathways the results indicate that pyrite might not only act as an electron mediator such as aqds but also enrich fe and s related nitrogen removal pathways to enhance anammox performance to further confirm this speculation co occurrence networks were constructed based on metatranscriptomic data fig 5b the robust pairwise correlations of these fe n s genes formed their co occurrence networks as depicted in fig 5b the consortia in the pyrite group contained a higher number of functional genes 35 nodes than that of the control 23 nodes and aqds 25 nodes group indicating an increased network size with pyrite dosing the larger network size suggested a greater network complexity contributing to greater resilience to disturbances wang et al 2022 i e substrate shock loading this result further explained the higher tnrr obtained in the pyrite group furthermore the more connections edges a gene node had the more potential fe n s closely correlated with the reactor owned the average degree the average edges per node in the pyrite group 12 5 is the highest among the control group 3 3 and the aqds group 6 6 indicating the interaction between fe n and s related functions are strengthened with pyrite dosing therefore the extra fe and s related pathways were responsible for nitrogen removal in the pyrite group 3 4 2 increasing nitrate removal a combination of reduced iron and sulfur compounds e g pyrite likely enhances the efficiency of nitrate the byproduct of anammox removal by introducing more reducing equivalents it may contribute to the surprising nitrr increase of the pyrite group bioleaching fe and s from pyrite is a prerequisite for anammox performance promotion it has been demonstrated that pyrite bioleaching could be effectively accelerated by bioleaching microorganisms e g acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and leptospirillum ferrooxidans which were detected in this study then fe ii released from pyrite is easily oxidized to fe iii because of its strong reducing property wang et al 2022 anammox bacteria usually produce abundant extracellular polymeric substances where pyrite bioleaching by fe iii was accelerated feng et al 2022 therefore anammox interaction with pyrite facilitates fe and s release from pyrite 3 4 2 1 ndfo coupled feammox for nitrate removal iron is a key factor in the nitrogen cycle nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo eqs 2 and 3 has been found in various environments li et al 2018 additionally feammox had been demonstrated eqs 4 6 these reactions may contribute to a better nitrogen removal performance with pyrite addition the continuous conversion process of no3 and nh4 was a coupled process of feammox anammox and ndfo under anaerobic conditions 2 4fe ii 2no2 9h2o 4fe oh 3 n2o 6h 3 10fe ii 2no3 12h 10fe iii n2 6h2o 4 3fe oh 3 5h nh4 3fe2 9h2o 0 5n2 5 6fe oh 3 10h nh4 6fe2 16h2o no2 6 8fe oh 3 14h nh4 8fe2 21h2o no3 however it is difficult to elucidate this process by monitoring changes in the fe oxidation state because of the complexity of the biochemical fe cycle in anammox bioreactors wang et al 2022 we tried quantifying the fe ii concentration in the effluent of the pyrite group nevertheless the concentration of detectable fe was relatively low fig s12 which was presumably caused by a large amount of iron hydroxide precipitation therefore pyrite was collected for further detection afm fig s13 and sem fig s14 analyses characterized the surface topographical features and element compositions of pyrite the results showed that the surface roughness and fe s ratio of pyrite increased likely due to corrosion after a long time operation suggesting the fe release from pyrite further analysis was conducted by multi omics to confirm the coupled process of feammox anammox and ndfo multiple fe n cycle related microorganisms were detected in this study such as ferrous iron oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria e g rhodanobacter mizugakiibacter and gallionella and iron sulfides mediated autotrophic denitrifiers e g thiobacillus sulfurimonas and acidovorax the results implied that nitrate removal might relate to the fe oxidization which produced fe iii limiting the continued ndfo process feammox can reduce the fe iii to fe ii forming the iron cycle and continuously reducing nitrate however the microbial communities associated with feammox are still unclear li et al 2019 so we confirmed the existence of feammox at the genetic level by analyzing fe iii uptake genes the feoabc system was previously regarded as the only system for iron uptake by anammox bacteria yang et al 2021 in contrast a tonb exbb exbd tee complex associated with fe iii uptake yang et al 2021 was found in this study with a 70 increase in the pyrite group fig s15 moreover the ferric uptake regulator related gene also dramatically increased in the pyrite group fig s16 this result implies the enrichment of fe iii utilizing microorganisms which might participate in the feammox process among which candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis lautropia sp scn 69 89 and chloroflexi bacterium olb15 are potential feammox bacteria whose ferric uptake regulator genes significantly increased 4 13 times p 0 005 in the pyrite group these results implied the enhancement of feammox providing fe ii for ndfo to remove nitrate in conclusion the fe n cycle is driven by the detection of fe related nitrate removal microorganisms and the up regulation of fe iii uptake genes both contributing to nitrate removal in the anammox system with pyrite dosing 3 4 2 2 s based denitrification for nitrate removal nitrate was effectively attenuated by sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox in the presence of sulfide qin et al 2019 deng et al 2021a sulfur particles li et al 2019 and thiosulfate deng et al 2019 2021b a large amount of s released from pyrite may enhance nitrogen removal by s based denitrification eqs 7 9 7 hs 1 23no3 0 573h 0 027co2 0 093nh4 0 438hco3 0 093c5h7o2n 0 614n2 so4 2 0 866h2o 8 s0 0 876no3 0 343h2o 0 023co2

reduction and oxidation assimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation sox multi omics analysis revealed that the former two were dominant and gene expression of the sox system was negligible fig s10b compared with aqds pyrite benefits sulfate reduction fig s10b specifically the first step required in all sulfate utilization pathways assimilatory or dissimilatory is the conversion of sulfate into the activated intermediate adenylyl sulfate aps and is affected via sulfate adenylyltransferase sat the transcriptional activity of sulfate adenylyltransferas increased from 2 12 control to 4 06 pyrite fig 6 suggesting a higher sulfate reduction level in the pyrite group the same results from liu et al 2015 showed that fe iii addition induced the microbial reduction of fe iii by iron reducing bacteria which significantly enhanced the sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in addition the transcriptional activity of phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase cysh increased from 0 52 control to 1 20 pyrite fig 6 indicating a higher potential for sulfite production abundant intermediate sulfur provides electron donors for autotrophic denitrification which benefits nitrate removal pyrite also strengthened bacterial syntrophy by vitamin and amino acid cross feeding fig 6 metabolite exchange of amino acids and vitamins shapes microbial community assembly lawson et al 2017 we observed that several of the srb were missing key genes involved in amino acid leucine and methionine and b vitamin biosynthesis thiamine phosphate synthase and adenosylcobinamidephosphate synthase fig s17 which may be supported by candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis srb also provided anammox bacteria with essential nutrients such as lysine and tyrosine this mutual nutrient supply exemplified bacterial syntrophy and implied that the survival of srb and anammox bacteria was interdependent the s n cycle driven by the up regulation of s n related gene expression and nutrient exchange contributed to nitrate removal in the anammox system with pyrite dosing naturally the fe n s cycle network is constructed in this study to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the pyrite induced nitrogen removal enhancement in summary fig 6 pyrite promoted the tnrr of anammox in the following ways accelerating electron transfer rate by increasing cytochromes c fe s protein dehydrogenase etc and improving the nitrogen removal rate by coupling nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation feammox and s based denitrification 3 5 environmental implications considering the abundance of sulfide mineral reserves using these minerals to reduce n eutrophication is attractive in terms of easy access to such resources pyrite an earth abundant iron bearing sulfide mineral enhances bacterial activity and total nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater especially under high substrate shock loading this study shed light on the mechanism of electron transfer and the fe n s cycle in anammox systems providing a fundamental basis for developing a mediator in the anammox process for practical implications it is worth mentioning that no sulfide inhibition on the anammox process was observed during the operation indicating such a low dose of pyrite 1 g l 1 was not sufficient to cause sulfide inhibition moreover multi omics analyses showed that the sulfide was consumed by s based denitrification at the same time as it was produced effectively avoiding potential inhibition the slow and continuous release of fe and s through pyrite modification is also a way to avoid the inhibition of sulfide in practical applications several notable orientations for future research were proposed here first optimizing the mediator i e iron bearing sulfide mineral with a higher bioavailability and an improving electron transfer ability by weighing the economics and effectiveness is necessary second the significance of this work will be greatly enhanced if metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data can be put in the context of specific genomes meanwhile future studies integrating long term proteomic analysis are necessary to obtain more detailed information regarding delays in anammox growth although the lab scale investigation was performed in this study the strengthening effect of pyrite on the anammox system in the natural environment and engineering system should be further explored pyrite recovery should be considered to avoid the impact on subsequent sludge disposal therefore developing the modification of pyrite based materials to enhance nitrogen removal and pyrite recovery is of great significance 4 conclusion pyrite addition to the anammox system significantly improved the nitrogen removal rate by 52 in long term operation via enhancing electron transfer and coupling the fe n s cycle the enhanced electron transfer rate possibly resulted from the increase of electron transfer proteins i e cytochromes c and fe s protein with pyrite dosing the increasing heme c content 49 increase and ccx gene expression 9 85 fold increase intracellular iron from 0 15 to 0 32 mg gvss 1 the up regulation of fe s protein synthesis genes and other associated electron transfer proteins are responsible for the increase of electron transfer the removal of nitrate was attributed to the fe n s cycle driven by multi nitrogen removal pathways with pyrite dosing the gene expression of fe n s related enzymes increased by 56 93 and 67 revealing the increased utilization of fe n and s the closer fe n s correlations functional genes average degree from 3 3 to 12 5 in network analyses suggested the closer fe n s correlations the fe n s cycle was further confirmed by detecting fe related nitrate removal microorganisms bacterial syntrophy by nutrient exchange and the

15203,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox represents an energy efficient process for biological nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater however there are mechanistic issues unsolved regarding the low microbial electron transfer and undesired accumulation of nitrate in treated water limiting its widespread engineering applications we found that the addition of pyrite 1 g l 1 reactor an earth abundant iron bearing sulfide mineral to the anammox system significantly improved the nitrogen removal rate by 52 in long term operation at a high substrate shock loading 3 86 kg n m 3 d 1 two lines of evidence were presented to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the pyrite induced enhancement physiochemical evidence indicated that an increase of cytochromes c and fe s protein was responsible for the accelerated electron transfer among metabolic enzymes multi omics evidence showed that the depletion of nitrate was attributed to the fe n s cycle driven by nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation and s based denitrification this study deepens our understanding of the roles of electron transfer and the fe n s cycle in anammox systems providing a fundamental basis for the development of mediators in the anammox process for practical implications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological nitrogen removal iron mineral multi omics autotrophic system s based denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria oxidized ammonium nh4 to dinitrogen gas n2 using nitrite no2 as an electron acceptor under anoxic conditions eq 1 it is an advanced biological nitrogen removal pathway with lower sludge production no requirement for organic matter and substantial energy savings zekker et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however the autotrophic anammox bacteria possessed an extremely low growth rate and cellular yield easily inhibited by substrate and other inhibitory substances limiting the further improvement of anammox performance jin et al 2013 both nh4 and no2 may inhibit anammox performance when their concentration exceeds the tolerance threshold of anammox consortia zekker et al 2015 ma et al 2017 such substrate shock loading may plummet the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr generally there are two feasible methods to enhance the tnrr related to the anammox pathway accelerate substrate nh4 and no2 removal by improving anammox activity and increase byproduct no3 removal by amplifying nitrogen removal pathways 1 nh4 1 31no2 0 066hco3 0 13h n2 0 26no3 0 066ch2o0 5n0 15 2h2o tang et al 2018 reported that the activity of anammox consortia could be improved by increasing electron transfer recent research has shown that mediators electron shuttles and conductive materials can promote microbial activity by enhancing electron transfer liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 electron shuttles can act as electron carriers helping electron transfer from cell surface to electron acceptor including cell excreted small molecules e g flavins and exogenous mediators e g anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds aeppli et al 2022 conductive materials such as granular activated carbon and iron bearing minerals can assist extracellular electron transfer due to their high conductivity wang et al 2021 in addition fe ii can further enhance the concentration and activity of related iron containing enzymes e g cytochromes and fe s protein playing a crucial role in electron transfer feng et al 2022 in anoxic and circumneutral ph environments fe ii is predominantly embedded within the structure of fe ii rich clays or minerals like siderite feco3 and pyrite fes2 jakus et al 2021 offering a possible cost effective opportunity for promoting tnrr via electron transfer enhancement at a process level wang et al 2022 reported that fe iii mineral additions increased the cellular processes in the anammox system besides the relevant studies on the utilization of iron minerals for enhanced anammox performance are limited to study potential enhancement mechanisms we developed a hypothesis that iron bearing minerals as a mediator and iron containing enzyme facilitator may enhance the electron transfer rate thus ultimately enhancing the activity of anammox consortia furthermore the reduced iron and sulfur also account for nitrogen removal via autotrophic denitrification by introducing more reducing equivalents thus expanding the nitrogen removal pathway in the anammox system pelivano et al 2022 generally fe and s cycles are linked by microbially mediated no3 reduction coupled to iron bearing sulfide mineral oxidation melton et al 2014 which was also summarized previously feng et al 2022 pyrite whose unit cell contains four fes2 molecular formulas is one of the most abundant sulfide minerals with a high content of fe ii feng et al 2022 theoretically pyrite could have a great potential to amplify the nitrogen removal pathway by coupling the fe n s cycle and thus ultimately consume the byproduct nitrate nevertheless the mechanisms have yet to be explored one remaining question is whether pyrite can serve as the electron transfer accelerator and fe s supplier for enhancing nitrogen removal of the anammox process complex and dynamic networks of organisms are involved in the anammox system owing to the cooperation of unculturable pure anammox accompanied by symbiotic heterogeneous bacteria it is challenging to unravel the fe n s cycle of anammox consortia merely based on traditional techniques as a result the microbial interaction in anammox consortia caused by the fe n s cycle and a clearer picture of the nitrogen removal pathways remain poorly understood elucidation of a genotype performance relationship is critical to understand anammox consortia at the whole system level multi omics are the most universal and powerful approaches to tracking microbial community and activity at the genetic level becoming increasingly popular in biological research consequently multi omics analyses may bring new insights into the interactions between pyrite and anammox therefore this study proposes that pyrite could act as a mediator to facilitate the electron transfer and a fe s supplier to couple with the fe n s cycle ultimately achieving an increase in anammox performance the contribution of the fe n s cycle to tnrr was investigated by comparing the anammox performance dosing with pyrite and that of aqds the common mediators without fe and s moreover the possibility of anammox enhancement and the underlying mechanisms are explored by using physiochemical and multi omics approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of mediators by batch test to clarify the promotion effect of the mediator and the fe n s cycle on anammox performance the mediator pyrite and aqds with without fe and s were selected for comparative study the specific anammox activity saa test was used to evaluate the nitrogen removal performance and the experimental details are described in the supporting information we compared the performances of 4 kinds of mediators i activated carbon ii riboflavin iii aqds and iv pyrite including mediators without i iii with iv fe and s 2 2 long term bioreactor operation seeded sludge the anammox granular sludge was taken from the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor which had been successfully operated for a year in the laboratory with a nitrogen loading rate nlr higher than 1 1 kg n m 3 d 1 the relative abundance of anammox bacteria was 21 with the dominant genus candidatus kuenenia 15 operation strategy to investigate how anammox performance changes with pyrite and aqds dosing three identical bioreactors fig s1a with a

at 6 5 h the feeding medium was flushed with n2 co2 95 5 to remove dissolved oxygen and the ph was maintained at 6 8 7 0 three reactors the control pyrite and aqds groups were operated synchronously no exogenous mediators were added to the control group the concentrations of pyrite and aqds are selected according to the preliminary experiment figs s2 and s3 the pyrite group was injected with 1 0

pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between these genes were calculated using the software r www r project org with the hmisc packages the connection representing a strong r 0 99 and significant p

calcein am as the fluorescent probes according to the instructions jiang et al 2020 exposed to this ester it can penetrate the cell membrane and reacts with cytosolic esterase and then creates highly charged iron probe calcein which is a fluorochrome calcein fluorescence can be quenched following the chelation of iron and the degree of quenching gives an estimate of the amount of intracellular iron pre treatment of anammox sludge was applied to obtain a free cell suspension suitable for flow cytometry analysis firstly the anammox sludge was washed with pbs 0 1 m ph 7 0 3 times and resuspended in pbs the free cell suspension was then filtered with a 40 µm cell strainer to eliminate coarse particles that may clog the flow cytometer s nozzle in the subsequent flow cytometry analysis furthermore the data were analyzed by flowjo each treatment was analyzed in triplicate 2 5 other analytical methods the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations of supernatant samples were determined using american public health association apha standard methods with spectrophotometry the calculations of nitrogen loading rate nlr tnrr ammoniacal nitrogen removal rate arr and nitrite and nitrate nitrogen removal rate nitrr are listed in the supporting information the cell membrane integrity of bacteria was characterized by ldh activity the heme c concentration was determined by measuring the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of the pyridine hemochrome using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 23 97 the fe concentrations in the effluent of bioreactors were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 2000 perkin elmer enterprise management co ltd china the fe distribution was conducted according to jiang et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance the nitrogen removal performance of the three reactors control pyrite and aqds are recorded in figs 1 and s4 based on influent substrate concentration the entire operation period can be divided into performance improvement stage i days 1 54 high substrate shock loading stage ii days 55 71 recovery stage iii days 72 85 and secondary shock loading stages stage iv days 86 96 direct evidence of the promotion effect of the mediator was obtained at a relatively higher nlr stage ii i e a 30 tnrr increase was achieved at 3 86 kg n m 3 d 1 with pyrite dosing during stage iii the fold changes of tnrr and arr of the treatment groups to the control group fluctuated between 1 0 1 3 further indicating that the addition of mediators enhanced the nitrogen removal performance the most apparent reinforcement by dosing mediators was obtained in stage iv when the high substrate shock loading resulted in the deterioration of anammox performance in the control group the values of the fold change treatment control in the maximum tnrr were 2 33 pyrite control and 1 82 aqds control respectively it suggested that mediators were effective in resisting high substrate shock loading pyrite was a more effective anammox reinforcer than aqds in promoting arr and tnrr based on both anammox and denitrification pathways the contribution of mediators to nitrogen removal in stage iv is quantified in fig 1c compared to the control group a 30 tnrr increase and 22 arr increase were achieved by dosing aqds whereas for the pyrite group an extra 22 tnrr and 16 arr increases were achieved over the aqds group in total adding pyrite significantly enhanced arr nitrr and tnrr by 38 14 and 52 respectively generally anammox is the only ammonium removal way under the tested anoxic system the higher arr suggested a better anammox performance in the pyrite group theoretically the improvement ratio of tnrr should be equal to that of arr if pyrite only acts as a mediator to enhance anammox bacteria however the nitrr tnrr arr in the pyrite group was 1 79 fold compared to the control group this significantly excessive nitrr with pyrite dosing may result from the multi nitrogen removal pathways such as autotrophic denitrification due to the fe and s releasing this hypothesis was further explored in the following 3 2 enhancement of microbial metabolism 3 2 1 increasing microbial community diversity the diversity of the community structure laid a good foundation for the reactor to resist the impact of the external environment i e a high loading rate the results from high throughput sequencing analysis suggested that the shannon index increased from 1 34 control to 1 85 pyrite and 1 79 aqds and chao diversity indexes increased as well in contrast the simpson estimator showed the opposite trend fig s5 it indicated the increasing microbial community diversity confirmed by tem analysis fig s6 presenting various morphologies of microorganisms in the pyrite and aqds group more information on microbial community diversity was discussed in detail in section 3 4 3 2 2 protecting cell membrane integrity as an indicator of cell membrane integrity the increasing ldh activity positively reflects cell damage or lysis wan et al 2016 along with the elevated nlr the ldh activity increased from stage i to stage iii fig 2 a c it suggested that the microorganism was susceptible to high substrate shock loading which destroyed the membrane integrity of anammox bacteria however the ldh activity was only 46 and 73 of the control in the pyrite and aqds groups respectively suggesting that the presence of mediators protected the membrane from damage except for the increasing microbial community diversity membrane integrity might partially result from metabolism enhancement especially the addition of pyrite may promote the metabolic activity of microorganisms fig s7 the sem results in fig s6 confirmed the anammox bacteria in the pyrite group maintained intact cell morphology with no collapse it confirmed that pyrite addition improved the microbial resistance i e substrate shock loading 3 2 3 up regulating functional metabolism genes mediators also overcame the stress of increasing substrate loading by up regulating nitrogen metabolism genes to improve cell endurance and reduce cell injury the normalized anammox 16s rrna genes constituted a 2 7 fold pyrite and 3 2 fold aqds up regulation compared to the value obtained in the control group fig 2d therefore the more anammox bacteria contributed to higher nitrogen removal performances with pyrite or aqds addition the significant up regulation of narg fig 2e and nirs fig 2f with pyrite and aqds addition also contribute to the higher nitrr during the anammox process to further clarify the promotion effect of mediators on nitrogen metabolism systematically anammox sludge with the best promotion effect of tnrr at the end of stage iv was selected for an in depth study by metagenomic and metatranscriptomics analyses the nmds plot based on sequences at an otu level 97 similarity showed a clear separation of the community composition between the control and treatment pyrite or aqds groups fig s8 revealing apparent changes in the community structure with different mediators microorganisms involved in nitrogen removal were determined based on their genus compositions fig s9 metagenomic sequencing approach revealed that candidatus kuenenia was the dominant anammox genus in the three reactors with mean abundances of 23 5 control 26 6 pyrite and 24 8 aqds respectively furthermore metatranscriptomics analysis suggested that candidatus kuenenia showed the highest expression activity functional enzymes related to nitrogen transformation were screened to reveal the biological mechanism of nitrogen metabolism under different mediator treatments microorganisms can convert nitrogen compounds spanning redox states from 3 to 5 using several discrete redox reactions kuypers et al 2018 in total 18 functional enzymes were coupled with 5 nitrogen transformation processes namely nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia anra and anammox fig 3 the transcription level of hydrazine synthase subunit hzs was the highest in the whole nitrogen metabolism followed by hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh table s6 they are 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than other genes meaning that anammox is the main nitrogen removal path in this study transcriptional activity analysis showed that pyrite enhanced nitrogen removal performance by improving nitrogen metabolism fig 3 nitrate reduction is an important way to remove the byproducts of anammox nitrate prefers to be reduced by anra and denitrification instead of dnra with pyrite addition because of the assimilatory nitrate reductases in the cytoplasm nitrate assimilation requires nitrate transport into the cell by atp dependent transporters the up regulation of anra expression also suggests that pyrite provides more energy for nitrogen removal this result was also consistent with the nitrogen removal performance in long term bioreactor operation in which the pyrite group obtained a higher tnrr followed by the aqds group 3 3 enhancement of electron transfer ability of anammox the growth rate of anammox consortia could be accelerated by increasing electron transfer zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2018 the electron transfer was investigated by fe s protein synthesis heme c ccx gene and other associated putative electron transfer proteins 3 3 1 increasing heme c content and up regulating ccx gene expression as a strong indicator of anammox performance evaluation heme c plays a vital role in electron transfer and storage ma et al 2019 in fig 4 a the content of heme c increased by 49 pyrite and 16 5 aqds compared to the control group the ccx gene is responsible for electron transfer and membrane associated energy conservation up regulating 9 9 and 5 0 fold in the pyrite and aqds groups respectively compared to the control group fig 4b cytochromes c are essential associated electron transfer proteins responsible for the increasing electron transfer the increase of heme c and the up regulation of ccx expression with pyrite or aqds dosing might increase cytochromes c enhancing electron transfer among metabolic enzymes kartal et al 2013 ferousi et al 2017 3 3 2 facilitating iron acquisition and promoting fe s protein synthesis iron is the most abundant transition metal in biological systems where it is employed as an essential cofactor in electron transfer reactions ferousi et al 2017 the extracellular iron must be transported into the cell before the bacteria can utilize it as reported the nitrogen removal performance improves as the iron inward transport capacity increases jiang et al 2020 intracellular iron concentration was detected to elucidate the pyrite induced nitrogen removal enhancement in the anammox system we found that the ability of iron to be transported from the solution to the cell was enhanced by pyrite dosing fig 4d f resulting in the evident increase of intracellular iron from 0 15 to 0 32 mg gvss 1 fig 4c and f the increase in intracellular iron may favor the fe s proteins synthesis as reported fe s proteins were prominent members of the redox center involved in electron transfer processes liu et al 2014 and they were essential for anammox bacteria metabolism multi omics results indicated that pyrite dosing greatly increased the transcriptional activity of fe s protein related genes the transcriptional activity of the rrf2 family transcriptional regulator fe s cluster assembly cytochrome b6 f complex iron sulfur subunit and fe s cluster assembly protein in the pyrite group constituted a 6 94 3 27 and 3 16 fold increase compared to the values obtained in the control group fig s10a thereby with the fe released from pyrite the increase of intracellular iron enhanced electron transfer by enriching fe s proteins conversely aqds cannot provide exogenous fe or s and thus cannot promote the electron transfer ability through the improving function of fe s protein fig s10a 3 3 3 stimulating the extracellular electron transfer dependent anaerobic oxidation of ammonium shaw et al 2020 revealed the potential of anammox bacteria to use solid state electron acceptors as the terminal electron sink the transcriptional activities of the genes participating in the putative extracellular electron transfer metabolic pathway were up regulated with pyrite and aqds addition fig s11 specifically the membrane bound formate dehydrogenase fdh possibly involved in the pathway to respire insoluble minerals in anammox bacteria shaw et al 2020 up regulated in the pyrite group accounting for 201 and 217 of the control and aqds groups fig s11 furthermore central carbon metabolism iron metabolism and respiratory complexes of anammox in extracellular electron transfer dependent anammox including ferredoxin oxidoreductase acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase biopolymer transport protein and dehydrogenase were all generally up regulated fig 6 the evidence suggested that pyrite addition might also provide another nh4 n removal pathway via extracellular electron transfer as reported the electron transfer is greatly enhanced from fe ii to cytochromes c of bacteria through the conduction band of semiconductive minerals i e pyrite in this study liu et al 2020 in contrast with aqds pyrite was likely to serve as a conduit xu et al 2020 due to its semi conduction further increasing the extracellular electron transfer to achieve a higher nitrogen removal rate in general in addition to the role of associated electron transfer enzymes pyrite might also act as a fe s supplier to promote extra intracellular electron transfer through enriching fe s protein and act as an electron conduit to improve extra extracellular electron transfer achieving a higher electron transfer and nitrogen removal rate than that in the aqds group 3 4 enhancement of nitrate removal with fe n s cycle the undesired accumulation of the nitrate in treated water could be removed by other nitrogen removal pathways attributed to the fe n s cycle such as nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation nh4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction feammox and s based denitrification therefore this work aims to verify this assumption by multi omics evidence 3 4 1 enriching fe and s related nitrogen removal pathways the possible roles of fe and s in the anammox system were further investigated to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the pyrite induced nitrogen removal enhancement with aqds dosing only electron transfer related enzymes increased 69 obviously fig 5 a accounting for the tnrr enhancement in the aqds group however with pyrite addition the gene expression of fe n s and electron transfer related enzymes significantly increased by 56 93 67 and 89 respectively fig 5a suggesting a higher tnrr was likely owing to the extra fe and s related nitrogen removal pathways the results indicate that pyrite might not only act as an electron mediator such as aqds but also enrich fe and s related nitrogen removal pathways to enhance anammox performance to further confirm this speculation co occurrence networks were constructed based on metatranscriptomic data fig 5b the robust pairwise correlations of these fe n s genes formed their co occurrence networks as depicted in fig 5b the consortia in the pyrite group contained a higher number of functional genes 35 nodes than that of the control 23 nodes and aqds 25 nodes group indicating an increased network size with pyrite dosing the larger network size suggested a greater network complexity contributing to greater resilience to disturbances wang et al 2022 i e substrate shock loading this result further explained the higher tnrr obtained in the pyrite group furthermore the more connections edges a gene node had the more potential fe n s closely correlated with the reactor owned the average degree the average edges per node in the pyrite group 12 5 is the highest among the control group 3 3 and the aqds group 6 6 indicating the interaction between fe n and s related functions are strengthened with pyrite dosing therefore the extra fe and s related pathways were responsible for nitrogen removal in the pyrite group 3 4 2 increasing nitrate removal a combination of reduced iron and sulfur compounds e g pyrite likely enhances the efficiency of nitrate the byproduct of anammox removal by introducing more reducing equivalents it may contribute to the surprising nitrr increase of the pyrite group bioleaching fe and s from pyrite is a prerequisite for anammox performance promotion it has been demonstrated that pyrite bioleaching could be effectively accelerated by bioleaching microorganisms e g acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and leptospirillum ferrooxidans which were detected in this study then fe ii released from pyrite is easily oxidized to fe iii because of its strong reducing property wang et al 2022 anammox bacteria usually produce abundant extracellular polymeric substances where pyrite bioleaching by fe iii was accelerated feng et al 2022 therefore anammox interaction with pyrite facilitates fe and s release from pyrite 3 4 2 1 ndfo coupled feammox for nitrate removal iron is a key factor in the nitrogen cycle nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo eqs 2 and 3 has been found in various environments li et al 2018 additionally feammox had been demonstrated eqs 4 6 these reactions may contribute to a better nitrogen removal performance with pyrite addition the continuous conversion process of no3 and nh4 was a coupled process of feammox anammox and ndfo under anaerobic conditions 2 4fe ii 2no2 9h2o 4fe oh 3 n2o 6h 3 10fe ii 2no3 12h 10fe iii n2 6h2o 4 3fe oh 3 5h nh4 3fe2 9h2o 0 5n2 5 6fe oh 3 10h nh4 6fe2 16h2o no2 6 8fe oh 3 14h nh4 8fe2 21h2o no3 however it is difficult to elucidate this process by monitoring changes in the fe oxidation state because of the complexity of the biochemical fe cycle in anammox bioreactors wang et al 2022 we tried quantifying the fe ii concentration in the effluent of the pyrite group nevertheless the concentration of detectable fe was relatively low fig s12 which was presumably caused by a large amount of iron hydroxide precipitation therefore pyrite was collected for further detection afm fig s13 and sem fig s14 analyses characterized the surface topographical features and element compositions of pyrite the results showed that the surface roughness and fe s ratio of pyrite increased likely due to corrosion after a long time operation suggesting the fe release from pyrite further analysis was conducted by multi omics to confirm the coupled process of feammox anammox and ndfo multiple fe n cycle related microorganisms were detected in this study such as ferrous iron oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria e g rhodanobacter mizugakiibacter and gallionella and iron sulfides mediated autotrophic denitrifiers e g thiobacillus sulfurimonas and acidovorax the results implied that nitrate removal might relate to the fe oxidization which produced fe iii limiting the continued ndfo process feammox can reduce the fe iii to fe ii forming the iron cycle and continuously reducing nitrate however the microbial communities associated with feammox are still unclear li et al 2019 so we confirmed the existence of feammox at the genetic level by analyzing fe iii uptake genes the feoabc system was previously regarded as the only system for iron uptake by anammox bacteria yang et al 2021 in contrast a tonb exbb exbd tee complex associated with fe iii uptake yang et al 2021 was found in this study with a 70 increase in the pyrite group fig s15 moreover the ferric uptake regulator related gene also dramatically increased in the pyrite group fig s16 this result implies the enrichment of fe iii utilizing microorganisms which might participate in the feammox process among which candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis lautropia sp scn 69 89 and chloroflexi bacterium olb15 are potential feammox bacteria whose ferric uptake regulator genes significantly increased 4 13 times p 0 005 in the pyrite group these results implied the enhancement of feammox providing fe ii for ndfo to remove nitrate in conclusion the fe n cycle is driven by the detection of fe related nitrate removal microorganisms and the up regulation of fe iii uptake genes both contributing to nitrate removal in the anammox system with pyrite dosing 3 4 2 2 s based denitrification for nitrate removal nitrate was effectively attenuated by sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox in the presence of sulfide qin et al 2019 deng et al 2021a sulfur particles li et al 2019 and thiosulfate deng et al 2019 2021b a large amount of s released from pyrite may enhance nitrogen removal by s based denitrification eqs 7 9 7 hs 1 23no3 0 573h 0 027co2 0 093nh4 0 438hco3 0 093c5h7o2n 0 614n2 so4 2 0 866h2o 8 s0 0 876no3 0 343h2o 0 023co2

reduction and oxidation assimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation sox multi omics analysis revealed that the former two were dominant and gene expression of the sox system was negligible fig s10b compared with aqds pyrite benefits sulfate reduction fig s10b specifically the first step required in all sulfate utilization pathways assimilatory or dissimilatory is the conversion of sulfate into the activated intermediate adenylyl sulfate aps and is affected via sulfate adenylyltransferase sat the transcriptional activity of sulfate adenylyltransferas increased from 2 12 control to 4 06 pyrite fig 6 suggesting a higher sulfate reduction level in the pyrite group the same results from liu et al 2015 showed that fe iii addition induced the microbial reduction of fe iii by iron reducing bacteria which significantly enhanced the sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in addition the transcriptional activity of phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase cysh increased from 0 52 control to 1 20 pyrite fig 6 indicating a higher potential for sulfite production abundant intermediate sulfur provides electron donors for autotrophic denitrification which benefits nitrate removal pyrite also strengthened bacterial syntrophy by vitamin and amino acid cross feeding fig 6 metabolite exchange of amino acids and vitamins shapes microbial community assembly lawson et al 2017 we observed that several of the srb were missing key genes involved in amino acid leucine and methionine and b vitamin biosynthesis thiamine phosphate synthase and adenosylcobinamidephosphate synthase fig s17 which may be supported by candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis srb also provided anammox bacteria with essential nutrients such as lysine and tyrosine this mutual nutrient supply exemplified bacterial syntrophy and implied that the survival of srb and anammox bacteria was interdependent the s n cycle driven by the up regulation of s n related gene expression and nutrient exchange contributed to nitrate removal in the anammox system with pyrite dosing naturally the fe n s cycle network is constructed in this study to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the pyrite induced nitrogen removal enhancement in summary fig 6 pyrite promoted the tnrr of anammox in the following ways accelerating electron transfer rate by increasing cytochromes c fe s protein dehydrogenase etc and improving the nitrogen removal rate by coupling nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation feammox and s based denitrification 3 5 environmental implications considering the abundance of sulfide mineral reserves using these minerals to reduce n eutrophication is attractive in terms of easy access to such resources pyrite an earth abundant iron bearing sulfide mineral enhances bacterial activity and total nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater especially under high substrate shock loading this study shed light on the mechanism of electron transfer and the fe n s cycle in anammox systems providing a fundamental basis for developing a mediator in the anammox process for practical implications it is worth mentioning that no sulfide inhibition on the anammox process was observed during the operation indicating such a low dose of pyrite 1 g l 1 was not sufficient to cause sulfide inhibition moreover multi omics analyses showed that the sulfide was consumed by s based denitrification at the same time as it was produced effectively avoiding potential inhibition the slow and continuous release of fe and s through pyrite modification is also a way to avoid the inhibition of sulfide in practical applications several notable orientations for future research were proposed here first optimizing the mediator i e iron bearing sulfide mineral with a higher bioavailability and an improving electron transfer ability by weighing the economics and effectiveness is necessary second the significance of this work will be greatly enhanced if metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data can be put in the context of specific genomes meanwhile future studies integrating long term proteomic analysis are necessary to obtain more detailed information regarding delays in anammox growth although the lab scale investigation was performed in this study the strengthening effect of pyrite on the anammox system in the natural environment and engineering system should be further explored pyrite recovery should be considered to avoid the impact on subsequent sludge disposal therefore developing the modification of pyrite based materials to enhance nitrogen removal and pyrite recovery is of great significance 4 conclusion pyrite addition to the anammox system significantly improved the nitrogen removal rate by 52 in long term operation via enhancing electron transfer and coupling the fe n s cycle the enhanced electron transfer rate possibly resulted from the increase of electron transfer proteins i e cytochromes c and fe s protein with pyrite dosing the increasing heme c content 49 increase and ccx gene expression 9 85 fold increase intracellular iron from 0 15 to 0 32 mg gvss 1 the up regulation of fe s protein synthesis genes and other associated electron transfer proteins are responsible for the increase of electron transfer the removal of nitrate was attributed to the fe n s cycle driven by multi nitrogen removal pathways with pyrite dosing the gene expression of fe n s related enzymes increased by 56 93 and 67 revealing the increased utilization of fe n and s the closer fe n s correlations functional genes average degree from 3 3 to 12 5 in network analyses suggested the closer fe n s correlations the fe n s cycle was further confirmed by detecting fe related nitrate removal microorganisms bacterial syntrophy by nutrient exchange and the

15204,nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo plays an important role in methane ch4 consumption in intertidal wetlands however little is known about the responses of n damo in intertidal wetlands to periodic drying wetting caused by tidal cycling here comparative experiments waterlogged desiccated reflooded with the yangtze estuarine intertidal sediments were performed to examine the effects of periodic tidal changes on n damo microbial communities abundances and potential activities functional gene sequencing indicated the coexistence of n damo bacteria and archaea in the tide fluctuating environments and generally higher biodiversity under reflooded conditions than consecutive inundation or emersion the n damo microbial abundance and associated activity varied significantly during alternative exposure and inundation with higher abundance and activity under the waterlogged than desiccated conditions reflooding of intertidal wetlands might intensify n damo activities indicating the resilience of n damo microbial metabolisms to the wetting drying events structural equation modeling and correlation analysis showed that n damo activity was highly related to n damo microbial abundance and substrate availability under inundation whereas salt accumulation in sediment was the primary factor restraining n damo activity under the desiccation overall this study reveals tidal induced shifts of n damo activity and associated contribution to mitigating ch4 which may help accurately project ch4 emission from intertidal wetlands under different tidal scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane anaerobic methane oxidation tidal cycle intertidal sediment nitrogen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the largest component of the terrestrial biological carbon c pool worldwide wetlands account for approximately 20 30 of total sequestered c mitsch and gosselink 2000 although wetlands generally have high potential for c burial belowground mcleod et al 2011 they also contribute 19 33 of the global terrestrial methane ch4 emission which is generated as the end product of anaerobic degradation of organic c kirschke et al 2013 saunois et al 2020 with a global warming potential of about 20 30 times that of carbon dioxide co2 on a 100 year perspective larger wetland ch4 emissions could trigger a positive feedback loop to further intensify global warming and ch4 release ipcc 2021 methanogens and methanotrophs primarily regulate biogenic ch4 emissions through determining ch4 production and oxidation activity conrad 2009 fan et al 2020 ch4 oxidation by aerobic and or anaerobic methanotrophs rather than ch4 production by methanogens generally controls the rate of ch4 emission in anoxic environments kits et al 2015 shen et al 2019 fan et al 2022 it has been documented that anaerobic methanotrophs could efficiently oxidize 200 tg of endogenous ch4 emission per year in anaerobic freshwater wetlands globally segarra et al 2015 martinez cruz et al 2018 and oxidize up to 300 tg ch4 per year in marine ecosystem hinrichs and boetius 2002 which makes anaerobic methane oxidation crucial for the global ch4 balance especially sulfate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation sulfate anmo is considered to dominate anaerobic ch4 oxidation in marine habitats mcglynn et al 2015 scheller et al 2016 however a novel microbial process nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is observed to be more chemically feasible and thermodynamically favorable in ch4 oxidation coupled with nitrite no2 nitrate no3 reduction in freshwater wetland ecosystems table s1 hu et al 2014 shen et al 2019 two distinct groups of anaerobic methanotrophs with a cooperative relationship were found to catalyze n damo wang et al 2019 the anme 2d archaeon candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens m nitroreducens performing nitrate dependent damo nitrate damo with no3 reduction to no2 raghoebarsing et al 2006 haroon et al 2013 and the nc10 bacterium candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera that is responsible for nitrite dependent damo nitrite damo with no2 completely reduction to nitrogen n2 ettwig et al 2010 hence these microorganisms contributed significantly to two major global nutrient cycles of carbon and nitrogen in natural environments wang et al 2019 shen et al 2020 compared with other natural wetlands estuarine and coastal wetlands are geographically squeezed zones between marine and terrestrial ecosystems that trap natural and anthropogenic pollutants canfield et al 2010 performing vital biogeochemical c and n reactions shiau and chiu 2020 the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and fossil fuels burning elser et al 2007 have caused overloading of reactive n in estuarine and coastal environments which could stimulate n damo microbial activity shen et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that n damo exerts a stronger control over ch4 flux than sulfate anmo in nitrogen enriched estuarine and coastal wetlands wang et al 2019 as a result estuarine and coastal environments are likely to represent an important niche harboring n damo microbes zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2020 niu et al 2022 understanding and modeling the controlling mechanisms for n damo have become a major research priority wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 nevertheless the research on n damo in natural environment is still limited so far the mechanisms of n damo in estuarine and coastal wetlands remain poorly understood because of limited experimental studies niu et al 2022 and their ch4 removal potential also remains to be explored estuarine intertidal flats are generally subjected to alternating exposure and immersion by periodic tidal cycles mikha et al 2005 hou et al 2007 chambers et al 2011 during inundation the sediments become an anaerobic environment conversely oxygen will permeate into the surface sediments and water loss occurs due to evaporation when sediments are exposed to the atmosphere which has substantial consequences on sediment physicochemical properties hou et al 2007 zheng et al 2016 cadier et al 2017 this succession of contradictory environmental conditions is evidenced to regulate the transformation of nutrients via changing the sediment physicochemical conditions hou et al 2007 emery et al 2021 therefore tidal cycle is hypothesized to affect the n damo characteristics which can be altered depending on the integrated influences of hydrological and sediment physicochemical parameters e g salinity ph dissolved oxygen temperature water table and redox conditions he et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 however previous studies only reflected the overall variation of n damo microbes that scale uniformly with environmental drivers mostly during inundation shen et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 niu et al 2022 to our knowledge few studies have investigated the response of n damo to the tidal inundation and exposure so far in particular it remains unclear if n damo responses to commonly studied drivers in consistent environments are transferable to fluctuated conditions where periodic tide strongly interacts and often dominates other factors modulating their effects on n damo microbial processes in addition increasing sea levels as a result of global climate changes will also expose estuarine intertidal sediments to more frequent and longer tidal inundations schuerch et al 2018 rising flooded events might trigger biological pulses or other transient changes in ch4 fluxes by controlling redox conditions and delivering nutrients or competing substrates for microbial processes ma et al 2013 cai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 emery et al 2021 moreover the extra heat from global warming is expected to increase the speed and intensity of drying during neap tide in intertidal wetlands trenberth et al 2014 further complicating predictions of ch4 dynamics in tidal wetlands to gain a better understanding of biogeochemical ch4 budgets in coastal wetlands quantifying the effects of periodic tides on n damo community dynamics and characterizing related drivers are thus needed here we investigated n damo microbial dynamics in response to experimentally simulated tidal cycles in intact sediment cores collected from intertidal flats of the yangtze estuary the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the variations of n damo microbial activity abundance and community structure under alternative drying wetting 2 to detangle the regulatory factors and potential mechanisms underlying the response of n damo to drying wetting alternation and 3 to estimate the contribution of n damo to ch4 attenuation and n elimination in coastal wetlands this study can provide a comprehensive understanding of the tidal effects on n damo bioprocess and give new insights into the potential effects of the intensifying tidal inundations on ch4 dynamics in coastal wetlands under the context of global climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the study site was located in chongming eastern tidal flat of the yangtze estuary china fig 1 a the yangtze estuary has a subtropical monsoon climate mean annual precipitation 1022 mm annual temperature 15 3 xu and zhao 2005 the study area can be seawards divided into the upper middle and lower tidal flats and characterized by clay sediments silt mixed with clay and silts with fine sands respectively in addition the native plant species phragmites communis and scripus triqueter dominate the upper and middle tidal flats respectively while the lower tidal flat has almost no vegetation the upper tidal flat is strongly influenced by the semi lunar alternating emersion and immersion and thus it was chosen as the experimental area in this study to avoid the influences of plant species and minimize errors caused by sediment spatial heterogeneity three 10 m 10 m plots in the vegetation free area were randomly located with an inter plot distance of 20 m it was previously found that n damo microbial activity was relatively higher in upper 0 10 cm depth zheng et al 2020 thus we collected 11 intact sediment cores 8 cm diameter 10 cm depth from each plot using perspex columns 30 cm length 8 cm diameter during the emersion stage additional near bottom seawater was collected using a plastic bucket from nearby marsh creeks during the sediment core collection all samples were transported to the laboratory within 4 6 h and stored at 4 for subsequent incubation experiments 2 2 experimental setup the collected sediment cores were assigned randomly to four treatments waterlogged core wc system desiccated core dc system reflooded core rc system and untreated core uc system control as previously described by hou et al 2007 fig 1b to investigate the effect of tidal immersion on n damo nine intact cores in the wc system were divided into three subgroups in triplicate wc1 wc2 and wc3 corresponding to immersion times of 5 10 and 15 days respectively to investigate the effect of tidal emersion on n damo process nine intact cores in the dc system were divided into three subgroups in triplicate dc1 dc2 and dc3 corresponding to emersion times of 10 20 and 30 days respectively finally to investigate the effect of re flooding on n damo process twelve intact cores in the rc system were subjected to two alternate wetting and drying cycles over one month following desiccation for 10 days and subsequent inundation for 5 days in one semi lunar tidal cycle these cores were divided into four subgroups in triplicate rc1 rc2 rc3 and rc4 corresponding to times of 10 15 25 and 30 days respectively herein the duration of waterlogging and desiccating respectively depended on the average immersion and emersion periods observed in the upper tidal flat during a semi lunar cycle hou et al 2007 sediment cores in each system were then transferred into four 20 l open top incubators and incubated at 25 under natural light dark cycles for wc and rc systems near bottom seawater was recirculated through pipes inserted along the edges of cores to achieve waterlogging and an air pump system maintained oxygen levels in the seawater of each incubator at the end of incubation the intact cores were quickly removed from the tank fig 1b and divided under helium atmosphere into two sections topsoil 0 5 cm depth and subsoil 5 10 cm depth layers subsequently each sample was further divided into two parts one for immediate determination of n damo rates and physicochemical parameters and the other stored at 20 for later molecular analyses 2 3 measurement of variables ch4 concentration was measured using the static sealed black box method in each sediment core at the end of incubation briefly at 0 15 30 and 45 mins after a tight fitting cap sealed the cores mu et al 2017 song et al 2018 a 50 ml plastic syringe was connected to a port stopcock installed in the box cap to extract gas samples in the headspace then 5 ml of gas was injected into a 5 ml pre evacuated vessel fitted with a butyl rubber stopper ch4 concentrations were quantified through a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan which was equipped with a flame ionization detector the flux of ch4 was estimated from linear regressions of ch4 concentration versus time in the present study r 2 of the regression equations was higher than 0 90 which can ensure the reliability of the estimated ch4 flux salinity and ph of sediments were determined respectively using a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi yellow springs instrument yellow springs oh usa and a ph meter mettler toledo greifensee switzerland at a solid water co2 free ratio of 1 2 5 hou et al 2013 water content of sediments was quantified based on sediment weight loss after vacuum freeze drying labconco kansas city mo usa total organic carbon toc of sediment was measured by the k2cr2o7 oxidation method sediment no3 no2 and ammonium nh4 contents were extracted using 2 m kcl from solid water suspensions 1 5 w v and analyzed colorimetrically using a flow injection analyzer skalar analytical san breda netherlands detection limits 0 1 µm for no2 no3 and 0 5 µm for nh4 sediment sulfide s2 and so4 2 contents were determined using an orion sure flow combination silver sulfide electrode thermo scientific waltham ma usa hou et al 2012 and an ion chromatograph segarra et al 2013 respectively sediment total fe and fe ii was determined using a 1 10 phenanthroline and 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride method after extracted from fresh sediment 0 5 g dry weight with 0 5 m anoxic hcl 30 ml wallmann et al 1993 haese et al 1997 fe iii was calculated by the difference between total fe and fe ii dissolved ch4 in sediment porewater was measured after fresh sediment was immersed by saturated nacl solution as described by winkel et al soil enzyme activities are sensitive indicators of microbial metabolic capacity therefore we also investigated the impact of the tidal cycle on enzyme synthesis soil urease sue urea hydrolysis was measured using the indophenol blue colorimetric method liu et al 2018 5 and 6 sulfofluorescein diacetate sfda an indicator of total microbial activities was measured by the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate 3 6 diacetylfluorescein fda method adam and duncan 2001 green et al 2006 all measured sediment physicochemical properties are given in table s2 2 4 measurement of n damo rates potential rates of n damo were measured with a 13c stable isotope method hu et al 2014 briefly 20 ml slurries containing 25 fresh sediments and 75 he degassed artificial seawater were prepared under a continuous flow of ultra high purity n2 99 99 airgas radnor pa usa and then transferred into sixteen 120 ml serum bottles all bottles were flushed with continuous n2 for 30 min and sealed using aluminum silicone rubber pads the slurries were pre incubated in the dark at near in situ sediment temperature 25 for at least 30 h to remove ambient nox no3 and no2 and oxygen o2 the bottles were subsequently split into four different treatment groups with three replicates 1 control 2 13ch4 99 9 13c sigma st louis mo usa 3 13ch4 no2 and 4 13ch4 no3 then 20 μl of he purged nano2 and nano3 stock solutions were injected into each bottle in the group 3 with 0 5 mm final no2 concentration and group 4 with 5 mm final no3 concentration respectively thereafter to achieve a final headspace 13ch4 concentration of approximately 1 v v 1 ml of 13ch4 was injected into each vial in groups 2 3 and 4 a control sample without any addition was also used to measure background 13co2 moreover to ensure anaerobic conditions before measurement of n damo rate dissolved oxygen was measured in four extra vials after pre incubation using an oxygen needle sensor ox n unisense aarhus denmark based on our previous study that 13co2 production increased linearly within 24 h of incubation fig s1 zheng et al 2020 all the bottles were incubated for one day hu et al 2014 and then stopped by injection of 1 ml of a 50 zncl2 solution 13co2 production in the headspace of the bottles was measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific karlsruhe germany total n damo nitrite damo and nitrate damo rates were quantified as

originlab corporation northampton ma usa software statistical significance was determined at the p 0 05 level comparisons of sediment physicochemical properties and n damo microbial abundances and

software was used to analyze the correlations between environmental variables and the community structures of n damo microbes using redundancy analysis rda lai 2013 3 results 3 1 effect of exposure and immersion on sediment physicochemical characteristics distinct distribution of sediment biogeochemical properties was observed among the uc dc wc and rc systems table s2 fig s2 sediment cores in different systems were separated along principal component pc1 and the topsoil layers were further separated out along pc1 with the subsoil layer fig s2 moisture content increased significantly from 27 99 34 38 in the dc system to 36 68 46 03 in the wc system p 0 05 and was significantly higher in the topsoil than subsoil in these two systems table s2 compared with the uc system the ch4 flux of cores was significantly larger in the wc system while there was no statistical significance among the wc dc and rc systems fig s3 the highest sediment salinity was detected in the dc system 2 36 on average while the lowest was observed in the wc system averaged 1 21 however only the difference in topsoil layers between the dc and wc systems was significant p 0 05 sediment ph ranged between 8 47 and 8 49 being significantly higher in the topsoil layer in the wc system compared with that in the dc 8 28 and rc 8 41 systems p 0 05 sulfide contents varied from 0 11 to 2 23 µmol g 1 and were higher in the wc system than in the dc system ranging from 0 01 to 0 08 µmol g 1 sediment fe ii contents were significantly higher in the wc system 14 86 23 63 mmol kg 1 compared with those in the dc system 9 87 20 00 mmol kg 1 while fe iii contents were lower in the wc 26 90 30 74 mmol kg 1 than dc 24 46 42 07 mmol kg 1 systems p 0 05 compared with the uc system average nh4 content in the topsoil layer increased from 80 42 μmol n kg 1 in the dc system to 251 45 425 90 μmol n kg 1 in the rc and wc systems with the maximum occurring in the wc system by contrast the highest no3 content was detected in the topsoil layer of the dc system 158 65 μmol n kg 1 no2 contents remained relatively low 1 52 15 56 μmol n kg 1 in all sediment cores sediment toc and ch4 in pore water were similar among the uc wc dc and rc systems likewise there was no significant difference in average sue and sfda activities in the wc and dc systems relative to the uc system however both activities were significantly higher in the rc system p 0 05 3 2 effect of exposure and immersion on community composition of n damo microbes using the clone sequencing technique n damo bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure were investigated with a nested qpcr assay by targeting m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa and m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra genes respectively in total 95 100 n damo bacterial pmoa sequences and 28 44 n damo archaeal mcra sequences were retrieved during the alternate wetting drying cycle table s4 which were clustered into 14 and 24 otus based on 97 and 93 similarity cutoffs respectively taxonomic classification revealed a significant difference in n damo bacterial community composition after alternate drying wetting phylogenetic analysis showed that the total 14 otus of n damo bacteria could be assigned to three distinctive clusters which were most similar 88 0 95 2 to m oxyfera fp565575 and were 81 8 85 4 similar to candidatus methylomirabilis sinica kt443986 fig s4a cluster i was dominant in the sediments after reflooding accounting for over 69 of the total community showing 88 4 97 4 similarity to the sequences reported in estuarine and coastal sediment kx268954 and paddy field soil kf546908 sequences 100 were totally affiliated to cluster ii during the immersed event which was closely related to those obtained from river sediments kc503661 sharing 93 3 98 6 similarity in contrast the exposure event mainly formed cluster iii accounting for 98 showing relatively lower similarity 88 5 to m oxyfera but sequences in this cluster were affiliated closely 100 with those retrieved from paddy field soil kf546974 for the n damo archaea three distinct clusters clusters i ii and iii were formed based on the mcra phylogenetic tree fig s4e cluster i containing 15 of the 24 otus exhibited up to 90 0 similarity to m nitroreducens jmiy01000002 which accounted for 52 71 of the sequences cluster ii showed relatively high similarity 93 0 97 0 to candidatus methanoperedens sp lkcm01000102 sequences in this cluster accounted for similar proportion with 17 26 of clone libraries during the alternate wetting drying cycle cluster iii contained only three otus showing 91 0 94 0 similarity to candidatus methanoperedens sp which were affiliated closely up to 100 similarity with those retrieved from estuary sediments mk888491 alpha diversity of n damo bacteria and archaea was further evaluated table s4 it was consistent with the rarefaction analysis that the diversity of n damo archaea and bacteria in the reflooded regime was generally higher than the immersed regime based on the simpson and shannon wiener indexes fig s5a in comparison the diversity of n damo archaea was generally greater than that of n damo bacteria among all the sediment cores p 0 05 t test results of pcoa with bray curtis similarity metric showed that total n damo microbial community structures from each regime were generally distributed in different parts of the data space fig s5c indicating that the n damo associated microbial communities were strongly influenced by periodic immersion and exposure 3 3 effect of exposure and immersion on the abundance of n damo microbes quantification of n damo microbial functional genes revealed that wetting drying process significantly affected the pmoa and mcra abundances fig 2 the number of pmoa genes ranged from 6 7 107 to 3 8 108 copies g 1 in the wc system and were significantly higher than those in the dc 5 9 107 1 9 108 copies g 1 and rc 2 2 107 1 5 108 copies g 1 systems fig 2c numbers of pmoa genes increased markedly after rewetting the sediment from rc1 to rc2 and then sharply decreased after re drying in rc3 fig 2a the vertical distribution of pmoa gene numbers was characterized by a decreasing trend from the topsoil to subsoil in the wc system p 0 05 but changed slightly in both the dc and rc systems fig s6a unexpectedly with prolonged waterlogging time pmoa gene numbers decreased gradually in the wc system fig 2a p 0 05 similarly the archaeal mcra gene had the lowest numbers 3 9 105 1 0 106 copies g 1 in the dc system and the highest 4 4 105 2 6 106 copies g 1 in the wc system p 0 05 however under alternating exposure and inundation regimes mcra gene numbers decreased after rewetting the sediment from rc1 to rc2 fig 2b in contrast to m oxyfera like bacteria there was no significant difference in the number of m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene between the topsoil and subsoil among all systems fig s6b with prolonged immersion time the mcra gene number gradually decreased similar to the pmoa gene furthermore the numbers of m nitroreducens like archaea were generally two orders of magnitude lower than m oxyfera like bacteria in all sediment cores p 0 05 3 4 effect of exposure and immersion on n damo rates in agreement with the qpcr analysis the trends of corresponding n damo rates were markedly higher in the wc system in the range of 6 8 11 8 nmol 13co2 g 1 for nitrite damo and 5 5 12 5 nmol 13co2 g 1 for nitrate damo fig 3 p 0 05 in addition alternate wetting events increased the n damo rates initially from rc1 to rc2 and from rc3 to rc4 respectively in contrast alternate drying events reduced n damo rates from rc2 to rc3 in the rc system fig 3 a and b compared with those in the subsoil both nitrite and nitrate damo rates were higher in the topsoil among all systems but without statistical significance fig s6c and d we further evaluated the influences of biotic and abiotic variables on n damo microbial activities pearson s correlation analysis showed that the nitrate and nitrite damo rates correlated well with the corresponding mcra and pmoa gene abundances respectively table s5 p 0 05 meanwhile sem analysis provided a comprehensive view of the potential effects of environmental factors on n damo microbial activity figs 4 and s7 the nitrate damo rate was associated directly and positively with nutrient availability no3 while the nitrite damo rate was associated positively with fe iii content in the wc system fig 4a the nitrite damo rate correlated positively with toc and sediment moisture whereas salinity could indirectly influence the nitrate damo rate via reducing mcra abundance in the dc system fig 4b table s6 similarly in the rc system the nitrate damo rate correlated positively with sediment moisture and the sediment moisture could also indirectly influence the nitrite damo rate via controlling the nitrate damo rate fig 4c table s6 regression analysis indicated that sediment moisture correlated linearly and positively with n damo microbial abundance and associated activities fig s8 further suggesting that periodic immersion and exposure strongly affected n damo activities moreover significant correlations were observed between n damo rates and contents of reductive fe ii and s2 fig s9 the overall effects of alternating exposure and emersion on n damo activity and related influential factors in estuarine intertidal flats are summarized in fig 5 4 discussion microbially mediated n damo processes contribute to ch4 sink in estuarine and coastal habitats wang et al 2019 niu et al 2022 and have significantly shaped our knowledge on global c and n cycling recently zheng et al 2020 have evidenced that tidal inundation contributed to the divergence of the vertical distributions of n damo bacteria and archaea with n damo bacteria dominant at the soil tidal water and soil groundwater interfaces of sediment cores in the present study we further conducted a systematic investigation of the dynamics contribution and underlying mechanisms of the nitrite and nitrate damo bioprocesses under waterlogged desiccated and reflooded regimes this study verified significant changes in biotic and abiotic factors caused by periodic exposure and immersion leading to divergent responses of n damo activities in estuarine intertidal flats periodic tidal cycles significantly affected the community structures of n damo bacteria rather than n damo archaea which was in line with the previous results that n damo bacteria tend to inhabit heterogenous environments hu et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 suggesting that n damo archaea can become accustomed and less sensitive to the tidal cycle emery et al 2021 compared with sole exposure or immersion the reflooded regime leads to higher alpha diversity of n damo bacteria implying that n damo bacterial diversity is strongly affected by periodic tidal dynamics in estuarine intertidal flats however this disagreed with the results of wang et al 2016 who found lower diversity of n damo microbes in a reservoir s water level fluctuation zone the availability of c and n is considered primary factors for n damo microbial traits he et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 during alternate emersion and immersion intensive interactions between the yangtze river freshwater and seawater occur causing marked substrate exchange in the upper sediment layers cadier et al 2017 simultaneously the protected organic matter would decompose and release labile organic matter caused by the grinding of sediment structure via repeated wetting drying events increasing nutrients for microbial growth fierer and schimel 2002 miller et al 2005 kim et al 2012 as shown in table s2 higher sfda activity in the rc system supported the increased microbial activities and fast turnover of c following anoxic oxic transitions bhattacharyya et al 2012 hu et al 2020a huang et al 2021 moreover periodic tidal water pulses might add trace amounts of oxygen to the upper layers the formed oxygen minimum zones were reported to be a suitable environment for n damo microbes zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 therefore it is assumed that tidal cycles cause rhythmic material fluxes between the oxygenated tidal water and the surface intertidal sediments providing diverse micro environments for different n damo species zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the abundance of n damo bacterial pmoa gene up to 1 7 108 copies g 1 was higher than the maximum values reported in sediments of freshwater riverbeds 1 5 107 copies g 1 lakes 8 5 106 copies g 1 and paddy soils 1 0 108 copies g 1 wang et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 liu et al 2015 shen et al 2019 likewise n damo archaeal mcra gene abundance was one order of magnitude higher than that in freshwater river sediments vaksmaa et al 2017 and in the wide range of previously reported values in estuarine and coastal wetland sediments niu et al 2022 this suggested that n damo bacteria and archaea are abundant and symbiotically related in estuarine fluctuated environment wang et al 2019 however in contrast to the multiple reflooded induced enrichment of n damo microbial diversity individual waterlogging and desiccation events showed stronger constraints on the abundances of n damo microbes with remarkably highest numbers in the wc system the n damo bacterial and archaeal numbers correlated positively with sediment moisture demonstrating n damo microbial metabolic acceleration in saturated sediments ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 during tidal submergence oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere into the sediment is impeded pärn et al 2018 over saturated or submerged sediment water interfaces not only form a stable environment for n damo microbes but also promote substrate diffusion and exchange zhu et al 2018 further facilitating n damo metabolic activity notably extended wetting days gradually reduced n damo microbial abundances fig 2 we hypothesized that lower n damo microbe abundance could result from substrate depletion under continuous immersion yu et al 2014 sediment nh4 could be rapidly converted to no2 no3 by ammonia oxidizers zheng et al 2014 thereby increasing available n and facilitating n damo activity shen et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 nitrite damo bacterial abundance was found to correlate positively with nh4 content in natural environments chen et al 2021 however herein pmoa and mcra gene abundances correlated negatively with nh4 content fig 4 it was reported that prolonged immersion may exacerbate anoxia of sediments lyimo and mushi 2005 emery et al 2021 which was consistent with higher sulfide content under prolonged immersion table s2 this might in turn inhibit aerobic ammonia oxidizing microbial activities partly contributing nh4 n accumulation morillas et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 denitrifying microbes vice versa benefit from waterlogged conditions hou et al 2007 and in turn enhance the competition for no3 n no2 n with n damo microbes zhu et al 2018 further evidence for the environmental importance of tidal action in shaping the n damo community activities was revealed by the 13c isotope tracing experiment the activities of n damo bacteria and archaea were notably greater in the wc system especially in the topsoil layer similar responses of anaerobic methanotrophic activities were observed in periodically waterlogged grasslands and paddy fields angel et al 2012 ma et al 2013 the potential n damo activities were positively associated with no3 as confirmed by previous studies in which n damo microbial activities were significantly correlated to abundant reactive n zhang et al 2018 2020 in addition following wetting increased n damo activities might result from decreased oxygen diffusion and increased ch4 production via anaerobic methanogenic decomposition emery et al 2021 inundation could lead to decreasing redox level which was confirmed by the significantly higher contents of s2 and fe ii in wc compared with dc table s2 gao et al 2022 long et al 2022 the lower redox potential under waterlogged condition could further facilitate ch4 emission as a significant positive correlation was observed between ch4 flux and fe ii fe iii ratio fig s10 besides an increased proportion of archaeal methanogen genera methanothermobacter methanolobus and methanosaeta was observed in the wc system fig s11c and d which might contribute to higher production of ch4 ma et al 2012 and further provide constantly available ch4 to facilitate n damo microbial activities indeed positive correlations between n damo rates and the contents of fe ii and s2 were observed fig s9 potential n damo activities were lower and negatively associated with salinity in the dc system which supported the finding that the rates of ch4 oxidation by n damo microbes might be greater in the upstream freshwater and relatively low salinity habitats chen et al 2021 following drainage levels of water soluble salts increased in sediment porewater because of water evaporation rysgarrd et al 1999 under high salinity conditions microbial osmotic stress increases leading to cellular dehydration rath and rousk 2015 ho et al 2018 and damage to metabolic enzyme activities in the periplasm like nitrite reductase nir and methanol dehydrogenase mdh wu et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 the reduced co occurrence network of microbial communities after drying event fig s12 implied that sediment desiccation had severe consequences for microbial community structures and activities hueso et al 2012 nocker et al 2012 under the drying event no3 n no2 n contents were remarkably accumulated table s2 which implied that the availability of these nutrients was not the factor inhibiting n damo activity the retention of no3 n no2 n may result from the increasing aeration promoted nitrifiers but inhibited denitrifiers however desiccation obviously increased the proportion of methylobacterium methylorubrum fig s9a and b thereby accelerating metabolically aerobic methanotrophs to oxidize ch4 martinez cruz et al 2018 schindler et al 2020 despite the desiccation induced lower n damo potential the increase in the diffusion and availability of oxygen in sediment cores triggered a shift from anaerobic to aerobic methanotrophs partly enhancing ch4 consumption under wetting drying conditions the average ratio of n damo to anaerobic ch4 oxidation was up to 50 fig s13 implying that n damo has crucial roles in response to semi lunar tides in coastal wetlands when no3 and so4 2 coexist wang et al 2019 besides n damo activity potential re increased and then markedly decreased in the cycle of alternate inundation and exposure fig 3a and b further confirming the contrasting responses of n damo microbes to tidal dynamics shen et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 based on the metagenomic analysis liu et al 2021 found that m oxyfera can enter a viable but non culturable state to tolerate o2 stress that is m oxyfera adopts a metabolically quiescent state to enhance survival under harsh conditions thus n damo microbes retained their replicative potential when stress factors prolonged desiccation are removed liu et al 2021 reflecting the inherent resilience of n damo microbes to tidal inundation our results provided new evidence for the responses of n damo bacteria and archaea to tidal inundation and exposure fig 5 and demonstrated their environmental significance in global c and n cycling potential n elimination attributed to nitrite damo was roughly evaluated at 7 5 104 t n in waterlogged conditions and 2 4 104 t n in desiccated condition representing about 5 6 and 1 8 of the terrigenous inorganic n transported into the yangtze estuary respectively wu et al 2019 meanwhile approximately 17 1 18 1 and 5 7 6 6 of the average ch4 flux in china s coastal wetlands hu et al 2020b could be oxidized via n damo under immersion and exposure conditions respectively although larger data sets would provide support for the estimates presented here our conclusions are based on a unique set of simulated measurements which suggested that n damo assessments in estuarine intertidal ecosystems should consider the impact of tidal cycles 5 conclusions our current stimulation experiment highlighted that tidal cycle had evident changes in sediment biogeochemical properties as well as a clear spatiotemporal distribution of n damo microbes which were more prevailing during tidal submergence after rewetting sediments n damo potential re enhanced further confirming that moist was a major factor directly affecting n damo divergence n damo microbes have the ability to be rapidly recovered and or resilient after relieving drought related stress overall alternating exposure and inundation of intertidal flats caused by the semi lunar tidal cycle significantly mold the n damo process through divergent alterations of sediment biogeochemical properties and n damo microbial abundance but contributed to higher diversity of n damo microbes understanding the shifts in the denitrifying methanotrophs in coastal wetlands may help accurately forecast ch4 emission under

15204,nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo plays an important role in methane ch4 consumption in intertidal wetlands however little is known about the responses of n damo in intertidal wetlands to periodic drying wetting caused by tidal cycling here comparative experiments waterlogged desiccated reflooded with the yangtze estuarine intertidal sediments were performed to examine the effects of periodic tidal changes on n damo microbial communities abundances and potential activities functional gene sequencing indicated the coexistence of n damo bacteria and archaea in the tide fluctuating environments and generally higher biodiversity under reflooded conditions than consecutive inundation or emersion the n damo microbial abundance and associated activity varied significantly during alternative exposure and inundation with higher abundance and activity under the waterlogged than desiccated conditions reflooding of intertidal wetlands might intensify n damo activities indicating the resilience of n damo microbial metabolisms to the wetting drying events structural equation modeling and correlation analysis showed that n damo activity was highly related to n damo microbial abundance and substrate availability under inundation whereas salt accumulation in sediment was the primary factor restraining n damo activity under the desiccation overall this study reveals tidal induced shifts of n damo activity and associated contribution to mitigating ch4 which may help accurately project ch4 emission from intertidal wetlands under different tidal scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane anaerobic methane oxidation tidal cycle intertidal sediment nitrogen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the largest component of the terrestrial biological carbon c pool worldwide wetlands account for approximately 20 30 of total sequestered c mitsch and gosselink 2000 although wetlands generally have high potential for c burial belowground mcleod et al 2011 they also contribute 19 33 of the global terrestrial methane ch4 emission which is generated as the end product of anaerobic degradation of organic c kirschke et al 2013 saunois et al 2020 with a global warming potential of about 20 30 times that of carbon dioxide co2 on a 100 year perspective larger wetland ch4 emissions could trigger a positive feedback loop to further intensify global warming and ch4 release ipcc 2021 methanogens and methanotrophs primarily regulate biogenic ch4 emissions through determining ch4 production and oxidation activity conrad 2009 fan et al 2020 ch4 oxidation by aerobic and or anaerobic methanotrophs rather than ch4 production by methanogens generally controls the rate of ch4 emission in anoxic environments kits et al 2015 shen et al 2019 fan et al 2022 it has been documented that anaerobic methanotrophs could efficiently oxidize 200 tg of endogenous ch4 emission per year in anaerobic freshwater wetlands globally segarra et al 2015 martinez cruz et al 2018 and oxidize up to 300 tg ch4 per year in marine ecosystem hinrichs and boetius 2002 which makes anaerobic methane oxidation crucial for the global ch4 balance especially sulfate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation sulfate anmo is considered to dominate anaerobic ch4 oxidation in marine habitats mcglynn et al 2015 scheller et al 2016 however a novel microbial process nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is observed to be more chemically feasible and thermodynamically favorable in ch4 oxidation coupled with nitrite no2 nitrate no3 reduction in freshwater wetland ecosystems table s1 hu et al 2014 shen et al 2019 two distinct groups of anaerobic methanotrophs with a cooperative relationship were found to catalyze n damo wang et al 2019 the anme 2d archaeon candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens m nitroreducens performing nitrate dependent damo nitrate damo with no3 reduction to no2 raghoebarsing et al 2006 haroon et al 2013 and the nc10 bacterium candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera that is responsible for nitrite dependent damo nitrite damo with no2 completely reduction to nitrogen n2 ettwig et al 2010 hence these microorganisms contributed significantly to two major global nutrient cycles of carbon and nitrogen in natural environments wang et al 2019 shen et al 2020 compared with other natural wetlands estuarine and coastal wetlands are geographically squeezed zones between marine and terrestrial ecosystems that trap natural and anthropogenic pollutants canfield et al 2010 performing vital biogeochemical c and n reactions shiau and chiu 2020 the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and fossil fuels burning elser et al 2007 have caused overloading of reactive n in estuarine and coastal environments which could stimulate n damo microbial activity shen et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that n damo exerts a stronger control over ch4 flux than sulfate anmo in nitrogen enriched estuarine and coastal wetlands wang et al 2019 as a result estuarine and coastal environments are likely to represent an important niche harboring n damo microbes zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2020 niu et al 2022 understanding and modeling the controlling mechanisms for n damo have become a major research priority wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 nevertheless the research on n damo in natural environment is still limited so far the mechanisms of n damo in estuarine and coastal wetlands remain poorly understood because of limited experimental studies niu et al 2022 and their ch4 removal potential also remains to be explored estuarine intertidal flats are generally subjected to alternating exposure and immersion by periodic tidal cycles mikha et al 2005 hou et al 2007 chambers et al 2011 during inundation the sediments become an anaerobic environment conversely oxygen will permeate into the surface sediments and water loss occurs due to evaporation when sediments are exposed to the atmosphere which has substantial consequences on sediment physicochemical properties hou et al 2007 zheng et al 2016 cadier et al 2017 this succession of contradictory environmental conditions is evidenced to regulate the transformation of nutrients via changing the sediment physicochemical conditions hou et al 2007 emery et al 2021 therefore tidal cycle is hypothesized to affect the n damo characteristics which can be altered depending on the integrated influences of hydrological and sediment physicochemical parameters e g salinity ph dissolved oxygen temperature water table and redox conditions he et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 however previous studies only reflected the overall variation of n damo microbes that scale uniformly with environmental drivers mostly during inundation shen et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 niu et al 2022 to our knowledge few studies have investigated the response of n damo to the tidal inundation and exposure so far in particular it remains unclear if n damo responses to commonly studied drivers in consistent environments are transferable to fluctuated conditions where periodic tide strongly interacts and often dominates other factors modulating their effects on n damo microbial processes in addition increasing sea levels as a result of global climate changes will also expose estuarine intertidal sediments to more frequent and longer tidal inundations schuerch et al 2018 rising flooded events might trigger biological pulses or other transient changes in ch4 fluxes by controlling redox conditions and delivering nutrients or competing substrates for microbial processes ma et al 2013 cai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 emery et al 2021 moreover the extra heat from global warming is expected to increase the speed and intensity of drying during neap tide in intertidal wetlands trenberth et al 2014 further complicating predictions of ch4 dynamics in tidal wetlands to gain a better understanding of biogeochemical ch4 budgets in coastal wetlands quantifying the effects of periodic tides on n damo community dynamics and characterizing related drivers are thus needed here we investigated n damo microbial dynamics in response to experimentally simulated tidal cycles in intact sediment cores collected from intertidal flats of the yangtze estuary the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the variations of n damo microbial activity abundance and community structure under alternative drying wetting 2 to detangle the regulatory factors and potential mechanisms underlying the response of n damo to drying wetting alternation and 3 to estimate the contribution of n damo to ch4 attenuation and n elimination in coastal wetlands this study can provide a comprehensive understanding of the tidal effects on n damo bioprocess and give new insights into the potential effects of the intensifying tidal inundations on ch4 dynamics in coastal wetlands under the context of global climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the study site was located in chongming eastern tidal flat of the yangtze estuary china fig 1 a the yangtze estuary has a subtropical monsoon climate mean annual precipitation 1022 mm annual temperature 15 3 xu and zhao 2005 the study area can be seawards divided into the upper middle and lower tidal flats and characterized by clay sediments silt mixed with clay and silts with fine sands respectively in addition the native plant species phragmites communis and scripus triqueter dominate the upper and middle tidal flats respectively while the lower tidal flat has almost no vegetation the upper tidal flat is strongly influenced by the semi lunar alternating emersion and immersion and thus it was chosen as the experimental area in this study to avoid the influences of plant species and minimize errors caused by sediment spatial heterogeneity three 10 m 10 m plots in the vegetation free area were randomly located with an inter plot distance of 20 m it was previously found that n damo microbial activity was relatively higher in upper 0 10 cm depth zheng et al 2020 thus we collected 11 intact sediment cores 8 cm diameter 10 cm depth from each plot using perspex columns 30 cm length 8 cm diameter during the emersion stage additional near bottom seawater was collected using a plastic bucket from nearby marsh creeks during the sediment core collection all samples were transported to the laboratory within 4 6 h and stored at 4 for subsequent incubation experiments 2 2 experimental setup the collected sediment cores were assigned randomly to four treatments waterlogged core wc system desiccated core dc system reflooded core rc system and untreated core uc system control as previously described by hou et al 2007 fig 1b to investigate the effect of tidal immersion on n damo nine intact cores in the wc system were divided into three subgroups in triplicate wc1 wc2 and wc3 corresponding to immersion times of 5 10 and 15 days respectively to investigate the effect of tidal emersion on n damo process nine intact cores in the dc system were divided into three subgroups in triplicate dc1 dc2 and dc3 corresponding to emersion times of 10 20 and 30 days respectively finally to investigate the effect of re flooding on n damo process twelve intact cores in the rc system were subjected to two alternate wetting and drying cycles over one month following desiccation for 10 days and subsequent inundation for 5 days in one semi lunar tidal cycle these cores were divided into four subgroups in triplicate rc1 rc2 rc3 and rc4 corresponding to times of 10 15 25 and 30 days respectively herein the duration of waterlogging and desiccating respectively depended on the average immersion and emersion periods observed in the upper tidal flat during a semi lunar cycle hou et al 2007 sediment cores in each system were then transferred into four 20 l open top incubators and incubated at 25 under natural light dark cycles for wc and rc systems near bottom seawater was recirculated through pipes inserted along the edges of cores to achieve waterlogging and an air pump system maintained oxygen levels in the seawater of each incubator at the end of incubation the intact cores were quickly removed from the tank fig 1b and divided under helium atmosphere into two sections topsoil 0 5 cm depth and subsoil 5 10 cm depth layers subsequently each sample was further divided into two parts one for immediate determination of n damo rates and physicochemical parameters and the other stored at 20 for later molecular analyses 2 3 measurement of variables ch4 concentration was measured using the static sealed black box method in each sediment core at the end of incubation briefly at 0 15 30 and 45 mins after a tight fitting cap sealed the cores mu et al 2017 song et al 2018 a 50 ml plastic syringe was connected to a port stopcock installed in the box cap to extract gas samples in the headspace then 5 ml of gas was injected into a 5 ml pre evacuated vessel fitted with a butyl rubber stopper ch4 concentrations were quantified through a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan which was equipped with a flame ionization detector the flux of ch4 was estimated from linear regressions of ch4 concentration versus time in the present study r 2 of the regression equations was higher than 0 90 which can ensure the reliability of the estimated ch4 flux salinity and ph of sediments were determined respectively using a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi yellow springs instrument yellow springs oh usa and a ph meter mettler toledo greifensee switzerland at a solid water co2 free ratio of 1 2 5 hou et al 2013 water content

netherlands detection limits 0 1 µm for no2 no3 and 0 5 µm for nh4 sediment sulfide s2 and so4 2 contents were determined using an orion sure flow combination silver sulfide electrode thermo scientific waltham ma usa hou et al 2012 and an ion chromatograph segarra et al 2013 respectively sediment total fe and fe ii was determined using a 1 10 phenanthroline and 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride method after extracted from fresh sediment 0 5 g dry weight with 0 5 m anoxic hcl 30 ml wallmann et al 1993 haese et al 1997 fe iii was calculated by the difference between total fe and fe ii dissolved ch4 in sediment porewater was measured after fresh sediment was immersed by saturated nacl solution as described by winkel et al soil enzyme activities are sensitive indicators of microbial metabolic capacity therefore we also investigated the impact of the tidal cycle on enzyme synthesis soil urease sue urea hydrolysis was measured using the indophenol blue colorimetric method liu et al 2018 5 and 6 sulfofluorescein diacetate sfda an indicator of total microbial activities was measured by the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate 3 6 diacetylfluorescein fda method adam and duncan 2001 green et al 2006 all measured sediment physicochemical properties are given in table s2 2 4 measurement of n damo rates potential rates of n damo were measured with a 13c stable isotope method hu et al 2014 briefly 20 ml slurries containing 25 fresh sediments and 75 he degassed artificial seawater were prepared under a continuous flow of ultra high purity n2 99 99 airgas radnor pa usa and then transferred into sixteen 120 ml serum bottles all bottles were flushed with continuous n2 for 30 min and sealed using aluminum silicone rubber pads the slurries were pre incubated in the dark at near in situ sediment temperature 25 for at least 30 h to remove ambient nox no3 and no2 and oxygen o2 the bottles were subsequently split into four different treatment groups with three replicates 1 control 2 13ch4 99 9 13c sigma st louis mo usa 3 13ch4 no2 and 4 13ch4 no3 then 20 μl of he purged nano2 and nano3 stock solutions were injected into each bottle in the group 3 with 0 5 mm final no2 concentration and group 4 with 5 mm final no3 concentration respectively thereafter to achieve a final headspace 13ch4 concentration of approximately 1 v v 1 ml of 13ch4 was injected into each vial in groups 2 3 and 4 a control sample without any addition was also used to measure background 13co2 moreover to ensure anaerobic conditions before measurement of n damo rate dissolved oxygen was measured in four extra vials after pre incubation using an oxygen needle sensor ox n unisense aarhus denmark based on our previous study that 13co2 production increased linearly within 24 h of

bottles was measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific karlsruhe germany total n damo nitrite damo and nitrate damo rates were quantified as previously described zheng et al 2020 more detailed procedure information is given in the supporting information si 2 5 dna extraction and sequencing we accessed n damo microbial communities by

mixed and cloned using a topo ta cloning kit invitrogen waltham ma usa according to previously described protocols zheng et al 2020 table s3 positive clones were selected and sequenced on an abi 3730 genetic analyzer applied biosystems foster city ca usa using m13 primers after checking for chimeras the pmoa and mcra sequences were split into groups with a 97 and 93 similarity cutoff respectively and assigned to one operational taxonomic unit otu using mothur 1 35 1 software employing the furthest neighbor method aguilar et al 2016 mothur was also used to calculate the shannon wiener and simpson diversity index values and the chao1 richness estimates and to construct rarefaction curves for the pmoa and mcra libraries the sequences were compared with reference sequences deposited in genbank at ncbi using the basic local alignment search tool blast phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor joining algorithm in mega 7 0 kumar et al 2016 and the robustness of tree topology was tested using 1000 replicates in bootstrap analysis the clone sequences were deposited to ncbi genbank under the accession numbers of on597919 on598326 2 6 real time qpcr the relative abundances of n damo bacterial pmoa and archaeal mcra were determined using real time quantitative pcr qpcr assays performed using the abi 7500 sequence detection system applied biosystems mississauga canada with primer sets cmo182 cmo568 luesken et al 2011 and mcra159f mcra345r vaksmaa et al 2017 respectively standard curves were generated by amplifying serial dilutions of standard plasmids containing the targeted genes and displayed linear relationships between the log values of the gene copy numbers and calculated threshold cycles r 2 0 98 all runs were performed in triplicate with amplification efficiencies between 90 and 110 and r 2 values greater than 0 99 all runs included a negative control and melt curve analyses were performed to confirm the specificity of the targeted genes detailed information for the primers and qpcr protocols is shown in table s3 2 7 statistical analysis all data were analyzed statistically using spss 22 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa and origin 2020 originlab corporation northampton ma usa software statistical significance was determined at the p 0 05 level comparisons of sediment physicochemical properties and n damo microbial abundances and rates among all the systems were done using a one way analysis of variance anova followed by a least significant difference lsd test pearson s correlation was used to determine the correlations of environmental variables with n damo microbial abundances and rates principal component analysis pca was employed to determine sediment physicochemical properties structural equation modeling sem was performed to illustrate the causal paths of abiotic and biotic factors effects on n damo microbial abundances and rates in amos 17 amos development corporation crawfordville fl usa chi squared test and akaike information criterion were used to determine the model fit principal coordinate analysis pcoa of the n damo microbial communities was computed using the bray curtis distance canoco 5 0 software was used to analyze the correlations between environmental variables and the community structures of n damo microbes using redundancy analysis rda lai 2013 3 results 3 1 effect of exposure and immersion on sediment physicochemical characteristics distinct distribution of sediment biogeochemical properties was observed among the uc dc wc and rc systems table s2 fig s2 sediment cores in different systems were separated along principal component pc1 and the topsoil layers were further separated out along pc1 with the subsoil layer fig s2 moisture content increased significantly from 27 99 34 38 in the dc system to 36 68 46 03 in the wc system p 0 05 and was significantly higher in the topsoil than subsoil in these two systems table s2 compared with the uc system the ch4 flux of cores was significantly larger in the wc system while there was no statistical significance among the wc dc and rc systems fig s3 the highest sediment salinity was detected in the dc system 2 36 on average while the lowest was observed in the wc system averaged 1 21 however only the difference in topsoil layers between the dc and wc systems was significant p 0 05 sediment ph ranged between 8 47 and 8 49 being significantly higher in the topsoil layer in the wc system compared with that in the dc 8 28 and rc 8 41 systems p 0 05 sulfide contents varied from 0 11 to 2 23 µmol g 1 and were higher in the wc system than in the dc system ranging from 0 01 to 0 08 µmol g 1 sediment fe ii contents were significantly higher in the wc system 14 86 23 63 mmol kg 1 compared with those in the dc system 9 87 20 00 mmol kg 1 while fe iii contents were lower in the wc 26 90 30 74 mmol kg 1 than dc 24 46 42 07 mmol kg 1 systems p 0 05 compared with the uc system average nh4 content in the topsoil layer increased from 80 42 μmol n kg 1 in the dc system to 251 45 425 90 μmol n kg 1 in the rc and wc systems with the maximum occurring in the wc system by contrast the highest no3 content was detected in the topsoil layer of the dc system 158 65 μmol n kg 1 no2 contents remained relatively low 1 52 15 56 μmol n kg 1 in all sediment cores sediment toc and ch4 in pore water were similar among the uc wc dc and rc systems likewise there was no significant difference in average sue and sfda activities in the wc and dc systems relative to the uc system however both activities were significantly higher in the rc system p 0 05 3 2 effect of exposure and immersion on community composition of n damo microbes using the clone sequencing technique n damo bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure were investigated with a nested qpcr assay by targeting m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa and m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra genes respectively in total 95 100 n damo bacterial pmoa sequences and 28 44 n damo archaeal mcra sequences were retrieved during the alternate wetting drying cycle table s4 which were clustered into 14 and 24 otus based on 97 and 93 similarity cutoffs respectively taxonomic classification revealed a significant difference in n damo bacterial community composition after alternate drying wetting phylogenetic analysis showed that the total 14 otus of n damo bacteria could be assigned to three distinctive clusters which were most similar 88 0 95 2 to m oxyfera fp565575 and were 81 8 85 4 similar to candidatus methylomirabilis sinica kt443986 fig s4a cluster i was dominant in the sediments after reflooding accounting for over 69 of the total community showing 88 4 97 4 similarity to the sequences reported in estuarine and coastal sediment kx268954 and paddy field soil kf546908 sequences 100 were totally affiliated to cluster ii during the immersed event which was closely related to those obtained from river sediments kc503661 sharing 93 3 98 6 similarity in contrast the exposure event mainly formed cluster iii accounting for 98 showing relatively lower similarity 88 5 to m oxyfera but sequences in this cluster were affiliated closely 100 with those retrieved from paddy field soil kf546974 for the n damo archaea three distinct clusters clusters i ii and iii were formed based on the mcra phylogenetic tree fig s4e cluster i containing 15 of the 24 otus exhibited up to 90 0 similarity to m nitroreducens jmiy01000002 which accounted for 52 71 of the sequences cluster ii showed relatively high similarity 93 0 97 0 to candidatus methanoperedens sp lkcm01000102 sequences in this cluster accounted for similar proportion with 17 26 of clone libraries during the alternate wetting drying cycle cluster iii contained only three otus showing 91 0 94 0 similarity to candidatus methanoperedens sp which were affiliated closely up to 100 similarity with those retrieved from estuary sediments mk888491 alpha diversity of n damo bacteria and archaea was further evaluated table s4 it was consistent with the rarefaction analysis that the diversity of n damo archaea and bacteria in the reflooded regime was generally higher than the immersed regime based on the simpson and shannon wiener indexes fig s5a in comparison the diversity of n damo archaea was generally greater than that of n damo bacteria among all the sediment cores p 0 05 t test results of pcoa with bray curtis similarity metric showed that total n damo microbial community structures from each regime were generally distributed in different parts of the data space fig s5c indicating that the n damo associated microbial communities were strongly influenced by periodic immersion and exposure 3 3 effect of exposure and immersion on the abundance of n damo microbes quantification of n damo microbial functional genes revealed that wetting drying process significantly affected the pmoa and mcra abundances fig 2 the number of pmoa genes ranged from 6 7 107 to 3 8 108 copies g 1 in the wc system and were significantly higher than those in the dc 5 9 107 1 9 108 copies g 1 and rc 2 2 107 1 5 108 copies g 1 systems fig 2c numbers of pmoa genes increased markedly after rewetting the sediment from rc1 to rc2 and then sharply decreased after re drying in rc3 fig 2a the vertical distribution of pmoa gene numbers was characterized by a decreasing trend from the topsoil to subsoil in the wc system p 0 05 but changed slightly in both the dc and rc systems fig s6a unexpectedly with prolonged waterlogging time pmoa gene numbers decreased gradually in the wc system fig 2a p 0 05 similarly the archaeal mcra gene had the lowest numbers 3 9 105 1 0 106 copies g 1 in the dc system and the highest 4 4 105 2 6 106 copies g 1 in the wc system p 0 05 however under alternating exposure and inundation regimes mcra gene numbers decreased after rewetting the sediment from rc1 to rc2 fig 2b in contrast to m oxyfera like bacteria there was no significant difference in the number of m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene between the topsoil and subsoil among all systems fig s6b with prolonged immersion time the mcra gene number gradually decreased similar to the pmoa gene furthermore the numbers of m nitroreducens like archaea were generally two orders of magnitude lower than m oxyfera like bacteria in all sediment cores p 0 05 3 4 effect of exposure and immersion on n damo rates in agreement with the qpcr analysis the trends of corresponding n damo rates were markedly higher in the wc system in the range of 6 8 11 8 nmol 13co2 g 1 for nitrite damo and 5 5 12 5 nmol 13co2 g 1 for nitrate damo fig 3 p 0 05 in addition alternate wetting events increased the n damo rates initially from rc1 to rc2 and from rc3 to rc4 respectively in contrast alternate drying events reduced n damo rates from rc2 to rc3 in the rc system fig 3 a and b compared with those in the subsoil both nitrite and nitrate damo rates were higher in the topsoil among all systems but without statistical significance fig s6c and d we further evaluated the influences of biotic and abiotic variables on n damo microbial activities pearson s correlation analysis showed that the nitrate and nitrite damo rates correlated well with the corresponding mcra and pmoa gene abundances respectively table s5 p 0 05 meanwhile sem analysis provided a comprehensive view of the potential effects of environmental factors on n damo microbial activity figs 4 and s7 the nitrate damo rate was associated directly and positively with nutrient availability no3 while the nitrite damo rate was associated positively with fe iii content in the wc system fig 4a the nitrite damo rate correlated positively with toc and sediment moisture whereas salinity could indirectly influence the nitrate damo rate via reducing mcra abundance in the dc system fig 4b table s6 similarly in the rc system the nitrate damo rate correlated positively with sediment moisture and the sediment moisture could also indirectly influence the nitrite damo rate via controlling the nitrate damo rate fig 4c table s6 regression analysis indicated that sediment moisture correlated linearly and positively with n damo microbial abundance and associated activities fig s8 further suggesting that periodic immersion and exposure strongly affected n damo activities moreover significant correlations were observed between n damo rates and contents of reductive fe ii and s2 fig s9 the overall effects of alternating exposure and emersion on n damo activity and related influential factors in estuarine intertidal flats are summarized in fig 5 4 discussion microbially mediated n damo processes contribute to ch4 sink in estuarine and coastal habitats wang et al 2019 niu et al 2022 and have significantly shaped our knowledge on global c and n cycling recently zheng et al 2020 have evidenced that tidal inundation contributed to the divergence of the vertical distributions of n damo bacteria and archaea with n damo bacteria dominant at the soil tidal water and soil groundwater interfaces of sediment cores in the present study we further conducted a systematic investigation of the dynamics contribution and underlying mechanisms of the nitrite and nitrate damo bioprocesses under waterlogged desiccated and reflooded regimes this study verified significant changes in biotic and abiotic factors caused by periodic exposure and immersion leading to divergent responses of n damo activities in estuarine intertidal flats periodic tidal cycles significantly affected the community structures of n damo bacteria rather than n damo archaea which was in line with the previous results that n damo bacteria tend to inhabit heterogenous environments hu et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 suggesting that n damo archaea can become accustomed and less sensitive to the tidal cycle emery et al 2021 compared with sole exposure or immersion the reflooded regime leads to higher alpha diversity of n damo bacteria implying that n damo bacterial diversity is strongly affected by periodic tidal dynamics in estuarine intertidal flats however this disagreed with the results of wang et al 2016 who found lower diversity of n damo microbes in a reservoir s water level fluctuation zone the availability of c and n is considered primary factors for n damo microbial traits he et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 during alternate emersion and immersion intensive interactions between the yangtze river freshwater and seawater occur causing marked substrate exchange in the upper sediment layers cadier et al 2017 simultaneously the protected organic matter would decompose and release labile organic matter caused by the grinding of sediment structure via repeated wetting drying events increasing nutrients for microbial growth fierer and schimel 2002 miller et al 2005 kim et al 2012 as shown in table s2 higher sfda activity in the rc system supported the increased microbial activities and fast turnover of c following anoxic oxic transitions bhattacharyya et al 2012 hu et al 2020a huang et al 2021 moreover periodic tidal water pulses might add trace amounts of oxygen to the upper layers the formed oxygen minimum zones were reported to be a suitable environment for n damo microbes zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 therefore it is assumed that tidal cycles cause rhythmic material fluxes between the oxygenated tidal water and the surface intertidal sediments providing diverse micro environments for different n damo species zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the abundance of n damo bacterial pmoa gene up to 1 7 108 copies g 1 was higher than the maximum values reported in sediments of freshwater riverbeds 1 5 107 copies g 1 lakes 8 5 106 copies g 1 and paddy soils 1 0 108 copies g 1 wang et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 liu et al 2015 shen et al 2019 likewise n damo archaeal mcra gene abundance was one order of magnitude higher than that in freshwater river sediments vaksmaa et al 2017 and in the wide range of previously reported values in estuarine and coastal wetland sediments niu et al 2022 this suggested that n damo bacteria and archaea are abundant and symbiotically related in estuarine fluctuated environment wang et al 2019 however in contrast to the multiple reflooded induced enrichment of n damo microbial diversity individual waterlogging and desiccation events showed stronger constraints on the abundances of n damo microbes with remarkably highest numbers in the wc system the n damo bacterial and archaeal numbers correlated positively with sediment moisture demonstrating n damo microbial metabolic acceleration in saturated sediments ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 during tidal submergence oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere into the sediment is impeded pärn et al 2018 over saturated or submerged sediment water interfaces not only form a stable environment for n damo microbes but also promote substrate diffusion and exchange zhu et al 2018 further facilitating n damo metabolic activity notably extended wetting days gradually reduced n damo microbial abundances fig 2 we hypothesized that lower n damo microbe abundance could result from substrate depletion under continuous immersion yu et al 2014 sediment nh4 could be rapidly converted to no2 no3 by ammonia oxidizers zheng et al 2014 thereby increasing available n and facilitating n damo activity shen et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 nitrite damo bacterial abundance was found to correlate positively with nh4 content in natural environments chen et al 2021 however herein pmoa and mcra gene abundances correlated negatively with nh4 content fig 4 it was reported that prolonged immersion may exacerbate anoxia of sediments lyimo and mushi 2005 emery et al 2021 which was consistent with higher sulfide content under prolonged immersion table s2 this might in turn inhibit aerobic ammonia oxidizing microbial activities partly contributing nh4 n accumulation morillas et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 denitrifying microbes vice versa benefit from waterlogged conditions hou et al 2007 and in turn enhance the competition for no3 n no2 n with n damo microbes zhu et al 2018 further evidence for the environmental importance of tidal action in shaping the n damo community activities was revealed by the 13c isotope tracing experiment the activities of n damo bacteria and archaea were notably greater in the wc system especially in the topsoil layer similar responses of anaerobic methanotrophic activities were observed in periodically waterlogged grasslands and paddy fields angel et al 2012 ma et al 2013 the potential n damo activities were positively associated with no3 as confirmed by previous studies in which n damo microbial activities were significantly correlated to abundant reactive n zhang et al 2018 2020 in addition following wetting increased n damo activities might result from decreased oxygen diffusion and increased ch4 production via anaerobic methanogenic decomposition emery et al 2021 inundation could lead to decreasing redox level which was confirmed by the significantly higher contents of s2 and fe ii in wc compared with dc table s2 gao et al 2022 long et al 2022 the lower redox potential under waterlogged condition could further facilitate ch4 emission as a significant positive correlation was observed between ch4 flux and fe ii fe iii ratio fig s10 besides an increased proportion of archaeal methanogen genera methanothermobacter methanolobus and methanosaeta was observed in the wc system fig s11c and d which might contribute to higher production of ch4 ma et al 2012 and further provide constantly available ch4 to facilitate n damo microbial activities indeed positive correlations between n damo rates and the contents of fe ii and s2 were observed fig s9 potential n damo activities were lower and negatively associated with salinity in the dc system which supported the finding that the rates of ch4 oxidation by n damo microbes might be greater in the upstream freshwater and relatively low salinity habitats chen et al 2021 following drainage levels of water soluble salts increased in sediment porewater because of water evaporation rysgarrd et al 1999 under high salinity conditions microbial osmotic stress increases leading to cellular dehydration rath and rousk 2015 ho et al 2018 and damage to metabolic enzyme activities in the periplasm like nitrite reductase nir and methanol dehydrogenase mdh wu et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 the reduced co occurrence network of microbial communities after drying event fig s12 implied that sediment desiccation had severe consequences for microbial community structures and activities hueso et al 2012 nocker et al 2012 under the drying event no3 n no2 n contents were remarkably accumulated table s2 which implied that the availability of these nutrients was not the factor inhibiting n damo activity the retention of no3 n no2 n may result from the increasing aeration promoted nitrifiers but inhibited denitrifiers however desiccation obviously increased the proportion of methylobacterium methylorubrum fig s9a and b thereby accelerating metabolically aerobic methanotrophs to oxidize ch4 martinez cruz et al 2018 schindler et al 2020 despite the desiccation induced lower n damo potential the increase in the diffusion and availability of oxygen in sediment cores triggered a shift from anaerobic to aerobic methanotrophs partly enhancing ch4 consumption under wetting drying conditions the average ratio of n damo to anaerobic ch4 oxidation was up to 50 fig s13 implying that n damo has crucial roles in response to semi lunar tides in coastal wetlands when no3 and so4 2 coexist wang et al 2019 besides n damo activity potential re increased and then markedly decreased in the cycle of alternate inundation and exposure fig 3a and b further confirming the contrasting responses of n damo microbes to tidal dynamics shen et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 based on the metagenomic analysis liu et al 2021 found that m oxyfera can enter a viable but non culturable state to tolerate o2 stress that is m oxyfera adopts a metabolically quiescent state to enhance survival under harsh conditions thus n damo microbes retained their replicative potential when stress factors prolonged desiccation are removed liu et al 2021 reflecting the inherent resilience of n damo microbes to tidal inundation our results provided new evidence for the responses of n damo bacteria and archaea to tidal inundation and exposure fig 5 and demonstrated their environmental significance in global c and n cycling potential n elimination attributed to nitrite damo was roughly evaluated at 7 5 104 t n in waterlogged conditions and 2 4 104 t n in desiccated condition representing about 5 6 and 1 8 of the terrigenous inorganic n transported into the yangtze estuary respectively wu et al 2019 meanwhile approximately 17 1 18 1 and 5 7 6 6 of the average ch4 flux in china s coastal wetlands hu et al 2020b could be oxidized via n damo under immersion and exposure conditions respectively although larger data sets would provide support for the estimates presented here our conclusions are based on a unique set of simulated measurements which suggested that n damo assessments in estuarine intertidal ecosystems should consider the impact of tidal cycles 5 conclusions our current stimulation experiment highlighted that tidal cycle had evident changes in sediment biogeochemical properties as well as a clear spatiotemporal distribution of n damo microbes which were more prevailing during tidal submergence after rewetting sediments n damo potential re enhanced further confirming that moist was a major factor directly affecting n damo divergence n damo microbes have the ability to be rapidly recovered and or resilient after relieving drought related stress overall alternating exposure and inundation of intertidal flats caused by the semi lunar tidal cycle significantly mold the n damo process through divergent alterations of sediment biogeochemical properties and n damo microbial abundance but contributed to higher diversity of n damo microbes understanding the shifts in the denitrifying methanotrophs in coastal wetlands may help accurately forecast ch4 emission under different tidal scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence
