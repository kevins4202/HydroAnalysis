4565,over the past few decades the nu river watershed nrw which originates in the qinghai tibet plateau and covers an area of 113 414 km2 has experienced increased streamflow temperatures and precipitation along with cryospheric degradation to determine the mechanism of increase of the observed streamflow composition a distributed hydrological model wep c was developed to investigate the streamflow composition and its changes in the nrw from 1979 to 2019 during this period glaciers snowmelt permafrost groundwater and precipitation accounted for 3 2 13 4 0 8 10 4 and 72 2 of the nrw streamflow respectively the streamflow of the watershed increased at a rate of 1 36 mm year among the contribution rates to the increase of streamflow glaciers increased at a rate of 0 28 mm year and snowmelt decreased at a rate of 0 53 mm year additionally permafrost meltwater groundwater and precipitation increased at a rate of 0 03 mm year 0 60 mm year and 0 98 mm year respectively thus this study provides an understanding of the composition and change of streamflow in the qinghai tibet plateau and similar watersheds wherein the cryosphere plays an important part in the hydrological cycle keywords wep c hydrological model streamflow composition climate change nu river watershed 1 introduction the cryosphere refers to the portion of the surface water of earth that exists in solid form which includes all types of ice and snow wu et al 2016 and is the most sensitive layer to global climate change immerzeel et al 2010 owing to its high sensitivity toward climate change the cryosphere and liquid hydrosphere forms a reciprocal relationship with increase in temperatures due to climate change most of the glacial snow shrinks and the permafrost layer thins down resulting in significant changes in the water cycle koven et al 2013 radić and hock 2014 the melting water from the cryosphere changes the salinity and temperature of the ocean which affects the global thermohaline circulation process and contributes to climate change schmittner 2002 in addition the change in the cryosphere has a significant impact on the high and mid latitude watersheds which are recharged by the melting of the cryosphere during the interglacial process of dansgaard oeschger events the solid liquid water underwent a significant change in time of advance and retreat burns 2003 this change closely links the atmosphere ocean land and ecosystem through the phase transition process of the solid liquid water cycle and transforms into one of the key factors in the process of climate change cimatoribus et al 2013 the hydrological impact of the cryosphere on the global and regional water cycle is not only related to changes in the global hydrosphere but also has an increasingly significant impact on regional sustainable development these variations have considerable impacts on water security food safety production and social and economic development therefore water managers must understand the changes in the cryosphere and acknowledge the possibility of the disappearance of the cryosphere under the continuous influence of climate warming al jawad et al 2019 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is an alpine region with complex geomorphology and water sources with an intricate water circulation system wang et al 2009 a significant warm and humid air current from the ocean is observed on the southern side of the qtp along with abnormally strong convection in the middle and eastern side of the plateau which constitutes a special water cycle process in the active east asian monsoon area thus it is a region that is particularly sensitive to climate change pithan 2010 the typical topography of the qtp along with its alpine climate results in the widespread distribution of glacial snow and permafrost on the plateau which accounts for a large proportion of its total water resources ran et al 2018 over the past 40 years there is a decrease in both snow depth and snow days on the qtp fan et al 2015 climate change significantly affects the temporal and spatial processes of water and energy cycles causing the melting of surface ice and snow and impacting the freeze thaw process of soil moisture wu et al 2010 the freezing of soil moisture affects surface infiltration soil moisture movement and evapotranspiration benettin et al 2018 wang et al 2009 furthermore the ice and snow ablation process causes temporal changes in streamflow generation and confluence and strengthens evapotranspiration affecting the spatial and temporal processes of water circulation back et al 2013 ramanathan 2001 however limited research has been conducted on this topic the distributed hydrological model dhm is the most frequently used method for streamflow simulations panday and huyakorn 2004 the dhm determined the water balance through a series of nested equations and simulates the spatiotemporal changes in the water balance components wang et al 2020 however traditional dhms primarily focus on the simulation of the gravity driven water cycle process while ignoring the various microscopic forces in the soil medium hindering effective water cycle simulation in alpine areas wang et al 2020 wang and xue 2013 due to harsh natural conditions of the qtp it is difficult to carry out routine field observations thus numerical simulation and satellite data which provides corresponding verification data for the model are integrated in order to better understand the plateau s glaciers snow permafrost rivers lakes groundwater coupling processes gao et al 2018 at present utilization of the dhm to calculate the cryospheric streamflow consists of two forms 1 embedding the cryospheric module into the existing dhm to compensate for the shortcomings of the original model in describing the cryospheric streamflow process or 2 developing a new cryosphere hydrological model ran et al 2018 in recent years an increasing number of studies have been conducted on the cryosphere using hydrological models researchers have improved the typical water cycle simulation methods within the traditional hydrological models these include the degree day factor method and the hydrothermal coupling method to simulate ice and snow meltwater and the soil freeze thaw process respectively jia et al 2006 wang and xue 2013 however although some water cycle simulations provide results for specific water bodies they lack systematic physical mechanisms of water and energy circulation unable to adequately simulate the cryosphere water cycle based on the theory of glacier mass balance li et al 2020b proposed a glacier evolution scheme and precipitation runoff model that integrates the processes of glacier melting sublimation evaporation and accumulation gao et al 2018 introduced a permafrost module based on a dhm and conducted a streamflow simulation on the upper heihe basin in the northeastern qtp indicating that the permafrost area shrank by 8 8 from 1971 to 2013 however their research solely focused on the response of one type of water body to climate change and did not consider the impact of other water bodies this would lead to inaccurate estimates of the water balance of the watershed the melting of the cryosphere and its contribution to streamflow thus to provide a basis for predicting glacial permafrost and snowmelt streamflow due to changing climate we developed a distributed hydrological model known as the wep c to simulate the characteristics of rivers in alpine regions the primary purpose of this study was to utilize the model to 1 simulate the streamflow in the cryosphere of the watershed 2 partition the streamflow composition and 3 calculate the possible causes of streamflow changes over the past 40 years 2 methods and data in the vertical structure of the wep c model fig s1a rainfall and snowfall were identified by the precipitation phase identification module and the corresponding snow cover area was calculated according to the surface depth of the snow liu et al 2018 table s1 lists the methods implemented for the principal modules of the model based on the various underlying surface conditions the model selects the corresponding parameterized module to calculate the surface water heat energy including canopy interception depression storage surface infiltration evapotranspiration along with ice and snow sublimation and melting jia et al 2005 the soil moisture permafrost depth and energy transport were simulated based on the surface soil moisture flux boundary and ground temperature boundary furthermore the water exchange between the surface layer and the groundwater was estimated based on the water balance of the soil layer in the horizontal structure of the wep c model fig s1b the smallest calculation unit was the hydrological response unit hru yang et al 2019 2020a the subwatersheds were divided into several hrus according to the elevation of the watershed and various underlying conditions of the different land use types soil type and soil thickness of the watershed in the model simulation each hru was directly merged into the subwatershed channel using a virtual channel based on the quantitative relationship between the subwatershed area and its channel length the corresponding virtual channel length could be obtained by calculating the area of the hru due to the complex spatial distribution of the hrus the water transfer between the hrus within the subwatershed was not considered in the model and each hru directly exchanged water with the subwatershed river channel fig s2 2 1 case study the nu river watershed nrw originates in the southern foothills of the tanggula mountains on the qtp flows through the tibet autonomous region and yunnan province within china and finally empties into the andaman sea of the indian ocean weng et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the nu river supports agricultural irrigation urban and rural water supply in the watershed along with the religious activities of some tibetan residents wang and chen 2017 the area of the nrw above the daojieba hydrological station is 113 414 km2 with a river length of 1 842 5 km and elevations ranging from 641 to 6491 m fig 1 from 1979 to 2019 the average annual precipitation was 653 mm with a rate of increase of 0 98 mm year the average annual air temperature was 4 6 c with a rate of increase of 0 049 c year the maximum observed air temperature during this period was 30 8 c whereas the minimum air temperature was 29 2 c the main land use type in the watershed is meadow which accounts for 62 3 of the total land use in 2014 the area of glaciers in the watershed is about 1816 km2 and is concentrated in the middle and upper reaches of the watershed the soil types in the watershed are alpine meadow grassland and sub alpine meadow soils seasonal permafrost and permafrost are widely distributed in the watershed the types of groundwater in the nrw include water frozen in bedrock water in bedrock fissures water associated with carbonate caves pore water in clastic rocks water in fissures of layered sedimentary rocks water frozen in unconsolidated sediments and pore water in unconsolidated sediments multiple water sources contribute to the complexity and seasonal variation of the nrw streamflow composition 2 2 soil moisture and heat coupling module the model uses the vertical one dimensional richards equation with the phase change term to couple the heat flow equation and incorporates the soil moisture movement by increasing the source and sink terms hayek

period and obtain the soil temperature of each layer in the current period 5 repeat the above steps until the maximum values of soil moisture and temperature difference calculated twice meets the given error threshold 2 3 ice and snow ablation module based on the energy and mass conservation of the ice and snow area the model first calculates the latent heat of the phase change of the ice and snow covered area to obtain the ice and snowmelt amount and then calculates the ice and snow storage variables using mass conservation gong et al 2010 han et al 2011 as follows 9 m i q v s ice ρ w l i

use multi criteria glue as the method of multi objective optimization and model uncertainty evaluation the multi objective glue method evaluates model uncertainty based on the extension of a single objective glue jia and culver 2008 the likelihood function is an important indicator for evaluating the quality of the hydrological process simulation the likelihood function in a single objective is considered as the objective function and a multi objective function is used to express the relationship between the likelihood degrees to form a multi objective likelihood function the specific process of glue for uncertainty analysis can be found in beven and binley 1992 the nash efficiency coefficient nash and the certainty coefficient r2 were selected as the likelihood functions to describe the hydrological process from different aspects the evaluation indicators are as follows 1 nash efficiency coefficient 13 n a s h 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o i is the observed data q s i is the modeled data over the i th period and q o is the average observed data over n periods here the modeling accuracy increases as the nash index approaches a value of 1 2

study combined the water cycle multi process observation data to verify the model systematically based on the characteristics of the observation data we considered soil moisture surface snow cover glacier inventory permafrost depth and streamflow as the optimization targets for parameter calibration and validation to calibrate and verify the wep c the data pertaining to the nrw used in the modeling are listed in table 1 these data include a digital elevation model dem for 2003 soil thickness and type for 2000 spatially distributed land use data for 1980 1995 2005 2010 and 2014 daily precipitation air temperature surface temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration were obtained for the period 1979 2019 from 22 meteorological stations the dem was used to divide the subwatersheds and hrus obtain channel information and calculate the slope the watershed consists of many types of soils as well as large differences in soil spatial distribution thus the related physical and chemical parameters are difficult to obtain accurately during the modeling process the soil was reclassified into four types sandy sandy loam loam and clay loam soils jia et al 2006 the land use data in the model were obtained from the institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research of the chinese academy of sciences and were reclassified as water glacier and snow forest grassland bare land cultivated land and residential land the soil moisture observation data were provided by the institute of tibetan plateau research resolution 0 1 table 2 the data monitoring soil profile included a total of four soil depths below the surface at 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm from august 2010 to december 2013 the snow thickness data was implemented from the china snow depth long time series dataset 1979 2014 resolution 0 25 provided by the cold and arid region scientific data center table 2 the glacier cataloging process is complex and the time span involved is lengthy the basic data used for the nrw during the two glacier cataloging processes were the aerial survey topographic maps from the 1980s and landsat tm etm remote sensing images from 2004 to 2011 guo et al 2015 permafrost depth and streamflow data was incorporated from meteorological stations and hydrological stations streamflow calibration and verification were conducted according to the observed monthly streamflow at the dasa 1983 1995 jiayuqiao 1980 2008 and daojieba 1979 2000 hydrological stations and the daily flood season streamflow at the jiayuqiao hydrological station 1993 2000 table 2 the respective model calibration and model verification periods adopted for the hydrological stations were 1983 1991 and 1992 1995 for dasa 1980 2002 and 2003 2008 for jiayuqiao and 1979 1993 and 1994 2000 for daojieba 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation in fig s2 the scattered points display the solution when nash 0 50 and r2 0 70 are used as thresholds for calibration when cr 53 14 and sh 74 38 in the model fig s2 black dot the simulation effect was the best and the uncertainty was the lowest table s2 3 1 1 snow depth calibration for the monthly snow depth simulation results of the watershed the nash and r2 coefficients were 0 62 and 0 83 respectively fig 2 compared with the satellite based data the average simulation snow depth was 1 55 mm less the model was found to be sensitive to the simulation of heavy snowfall but was generally effective for the simulation of light snowfall overall the results revealed that the snow simulation could characterize the watershed changes in snowfall and snow depth for each year of the study period 3 1 2 glacier melting process calibration the results of the two glacier surveys in the watershed were for the periods 1980 1990 and 2004 2011 and they were used to verify the simulated watershed glacier melting process fig 3 the results indicated that the glacier reduction rate between the two glacier surveys was 17 8 km3 while the simulated annual average glacier melting rate was 16 3 km3 the simulated glacier inventory rate was slightly lower but the overall difference was not significant overall the simulation results were in good agreement with china s two glacier cataloging results 3 1 3 soil moisture and permafrost calibration from the daily soil moisture simulation results of the subwatersheds of the nagqu station obvious differences were observed for each layer table 3 and fig 4 compared with the observed data the fluctuations of the simulated soil moisture were minor there was a certain hysteresis in the simulated soil moisture movement and the differences in the deeper soil were more obvious overall it was found that the soil moisture simulation results could characterize the temporal changes in soil moisture in each layer of the watershed the simulation results of the monthly average permafrost depths of the meteorological stations revealed that the permafrost depths of the nagqu fig 5 a suoxian fig 5b dingqing fig 5c and luolong fig 5d stations in the watershed gradually decreased the accuracy of the suoxian and dingqing simulation results were good the simulated permafrost depths of nagqu and luolong were greater than the observed data table 4 this may be due to the inconsistency between the surface soil type and the deep soil type resulting in changes in the soil parameters the results indicate that the simulation results of the permafrost depth were good although the annual fluctuation degree of the hydrological model simulation results was less than the observed value 3 1 4 streamflow the daily streamflow simulation results at the jiayuqiao hydrological station during the flood season revealed that the nash coefficients of the daily streamflow for calibration and validation were 0 71 and 0 77 respectively indicating proper simulation of the extreme daily precipitation process in summer table 5 the verification results of monthly streamflow at the nagqu jiayuqiao and daojieba hydrological stations indicated that the monthly streamflow simulation results were all above 0 79 with the simulation results of the downstream stations being better than those of the upstream stations fig 6 3 2 annual streamflow composition changes the phase identification of precipitation demonstrated that rainfall and snowfall accounted for 90 and 10 respectively and snowfall was concentrated from october to may the annual evapotranspiration and infiltration were 267 mm year and 140 mm year respectively and were concentrated in summer fig 7a b from 1979 to 2019 glaciers snowmelt permafrost groundwater and precipitation accounted for 3 2 13 4 0 8 10 4 and 72 2 of the streamflow in the watershed respectively hence precipitation is a significant part of the streamflow in summer precipitation accounted for 90 of the streamflow while snowmelt glaciers and groundwater accounted for 50 of the streamflow from november to april occupying a dominant position fig 7c d water balance analysis revealed that the annual average water storage in the nrw decreased at a rate of 38 mm year over the study period fig 7e in the watershed for elevations 5000 m the proportions of groundwater permafrost water glacier water and snowmelt water in the streamflow increased with elevation whereas for elevations 5000 m these features decreased with increasing elevation fig 7f this was primarily due to the low temperatures above 5000 m where the melting of the cryosphere is not obvious 3 3 annual changes in streamflow composition fig 8 a displays the simulated 1979 2019 streamflow time series in the nrw which exhibited an increase rate of 1 36 mm year fig 8b shows the streamflow composition contribution rate from 1979 to 2019 in which precipitation increased at the rate of 0 98 mm year accounting for 72 1 of the change rate and snowmelt decreased at the rate of 0 53 mm year accounting for 39 0 of the change rate in the case of increased precipitation snowmelt displayed a decreasing trend indicating an increase in the proportion of precipitation shifting to rainfall rather than snowfall as the temperatures rose glaciers increased at the rate of 0 28 mm year accounting for 20 6 of the change rate groundwater increased at the rate of 0 60 mm year accounting for 44 1 of the change rate and permafrost water melted at the rate of 0 03 mm year accounting for 2 8 of the change rate the contribution of rainfall to the total streamflow reached its minimum value of 65 02 in 1984 and then rose to its maximum of 85 6 in 2018 in 1994 the contribution of glacial melting to the total streamflow reached its maximum of 4 3 which was 2 7 higher than the 2018 minimum similar to the melting characteristics of glaciers the contribution of snowmelt to the total streamflow fell to a minimum of 6 0 in 2018 a decrease of 11 0 from its 1994 maximum the contribution of permafrost water to the total streamflow reduced to a minimum of 0 04 in 2017 which was 2 56 less than the 1997 maximum the contribution of groundwater to the total streamflow fell to a minimum of 5 5 in 2016 which was 12 5 less than the maximum value in 1984 these results indicate that the increase in precipitation was the primary reason for the increase in total streamflow while the increases in glacial melting snowmelt and groundwater also provided significant contributions 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with the previous similar studies the model simulations in the present study indicated that increased precipitation led to increased streamflow in nrw this result was consistent with the conclusions previously obtained by zhang et al 2013 and wang and chen 2017 based on a land surface model and observed data on the upper nu river however these investigations focused primarily on the impact of precipitation on streamflow ignoring the effects of the cryosphere and groundwater the present study found that glaciers snowmelt permafrost and groundwater accounted for 3 2 13 4 0 8 and 10 4 of the streamflow respectively indicating that these features also comprise an important part of streamflow composition this study also demonstrated that climate change has led to increases in groundwater storage and decreases in ice and snow water storage in the nrw this is consistent with the study by luo et al 2020 wherein the special sensor microwave imager was utilized to observe the relationship between permafrost changes and groundwater storage and that by xiang et al 2016 wherein grace satellite gravity data was applied to reveal that the increase in groundwater was related to the streamflow replenishment caused by the increase in ice snow permafrost melt and precipitation in the watershed unlike other studies this investigation used multi source data to verify the reliability of the model and analyzed both the streamflow composition and its spatiotemporal changes 4 2 model uncertainty owing to the complexity of the dhm the uncertainty of the overall quantitative model is problematic montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 there are two primary uncertainties in the simulation of this model the uncertainty in the simulation of the energy balance of the land surface and the uncertainty of the data input due to the complex terrain of the qtp the solar radiation differences between shady and sunny slopes lead to different snowmelt vegetation coverage and soil moisture distributions pomeroy et al 2003 which are closely related to cryosphere degradation and soil thermal properties geothermal flow initial ground temperature and permafrost conditions additionally failure to consider lateral heat flux may lead to an underestimation of the development and melting rate of the cryosphere gao et al 2018 for example as a result of the difference in active layer thickness and temperature difference between ridges and valleys lateral advection heat flux may increase the melting of permafrost in areas with high groundwater velocity this portion of the uncertainty may lead to further uncertainty in the simulation of the surface energy balance thus introducing uncertainty in the estimation of ice and snow cover water as well as soil heat flux furthermore the sparse weather stations in the nrw and the short observation series directly affect the simulation accuracy of the water cycle process in the watershed mazzoleni et al 2017 the current study implemented multiple factors such as streamflow soil moisture permafrost depth and snow to verify the model but these data exhibited significant spatial and temporal differences the spatiotemporal inconsistencies in the data significantly affected the reliability of the verification results the time series of the daily and monthly streamflow data were inconsistent and the soil moisture monitoring stations were distributed in the upstream area 4 3 meteorological elements and cryosphere degradation owing to the small population and the lack of large reservoirs in the nrw the contribution of human activities to streamflow change is low yang et al 2020b in addition meteorological factors are the primary factors affecting the water cycle the changes in meteorological elements primarily include precipitation air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed the correlation between the annual streamflow composition caused by changes in meteorological elements is analyzed fig 9 the positive correlation indicates that the streamflow composition has the same trend as the meteorological elements while a negative correlation indicates that they have the opposite trend the larger the absolute value of the correlation coefficient the greater the influence of meteorological elements on the water cycle elements as displayed in fig 9 the change in precipitation is the major meteorological factor causing the evolution of streamflow composition followed by sunshine duration and temperature over the past 40 years the cryosphere in the nrw has degraded to varying degrees indicating that the area of permafrost has shrunk and the thicknesses of glaciers and snow have decreased or even disappeared zhang et al 2019 the melting process of the cryosphere is sensitive to global climate change and this change may intensify in the future ran et al 2018 the degradation rate of permafrost in the nrw ranges from a downstream value of 1 1 mm year to an upstream value of 48 mm year table 4 the degradation of permafrost first occurred in the permafrost boundary of the island shaped permafrost area indicating that the seasonal freezing depth decreased and the melting depth increased wu et al 2010 permafrost exerts an important influence on the formation and regulation of streamflow on the one hand permafrost ablation provides water for streamflow on the other hand the presence of permafrost can prevent the seepage of precipitation intercept the conversion of precipitation and groundwater and make the streamflow process both concentrated and short lived ran et al 2018 the continuous degradation of permafrost will reduce the recharge of streamflow in the permafrost layer affecting the recharge of highland rivers sun et al 2020 moreover the degradation of permafrost leads to an increase in plant root zone moisture and root zone nutrients juřička et al 2020 keuper et al 2012 changes in the physical and chemical properties of soil li et al 2020a 2020b and the degradation or succession of alpine meadows and wetlands chen et al 2012 glaciers and snow can regulate streamflow for many years in low temperature and humid years ice and snow melting are weak increasing accumulation the retreat of the nrw glaciers and the reduction of snow cover area caused by global warming could increase the supply of rivers in the short term and significantly increase the streamflow of the nrw in the long run however glaciers and snow cover will gradually disappear resulting in a gradual decrease in the supply of ice and snow water to rivers causing rivers to dry up or be threatened by drought and flood disasters zhang et al 2019 at the same time hydrologic flow and water circulation in the river basin have intensified and the risk of floods and droughts has increased dramatically as the precipitation in the basin could increase and temperature will rise in the future the disturbance to the ecological environment due to climate change will thus increase yang et al 2019 therefore the surface water of the river basin should be effectively managed to ensure that water resources are effectively used to support regional ecosystems 5 conclusions using a distributed hydrological model wep c we investigated the nrw of the qtp which has experienced cryosphere degradation increasing temperatures and increasing precipitation over the past several decades our principal findings include 1 in the streamflow of the nrw from 1979 to 2019 glaciers snowmelt permafrost groundwater and

4565,over the past few decades the nu river watershed nrw which originates in the qinghai tibet plateau and covers an area of 113 414 km2 has experienced increased streamflow temperatures and precipitation along with cryospheric degradation to determine the mechanism of increase of the observed streamflow composition a distributed hydrological model wep c was developed to investigate the streamflow composition and its changes in the nrw from 1979 to 2019 during this period glaciers snowmelt permafrost groundwater and precipitation accounted for 3 2 13 4 0 8 10 4 and 72 2 of the nrw streamflow respectively the streamflow of the watershed increased at a rate of 1 36 mm year among the contribution rates to the increase of streamflow glaciers increased at a rate of 0 28 mm year and snowmelt decreased at a rate of 0 53 mm year additionally permafrost meltwater groundwater and precipitation increased at a rate of 0 03 mm year 0 60 mm year and 0 98 mm year respectively thus this study provides an understanding of the composition and change of streamflow in the qinghai tibet plateau and similar watersheds wherein the cryosphere plays an important part in the hydrological cycle keywords wep c hydrological model streamflow composition climate change nu river watershed 1 introduction the cryosphere refers to the portion of the surface water of earth that exists in solid form which includes all types of ice and snow wu et al 2016 and is the most sensitive layer to global climate change immerzeel et al 2010 owing to its high sensitivity toward climate change the cryosphere and liquid hydrosphere forms a reciprocal relationship with increase in temperatures due to climate change most of the glacial snow shrinks and the permafrost layer thins down resulting in significant changes in the water cycle koven et al 2013 radić and hock 2014 the melting water from the cryosphere changes the salinity and temperature of the ocean which affects the global thermohaline circulation process and contributes to climate change schmittner 2002 in addition the change in the cryosphere has a significant impact on the high and mid latitude watersheds which are recharged by the melting of the cryosphere during the interglacial process of dansgaard oeschger events the solid liquid water underwent a significant change in time of advance and retreat burns 2003 this change closely links the atmosphere ocean land and ecosystem through the phase transition process of the solid liquid water cycle and transforms into one of the key factors in the process of climate change cimatoribus et al 2013 the hydrological impact of the cryosphere on the global and regional water cycle is not only related to changes in the global hydrosphere but also has an increasingly significant impact on regional sustainable development these variations have considerable impacts on water security food safety production and social and economic development therefore water managers must understand the changes in the cryosphere and acknowledge the possibility of the disappearance of the cryosphere under the continuous influence of climate warming al jawad et al 2019 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is an alpine region with complex geomorphology and water sources with an intricate water circulation system wang et al 2009 a significant warm and humid air current from the ocean is observed on the southern side of the qtp along with abnormally strong convection in the middle and eastern side of the plateau which constitutes a special water cycle process in the active east asian monsoon area thus it is a region that is particularly sensitive to climate change pithan 2010 the typical topography of the qtp along with its alpine climate results in the widespread distribution of glacial snow and permafrost on the plateau which accounts for a large proportion of its total water resources ran et al 2018 over the past 40 years there is a decrease in both snow depth and snow days on the qtp fan et al 2015 climate change significantly affects the temporal and spatial processes of water and energy cycles causing the melting of surface ice and snow and impacting the freeze thaw process of soil moisture wu et al 2010 the freezing of soil moisture affects surface infiltration soil moisture movement and evapotranspiration benettin et al 2018 wang et al 2009 furthermore the ice and snow ablation process causes temporal changes in streamflow generation and confluence and strengthens evapotranspiration affecting the spatial and temporal processes of water circulation back et al 2013 ramanathan 2001 however limited research has been conducted on this topic the distributed hydrological model dhm is the most frequently used method for streamflow simulations panday and huyakorn 2004 the dhm determined the water balance through a series of nested equations and simulates the spatiotemporal changes in the water balance components wang et al 2020 however traditional dhms primarily focus on the simulation of the gravity driven water cycle process while ignoring the various microscopic forces in the soil medium hindering effective water cycle simulation in alpine areas wang et al 2020 wang and xue 2013 due to harsh natural conditions of the qtp it is difficult to carry out routine field observations thus numerical simulation and satellite data which provides corresponding verification data for the model are integrated in order to better understand the plateau s glaciers snow permafrost rivers lakes groundwater coupling processes gao et al 2018 at present utilization of the dhm to calculate the cryospheric streamflow consists of two forms 1 embedding the cryospheric module into the existing dhm to compensate for the shortcomings of the original model in describing the cryospheric streamflow process or 2 developing a new cryosphere hydrological model ran et al 2018 in recent years an increasing number of studies have been conducted on the cryosphere using hydrological models researchers have improved the typical water cycle simulation methods within the traditional hydrological models these include the degree day factor method and the hydrothermal coupling method to simulate ice and snow meltwater and the soil freeze thaw process respectively jia et al 2006 wang and xue 2013 however although some water cycle simulations provide results for specific water bodies they lack systematic physical mechanisms of water and energy circulation unable to adequately simulate the cryosphere water cycle based on the theory of glacier mass balance li et al 2020b proposed a glacier evolution scheme and precipitation runoff model that integrates the processes of glacier melting sublimation evaporation and accumulation gao et al 2018 introduced a permafrost module based on a dhm and conducted a streamflow simulation on the upper heihe basin in the northeastern qtp indicating that the permafrost area shrank by 8 8 from 1971 to 2013 however their research solely focused on the response of one type of water body to climate change and did not consider the impact of other water bodies this would lead to inaccurate estimates of the water balance of the watershed the melting of the cryosphere and its contribution to streamflow thus to provide a basis for predicting glacial permafrost and snowmelt streamflow due to changing climate we developed a distributed hydrological model known as the wep c to simulate the characteristics of rivers in alpine regions the primary purpose of this study was to utilize the model to 1 simulate the streamflow in the cryosphere of the watershed 2 partition the streamflow composition and 3 calculate the possible causes of streamflow changes over the past 40 years 2 methods and data in the vertical structure of the wep c model fig s1a rainfall and snowfall were identified by the precipitation phase identification module and the corresponding snow cover area was calculated according to the surface depth of the snow liu et al 2018 table s1 lists the methods implemented for the principal modules of the model based on the various underlying surface conditions the model selects the corresponding parameterized module to calculate the surface water heat energy including canopy interception depression storage surface infiltration evapotranspiration along with ice and snow sublimation and melting jia et al 2005 the soil moisture permafrost depth and energy transport were simulated based on the surface soil moisture flux boundary and ground temperature boundary furthermore the water exchange between the surface layer and the groundwater was estimated based on the water balance of the soil layer in the horizontal structure of the wep c model fig s1b the smallest calculation unit was the hydrological response unit hru yang et al 2019 2020a the subwatersheds were divided into several hrus according to the elevation of the watershed and various underlying conditions of the different land use types soil type and soil thickness of the watershed in the model simulation each hru was directly merged into the subwatershed channel using a virtual channel based on the quantitative relationship between the subwatershed area and its channel length the corresponding virtual channel length could be obtained by calculating the area of the hru due to the complex spatial distribution of the hrus the water transfer between the hrus within the subwatershed was not considered in the model and each hru directly exchanged water with the subwatershed river channel fig s2 2 1 case study the nu river watershed nrw originates in the southern foothills of the tanggula mountains on the qtp flows through the tibet autonomous region and yunnan province within china and finally empties into the andaman sea of the indian ocean weng et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the nu river supports agricultural irrigation urban and rural water supply in the watershed along with the religious activities of some tibetan residents wang and chen 2017 the area of the nrw above the daojieba hydrological station is 113 414 km2 with a river length of 1 842 5 km and elevations ranging from 641 to 6491 m fig 1 from 1979 to 2019 the average annual precipitation was 653 mm with a rate of increase of 0 98 mm year the average annual air temperature was 4 6 c with a rate of increase of 0 049 c year the maximum observed air temperature during this period was 30 8 c whereas the minimum air temperature was 29 2 c the main land use type in the watershed is meadow which accounts for 62 3 of the total land use in 2014 the area of glaciers in the watershed is about 1816 km2 and is concentrated in the middle and upper reaches of the watershed the soil types in the watershed are alpine meadow grassland and sub alpine meadow soils seasonal permafrost and permafrost are widely distributed in the watershed the types of groundwater in the nrw include water frozen in bedrock water in bedrock fissures water associated with carbonate caves pore water in clastic rocks water in fissures of layered sedimentary rocks water frozen in unconsolidated sediments and pore water in unconsolidated sediments multiple water sources contribute to the complexity and seasonal variation of the nrw streamflow composition 2 2 soil moisture and heat coupling module the model uses the vertical one dimensional richards equation with the phase change term to couple the heat flow equation and incorporates the soil moisture movement by increasing the source and sink terms hayek

use multi criteria glue as the method of multi objective optimization and model uncertainty evaluation the multi objective glue method evaluates model uncertainty based on the extension of a single objective glue jia and culver 2008 the likelihood function is an important indicator for evaluating the quality of the hydrological process simulation the likelihood function in a single objective is considered as the objective function and a multi objective function is used to express the relationship between the likelihood degrees to form a multi objective likelihood function the specific process of glue for uncertainty analysis can be found in beven and binley 1992 the nash efficiency coefficient nash and the certainty coefficient r2 were selected as the likelihood functions to describe the hydrological process from different aspects the evaluation indicators are as follows 1 nash efficiency coefficient 13 n a s h 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o i is the observed data q s i is the modeled data over the i th period and q o is the average observed data over n periods here the modeling accuracy increases as the nash index approaches a value of 1 2

study combined the water cycle multi process observation data to verify the model systematically based on the characteristics of the observation data we considered soil moisture surface snow cover glacier inventory permafrost depth and streamflow as the optimization targets for parameter calibration and validation to calibrate and verify the wep c the data pertaining to the nrw used in the modeling are listed in table 1 these data include a digital elevation model dem for 2003 soil thickness and type for 2000 spatially distributed land use data for 1980 1995 2005 2010 and 2014 daily precipitation air temperature surface temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration were obtained for the period 1979 2019 from 22 meteorological stations the dem was used to divide the subwatersheds and hrus obtain channel information and calculate the slope the watershed consists of many types of soils as well as large differences in soil spatial distribution thus the related physical and chemical parameters are difficult to obtain accurately during the modeling process the soil was reclassified into four types sandy sandy loam loam and clay loam soils jia et al 2006 the land use data in the model were obtained from the institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research of the chinese academy of sciences and were reclassified as water glacier and snow forest grassland bare land cultivated land and residential land the soil moisture observation data were provided by the institute of tibetan plateau research resolution 0 1 table 2 the data monitoring soil profile included a total of four soil depths below the surface at 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm from august 2010 to december 2013 the snow thickness data was implemented from the china snow depth long time series dataset 1979 2014 resolution 0 25 provided by the cold and arid region scientific data center table 2 the glacier cataloging process is complex and the time span involved is lengthy the basic data used for the nrw during the two glacier cataloging processes were the aerial survey topographic maps from the 1980s and landsat tm etm remote sensing images from 2004 to 2011 guo et al 2015 permafrost depth and streamflow data was incorporated from meteorological stations and hydrological stations streamflow calibration and verification were conducted according to the observed monthly streamflow at the dasa 1983 1995 jiayuqiao 1980 2008 and daojieba 1979 2000 hydrological stations and the daily flood season streamflow at the jiayuqiao hydrological station 1993 2000 table 2 the respective model calibration and model verification periods adopted for the hydrological stations were 1983 1991 and 1992 1995 for dasa 1980 2002 and 2003 2008 for jiayuqiao and 1979 1993 and 1994 2000 for daojieba 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation in fig s2 the scattered points display the solution when nash 0 50 and r2 0 70 are used as thresholds for calibration when cr 53 14 and sh 74 38 in the model fig s2 black dot the simulation effect was the best and the uncertainty was the lowest table s2 3 1 1 snow depth calibration for the monthly snow depth simulation results of the watershed the nash and r2 coefficients were 0 62 and 0 83 respectively fig 2 compared with the satellite based data the average simulation snow depth was 1 55 mm less the model was found to be sensitive to the simulation of heavy snowfall but was generally effective for the simulation of light snowfall overall the results revealed that the snow simulation could characterize the watershed changes in snowfall and snow depth for each year of the study period 3 1 2 glacier melting process calibration the results of the two glacier surveys in the watershed were for the periods 1980 1990 and 2004 2011 and they were used to verify the simulated watershed glacier melting process fig 3 the results indicated that the glacier reduction rate between the two glacier surveys was 17 8 km3 while the simulated annual average glacier melting rate was 16 3 km3 the simulated glacier inventory rate was slightly lower but the overall difference was not significant overall the simulation results were in good agreement with china s two glacier cataloging results 3 1 3 soil moisture and permafrost calibration from the daily soil moisture simulation results of the subwatersheds of the nagqu station obvious differences were observed for each layer table 3 and fig 4 compared with the observed data the fluctuations of the simulated soil moisture were minor there was a certain hysteresis in the simulated soil moisture movement and the differences in the deeper soil were more obvious overall it was found that the soil moisture simulation results could characterize the temporal changes in soil moisture in each layer of the watershed the simulation results of the monthly average permafrost depths of the meteorological stations revealed that the permafrost depths of the nagqu fig 5 a suoxian fig 5b dingqing fig 5c and luolong fig 5d stations in the watershed gradually decreased the accuracy of the suoxian and dingqing simulation results were good the simulated permafrost depths of nagqu and luolong were greater than the observed data table 4 this may be due to the inconsistency between the surface soil type and the deep soil type resulting in changes in the soil parameters the results indicate that the simulation results of the permafrost depth were good although the annual fluctuation degree of the hydrological model simulation results was less than the observed value 3 1 4 streamflow the daily streamflow simulation results at the jiayuqiao hydrological station during the flood season revealed that the nash coefficients of the daily streamflow for calibration and validation were 0 71 and 0 77 respectively indicating proper simulation of the extreme daily precipitation process in summer table 5 the verification results of monthly streamflow at the nagqu jiayuqiao and daojieba hydrological stations indicated that the monthly streamflow simulation results were all above 0 79 with the simulation results of the downstream stations being better than those of the upstream stations fig 6 3 2 annual streamflow composition changes the phase identification of precipitation demonstrated that rainfall and snowfall accounted for 90 and 10 respectively and snowfall was concentrated from october to may the annual evapotranspiration and infiltration were 267 mm year and 140 mm year respectively and were concentrated in summer fig 7a b from 1979 to 2019 glaciers snowmelt permafrost groundwater and precipitation accounted for 3 2 13 4 0 8 10 4 and 72 2 of the streamflow in the watershed respectively hence precipitation is a significant part of the streamflow in summer precipitation accounted for 90 of the streamflow while snowmelt glaciers and groundwater accounted for 50 of the streamflow from november to april occupying a dominant position fig 7c d water balance analysis revealed that the annual average water storage in the nrw decreased at a rate of 38 mm year over the study period fig 7e in the watershed for elevations 5000 m the proportions of groundwater permafrost water glacier water and snowmelt water in the streamflow increased with elevation whereas for elevations 5000 m these features decreased with increasing elevation fig 7f this was primarily due to the low temperatures above 5000 m where the melting of the cryosphere is not obvious 3 3 annual changes in streamflow composition fig 8 a displays the simulated 1979 2019 streamflow time series in the nrw which exhibited an increase rate of 1 36 mm year fig 8b shows the streamflow composition contribution rate from 1979 to 2019 in which precipitation increased at the rate of 0 98 mm year accounting for 72 1 of the change rate and snowmelt decreased at the rate of 0 53 mm year accounting for 39 0 of the change rate in the case of increased precipitation snowmelt displayed a decreasing trend indicating an increase in the proportion of precipitation shifting to rainfall rather than snowfall as the temperatures rose glaciers increased at the rate of 0 28 mm year accounting for 20 6 of the change rate groundwater increased at the rate of 0 60 mm year accounting for 44 1 of the change rate and permafrost water melted at the rate of 0 03 mm year accounting for 2 8 of the change rate the contribution of rainfall to the total streamflow reached its minimum value of 65 02 in 1984 and then rose to its maximum of 85 6 in 2018 in 1994 the contribution of glacial melting to the total streamflow reached its maximum of 4 3 which was 2 7 higher than the 2018 minimum similar to the melting characteristics of glaciers the contribution of snowmelt to the total streamflow fell to a minimum of 6 0 in 2018 a decrease of 11 0 from its 1994 maximum the contribution of permafrost water to the total streamflow reduced to a minimum of 0 04 in 2017 which was 2 56 less than the 1997 maximum the contribution of groundwater to the total streamflow fell to a minimum of 5 5 in 2016 which was 12 5 less than the maximum value in 1984 these results indicate that the increase in precipitation was the primary reason for the increase in total streamflow while the increases in glacial melting snowmelt and groundwater also provided significant contributions 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with the previous similar studies the model simulations in the present study indicated that increased precipitation led to increased streamflow in nrw this result was consistent with the conclusions previously obtained by zhang et al 2013 and wang and chen 2017 based on a land surface model and observed data on the upper nu river however these investigations focused primarily on the impact of precipitation on streamflow ignoring the effects of the cryosphere and groundwater the present study found that glaciers snowmelt permafrost and groundwater accounted for 3 2 13 4 0 8 and 10 4 of the streamflow respectively indicating that these features also comprise an important part of streamflow composition this study also demonstrated that climate change has led to increases in groundwater storage and decreases in ice and snow water storage in the nrw this is consistent with the study by luo et al 2020 wherein the special sensor microwave imager was utilized to observe the relationship between permafrost changes and groundwater storage and that by xiang et al 2016 wherein grace satellite gravity data was applied to reveal that the increase in groundwater was related to the streamflow replenishment caused by the increase in ice snow permafrost melt and precipitation in the watershed unlike other studies this investigation used multi source data to verify the reliability of the model and analyzed both the streamflow composition and its spatiotemporal changes 4 2 model uncertainty owing to the complexity of the dhm the uncertainty of the overall quantitative model is problematic montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 there are two primary uncertainties in the simulation of this model the uncertainty in the simulation of the energy balance of the land surface and the uncertainty of the data input due to the complex terrain of the qtp the solar radiation differences between shady and sunny slopes lead to different snowmelt vegetation coverage and soil moisture distributions pomeroy et al 2003 which are closely related to cryosphere degradation and soil thermal properties geothermal flow initial ground temperature and permafrost conditions additionally failure to consider lateral heat flux may lead to an underestimation of the development and melting rate of the cryosphere gao et al 2018 for example as a result of the difference in active layer thickness and temperature difference between ridges and valleys lateral advection heat flux may increase the melting of permafrost in areas with high groundwater velocity this portion of the uncertainty may lead to further uncertainty in the simulation of the surface energy balance thus introducing uncertainty in the estimation of ice and snow cover water as well as soil heat flux furthermore the sparse weather stations in the nrw and the short observation series directly affect the simulation accuracy of the water cycle process in the watershed mazzoleni et al 2017 the current study implemented multiple factors such as streamflow soil moisture permafrost depth and snow to verify the model but these data exhibited significant spatial and temporal differences the spatiotemporal inconsistencies in the data significantly affected the reliability of the verification results the time series of the daily and monthly streamflow data were inconsistent and the soil moisture monitoring stations were distributed in the upstream area 4 3 meteorological elements and cryosphere degradation owing to the small population and the lack of large reservoirs in the nrw the contribution of human activities to streamflow change is low yang et al 2020b in addition meteorological factors are the primary factors affecting the water cycle the changes in meteorological elements primarily include precipitation air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed the correlation between the annual streamflow composition caused by changes in meteorological elements is analyzed fig 9 the positive correlation indicates that the streamflow composition has the same trend as the meteorological elements while a negative correlation indicates that they have the opposite trend the larger the absolute value of the correlation coefficient the greater the influence of meteorological elements on the water cycle elements as displayed in fig 9 the change in precipitation is the major meteorological factor causing the evolution of streamflow composition followed by sunshine duration and temperature over the past 40 years the cryosphere in the nrw has degraded to varying degrees indicating that the area of permafrost has shrunk and the thicknesses of glaciers and snow have decreased or even disappeared zhang et al 2019 the melting process of the cryosphere is sensitive to global climate change and this change may intensify in the future ran et al 2018 the degradation rate of permafrost in the nrw ranges from a downstream value of 1 1 mm year to an upstream value of 48 mm year table 4 the degradation of permafrost first occurred in the permafrost boundary of the island shaped permafrost area indicating that the seasonal freezing depth decreased and the melting depth increased wu et al 2010 permafrost exerts an important influence on the formation and regulation of streamflow on the one hand permafrost ablation provides water for streamflow on the other hand the presence of permafrost can prevent the seepage of precipitation intercept the conversion of precipitation and groundwater and make the streamflow process both concentrated and short lived ran et al 2018 the continuous degradation of permafrost will reduce the recharge of streamflow in the permafrost layer affecting the recharge of highland rivers sun et al 2020 moreover the degradation of permafrost leads to an increase in plant root zone moisture and root zone nutrients juřička et al 2020 keuper et al 2012 changes in the physical and chemical properties of soil li et al 2020a 2020b and the degradation or succession of alpine meadows and wetlands chen et al 2012 glaciers and snow can regulate streamflow for many years in low temperature and humid years ice and snow melting are weak increasing accumulation the retreat of the nrw glaciers and the reduction of snow cover area caused by global warming could increase the supply of rivers in the short term and significantly increase the streamflow of the nrw in the long run however glaciers and snow cover will gradually disappear resulting in a gradual decrease in the supply of ice and snow water to rivers causing rivers to dry up or be threatened by drought and flood disasters zhang et al 2019 at the same time hydrologic flow and water circulation in the river basin have intensified and the risk of floods and droughts has increased dramatically as the precipitation in the basin could increase and temperature will rise in the future the disturbance to the ecological environment due to climate change will thus increase yang et al 2019 therefore the surface water of the river basin should be effectively managed to ensure that water resources are effectively used to support regional ecosystems 5 conclusions using a distributed hydrological model wep c we investigated the nrw of the qtp which has experienced cryosphere degradation increasing temperatures and increasing precipitation over the past several decades our principal findings include 1 in the streamflow of the nrw from 1979 to 2019 glaciers snowmelt permafrost groundwater and precipitation accounted for 3 2 13 4 0 8 10 4 and 72 2 of the streamflow respectively and 2 in terms of annual change streamflow in the nrw increased at a rate of 1 36 mm year among the contributions

4566,a streamflow time series contains a large quantity of information and finding the instruments that are capable of accessing this information remains an important task using the kolmogorov complexity kc and its derivatives it has previously been shown that the degree of randomness in streamflow partly depends on its orographic characteristics this paper applied a change based complexity measure aksentijevic gibson complexity ag to investigate the spatiotemporal regularities of monthly streamflow of seven rivers from bosnia and herzegovina for a period of 1965 1986 and evaluate their hydrological effects a unique advantage of this complexity measure is its ability to quantify large scale complexity and to zoom in on low level structure and detect patterns that are normally inaccessible ten time series created from the seven rivers were examined and temporal and structural complexity profiles of different streamflows and annual periodicities associated with bimodal mixed flow regimes were obtained the ag complexity can be employed as a standard instrument for the analysis of hydrological data and it holds the promise of uncovering patterns and rhythms in the data that cannot be captured by kc and other complexity measures keywords aksentijevic gibson complexity kolmogorov complexity periodicity river regime river streamflow series 1 introduction 1 1 towards a non circular complexity measure for use in hydrology regularities and patterns of river flow or absence thereof reveal a great deal about the interactions between the river and its surrounding environment and various meteorological factors the information about the interactions can be parameterized by complexity measures two main approaches to studying the complexity of river flow have thus far been used namely shannon and other entropies castillo et al 2015 ma et al 2020 sivakumar and singh 2012 singh 2013 2015 and kolmogorov complexity kc via the lempel ziv algorithm lza lempel ziv 1976 since kc is non computable mihailović et al 2016 however there exists a gap between general and approximate complexity estimates and the need for the precise quantification of changes in complexity that can be reliably ascribed to specific causes a problem with complexity measures is a lack of a clear theoretical foundation that would enable a measure to be easily applicable for example shannon 1948 entropy is defined via probability which can only be computed if the source is known which is contrary to the spirit of inquiry into completely unknown phenomena although widely used in hydrology e g chapman 1986 dalezios tyraskis 1989 singh 1997 2013 2015 entropy is not well suited to detecting patterns some form of entropy can yield a rough estimate of the differences in the quantities of low level components in a time series but cannot provide a description of the structure of information except indirectly more components imply more ways of arranging them for studying the structure of a streamflow time series one ought to operationalize complexity which takes into account spatial and temporal relationships between components kolmogorov 1965 conceptualized complexity of a string in terms of the length of its description translated into the language of information technology this became the length of the shortest algorithm or code necessary to reproduce the string unlike entropy kolmogorov s measure pays heed to the structure of a string the more regularly the components are arranged the shorter the algorithm and the lower the complexity of the string kc and its derived computable measures currently represent the main tool to characterize streamflow complexity mihailović et al 2019 note that the binarization of time series lempel ziv algorithm represents an average since it depends on the value that is used to binarize the series that is the problem which is also present in statistical randomness tests however the kc spectrum one of kc derivatives mihailović et al 2015a solves this by taking each element of a time series as a threshold ultimately this relates the statistical properties of a string to its compressibility although rigorously quantitative kc offers a somewhat circular definition of complexity a simple string is one that has a short description in other words kc does not engage with the nature of complexity but only describes it while this is not a problem in applied fields the lack of a solid theoretical foundation can hamper the advance in the understanding of complex processes once a kc value is computed there is little that can be said about a time series besides stating whether it is more complex or less than another one the minimum length constraint mihailović et al 2014 means that kc is not suited to examining short time series note that this is different from short time periods in order to penetrate the structure of a string a measure needs to be able to a offer a non circular definition of complexity b have a solid theoretical basis c be equally applicable to strings of any length d connect and take into account different levels of structure and e enable easy modeling of different complexity regimens a complexity measure that satisfies all of the above requirements is the ag or change complexity which is a complexity measure that attempts to harness principles of perception because it is founded on the assumption that complexity is ultimately a subjective perceptual cognitive concept in this measure complexity is defined as the amount of change at all levels of the string a change from a change to absence of change is also considered change thus satisfying requirement a aksentijevic gibson 2012a change is a primal concept that precedes invariance cutting 1998 and connects the subjective domain of perception with objective science specifically change can serve as a measure of effort invested in or more formally cost of information processing aksentijevic gibson 2012b this satisfies requirement b ag was designed as a measure that would index the complexity of short patterns relevant for psychology length 10 for such patterns it has proved itself superior to the kc complexity which is difficult to adapt to short strings aksentijevic et al 2021 however it has recently been demonstrated that it also works well with long strings aksentijevic et al 2020 mihailović et al 2021 satisfying requirement c perhaps the most important property of ag is that it takes into account all levels of structure and has hence a number of positive consequences first it extracts more information than does lza which counts the number of distinct patterns at all levels by considering changes at all levels although subtle this shift relates different levels of structure to each other requirement d finally the ag measure consists of two components namely the complexity profile which is an ordered sequence of the number of changes at all levels from left to right and appropriate weights which determine the influence of each structural level in principle it is possible to simulate different hydrological complexity signatures caused by factors at different time scales from short term human to very long term geophysical factors satisfying requirement e such flexibility is not achievable by other complexity measures see appendix for a step by step explanation of the logic and application of ag to a hydrological time series 1 2 studying streamflow complexity understanding the dynamic behavior of rivers which is affected by several factors is important for river management physical factors include the incline gradient of the river the viscosity of water the shape of river bed and the properties of the surrounding terrain geophysical factors involve the geographical location weather and climatic change and finally streamflow is significantly affected by human activities including building river training works damming dredging fishing deforestation and pollution the question arises here as to how the study of river flow complexity can help disentangle the effects of these factors thus far studies of streamflow complexity and more generally geophysical complexity e g puente and sivakumar 2007 have described the differences between time series and offered correlational explanations it is important to relate different complex regimens to specific short time periods and causes of particular interest are rhythmical and quasi rhythmical changes in river flow which might signal a cause that is predictable one such variable is river regime which beckinsale 1969 referred to as annual river discharge which is affected by precipitation and temperature krasovskaia 1997 river regimes can be simple mixed or complex and one question is how do these regimes relate to river flow complexity to answer this question needs a complexity measure that is capable of capturing complexity changes within relatively short time periods with this in mind we applied the ag complexity to monthly river flow time series over a 21 year period 1965 1986 from seven rivers in bosnia and herzegovina we examined these rivers because they have already been a subject of analysis using lza which enabled to compare the behavior of the two measures it was hypothesized that ag would behave well in indexing the overall complexity but would excel at precisely pinpointing the loci of low complexity 2 methodology 2 1 aksentijevic gibson complexity aksentijevic gibson or change complexity ag has been formally defined and described by aksentijevic and gibson 2012a 2012b nevertheless a brief overview of the measure is given here every time we scan from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa we encounter a change registering and responding to change is a critical faculty of a living or intelligent agent and change represents an ideal index of the cost of information processing aksentijevic gibson 2012b the shift from symbols objects to their relationships reflects a deeper shift in thinking about information the relational and structural aspects are becoming more important and are beginning to supplement the traditional purely quantitative methods currently we are using the binary version of the measure and all time series are binarized using mean thresholding let s be a binary string of length l 2 if we scan the string and note a change whenever we encounter a pair 01 or 10 the sum of changes over all pairs would represent a crude index of complexity entropy therefore we scan j symbols at a time j 2 3 l and ask which substring of length j of s should register a change suppose we encounter the substring x of s then x will register a change if the two overlapping pairs 01 and 10 differ in the amount of change we define a change function on binary strings that determines when a substring of s should register a change and then use it to construct the change profile p p 2 p 3 p l of s where p j is the number of substrings of length j of s that register a change 1 1 two strings are considered different the measure registers a change if they are not a mirror inversion complement or a mirror complement of each other the original string and the three transformations represent a pattern class for example the string 0110101 belongs to the same equivalence class as 1010110 1001010 and 0101001 because all four strings contain the same number of changes then we obtain the complexity c of s as a suitably weighted average of the coordinates of p noting that there are l j 1 substrings of s of length j we define c to be the sum of the quantities p j l j 1 j 2 3 l the change matrix of s is matrix a aksentijevic et al 2021a whose entry in row i and column j is x ij the change profile of s is the array p p 2 p 3 p l the complexity c of s is defined to be equal to j 2 l p j w j where w j 1 l j 1 we can use weights w j to regulate the contribution of different lengths of substrings this particular weighting is chosen because it produces a large number of complexity values and gives some prominence to the higher levels of structure for 0 p j l j 1 the complexity c lies within the interval 0 c l 1 we define the normalized complexity n of s to be c s l 1 so 0 n 1 where necessary we refer to c as the unnormalized complexity of s the upper bounds for c and n are never attained but as l becomes large both mean and maximum values of n approach 1 the code for calculating this measure in the r language is given in aksentijevic et al 2020b 2 2 kolmogorov complexity for a given time series x i i 1 2 3 n kc complexity is calculated approximately using the lempel ziv algorithm lza or some of its variants and n is the time series length this algorithm includes the following steps 1 encode the time series by constructing a sequence s of characters 0 and 1 written as s i i 1 2 3 n according to the rule s i 0 x i x m or 1 if x i x m where x m is the mean value of the time series samples selected as the threshold other encoding schemes are also used depending on the application 2 calculate the complexity counter c n which is defined as the minimum number of distinct patterns contained in a given character sequence the complexity counter c n is a function of the length of sequence n the value of c n approaches an ultimate value b n as n is approaches infinity i e c n o b n and c n b n n l o g 2 n 3 calculate the normalized measure c k n which is defined as c k n c n b n c n log 2 n n parameter c k n represents the information quantity contained in a time series and it varies from 0 to 1 although the values of kc can exceed 1 2 3 running complexity in statistical geophysics a running mean is often calculated to analyze data by creating the series of averages of different subsets of the full data set that is a type of finite impulse response filter this procedure was used to calculate the running ag and kc complexities for a given series of streamflow values a fixed window of sizes 8 16 32 64 and 128 is extracted and ag and kc complexities are computed after that the window is moved one step forward and the ag or kc algorithm is applied again until the end of the time series is reached 2 4 geographical background for this study we selected seven rivers located in bosnia and herzegovina the reasons for this selection were as follows a the streamflow of the rivers was measured under comparable circumstances over the same period b the nature of rivers provided a sufficient variety within similarity which facilitated analysis c they were studied before so that their properties are well known d the time series were based on monthly readings which allowed interpreting the results in terms of meaningful time intervals bosnia and herzegovina bh is a federation of two entities located in the western balkans which was a constituent republic of the socialist federative republic of yugoslavia until 1992 it is located in the western balkans surrounded by croatia to the north and south west serbia to the east and montenegro to the southeast it lies between latitudes 42 and 46 n and longitudes 15 and 20 e the period under observation 1965 1986 was characterized by rapid development and increase in human activity in most of the regions where rivers are located bh is predominantly mountainous with the central dinaric alps representing the spine of the country they run on the east west axis and tend to be higher in the south the highest point maglić is at an altitude of 2386 m a s l some of the important mountains in bh are jahorina bjelašnica kozara vlašić romanija and grmeč the prevalence of mountainous terrain gives rise to a rich water fundus which is reflected in the fact that bh has around 200 rivers however the location of bh ensures that its northern parts impinge on the pannonian plain and are consequently flat on the other side of the alps the adriatic sea is a close neighbor and this adds another dimension to the richness of the hydrological profile of the country the seven rivers namely drina bosna vrbas neretva una ukrina and miljacka are major rivers which have been hydrologically assessed since the 1950 s and play an extremely important role in the life of the country here we briefly describe the specificities of each river see fig 1 for the geography of the bh river system drina is an important european river immortalized by the nobel prize winning novel a bridge on the drina by the serbian writer ivo andrić it is the main tributary of river sava and consequently belongs to the black sea basin it is 346 km long and is characterized by a mixed nivo pluvial regime with substantial flows throughout the year but especially in the spring melting snow and early winter rain the rivers examined here follow the same bimodal or mixed regime bosna is another tributary to river sava which is formed from karst wellsprings near ilidža a suburb of the bh capital sarajevo 273 km long like most other rivers described here it combines the mountainous and plains profiles river vrbas emerges from a mountain spring under the zec mountain and is 250 km long like drina it is a tributary to sava and is partly a typical mountainous river cutting through deep canyons only to enter the flat plains in its lower reaches from banja luka to srbac neretva is another important river length 225 km which is born from a mountain spring on the jabuka mountain and forms an alluvial delta before discharging into the adriatic sea another tributary of sava river una is 212 km long and has a typical mountainous profile in its early course its source is a deep void more than 200 m in depth and the river is renowned for the diversity of its fauna its annual discharge is 8 000 000 000 m3 of water ukrina is a small river also a tributary of sava that is only 81 km long and most of its course runs through a hilly terrain 450 m a s l finally miljacka is the shortest river in this sample 36 km although probably of most historical significance while it starts as a typical mountain river most of its course runs through the suburbs and the city center of sarajevo after which it joins river bosna as a tributary as shown in table 1 the segments in question vary substantially in terms of flow rate from miljacka shifting only 5 m3 s to the section of drina to kozluk which pushes 380 m3 s on average this is not surprising given the large channel and gradient incline of the latter within this stretch drina is a very fast and powerful river which creates a large drainage basin in its lower course by contrast miljacka is a small river characterized by poor discharge and low flow rate another interesting piece of information here is the variability of flow rate one way of measuring this is to quantify the overall deviation of flow rate values from the mean it can be easily seen that the standard deviation sd follows the mean flow rate the larger the former the larger the latter and vice versa one of the factors that possibly contributes to drina s flow variability is its large sinuosity index si 1 98 which imposes local constraints on the flow rate resulting in large variability since the variability is related to complexity we could expect the above results to be at least partly reflected in our complexity analyses 2 5 computation of complexity measures when studying the behavior of geophysical time series one often needs to conduct two types of analyses spatial and temporal the former refers to comparing the time series by locality at which they were recorded and attempting to infer something about the causes of their differences in such situations kc complexity has proved useful in providing a general estimate of randomness however the essence of a time series is the temporal change unfolding sequentially in order to capture this information a complexity measure needs to be sensitive to different levels of structure kc does take into account subpatterns of different lengths but is limited in its ability to assess shorter strings this is of particular importance with regard to hydrological time series which are often based on monthly readings consequently a brief 8 16 or 32 character string can contain a great deal of useful information it was for this reason that we decided to employ ag which is well suited to picking up regularities in short strings in this study we used the running complexity procedure aksentijevic et al 2020a the computations of running kc and ag were performed over the entire time interval 1965 1986 for each of the ten time series the running complexity procedure was applied in which windows of varying lengths were moved over a time series by one space at the time from left to right it has been shown that this procedure allows a detailed analysis of space time contingencies and relevant phenomena in general the original streamflow time series m3 s were binarized via mean thresholding see appendix 1 for details of how ag complexity of streamflow is computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial analysis fig 2 illustrates the behavior of the 10 river segments over the 21 year period what catches one s eye is a largely stationary regime which is not disturbed to any great extent by large scale influences particularly obvious is the approximately annual rhythmicity which reflects the waxing of discharge that is caused by the melting of snow and precipitation this results in a typical bimodal double peaked annual regime the annual rhythm is very pronounced and the only other two points of note are a the regimes for most rivers are very similar as confirmed by the correlations and b a peak discharge that occurred in the spring of 1969 around month 52 given that the relevant information is largely accessible to visual inspection the question that motivates this work is whether and how well ag would be able to detect these or any other regularities to examine the claim that globally the seven rivers followed the same regime we correlated the flow values for the 10 segments over the full sampling period the results were as expected in that the correlations were related to proximity table 2 overall the highly significant pearson correlations roughly varied between r 0 30 and 0 90 all p 0 001 r 2 10 80 suggesting the presence of an organic system which is not surprising given the largely similar geological conditions equally interesting was the fact that the segments of one river or tributaries were more strongly correlated than unrelated segments this confirms the value of correlation as a tool for assessing similarities between rivers more importantly it indicates that each river possesses its flow signature specific quality of flow which characterizes all of its sections river ukrina does not appear related to the other components of the hydro system which is confirmed by its low correlation with other rivers the northernmost river ukrina provides low correlations with the rest because it has little contact with the dynamics of the alpine hydro system to the south equally it should be noted that east west correlations are somewhat stronger than north south ones which is to be expected given the natural geomorphologic barrier created by the alps the very high correlation between the two segments of the river drina supports the notion that irrespective of the geographical locus distinct parts of a river possess a common hydrological signature and that even if different rivers belonging to the same basin can behave similarly irrespective of distance mihailović et al 2015b related the flow rate kc complexity to the geomorphological context and found that mountainous rivers tended to have a higher complexity this could perhaps be because mountain rivers flow more rapidly and interact with the terrain much more than their lowland counterparts this in turn creates all kinds of hydrodynamical phenomena such as eddies currents whirlpools vortices breakwaters deep narrow riverbeds and underwater caves and pits which contribute to the complexity of flow first we examined the ability of the two measures to quantify similarities and differences between the time series we compared ag and kc on their sensitivity to overall differences in complexity for the ten river segments the relatively short length of these 252 steps meant that the largest window size we could employ was 128 this is not technically true but we wished to preserve the continuity with the work of aksentijevic et al 2020b we examined the complexities using a 1 way repeated measures by analysis of variance anova computed the value of f statistic by dividing the variance within conditions by that measured between conditions the fact that the levels segments did not belong to a single variable was not important because we were interested only in the relative differences between the time series and the measurements and time series length were uniform across the total sample as demonstrated in fig 4 kc captured the difference between the segments well f 9 1116 132 19 p 0 001 the power of experiment was maximal 1 ag was even more sensitive f 9 1116 181 45 p 0 001 according to kc mil s and ukr d possessed the highest complexity and bos d the lowest this is somewhat surprising because miljacka to sarajevo is a mountain segment while the other two are lowland segments if we look at the ag results for the same window size the mountain segment ner u had by far the highest complexity with bos d again having the lowest complexity it should be noted that this difference is statistically vast t 124 53 18 p 0 001 as well as stable it is maintained at all window sizes down to l 8 this is in contrast with the very small absolute differences in the value of ag as explained by aksentijevic et al 2020 the statistical power of ag increases with sample size as its variance decreases faster than the absolute differences in value thus ag offers an explanation which is in line with the hypothesis by mihailović et al 2015b on the other hand kc introduces a complication in that it considers the lowland ukrina a high complexity river this however could be the result of a window specific effect in other words the non orographic source of the complexity is confined to roughly a 15 year period further research is needed to corroborate this another detail worth noting is that the segment with the largest monthly discharge drina to kozluk was not associated with the highest complexity equally the segment with the lowest complexity according to both the measures bos d possessed the largest standard deviation this is a useful reminder that standard measures of statistical variability are not really suited to quantifying the orderliness or absence thereof in natural data the minimum length at which kc is applicable is an intriguing question la plante 2006 although no general solution exists in practical applications the minimum kc length can vary from l 50 in psychology gauvrit et al 2016 to l 200 in analysis of hydrological time series mihailović et al 2014 2019 we applied the running kc complexity to windows 128 and 64 no major differences were observed with the change in window length ag on the other hand was designed to analyze short strings l 10 which consequently could be scaled down to l 8 this is particularly useful in the temporal analyses where the measure can scan over 8 month periods before we examine these we should note that bosna to doboj has the lowest complexity according to both measures this is potentially interesting since this time series possesses the largest standard deviation from the mean since sd measures the quantity of deviation but not its structure the low complexity might reflect a relatively ordered regimen in which these movements occur 2 2 a perfectly ordered sequence 100 500 100 500 100 500 has a mean of 300 and the sd of 219 09 by contrast the series 385 299 201 399 215 301 with the same mean but a much lower sd 82 53 possesses no obvious ordering for the relationship between the variance and entropy see singh 1997 one can go a step further in examining the spatial relationships among the rivers as shown in table 2 and fig 3 changes in flow rates across the rivers segments are highly correlated can the same be said for the complexity scores complexity is an abstract concept which is not necessarily closely yoked to the variable of interest at the same time since complexity measures use the original information some resemblance should be expected we examined ag correlations between segments for window lengths 128 to 8 rather than describing the data in detail we observed that a the correlations were generally lower if highly significant and b few rivers were not correlated concerning the latter point mil s and ner z were not correlated with bos d confirming the large difference in complexity between these rivers reported by both measures the most salient finding of this analysis is that ag is not only capable of quantifying the complexity of long flow rate series but is possibly more sensitive to the hydrological structure compared with the widely used kc complexity further the results of current analysis largely confirm the findings by mihailović et al 2015b in that the highest complexity is associated with mountain rivers and the lowest with a lowland river 3 2 temporal analysis the data in fig 2 clearly show an annual rhythm that is probably caused by seasonal changes in precipitation by the very definition of complexity such rhythms should lower the complexity of a string substantially and as such represent a good test of a measure s sensitivity mihailović et al 2021 observed that kc was able to capture annual periodicities in daily sampled time series of solar irradiation this is understandable given that a year is described by about 360 data points affording kc ample room to extract sufficient information however the current time series are based on monthly readings resulting in 12 data points a year given the original purpose of kc and based on previous research aksentijevic et al 2020a 2020b we hypothesized that ag but not kc would be able to detect this periodicity further if complexity is related to the changes in flow we should expect ag to pick these up at an appropriate scale 3 3 streamflow is generated by several mechanisms the ups in streamflow are usually due to surface runoff caused by rainfall or rainfall cum snowmelt horton mechanism as well as saturated mechanism whereas downs or low streamflow values are caused by baseflow or groundwater flow subsurface flow mechanism see bras 1990 first we compared the running mean ag for window 128 averaged across the stations with the running mean ag computed over a true random string of length 252 the string was obtained from the site random org using the random bytes procedure haahr 2020 a repeated measures t test confirmed that the complexity of flow for the seven rivers was much lower than the complexity of random string t 124 34 61 p 0 001 interestingly kc was slightly more sensitive t 124 35 39 p 0 001 the correlation between the measures was low r 0 26 p 0 014 in our other geophysical studies we have found that ag and kc can correlate very highly e g solar radiation data the current result might have to do with sparse sampling which leaves kc unable to encode long patterns relative to the period in question nevertheless it is certainly capable of sensing short term periodicities indirectly scanning the time series with a window 128 approximately 10 5 years fig 5 we immediately notice a general downward trend this window captures long term effects on the environment of factors such as human activity which tend to dampen the natural complexity of river flow thus the running temporal mean ag offers a consistent and easily interpretable summary of the data but note that complexity for mil s and ner z remains high this cannot be said of kc which although performing well does not afford visual discrimination of the stations and does not show any clear trends for example ag discriminates very well between the two rivers with the highest and lowest complexities another thing that is visible here is a few sharp local drops at steps 13 bos r winter 1966 and 125 ner z winter 1986 although it is not possible to explain this at the moment we suggest that a closer study of such local drops in complexity might prove profitable to examine the ability of ag to detect smaller scale regularities we plotted it with shorter windows l 64 to 16 fig 6 at l 64 and 32 we note a substantial fall in the complexity of river ukrina towards the end of the time series these are processes that unfold over 3 to 5 years and culminated in the second half of 1980 given that ukrina is a small river an inspection of local documents might be helpful in determining the cause nothing else catches the eye except a large and abrupt fall in the complexity of rivers miljacka and bosna to river doboj in the winter of 1970 as captured by window 16 this makes sense because the two measuring stations are very close and the event was of brief duration a month or two what is the meaning of these local drops in the complexity at different structural levels they are caused by regularities redundancies within a specific time period for example if a drop is not caught at l 128 but at l 64 it means that the period in question is of the order of about five years as the drop persists at l 32 it is likely that the drop is caused by an even shorter event of two to three year duration the most interesting finding however is revealed by window l 8 as can be seen in fig 7 the overall complexity of a segment streamflow is partly determined by the zero points which signal a perfect regularity in the complexity series see appendix 1 for an explanation of how running ag captures these low complexity points inspection shows that this is caused by the way in which the binarized data reflect the original streamflow regime the highest complexity of flow has been recorded with river neretva to ulog it is therefore not surprising that the corresponding time series contains only two zero points by contrast bosna to doboj bottom contains nine such points this is a potentially useful indicator of the effect of a yearly precipitation regime on the overall complexity as could be expected this is larger in the cases of slower lowland rivers another interesting detail concerns the higher frequency of zero points in the latter part of the series which corresponds to the earlier observation that the complexity of river flow declined over time it is perhaps this decline that allowed the natural annual regime to become more salient finally river ukrina which sits aside from the remaining alpine rivers demonstrates a couple of phase shifted zero points which do not fit in the general annual rhythm the window of length 8 might appear too short for any practical purpose yet we show here that it captures an important hydrological rhythm what is immediately obvious from fig 8 is the almost perfect rhythmicity with a period of 12 months which is caused by the fall in complexity to zero this is only possible when a perfect period is maintained between oscillations the observed zero points signal periods of subthreshold streamflow which last eight or nine months and are flanked by peaks of high discharge see the mean line in fig 2 the individual zero points are generally phase locked to the grand seasonal rhythm and reflect a coherent geographical climatic system which governs streamflow despite significant local variations in terrain and temperature we hypothesize that the rhythm reflects the annual waxing and waning of flow governed by precipitation and melting of snow the cumulative rhythm over all 10 segments is so precise that the individual minima fall perfectly into a comb whose teeth are separated by 12 months given the general complexity of hydrological data such precision is noteworthy the interesting detail here is that not all segments show drops at all intervals rather some show drops at certain intervals and their cumulative effect is reminiscent of the volley principle of temporal coding in the auditory nerve where the sum of sparse but precisely timed signals from different neurons produces a steady beat at every period wever bray 1937 the white highlights point out secondary rhythms that are probably due to the bimodal nature of annual regime 3 3 structural analysis the presence of minima of different sizes as well as structural differences between the time series suggests that an elaboration of the current technique is necessary rather than restricting the analysis to a few windows it is possible to create a structure map of the complexity series by stacking all change transforms from level 1 to l 1 on the top of each other see appendix and aksentijevic et al 2021 since a structure map contains all available information about the string this would provide a detailed picture of the temporal arrangement and size of low complexity regions see mihailović et al 2021 visual inspection of structure maps in fig 9 indicates that orographic structure if any is confined to the low structural levels in other words most zero complexity sub and supra threshold troughs are of short duration 1 to 6 months periodic zero drops are noticeable in all segments and their temporal distribution allows us to refine our understanding of hydrological complexity although the maps appear to confirm the presence of climatic seasonal periodicities observed in fig 5 the full structural specification allows for a better discrimination between individual segments rivers in order to benefit from this the area of the map containing structural features needs to be magnified stretched vertically so that the structure rich region becomes salient fig 10 the relationship between complexity and its structure can be briefly explained thus the highest complexity ner u segment is characterized by the absence of a clear period and relatively small zero troughs next to it is mil s which possesses the second highest complexity its complexity function also lacks rhythmicity but some of its troughs are large and compensate for this making it ultimately less complex than ner u it should also be remembered that these two mountain rivers have maintained their flow rate complexity throughout the recording period by contrast bos d and vrb s are the two lowest complexity segments and this is explained by their structure as shown in fig 11 the segment bos d is characterized by a clear annual rhythm which is present throughout the map with the exception of a lacuna surrounding step 100 the appearance of periodicity on some time scales could be ascribed to specific environmental factors and possible human activity in regard to that we note two things i we define regularity also rhythm as a recurrence of a condition or a set of conditions at equal intervals and ii occurrence of the periodicity on a particular time scale does not imply that it will be maintained over long periods an in phase 6 monthly periodicity is equally prominent especially in the earlier section of the map and is also visible in the vrb s segment the former reflects a seasonal cycle and the latter the regime linked ups and downs increased complexity fig 5 is associated with the increase in streamflow caused by precipitation and snowmelt whereas a low complexity signifies the dampening of the streamflow dynamics which accompanies the seasonal dissipation of the flow since precipitation is highly variable and is in itself complex the increased complexity during periods of high streamflow is expected on the other hand when streamflow dampens the source contributing it is subsurface flow which is relatively stable having low complexity in summary streamflow complexity as measured by ag reflects the number size and temporal arrangement of zero complexity troughs in the structure map any combination of these factors can contribute to the complexity value their configuration represents a structural signature which can be used to classify rivers according to their streamflow complexity 4 discussion ag provided a clear and logical account of the hydrological system of bh from 1965 to 1986 it discriminated between time series convincingly and maintained a statistically significant difference all the way down to window l 8 with a sliding window of 10 5 years we observed a long term downward trend in the overall complexity of the river system this is in agreement with the hypothesis that human activity lowers the complexity of river flow through removing natural obstacles that facilitate complex flow or building dams levees and mooring points which dampen the chaotic fluid dynamics given that the rivers in question are relatively short and narrow it is plausible to ascribe the fall in complexity to local human activity note the two exceptions in fig 5 however at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that long term geophysical and climatic forces also play a part as we reduced the window size local differences started to emerge at l 64 and 32 a substantial fall in the complexity for river ukrina in the early 1980 s could be observed but the most interesting finding at this point was the almost perfect rhythmicity of streamflow complexity across all segments with a window l 8 the phenomenon cannot be observed by studying individual rivers only when the running complexity series are superimposed over each other does the rhythmicity become visible a further level of precision was added to the analysis by means of structure maps which contain all the change information contained in the string namely frequency regularity and size of zero complexity troughs running ag complexity particularly in the form of structural maps is capable of revealing aspects of information that would otherwise remain hidden to the one off complexity estimates consequently the measure can be useful in disentangling complex hydrological phenomena and classifying rivers according to their structure as confirmed by previous studies kc produces excellent results with running complexity as long as the window is sufficiently large to accommodate the measure s requirements with dense sampling e g daily kc can uncover interesting temporal regularities of the order of a year or more e g mihailović et al 2021 however here the situation is different with monthly sampling kc which works well with windows of 256 upwards cannot provide a consistent complexity picture with windows that are too short for it importantly ag is highly sensitive to rhythms which are detected from as few as two or three repeating periods while kc remains the tool of choice for the analysis of large data sets all it can say about a data set is whether this is likely or not to have come from some random source once this important first step is made a different tool is required one that is capable of locating and describing patterns in the data it is here that aksentijevic gibson complexity is proving useful as a microscope that can focus on the structural information and its hierarchical patterning 5 conclusions understanding the dynamics of streamflow remains a challenge in hydrology one of the ways in which this can be accomplished is to measure the complexity of river flow the assumption that complexity represents an important variable comes from the intuitive understanding of the difference between the unpredictability of a fast flowing mountain stream and the leisurely meandering of a lowland river furthermore water carries a great deal of information about the geology geography and climate of its environment to access such information we resort to complexity measures in the hope of being able to connect complexity values with various external causes one of the measures is used to obtain a general estimate of the complexity of river flow however this leaves untapped large amounts of sequential temporal information that after all is the raison d etre of time series to access this information we applied aksentijevic gibson complexity to ten time series taken from seven rivers in bh to our knowledge this is the first time such a regularity has been observed this might be of particular interest in the context of hydrological prediction given that stochastic approaches do not address the hierarchical nature of complexity and the patterning of information our finding opens up an interesting avenue for research on hydrological rhythms and furnishes additional support for our contention that aksentijevic gibson complexity represents a useful addition to the hydrological toolbox given the sensitivity of ag to periodicities future research will focus on disruptions in periodic complexity functions which might signal significant geophysical or human generated changes to the ecosystem of equal interest are short range 1 day to 1 month and long range 10 years rhythms the former are potentially important as indices of local ecological conditions while the latter could provide useful information on the structure and idiosyncrasies of macro hydrological and geological processes which are currently accessible only via traditional informational measures finally given the deliberately restricted scope of the current study one aim is to examine a global gamut of hydrological regimes in terms of complexity credit authorship contribution statement aleksandar

profit sectors appendix the logic and informal derivation of ag complexity one of the puzzling details associated with the study of information and complexity is that the titans of this field shannon and kolmogorov never provided a clear definition of either term e g kolmogorov 1987 shannon 1948 rather these are arrived at as secondary products of the mathematical treatment of topics such as cost of communication shannon or efficacy of algorithmic encoding kolmogorov for instance shannon determines the uncertainty of a binary string based on the probabilities frequencies of the symbols contained therein the highest uncertainty entropy information content or indirectly complexity is found in strings with equal proportions of symbols thus all of these are considered maximally entropic and complex 000000111111 010101010101 110011001100 000111000111 000011001111 011010001110 etc it is easily noticed that the above strings differ in terms of their patterning structure and that the first one is simpler contains less information than the last one and while it is true that 000000000001 is simpler than 011010001110 so are all the other strings shown above consequently probabilistic entropy based on quantity is not well suited to the investigation of complexity which implies interconnectedness between different structural levels kolmogorov s idea to equate complexity with randomness and simplicity with ease of algorithmic encoding has brought us closer to the intuitive meaning of complexity simple periodic strings such as 000111000111 are encoded by short algorithms of the form 000111 x n where n is the number of repetitions of the period however the compressibility argument suffers from the absence of a consistent mapping between algorithms and their outputs as shown in many instances ostensibly simple algorithms can produce complex outputs e g logistic map may 1976 and vice versa any complex algorithm can be tweaked to output a periodic string consequently compressibility can serve as a conceptual template but not a foundation of a method for measuring complexity in the aksentijevic gibson paradigm complexity is ultimately a perceptual and cognitive in other words subjective phenomenon the same is true of information which is important only to agents in possession of limited resources the most basic and primal definition of information is change in agreement with shannon ag considers information to be equivalent to entropy loss of energy needed to process change and complexity aksentijevic gibson 2012a 2012b here we give examples of how ag is computed and how it captures the regularities in a streamflow series in the current paper each streamflow series was binarized values below the mean were assigned a 0 and those above a 1 since the binarized time series for the relevant river segments do not contain changes at very low levels 2 or 3 we have created a string that satisfies this requirement in order to illustrate the workings of ag take a string l 10 fig 12 a at the lowest level comparing adjacent symbols from left to right there are six changes next symbol pairs are compared redundantly 01 10 10 01 01 11 and so on an ordered sequence which catalogues individual changes over time or steps is called a change transform see fig 12b highlight change transform at level 1 changes between substrings are computed for all levels up to l 1 when all change transforms are laid on top of each other a structure map is obtained that represents a complete change record of a string fig 12b a sequence tallying changes across levels is called a complexity profile fig 12d solid line the complexity profile represents a quantitative record of the cost of scanning memorizing reproducing a pattern different profile entries levels of structure are not mutually independent the relationship is best understood starting from level l 1 if there are a lot of changes there generally more changes are likely to be found at other levels the exception to this rule is the core pattern 10101010 which represents the foundation of the measure and is not taken into account when computing the complexity of real life data it contains the maximum number of changes at level 1 and no changes at higher levels 4 4 its unit complexity is an outlier that disproportionately affects the mean complexity of any set of patterns the same is true of other very simple strings consisting of short periods e g 00110011 001001001 etc a complexity profile contains a great deal of information about a pattern but the way in which different entries are weighted affects the final complexity value currently each profile entry is weighted by the maximum possible number of changes at that level l j for a string l 10 the maximum number of changes at level 1 is nine 0101010101 this decreases by one only to finish with one possible change at level l 1 this solution was chosen because it maintains a good balance between sensitivity number of distinct complexity values and stability similar values for similar patterns it so happens that this weighting scheme is very successful in modeling the complexity in diverse contexts from psychology to environmental sciences in the remainder of the appendix we show how ag captures seasonal drops in complexity visual inspection of the binarized series for bos d the first river segment on the list shows a highly regular seesaw pattern with 5 10 month minima followed by a 3 5 month maxima fig 13 the trough highlighted in red is an 8 month minimum which starts at step 65 spring 1971 it is flanked by 5 month runs of suprathreshold values and appears nine times over the course of measurement of bos d when the binary flow series is converted into a running ag series the 8 month subthreshold runs are captured by the ag window l 8 the running complexity procedure is described in fig 14 as the window l 8 moves to the right the complexity of the adjacent windows is low but not zero a zero trough is registered only when the ag window l 8 detects a zero complexity run l 8 a sufficient number of these occur within the sample to allow ag to capture its meta period however the presence of minima of different sizes suggests that an elaboration of the current technique is necessary rather than restricting the analysis to a few windows it is possible to create an exhaustive structure map by plotting all running complexity series from 1 to l 1 in a vertical sequence this would provide a detailed picture of the evolution and extinction of a low complexity region enabling a more substantive causal inference 
4566,a streamflow time series contains a large quantity of information and finding the instruments that are capable of accessing this information remains an important task using the kolmogorov complexity kc and its derivatives it has previously been shown that the degree of randomness in streamflow partly depends on its orographic characteristics this paper applied a change based complexity measure aksentijevic gibson complexity ag to investigate the spatiotemporal regularities of monthly streamflow of seven rivers from bosnia and herzegovina for a period of 1965 1986 and evaluate their hydrological effects a unique advantage of this complexity measure is its ability to quantify large scale complexity and to zoom in on low level structure and detect patterns that are normally inaccessible ten time series created from the seven rivers were examined and temporal and structural complexity profiles of different streamflows and annual periodicities associated with bimodal mixed flow regimes were obtained the ag complexity can be employed as a standard instrument for the analysis of hydrological data and it holds the promise of uncovering patterns and rhythms in the data that cannot be captured by kc and other complexity measures keywords aksentijevic gibson complexity kolmogorov complexity periodicity river regime river streamflow series 1 introduction 1 1 towards a non circular complexity measure for use in hydrology regularities and patterns of river flow or absence thereof reveal a great deal about the interactions between the river and its surrounding environment and various meteorological factors the information about the interactions can be parameterized by complexity measures two main approaches to studying the complexity of river flow have thus far been used namely shannon and other entropies castillo et al 2015 ma et al 2020 sivakumar and singh 2012 singh 2013 2015 and kolmogorov complexity kc via the lempel ziv algorithm lza lempel ziv 1976 since kc is non computable mihailović et al 2016 however there exists a gap between general and approximate complexity estimates and the need for the precise quantification of changes in complexity that can be reliably ascribed to specific causes a problem with complexity measures is a lack of a clear theoretical foundation that would enable a measure to be easily applicable for example shannon 1948 entropy is defined via probability which can only be computed if the source is known which is contrary to the spirit of inquiry into completely unknown phenomena although widely used in hydrology e g chapman 1986 dalezios tyraskis 1989 singh 1997 2013 2015 entropy is not well suited to detecting patterns some form of entropy can yield a rough estimate of the differences in the quantities of low level components in a time series but cannot provide a description of the structure of information except indirectly more components imply more ways of arranging them for studying the structure of a streamflow time series one ought to operationalize complexity which takes into account spatial and temporal relationships between components kolmogorov 1965 conceptualized complexity of a string in terms of the length of its description translated into the language of information technology this became the length of the shortest algorithm or code necessary to reproduce the string unlike entropy kolmogorov s measure pays heed to the structure of a string the more regularly the components are arranged the shorter the algorithm and the lower the complexity of the string kc and its derived computable measures currently represent the main tool to characterize streamflow complexity mihailović et al 2019 note that the binarization of time series lempel ziv algorithm represents an average since it depends on the value that is used to binarize the series that is the problem which is also present in statistical randomness tests however the kc spectrum one of kc derivatives mihailović et al 2015a solves this by taking each element of a time series as a threshold ultimately this relates the statistical properties of a string to its compressibility although rigorously quantitative kc offers a somewhat circular definition of complexity a simple string is one that has a short description in other words kc does not engage with the nature of complexity but only describes it while this is not a problem in applied fields the lack of a solid theoretical foundation can hamper the advance in the understanding of complex processes once a kc value is computed there is little that can be said about a time series besides stating whether it is more complex or less than another one the minimum length constraint mihailović et al 2014 means that kc is not suited to examining short time series note that this is different from short time periods in order to penetrate the structure of a string a measure needs to be able to a offer a non circular definition of complexity b have a solid theoretical basis c be equally applicable to strings of any length d connect and take into account different levels of structure and e enable easy modeling of different complexity regimens a complexity measure that satisfies all of the above requirements is the ag or change complexity which is a complexity measure that attempts to harness principles of perception because it is founded on the assumption that complexity is ultimately a subjective perceptual cognitive concept in this measure complexity is defined as the amount of change at all levels of the string a change from a change to absence of change is also considered change thus satisfying requirement a aksentijevic gibson 2012a change is a primal concept that precedes invariance cutting 1998 and connects the subjective domain of perception with objective science specifically change can serve as a measure of effort invested in or more formally cost of information processing aksentijevic gibson 2012b this satisfies requirement b ag was designed as a measure that would index the complexity of short patterns relevant for psychology length 10 for such patterns it has proved itself superior to the kc complexity which is difficult to adapt to short strings aksentijevic et al 2021 however it has recently been demonstrated that it also works well with long strings aksentijevic et al 2020 mihailović et al 2021 satisfying requirement c perhaps the most important property of ag is that it takes into account all levels of structure and has hence a number of positive consequences first it extracts more information than does lza which counts the number of distinct patterns at all levels by considering changes at all levels although subtle this shift relates different levels of structure to each other requirement d finally the ag measure consists of two components namely the complexity profile which is an ordered sequence of the number of changes at all levels from left to right and appropriate weights which determine the influence of each structural level in principle it is possible to simulate different hydrological complexity signatures caused by factors at different time scales from short term human to very long term geophysical factors satisfying requirement e such flexibility is not achievable by other complexity measures see appendix for a step by step explanation of the logic and application of ag to a hydrological time series 1 2 studying streamflow complexity understanding the dynamic behavior of rivers which is affected by several factors is important for river management physical factors include the incline gradient of the river the viscosity of water the shape of river bed and the properties of the surrounding terrain geophysical factors involve the geographical location weather and climatic change and finally streamflow is significantly affected by human activities including building river training works damming dredging fishing deforestation and pollution the question arises here as to how the study of river flow complexity can help disentangle the effects of these factors thus far studies of streamflow complexity and more generally geophysical complexity e g puente and sivakumar 2007 have described the differences between time series and offered correlational explanations it is important to relate different complex regimens to specific short time periods and causes of particular interest are rhythmical and quasi rhythmical changes in river flow which might signal a cause that is predictable one such variable is river regime which beckinsale 1969 referred to as annual river discharge which is affected by precipitation and temperature krasovskaia 1997 river regimes can be simple mixed or complex and one question is how do these regimes relate to river flow complexity to answer this question needs a complexity measure that is capable of capturing complexity changes within relatively short time periods with this in mind we applied the ag complexity to monthly river flow time series over a 21 year period 1965 1986 from seven rivers in bosnia and herzegovina we examined these rivers because they have already been a subject of analysis using lza which enabled to compare the behavior of the two measures it was hypothesized that ag would behave well in indexing the overall complexity but would excel at precisely pinpointing the loci of low complexity 2 methodology 2 1 aksentijevic gibson complexity aksentijevic gibson or change complexity ag has been formally defined and described by aksentijevic and gibson 2012a 2012b nevertheless a brief overview of the measure is given here every time we scan from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa we encounter a change registering and responding to change is a critical faculty of a living or intelligent agent and change represents an ideal index of the cost of information processing aksentijevic gibson 2012b the shift from symbols objects to their relationships reflects a deeper shift in thinking about information the relational and structural aspects are becoming more important and are beginning to supplement the traditional purely quantitative methods currently we are using the binary version of the measure and all time series are binarized using mean thresholding let s be a binary string of length l 2 if we scan the string and note a change whenever we encounter a pair 01 or 10 the sum of changes over all pairs would represent a crude index of complexity entropy therefore we scan j symbols at a time j 2 3 l and ask which substring of length j of s should register a change suppose we encounter the substring x of s then x will register a change if the two overlapping pairs 01 and 10 differ in the amount of change we define a change function on binary strings that determines when a substring of s should register a change and then use it to construct the change profile p p 2 p 3 p l of s where p j is the number of substrings of length j of s that register a change 1 1 two strings are considered different the measure registers a change if they are not a mirror inversion complement or a mirror complement of each other the original string and the three transformations represent a pattern class for example the string 0110101 belongs to the same equivalence class as 1010110 1001010 and 0101001 because all four strings contain the same number of changes then we obtain the complexity c of s as a suitably weighted average of the coordinates of p noting that there are l j 1 substrings of s of length j we define c to be the sum of the quantities p j l j 1 j 2 3 l the change matrix of s is matrix a aksentijevic et al 2021a whose entry in row i and column j is x ij the change profile of s is the array p p 2 p 3 p l the complexity c of s is defined to be equal to j 2 l p j w j where w j 1 l j 1 we can use weights w j to regulate the contribution of different lengths of substrings this particular weighting is chosen because it produces a large number of complexity values and gives some prominence to the higher levels of structure for 0 p j l j 1 the complexity c lies within the interval 0 c l 1 we define the normalized complexity n of s to be c s l 1 so 0 n 1 where necessary we refer to c as the unnormalized complexity of s the upper bounds for c and n are never attained but as l becomes large both mean and maximum values of n approach 1 the code for calculating this measure in the r language is given in aksentijevic et al 2020b 2 2 kolmogorov complexity for a given time series x i i 1 2 3 n kc complexity is calculated approximately using the lempel ziv algorithm lza or some of its variants and n is the time series length this algorithm includes the following steps 1 encode the time series by constructing a sequence s of characters 0 and 1 written as s i i 1 2 3 n according to the rule s i 0 x i x m or 1 if x i x m where x m is the mean value of the time series samples selected as the threshold other encoding schemes are also used depending on the application 2 calculate the complexity counter c n which is defined as the minimum number of distinct patterns contained in a given character sequence the complexity counter c n is a function of the length of sequence n the value of c n approaches an ultimate value b n as n is approaches infinity i e c n o b n and c n b n n l o g 2 n 3 calculate the normalized measure c k n which is defined as c k n c n b n c n log 2 n n parameter c k n represents the information quantity contained in a time series and it varies from 0 to 1 although the values of kc can exceed 1 2 3 running complexity in statistical geophysics a running mean is often calculated to analyze data by creating the series of averages of different subsets of the full data set that is a type of finite impulse response filter this procedure was used to calculate the running ag and kc complexities for a given series of streamflow values a fixed window of sizes 8 16 32 64 and 128 is extracted and ag and kc complexities are computed after that the window is moved one step forward and the ag or kc algorithm is applied again until the end of the time series is reached 2 4 geographical background for this study we selected seven rivers located in bosnia and herzegovina the reasons for this selection were as follows a the streamflow of the rivers was measured under comparable circumstances over the same period b the nature of rivers provided a sufficient variety within similarity which facilitated analysis c they were studied before so that their properties are well known d the time series were based on monthly readings which allowed interpreting the results in terms of meaningful time intervals bosnia and herzegovina bh is a federation of two entities located in the western balkans which was a constituent republic of the socialist federative republic of yugoslavia until 1992 it is located in the western balkans surrounded by croatia to the north and south west serbia to the east and montenegro to the southeast it lies between latitudes 42 and 46 n and longitudes 15 and 20 e the period under observation 1965 1986 was characterized by rapid development and increase in human activity in most of the regions where rivers are located bh is predominantly mountainous with the central dinaric alps representing the spine of the country they run on the east west axis and tend to be higher in the south the highest point maglić is at an altitude of 2386 m a s l some of the important mountains in bh are jahorina bjelašnica kozara vlašić romanija and grmeč the prevalence of mountainous terrain gives rise to a rich water fundus which is reflected in the fact that bh has around 200 rivers however the location of bh ensures that its northern parts impinge on the pannonian plain and are consequently flat on the other side of the alps the adriatic sea is a close neighbor and this adds another dimension to the richness of the hydrological profile of the country the seven rivers namely drina bosna vrbas neretva una ukrina and miljacka are major rivers which have been hydrologically assessed since the 1950 s and play an extremely important role in the life of the country here we briefly describe the specificities of each river see fig 1 for the geography of the bh river system drina is an important european river immortalized by the nobel prize winning novel a bridge on the drina by the serbian writer ivo andrić it is the main tributary of river sava and consequently belongs to the black sea basin it is 346 km long and is characterized by a mixed nivo pluvial regime with substantial flows throughout the year but especially in the spring melting snow and early winter rain the rivers examined here follow the same bimodal or mixed regime bosna is another tributary to river sava which is formed from karst wellsprings near ilidža a suburb of the bh capital sarajevo 273 km long like most other rivers described here it combines the mountainous and plains profiles river vrbas emerges from a mountain spring under the zec mountain and is 250 km long like drina it is a tributary to sava and is partly a typical mountainous river cutting through deep canyons only to enter the flat plains in its lower reaches from banja luka to srbac neretva is another important river length 225 km which is born from a mountain spring on the jabuka mountain and forms an alluvial delta before discharging into the adriatic sea another tributary of sava river una is 212 km long and has a typical mountainous profile in its early course its source is a deep void more than 200 m in depth and the river is renowned for the diversity of its fauna its annual discharge is 8 000 000 000 m3 of water ukrina is a small river also a tributary of sava that is only 81 km long and most of its course runs through a hilly terrain 450 m a s l finally miljacka is the shortest river in this sample 36 km although probably of most historical significance while it starts as a typical mountain river most of its course runs through the suburbs and the city center of sarajevo after which it joins river bosna as a tributary as shown in table 1 the segments in question vary substantially in terms of flow rate from miljacka shifting only 5 m3 s to the section of drina to kozluk which pushes 380 m3 s on average this is not surprising given the large channel and gradient incline of the latter within this stretch drina is a very fast and powerful river which creates a large drainage basin in its lower course by contrast miljacka is a small river characterized by poor discharge and low flow rate another interesting piece of information here is the variability of flow rate one way of measuring this is to quantify the overall deviation of flow rate values from the mean it can be easily seen that the standard deviation sd follows the mean flow rate the larger the former the larger the latter and vice versa one of the factors that possibly contributes to drina s flow variability is its large sinuosity index si 1 98 which imposes local constraints on the flow rate resulting in large variability since the variability is related to complexity we could expect the above results to be at least partly reflected in our complexity analyses 2 5 computation of complexity measures when studying the behavior of geophysical time series one often needs to conduct two types of analyses spatial and temporal the former refers to comparing the time series by locality at which they were recorded and attempting to infer something about the causes of their differences in such situations kc complexity has proved useful in providing a general estimate of randomness however the essence of a time series is the temporal change unfolding sequentially in order to capture this information a complexity measure needs to be sensitive to different levels of structure kc does take into account subpatterns of different lengths but is limited in its ability to assess shorter strings this is of particular importance with regard to hydrological time series which are often based on monthly readings consequently a brief 8 16 or 32 character string can contain a great deal of useful information it was for this reason that we decided to employ ag which is well suited to picking up regularities in short strings in this study we used the running complexity procedure aksentijevic et al 2020a the computations of running kc and ag were performed over the entire time interval 1965 1986 for each of the ten time series the running complexity procedure was applied in which windows of varying lengths were moved over a time series by one space at the time from left to right it has been shown that this procedure allows a detailed analysis of space time contingencies and relevant phenomena in general the original streamflow time series m3 s were binarized via mean thresholding see appendix 1 for details of how ag complexity of streamflow is computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial analysis fig 2 illustrates the behavior of the 10 river segments over the 21 year period what catches one s eye is a largely stationary regime which is not disturbed to any great extent by large scale influences particularly obvious is the approximately annual rhythmicity which reflects the waxing of discharge that is caused by the melting of snow and precipitation this results in a typical bimodal double peaked annual regime the annual rhythm is very pronounced and the only other two points of note are a the regimes for most rivers are very similar as confirmed by the correlations and b a peak discharge that occurred in the spring of 1969 around month 52 given that the relevant information is largely accessible to visual inspection the question that motivates this work is whether and how well ag would be able to detect these or any other regularities to examine the claim that globally the seven rivers followed the same regime we correlated the flow values for the 10 segments over the full sampling period the results were as expected in that the correlations were related to proximity table 2 overall the highly significant pearson correlations roughly varied between r 0 30 and 0 90 all p 0 001 r 2 10 80 suggesting the presence of an organic system which is not surprising given the largely similar geological conditions equally interesting was the fact that the segments of one river or tributaries were more strongly correlated than unrelated segments this confirms the value of correlation as a tool for assessing similarities between rivers more importantly it indicates that each river possesses its flow signature specific quality of flow which characterizes all of its sections river ukrina does not appear related to the other components of the hydro system which is confirmed by its low correlation with other rivers the northernmost river ukrina provides low correlations with the rest because it has little contact with the dynamics of the alpine hydro system to the south equally it should be noted that east west correlations are somewhat stronger than north south ones which is to be expected given the natural geomorphologic barrier created by the alps the very high correlation between the two segments of the river drina supports the notion that irrespective of the geographical locus distinct parts of a river possess a common hydrological signature and that even if different rivers belonging to the same basin can behave similarly irrespective of distance mihailović et al 2015b related the flow rate kc complexity to the geomorphological context and found that mountainous rivers tended to have a higher complexity this could perhaps be because mountain rivers flow more rapidly and interact with the terrain much more than their lowland counterparts this in turn creates all kinds of hydrodynamical phenomena such as eddies currents whirlpools vortices breakwaters deep narrow riverbeds and underwater caves and pits which contribute to the complexity of flow first we examined the ability of the two measures to quantify similarities and differences between the time series we compared ag and kc on their sensitivity to overall differences in complexity for the ten river segments the relatively short length of these 252 steps meant that the largest window size we could employ was 128 this is not technically true but we wished to preserve the continuity with the work of aksentijevic et al 2020b we examined the complexities using a 1 way repeated measures by analysis of variance anova computed the value of f statistic by dividing the variance within conditions by that measured between conditions the fact that the levels segments did not belong to a single variable was not important because we were interested only in the relative differences between the time series and the measurements and time series length were uniform across the total sample as demonstrated in fig 4 kc captured the difference between the segments well f 9 1116 132 19 p 0 001 the power of experiment was maximal 1 ag was even more sensitive f 9 1116 181 45 p 0 001 according to kc mil s and ukr d possessed the highest complexity and bos d the lowest this is somewhat surprising because miljacka to sarajevo is a mountain segment while the other two are lowland segments if we look at the ag results for the same window size the mountain segment ner u had by far the highest complexity with bos d again having the lowest complexity it should be noted that this difference is statistically vast t 124 53 18 p 0 001 as well as stable it is maintained at all window sizes down to l 8 this is in contrast with the very small absolute differences in the value of ag as explained by aksentijevic et al 2020 the statistical power of ag increases with sample size as its variance decreases faster than the absolute differences in value thus ag offers an explanation which is in line with the hypothesis by mihailović et al 2015b on the other hand kc introduces a complication in that it considers the lowland ukrina a high complexity river this however could be the result of a window specific effect in other words the non orographic source of the complexity is confined to roughly a 15 year period further research is needed to corroborate this another detail worth noting is that the segment with the largest monthly discharge drina to kozluk was not associated with the highest complexity equally the segment with the lowest complexity according to both the measures bos d possessed the largest standard deviation this is a useful reminder that standard measures of statistical variability are not really suited to quantifying the orderliness or absence thereof in natural data the minimum length at which kc is applicable is an intriguing question la plante 2006 although no general solution exists in practical applications the minimum kc length can vary from l 50 in psychology gauvrit et al 2016 to l 200 in analysis of hydrological time series mihailović et al 2014 2019 we applied the running kc complexity to windows 128 and 64 no major differences were observed with the change in window length ag on the other hand was designed to analyze short strings l 10 which consequently could be scaled down to l 8 this is particularly useful in the temporal analyses where the measure can scan over 8 month periods before we examine these we should note that bosna to doboj has the lowest complexity according to both measures this is potentially interesting since this time series possesses the largest standard deviation from the mean since sd measures the quantity of deviation but not its structure the low complexity might reflect a relatively ordered regimen in which these movements occur 2 2 a perfectly ordered sequence 100 500 100 500 100 500 has a mean of 300 and the sd of 219 09 by contrast the series 385 299 201 399 215 301 with the same mean but a much lower sd 82 53 possesses no obvious ordering for the relationship between the variance and entropy see singh 1997 one can go a step further in examining the spatial relationships among the rivers as shown in table 2 and fig 3 changes in flow rates across the rivers segments are highly correlated can the same be said for the complexity scores complexity is an abstract concept which is not necessarily closely yoked to the variable of interest at the same time since complexity measures use the original information some resemblance should be expected we examined ag correlations between segments for window lengths 128 to 8 rather than describing the data in detail we observed that a the correlations were generally lower if highly significant and b few rivers were not correlated concerning the latter point mil s and ner z were not correlated with bos d confirming the large difference in complexity between these rivers reported by both measures the most salient finding of this analysis is that ag is not only capable of quantifying the complexity of long flow rate series but is possibly more sensitive to the hydrological structure compared with the widely used kc complexity further the results of current analysis largely confirm the findings by mihailović et al 2015b in that the highest complexity is associated with mountain rivers and the lowest with a lowland river 3 2 temporal analysis the data in fig 2 clearly show an annual rhythm that is probably caused by seasonal changes in precipitation by the very definition of complexity such rhythms should lower the complexity of a string substantially and as such represent a good test of a measure s sensitivity mihailović et al 2021 observed that kc was able to capture annual periodicities in daily sampled time series of solar irradiation this is understandable given that a year is described by about 360 data points affording kc ample room to extract sufficient information however the current time series are based on monthly readings resulting in 12 data points a year given the original purpose of kc and based on previous research aksentijevic et al 2020a 2020b we hypothesized that ag but not kc would be able to detect this periodicity further if complexity is related to the changes in flow we should expect ag to pick these up at an appropriate scale 3 3 streamflow is generated by several mechanisms the ups in streamflow are usually due to surface runoff caused by rainfall or rainfall cum snowmelt horton mechanism as well as saturated mechanism whereas downs or low streamflow values are caused by baseflow or groundwater flow subsurface flow mechanism see bras 1990 first we compared the running mean ag for window 128 averaged across the stations with the running mean ag computed over a true random string of length 252 the string was obtained from the site random org using the random bytes procedure haahr 2020 a repeated measures t test confirmed that the complexity of flow for the seven rivers was much lower than the complexity of random string t 124 34 61 p 0 001 interestingly kc was slightly more sensitive t 124 35 39 p 0 001 the correlation between the measures was low r 0 26 p 0 014 in our other geophysical studies we have found that ag and kc can correlate very highly e g solar radiation data the current result might have to do with sparse sampling which leaves kc unable to encode long patterns relative to the period in question nevertheless it is certainly capable of sensing short term periodicities indirectly scanning the time series with a window 128 approximately 10 5 years fig 5 we immediately notice a general downward trend this window captures long term effects on the environment of factors such as human activity which tend to dampen the natural complexity of river flow thus the running temporal mean ag offers a consistent and easily interpretable summary of the data but note that complexity for mil s and ner z remains high this cannot be said of kc which although performing well does not afford visual discrimination of the stations and does not show any clear trends for example ag discriminates very well between the two rivers with the highest and lowest complexities another thing that is visible here is a few sharp local drops at steps 13 bos r winter 1966 and 125 ner z winter 1986 although it is not possible to explain this at the moment we suggest that a closer study of such local drops in complexity might prove profitable to examine the ability of ag to detect smaller scale regularities we plotted it with shorter windows l 64 to 16 fig 6 at l 64 and 32 we note a substantial fall in the complexity of river ukrina towards the end of the time series these are processes that unfold over 3 to 5 years and culminated in the second half of 1980 given that ukrina is a small river an inspection of local documents might be helpful in determining the cause nothing else catches the eye except a large and abrupt fall in the complexity of rivers miljacka and bosna to river doboj in the winter of 1970 as captured by window 16 this makes sense because the two measuring stations are very close and the event was of brief duration a month or two what is the meaning of these local drops in the complexity at different structural levels they are caused by regularities redundancies within a specific time period for example if a drop is not caught at l 128 but at l 64 it means that the period in question is of the order of about five years as the drop persists at l 32 it is likely that the drop is caused by an even shorter event of two to three year duration the most interesting finding however is revealed by window l 8 as can be seen in fig 7 the overall complexity of a segment streamflow is partly determined by the zero points which signal a perfect regularity in the complexity series see appendix 1 for an explanation of how running ag captures these low complexity points inspection shows that this is caused by the way in which the binarized data reflect the original streamflow regime the highest complexity of flow has been recorded with river neretva to ulog it is therefore not surprising that the corresponding time series contains only two zero points by contrast bosna to doboj bottom contains nine such points this is a potentially useful indicator of the effect of a yearly precipitation regime on the overall complexity as could be expected this is larger in the cases of slower lowland rivers another interesting detail concerns the higher frequency of zero points in the latter part of the series which corresponds to the earlier observation that the complexity of river flow declined over time it is perhaps this decline that allowed the natural annual regime to become more salient finally river ukrina which sits aside from the remaining alpine rivers demonstrates a couple of phase shifted zero points which do not fit in the general annual rhythm the window of length 8 might appear too short for any practical purpose yet we show here that it captures an important hydrological rhythm what is immediately obvious from fig 8 is the almost perfect rhythmicity with a period of 12 months which is caused by the fall in complexity to zero this is only possible when a perfect period is maintained between oscillations the observed zero points signal periods of subthreshold streamflow which last eight or nine months and are flanked by peaks of high discharge see the mean line in fig 2 the individual zero points are generally phase locked to the grand seasonal rhythm and reflect a coherent geographical climatic system which governs streamflow despite significant local variations in terrain and temperature we hypothesize that the rhythm reflects the annual waxing and waning of flow governed by precipitation and melting of snow the cumulative rhythm over all 10 segments is so precise that the individual minima fall perfectly into a comb whose teeth are separated by 12 months given the general complexity of hydrological data such precision is noteworthy the interesting detail here is that not all segments show drops at all intervals rather some show drops at certain intervals and their cumulative effect is reminiscent of the volley principle of temporal coding in the auditory nerve where the sum of sparse but precisely timed signals from different neurons produces a steady beat at every period wever bray 1937 the white highlights point out secondary rhythms that are probably due to the bimodal nature of annual regime 3 3 structural analysis the presence of minima of different sizes as well as structural differences between the time series suggests that an elaboration of the current technique is necessary rather than restricting the analysis to a few windows it is possible to create a structure map of the complexity series by stacking all change transforms from level 1 to l 1 on the top of each other see appendix and aksentijevic et al 2021 since a structure map contains all available information about the string this would provide a detailed picture of the temporal arrangement and size of low complexity regions see mihailović et al 2021 visual inspection of structure maps in fig 9 indicates that orographic structure if any is confined to the low structural levels in other words most zero complexity sub and supra threshold troughs are of short duration 1 to 6 months periodic zero drops are noticeable in all segments and their temporal distribution allows us to refine our understanding of hydrological complexity although the maps appear to confirm the presence of climatic seasonal periodicities observed in fig 5 the full structural specification allows for a better discrimination between individual segments rivers in order to benefit from this the area of the map containing structural features needs to be magnified stretched vertically so that the structure rich region becomes salient fig 10 the relationship between complexity and its structure can be briefly explained thus the highest complexity ner u segment is characterized by the absence of a clear period and relatively small zero troughs next to it is mil s which possesses the second highest complexity its complexity function also lacks rhythmicity but some of its troughs are large and compensate for this making it ultimately less complex than ner u it should also be remembered that these two mountain rivers have maintained their flow rate complexity throughout the recording period by contrast bos d and vrb s are the two lowest complexity segments and this is explained by their structure as shown in fig 11 the segment bos d is characterized by a clear annual rhythm which is present throughout the map with the exception of a lacuna surrounding step 100 the appearance of periodicity on some time scales could be ascribed to specific environmental factors and possible human activity in regard to that we note two things i we define regularity also rhythm as a recurrence of a condition or a set of conditions at equal intervals and ii occurrence of the periodicity on a particular time scale does not imply that it will be maintained over long periods an in phase 6 monthly periodicity is equally prominent especially in the earlier section of the map and is also visible in the vrb s segment the former reflects a seasonal cycle and the latter the regime linked ups and downs increased complexity fig 5 is associated with the increase in streamflow caused by precipitation and snowmelt whereas a low complexity signifies the dampening of the streamflow dynamics which accompanies the seasonal dissipation of the flow since precipitation is highly variable and is in itself complex the increased complexity during periods of high streamflow is expected on the other hand when streamflow dampens the source contributing it is subsurface flow which is relatively stable having low complexity in summary streamflow complexity as measured by ag reflects the number size and temporal arrangement of zero complexity troughs in the structure map any combination of these factors can contribute to the complexity value their configuration represents a structural signature which can be used to classify rivers according to their streamflow complexity 4 discussion ag provided a clear and logical account of the hydrological system of bh from 1965 to 1986 it discriminated between time series convincingly and maintained a statistically significant difference all the way down to window l 8 with a sliding window of 10 5 years we observed a long term downward trend in the overall complexity of the river system this is in agreement with the hypothesis that human activity lowers the complexity of river flow through removing natural obstacles that facilitate complex flow or building dams levees and mooring points which dampen the chaotic fluid dynamics given that the rivers in question are relatively short and narrow it is plausible to ascribe the fall in complexity to local human activity note the two exceptions in fig 5 however at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that long term geophysical and climatic forces also play a part as we reduced the window size local differences started to emerge at l 64 and 32 a substantial fall in the complexity for river ukrina in the early 1980 s could be observed but the most interesting finding at this point was the almost perfect rhythmicity of streamflow complexity across all segments with a window l 8 the phenomenon cannot be observed by studying individual rivers only when the running complexity series are superimposed over each other does the rhythmicity become visible a further level of precision was added to the analysis by means of structure maps which contain all the change information contained in the string namely frequency regularity and size of zero complexity troughs running ag complexity particularly in the form of structural maps is capable of revealing aspects of information that would otherwise remain hidden to the one off complexity estimates consequently the measure can be useful in disentangling complex hydrological phenomena and classifying rivers according to their structure as confirmed by previous studies kc produces excellent results with running complexity as long as the window is sufficiently large to accommodate the measure s requirements with dense sampling e g daily kc can uncover interesting temporal regularities of the order of a year or more e g mihailović et al 2021 however here the situation is different with monthly sampling kc which works well with windows of 256 upwards cannot provide a consistent complexity picture with windows that are too short for it importantly ag is highly sensitive to rhythms which are detected from as few as two or three repeating periods while kc remains the tool of choice for the analysis of large data sets all it can say about a data set is whether this is likely or not to have come from some random source once this important first step is made a different tool is required one that is capable of locating and describing patterns in the data it is here that aksentijevic gibson complexity is proving useful as a microscope that can focus on the structural information and its hierarchical patterning 5 conclusions understanding the dynamics of streamflow remains a challenge in hydrology one of the ways in which this can be accomplished is to measure the complexity of river flow the assumption that complexity represents an important variable comes from the intuitive understanding of the difference between the unpredictability of a fast flowing mountain stream and the leisurely meandering of a lowland river furthermore water carries a great deal of information about the geology geography and climate of its environment to access such information we resort to complexity measures in the hope of being able to connect complexity values with various external causes one of the measures is used to obtain a general estimate of the complexity of river flow however this leaves untapped large amounts of sequential temporal information that after all is the raison d etre of time series to access this information we applied aksentijevic gibson complexity to ten time series taken from seven rivers in bh to our knowledge this is the first time such a regularity has been observed this might be of particular interest in the context of hydrological prediction given that stochastic approaches do not address the hierarchical nature of complexity and the patterning of information our finding opens up an interesting avenue for research on hydrological rhythms and furnishes additional support for our contention that aksentijevic gibson complexity represents a useful addition to the hydrological toolbox given the sensitivity of ag to periodicities future research will focus on disruptions in periodic complexity functions which might signal significant geophysical or human generated changes to the ecosystem of equal interest are short range 1 day to 1 month and long range 10 years rhythms the former are potentially important as indices of local ecological conditions while the latter could provide useful information on the structure and idiosyncrasies of macro hydrological and geological processes which are currently accessible only via traditional informational measures finally given the deliberately restricted scope of the current study one aim is to examine a global gamut of hydrological regimes in terms of complexity credit authorship contribution statement aleksandar

profit sectors appendix the logic and informal derivation of ag complexity one of the puzzling details associated with the study of information and complexity is that the titans of this field shannon and kolmogorov never provided a clear definition of either term e g kolmogorov 1987 shannon 1948 rather these are arrived at as secondary products of the mathematical treatment of topics such as cost of communication shannon or efficacy of algorithmic encoding kolmogorov for instance shannon determines the uncertainty of a binary string based on the probabilities frequencies of the symbols contained therein the highest uncertainty entropy information content or indirectly complexity is found in strings with equal proportions of symbols thus all of these are considered maximally entropic and complex 000000111111 010101010101 110011001100 000111000111 000011001111 011010001110 etc it is easily noticed that the above strings differ in terms of their patterning structure and that the first one is simpler contains less information than the last one and while it is true that 000000000001 is simpler than 011010001110 so are all the other strings shown above consequently probabilistic entropy based on quantity is not well suited to the investigation of complexity which implies interconnectedness between different structural levels kolmogorov s idea to equate complexity with randomness and simplicity with ease of algorithmic encoding has brought us closer to the intuitive meaning of complexity simple periodic strings such as 000111000111 are encoded by short algorithms of the form 000111 x n where n is the number of repetitions of the period however the compressibility argument suffers from the absence of a consistent mapping between algorithms and their outputs as shown in many instances ostensibly simple algorithms can produce complex outputs e g logistic map may 1976 and vice versa any complex algorithm can be tweaked to output a periodic string consequently compressibility can serve as a conceptual template but not a foundation of a method for measuring complexity in the aksentijevic gibson paradigm complexity is ultimately a perceptual and cognitive in other words subjective phenomenon the same is true of information which is important only to agents in possession of limited resources the most basic and primal definition of information is change in agreement with shannon ag considers information to be equivalent to entropy loss of energy needed to process change and complexity aksentijevic gibson 2012a 2012b here we give examples of how ag is computed and how it captures the regularities in a streamflow series in the current paper each streamflow series was binarized values below the mean were assigned a 0 and those above a 1 since the binarized time series for the relevant river segments do not contain changes at very low levels 2 or 3 we have created a string that satisfies this requirement in order to illustrate the workings of ag take a string l 10 fig 12 a at the lowest level comparing adjacent symbols from left to right there are six changes next symbol pairs are compared redundantly 01 10 10 01 01 11 and so on an ordered sequence which catalogues individual changes over time or steps is called a change transform see fig 12b highlight change transform at level 1 changes between substrings are computed for all levels up to l 1 when all change transforms are laid on top of each other a structure map is obtained that represents a complete change record of a string fig 12b a sequence tallying changes across levels is called a complexity profile fig 12d solid line the complexity profile represents a quantitative record of the cost of scanning memorizing reproducing a pattern different profile entries levels of structure are not mutually independent the relationship is best understood starting from level l 1 if there are a lot of changes there generally more changes are likely to be found at other levels the exception to this rule is the core pattern 10101010 which represents the foundation of the measure and is not taken into account when computing the complexity of real life data it contains the maximum number of changes at level 1 and no changes at higher levels 4 4 its unit complexity is an outlier that disproportionately affects the mean complexity of any set of patterns the same is true of other very simple strings consisting of short periods e g 00110011 001001001 etc a complexity profile contains a great deal of information about a pattern but the way in which different entries are weighted affects the final complexity value currently each profile entry is weighted by the maximum possible number of changes at that level l j for a string l 10 the maximum number of changes at level 1 is nine 0101010101 this decreases by one only to finish with one possible change at level l 1 this solution was chosen because it maintains a good balance between sensitivity number of distinct complexity values and stability similar values for similar patterns it so happens that this weighting scheme is very successful in modeling the complexity in diverse contexts from psychology to environmental sciences in the remainder of the appendix we show how ag captures seasonal drops in complexity visual inspection of the binarized series for bos d the first river segment on the list shows a highly regular seesaw pattern with 5 10 month minima followed by a 3 5 month maxima fig 13 the trough highlighted in red is an 8 month minimum which starts at step 65 spring 1971 it is flanked by 5 month runs of suprathreshold values and appears nine times over the course of measurement of bos d when the binary flow series is converted into a running ag series the 8 month subthreshold runs are captured by the ag window l 8 the running complexity procedure is described in fig 14 as the window l 8 moves to the right the complexity of the adjacent windows is low but not zero a zero trough is registered only when the ag window l 8 detects a zero complexity run l 8 a sufficient number of these occur within the sample to allow ag to capture its meta period however the presence of minima of different sizes suggests that an elaboration of the current technique is necessary rather than restricting the analysis to a few windows it is possible to create an exhaustive structure map by plotting all running complexity series from 1 to l 1 in a vertical sequence this would provide a detailed picture of the evolution and extinction of a low complexity region enabling a more substantive causal inference 
4567,globally speaking groundwater is the predominant source of water for populations living in arid and semiarid regions the tools used to assess the quality of this resource contribute to the water security of the populations that depend on it this study evaluated the quality of groundwater sampled from 22 monitored wells in the araripe sedimentary basin asb located in the brazilian semiarid region we used probability curves to identify the critical variables and a regional water quality index wqir to assess groundwater quality the national sanitation foundation index wqinsf was adapted using multivariate statistical analyses the principal component analysis pca was employed to determine the principal water quality parameters and their weights gis technology was used to build geospatial behavior maps for the hydrogeochemical variables the results for the variables phosphorus nitrate n thermotolerant coliforms ph and turbidity exceeded the regulatory limits mainly in areas affected by anthropogenic sources with an insufficient sewage network nitrate n and turbidity had a marked seasonal behavior the wqir showed that the aquifer s waters can be classified mainly as regular 18 2 or good 82 8 the spatial behavior maps of the hydrogeochemical variables and the wqir allow us to prioritize those areas requiring mitigation and monitoring actions the water quality curves and the wqir are important tools for the management and handling of aquifers this study contributes to the assessment of water quality by policy makers and stakeholders enabling the planning and management of groundwater resources keywords water quality index groundwater quality hydrogeochemistry semiarid region water security water management 1 introduction groundwater is the source of approximately one third of the freshwater consumed to meet all domestic industrial and agricultural needs of the planet especially in arid and semiarid regions where surface water is scarce and unevenly distributed chen et al 2018 in brazil groundwater is a valuable water resource for public and private consumers with a total collected volume above 17 5 km3 year 1 557 m3s 1 taken from more than 2 5 million tubular wells this resource is essential for the national economy and for the health of the population both in rural and urban areas hirata et al 2019 water quality is usually cited as a limiting factor in proposing certain anthropic activities in a region tundisi and tundisi 2016 zhang et al 2018 parrone et al 2020 therefore knowing the physical chemical and biological properties of groundwater resources has a significant role in defining what these resources can be used for human consumption irrigation industrial uses and others zhang et al 2018 schwartz et al 2019 parrone et al 2020 it is well known that pollution from increased agricultural activities industrial development and population growth is becoming a serious problem that clearly compromises the quality of groundwater tundisi and tundisi 2016 mentions that climate change the deterioration of surface water quality and an ever increasing water demand have exponentially increased the usage of groundwater therefore an efficient management of the water resources requires knowledge about the dynamics of the hydrogeological environment and its impact on groundwater quality varnier et al 2017 sindico et al 2018 hirata et al 2019 under this scenario there is an intense search for tools that can optimize costs and time in solving such water related problems zotou et al 2019 charoula et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 physical chemical and bacteriological testing is used to understand the quality of groundwater varnier et al 2017 gabr et al 2020 however the results are complex as they comprise many parameters that are usually systematized for publication and that in general provide a comprehensive assessment of the water quality zhang et al 2019 costa et al 2020 fang et al 2020 with that in mind water quality indexes wqi were developed to address this question and also to facilitate the reporting of the obtained results de paula filho et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wqis incorporate many water quality variables into a single number expressing the quality of the tested water this methodology can help managing the groundwater resources of semiarid regions in developing countries with insufficient water monitoring systems such as in the northeast of brazil brhane 2018 costa et al 2020 gabr et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in this regard the use of indexes that reflect the quality of surface and groundwater has been an important tool as they are the representation of a comprehensive amount of information barilari et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 jha et al 2020 however we should emphasize the need for regionalization of such an index as the vast majority of country wide indexes are based on international standards which differ largely from the regional characteristics of the waters almeida and oliveira 2017 zhang et al 2019 gaikwad et al 2020 jha et al 2020 when defining a new index with a linear combination of variables it is desirable to use multivariate techniques containing the largest amount of information provided by the set of selected variables ferreira et al 2015 gaikwad et al 2020 likewise an important strategy for adapting an index intended to determine the quality of a specific water body is to readjust the weights of each variable component de paula filho et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 this study seeks to assess the groundwater quality and propose a water quality index for the monitored wells in the araripe sedimentary basin located in the semiarid northeast of brazil the formulation of an index suited to the local conditions will contribute to the better management of the multiple groundwater uses and to the water security of the populations living in arid and semiarid regions 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area comprises the

differences are the result of the intrinsic characteristics of each system their lithologic units porosity permeability depth of the static level veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 the classification according to the god level groundwater occurrence overall lithology of aquifer or aquitard and depth to groundwater of the asb foster et al 2006 indicated a slope zone and adjacent areas with a low to medium vulnerability resulting from the low porosity and permeability of the lithotypes permeability and porosity at the plateau and pediplain areas are higher thus resulting in a more significant natural vulnerability of the underlying aquifers veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 moreover the shallower static levels of the pediplain areas may favor the migration and access of certain pollutant species further increasing the risk of groundwater contamination in this context the 22 wells monitored in this study are located within the pediplain zone and overlap with the middle and lower aquifers these the wells are being overused mainly those located in urban areas and with depths ranging between 20 and 150 m cprm 2012 gomes and cavalcante 2017 the recharge of the middle aquifer system comes from the direct infiltration of rainwater 98 and underground springs 2 the monitoring carried out by the local water management authority estimates a water volume of 139 million and 26 million m3 stored in the middle and lower aquifers respectively cprm 2012 camacho and oliveira 2017 despite the intermittent nature of rivers in the semiarid region the natural discharge of the middle and lower aquifers partially guarantees the perennial nature of some stretches of the region s hydrographic network 2 2 groundwater sample collection data from 22 public supply wells located in predominantly urban areas were used the set of wells monitored in this study corresponded to 30 of the total destined for public supply in the eastern sector of the asb cprm 2012 the time series comprises data monitored in 8 seasonal campaigns between 2014 and 2018 made available by the ceará water management company cogerh 0 5 l polyethylene bottles were used to collect the water samples the bottles were previously washed with distilled water the monitored wells were purged at low flow according to standardized sampling protocols abnt 2010 thus regardless of the existing variability in the depths of the wells the purging method ensures that water representative of the formation was captured in order to reflect the chemistry of the groundwater with the least possible uncertainty all samples used in the research were collected after purging at a depth of 30 m in the field a multiparametric probe hanna instruments model hi 98194 was used to monitor the hydrogeological parameters temperature t dissolved oxygen do ph total dissolved solids tds and turbidity ntu hanna instruments model hi 98703 phosphorus p po4 3 nitrate n n no3 biochemical oxygen demand bod and thermotolerant coliforms ttc were determined in the laboratory following the procedures described in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d 2 3 statistical approach a descriptive statistical analysis and empirical quality curves were prepared using the excel software version 2016 the shapiro wilk test was used to assess data normality a hypothesis test was used according to the data distribution behavior parametric or non parametric in order to assess the seasonal behavior of the variables following the behavior of the distribution a correlation coefficient rank was used for measuring the degree of similarity between the hydrogeochemical variables the adequacy of the pca to the asb s hydrogeochemical dataset was tested through the application of the bartlett s sphericity and kaiser meyer olkin kmo tests using the built in function of the redas package r freeware v 0 9 1 bartlett 1951 kaiser 1974 maier 2014 the multivariate principal component analysis pca was used to formulate the wqir using the statistica software version 7 0 the same software was used to prepare the box plot graphics a varimax rotation was applied to the compounds extracted with pca to optimize the solution all measured variables were used for the pca the optimal number of factors extracted was obtained based on the scree plot criterion considering only components with eigenvalues greater than 1 ferreira et al 2015 cecconello et al 2018 2 4 empirical cumulative distributions plots empirical cumulative distributions plots were used to analyze the behavior of each of the hydrogeochemical variables against the allowable thresholds and quality standards established for water intended for human consumption brasil 2008 2017 from the set of raw data we inferred the cumulative probability of non conformity between the obtained values ant the respective groundwater thresholds table 1 the estimated cumulative probability distribution function was used which indicates how often a random variable x concentration of a tested water quality parameter is less than or equal to argument x maximum values allowed by current regulations the value of the cumulative distribution function f x for each real number x is given by eq 1 1 f x p x x p x x is the probability for the variable x to have a value lower than or equal to x the probability to be considered refers to those cases in which it exceeds or does not exceed the value of f x for an x equal to the environmental regulatory standard of each variable under the brazilian legislation brasil 2008 2017 table 1 2 5 wqi calibration using a multivariate analysis the regionalized groundwater quality index wqir considers the same variables as the index of the national sanitation foundation wqinsf and was obtained based on factorial scores according to the degree of relevance of each variable under study the pca allowed us to calibrate the wqir from the dataset collected on the monitoring campaigns this multivariate method is widely used to assess the mechanisms affecting the quality of surface and groundwater badillo camacho et al 2015 gomes and cavalcante 2017 cecconello et al 2018 costa et al 2020 the pca gives the relationship between the variables showing the individual participation of the physical chemical and biological ones the factors or components were generated by the transformation of the original dataset into a correlation matrix and such factors led to a new set of variables called principal components pc which in turn allowed the formulation of new weights for the calculation of the wqir when formulating the wqir the sum of the weights of all individual parameters must be equal to 1 a mathematical transformation was performed on the highest factor loadings that is the normalization of data expressed in different units into values ranging from 0 to 1 by dividing each of the values by the total sum of the factor loadings thus obtaining the calibrated weights cecconello et al 2018 the mathematical formulation is based on the principle that the weighted product of the groundwater quality values of the studied variables is raised to the weight defined for each variable according to their importance pursuant to eq 2 2 wqi r i 1 n q i w i the wqir has a value between 0 and 100 where q i is the quality rating of the ith parameter a number between 0 and 100 obtained from the respective average quality variation curve depending on its concentration or measure and wi is the weight of the ith parameter a number between 0 and 1 assigned according to its importance in explaining the global variability of the water quality and n is the number of variables in the wqir calculation the quality of the monitored water is then classified according to the ratings the classification divide groundwater quality into five categories according to the wqi value excellent 79 wqi 100 good 51 wqi 79 regular 36 wqi 51 bad 19 wqi 36 and very bad wqi 19 waters classified as regular to excellent are appropriate for conventional human consumption treatment bad and very bad waters need advanced treatments if intended for human consumption cetesb 2020 2 6 data spatialization to analyze the spatial behavior of the variables distribution maps based on gis technology were created when used to build forecast surfaces based on limited data it allows a reduction in monitoring costs fang et al 2020 the geostatistical distribution maps for hydrogeochemical variables and water quality index considered the average data values in each monitored well qgis version 3 10 was used to create maps used in the study to display the wells locations and spatial distribution the maps were drawn using the map composer of the qgis freeware the shape used for the delimitation of the basin was obtained from the website of the mineral resources research company cprm the coordinates of each well were obtained with a gnss receiver during the samplings made at each site 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal and spatial behavior of the hydrogeochemical variables table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the dataset obtained from the 22 monitored wells in relation to the maximum allowable values in drinking water mav brasil 2008 2017 there is no mav for phosphorus in drinking water in brazil in this case it was considered the natural background value of 0 03 mg l 1 on average the tested samples were within the reference values except for phosphorus nitrate n and thermotolerant coliforms nitrate is regarded in terms of n having an mav of 10 mg l 1 temperature has no reference values for natural waters according to phil eze 2010 a cv 20 indicates low variability 21 cv 50 is regarded as moderate variability 51 cv 100 indicates high variability and cv 100 is considered to be a very high variability considering this classification and the cv results presented in table 1 temperature ph bod and phosphorus showed a low to moderate variability while tds and do showed a high variability in the monitoring period turbidity nitrate n and thermotolerant coliforms showed a very high variability the monitoring was carried out during the most severe and prolonged drought recorded in the brazilian northeast in the last 60 years for six consecutive years 2012 2017 rainfall levels were up to 50 below the average for the region 600 mm affecting the recharge of the aquifers and the hydrogeochemical quality conditions marengo et al 2018 cunha et al 2019 shubo et al 2020 considering the environmental conditions which resulted in a long drought and a lesser aquifer recharge we performed a comparison of means in order to check whether the monitored variables showed a seasonal variation preliminarily we applied the shapiro wilk s normality test which proved that nitrate n turbidity tds bod and do did not follow a normal distribution pattern p 0 05 the wilcoxon non parametric test was then applied to compare the means the variables t ph bod do tds p po4 3 and ttc did not show statistically significant differences among the different periods fig 2 shows the distribution maps and ranges of values found for the hydrogeochemical variables throughout the monitoring period the well water in higher areas close to the slope zone were generally below 28 3 c cooler than those located in the pediplain while wells located at altitudes below 450 m and around urban areas were warmer approaching 30 c the narrower soil layers the urban impermeable surfaces and the higher ambient temperatures may have contributed to this result fig 2a the mean ph values were above the lower limit provided for by brazilian regulations and did not exceed the upper threshold 9 5 however 33 of the samples showed values below the lower ph threshold ph 6 0 fig 2b there was a differentiation between two different sectors of the basin mainly related to the type of soil predominating in each sector wells in areas with predominantly deeper acidic oxisols tend to have a more acidic ph in their waters p6 to p19 on the other hand wells in areas with thinner soils upon the bedrock litholic soils tend to have higher ph values p1 p4 p5 and p22 because of the nonnormality of the data a spearman rank correlation matrix was used p 0 05 the ph showed significant inverse correlation with nitrate n r 0 52 and positive with do r 0 56 during the monitoring period do concentrations were below 5 0 mg l 1 in all wells fig 2c and in terms of saturation we could see two distinct sectors the first one includes the wells located in areas of greater urban density where do concentrations ranged between 0 7 and 1 5 mg l 1 in the second sector which included areas where rural activities predominate concentrations were on average higher than 1 7 mg l 1 p13 reaching as high as 3 7 mg l 1 p12 as it has no contact with the surface groundwater tends to have low oxygen concentrations in general tds values were lower than the mav fig 2d wells close to the highest areas of the plateau had tds values below 256 mg l 1 on the other hand those located in intensely urbanized areas p13 to p19 were above 360 mg l 1 there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the values of tds and nitrate n r 0 67 the natural hydrogeological characteristics provide for a greater dissolution and accumulation of solids as the climate the weathering of rocks and the contact with litholic soils promote the diffusion of such solids into the aqueous environment andrade et al 2012 alencar et al 2019 according to gomes and cavalcante 2017 the increase in tds depends on climatic conditions with the highest concentrations of salts occurring during the dry season bod expresses the amount of molecular oxygen needed to mineralize organic matter aerobically decomposed by living organisms there is no standard established in the brazilian regulations for this variable as indicated by hazelton and murphy 2007 typical bod values in unpolluted natural waters are below 5 0 mg o2 l 1 a bod level between 1 0 and 2 0 mg o2 l 1 is an indication of very clean water 3 0 to 5 0 mg o2 l 1 moderately clean water and a bod 5 mg o2 l 1 means that there is a nearby source of pollution at bod levels of 100 mg o2 l 1 or higher the water supply is considered to be heavily polluted with organic waste bod values were less than 5 0 mg o2 l 1 in all wells evaluated during the monitoring therefore the waters of the asb wells are moderately free of organic pollution well p4 presented the highest bod 3 9 mg o2 l 1 fig 2e factors related to the agricultural use of the soil and a greater vulnerability to organic contamination may explain this result wells in more densely populated areas with low sewage coverage are more prone to percolation of organic contaminants found in effluents such as in p17 p18 and p19 when evaluating the physical chemical and microbiological quality of groundwater in the southwest of the state of bahia ne brazil dourado et al 2018 obtained bod readings between 17 3 mg l 1 and 20 1 mg l 1 higher than those obtained in this study for the asb thermotolerant coliforms ttc and escherichia coli were found in all monitored wells with higher values in areas of greater urban density fig 2f a deficient collection and treatment of domestic sewage is the main driver of microbiological groundwater pollution alves et al 2008 abdelkader et al 2012 dourado et al 2018 elevated ttc levels were found in p4 11680 mpn 100 ml p6 1102 mpn 100 ml p7 251 mpn 100 ml p11 308 mpn 100 ml and p16 1782 mpn 100 ml ttc and turbidity showed a statistically significant correlation r 0 54 for the data set coliform contaminated wells is a recurrent problem in ne brazil mainly due to a deficient domestic sewage collection and treatment infrastructure hirata et al 2019 phosphorus concentrations exceeded the natural background level 0 03 mg l 1 in all wells the highest readings 0 50 mg l 1 were found in wells p1 p20 and p18 located in a rural area with sparse vegetation on exposed soil and on urban soil respectively fig 2g these results are similar to those reported by oliveira et al 2019 who assessed the hydrochemistry of wells in rural areas of ne brazil finding excessive phosphorus values in 65 of the tested samples phosphates in water can have a natural origin resulting from the decomposition of biological matter and the leaching of minerals they may also have an anthropogenic origin resulting from the leaching of agricultural fertilizers or from failing wastewater treatment processes fang et al 2020 the insufficient sewage infrastructure throughout the asb and a poor effluent management contribute to the pollution of surface and groundwater resources as a result of a disorderly urban expansion there was a progressive reduction in the sewage system coverage rate from 2006 to 2015 coverage decreased from 52 18 to 37 24 as the sewage collection network could not keep up with urban growth sousa et al 2020 only nitrate n and turbidity showed a statistically significant difference between the rainy and dry seasons p 0 05 fig 3 shows the seasonal behavior of the concentrations of nitrate n and turbidity the median concentration of nitrate n in the rainy season 5 1 mg no3 l 1 was higher than the one found in the dry period 4 5 mg n no3 l 1 an inverse behavior was observed for turbidity which went from 0 41 ntu in the dry season to 0 60 ntu in the rainy one when analyzing the interrelationship between hydrogeochemical variables in an aquifer in nigeria adekunle et al 2007 determined a positive significant correlation p 0 05 between turbidity and nitrate n r 0 70 in the present study the mean turbidity values in the dry and rainy seasons were 3 3 and 1 3 ntu respectively in both climatic seasons nitrate n concentrations in the waters of the urban areas of the asb were high p13 to p19 being up to 1 7 to 5 5 times higher than the mav 17 mg l 1 in p19 and 54 1 mg l 1 in p16 on the other hand rural areas with a high nitrogen supply well drained soils and little vegetation which are very common in the asb pose a particular risk of groundwater nitrate contamination igrac 2014 these areas therefore need to be monitored having in mind that agricultural practices are heavily dependent on the use of chemical fertilizers natural nitrate n concentrations were generally lower than 10 mg l 1 however the results in fig 3 a show the influence of human activities on nutrient concentrations in the basin s most urbanized areas the limited coverage of the sewage collection network in the region 20 contributes to this result furthermore the use of single household sewage treatment mechanisms i e septic tanks predominates in the region just like the disposal of raw effluents into streams and rivers significantly affecting the quality of groundwater abdalla and khalil 2018 the large scale use of septic tanks may strongly affect the quality of groundwater due to the propagation of the effluent plume which may percolate to the aquifer barilari et al 2020 the extreme turbidity values in the waters of wells p6 and p16 were recorded in both climatic seasons fig 3b they were above the potability standards required by brazilian regulations with mean values reaching 5 5 ntu p16 in the dry season and 8 1 ntu p6 in the rainy one with the arrival of the rainy season and the consequent recharge of the aquifers there was a mild increase in the turbidity readings of the monitored wells this can be explained by the geological characteristics of the asb as it has cover strata composed mainly of sandstones overlaid by unconsolidated clay sediments 3 2 regulatory compliance of the wells the empirical cumulative distribution plots on fig 4 show the compliance or noncompliance of the results of a given hydrogeochemical variable with the maximum allowable values established by the countrýs regulations brasil 2008 2017 close to 32 70 of the tested samples had ph values outside the allowable range established by brazilian regulations for groundwater 6 0 9 5 table 1 wells p4 5 92 p7 4 43 p8 5 17 p9 5 64 p15 5 52 p16 5 47 p17 5 17 and p18 4 26 presented mean values below the mav fig 4a previous studies conducted on water from tubular wells also located in the asb reported ph readings ranging between 6 2 and 7 6 franca et al 2006 close to 5 7 of all turbidity results were above the mav fig 4b especially in the rainy season this occurred in 19 out of the 22 monitored wells the results that did not exceed the mav showed range between 0 1 and 4 8 ntu the concentrations of total dissolved solids ranged between 48 5 and 952 mg l 1 table 1 while 100 of the tested samples had concentrations lower than the allowable regulatory threshold fig 4c even though there is no regulatory limit for dissolved oxygen the obtained readings are within those normally found in groundwater fig 4d it is normal to find low do concentrations in groundwater as this resource has little or no contact with the atmosphere on the other hand low do concentrations can also be related to polluting sources where o2 is consumed in the decomposition of abundant biological material brasil 2017 nitrate n and phosphate showed the highest number of readings not in compliance with the regulatory limits 41 30 of the tested samples had nitrate n concentrations above 10 mg l 1 fig 4e as previously discussed this can be mainly attributed to anthropogenic contamination by domestic effluents the other results were in accordance with the mav values varied between 0 1 and 9 75 mg l 1 phosphorus is also considered a critical groundwater quality variable in the asb fig 4f a geochemical mechanism that may have contributed to this result is soil saturation and the low oxygen saturation conditions of the aquifer allowing the release of orthophosphate into the water when sorption sites on mineral surfaces are saturated with orthophosphate or other ions any additional orthophosphate added to the water will remain in solution likewise when the soil approaches or reaches saturation the dissolved phosphorus can be transported to deeper portions of the unsaturated zone and to the underlying aquifer as the soil s water leaches down at low oxygen concentrations iron oxides can dissolve and release the adsorbed phosphorus back into the water with a consequent increase in the dissolved phosphorus concentrations however this mechanism needs to be better evaluated in the asb as the dissolution of iron oxides in the aquifer also depends on biological mechanisms carried out by specific bacteria domagalski and johnson 2012 king et al 2015 the biochemical oxygen demand bod results showed means ranging from 2 80 to 3 97 mg l 1 table 1 which are within the regulatory limits fig 4g 100 of the samples had thermotolerant coliform e coli levels above the regulatory limits fig 4h out of 154 raw water samples 85 had 1 mpn 11 had 2 to 1000 mpn and the remaining 4 had 11 000 to 93 300 mpn these results are an indication of fecal contamination and of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in a groundwater quality study conducted in riachão do jacuípe in the state of bahia brazil almeida and mello 2019 detected the presence of thermotolerant coliforms in 100 and e coli in 66 7 of the monitored wells the rating of the waters of each well was defined based on the monitored hydrogeochemical variables considering that such waters are predominantly used for human consumption all the wells were in compliance with the regulations in terms of turbidity total dissolved solids and biological oxygen demand however all the wells were noncompliant on phosphorus and coliforms eight wells had a mean ph lower than that required by the regulations and none exceeded the maximum allowed ph wells p15 p16 p17 and p18 had a greater number of variables in violation of the respective mav brasil 2008 2017 considering the groundwater rating guidelines provided for in the brazilian environmental legislation brasil 2008 2017 all the wells can be rated as class ii these waters can therefore be used for human consumption after a conventional water treatment as they had at least one variable not in compliance with the mavs brasil 2008 2017 despite the limited number of parameters in this classification it is important to note that the chosen ones have critical effects on the quality of groundwater in several arid and semiarid regions worldwide as such parameters affect the predominant uses of such waters ferreira et al 2015 dourado et al 2018 maia et al 2019 gaikwad et al 2020 3 3 regionalized wqi for the araripe sedimentary basin a quality index adjusted to the hydrogeochemical conditions of the asb is herein proposed as a tool for the assessment of the groundwater quality in the basin according to the bartlett s sphericity test the parson s correlation matrix involving the hydrogeochemical variables data has been significantly different from an identity matrix the obtained p value was significantly less than 0 05 p 2 2 10 16 the result of the kmo test confirmed that the sample was adequate or sufficient kmo 0 5 and that the data set is suitable for component analysis the scree plot obtained from the eigenvalues showed that considering the entire data set the first four components are the most significant the eigenvalues for each pc comply with the exclusion criteria where each component must show a variance higher than that showed by a simple variable pc1 2 46 pc2 1 55 pc3 1 20 and pc4 1 10 the first four factors explain approximately 70 of the total variance fig 5 shows the largest factor loadings identified for each hydrogeochemical variable in the above mentioned four components the first pc represents the linear combination explaining the maximum variance of the sample whose largest factor loadings were related to nitrate n 0 892 ph 0 800 tds 0 744 and do 0 598 on pc2 the variables with the largest loading are related to the water s organic pollution bod 0 844 and ttc 0 830 p po4 3 0 835 is the most significant variable on pc3 followed by turbidity 0 791 and t 0 551 on pc4 the calibration of the wqir table 2 was done after these results a wqi must be designed for a specific situation occurring within the context of a given hydrographic basin and accounting for the urban industrial diversity of the region the use and occupation of the soil and the regional development pattern zotou et al 2019 charoula et al 2020 jha et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 thus considering the calibrated weights wi the order of relevance of the variables to define the water quality in the asb is nitrate n bod p po4 3 ttc ph turbidity tds do t in contrast with the wqinsf where do and ttc are the most important variables in empirical models the weights of each attribute are influenced by climatic factors geological settings environmental variations and land and water uses ferreira et al 2015 by using multivariate statistics for the selection and grouping of water quality indicators fang et al 2020 were able to assess the most important physical and chemical characteristics of the water to explain the variability in the groundwater quality in dagu river basin china 3 4 temporal and spatial analysis of the water quality a groundwater quality index wqir for the araripe sedimentary basin adapted to the conditions of the brazilian semiarid region was formulated using a multivariate analysis to obtain new weights the results obtained for the regionalized index considering the mean values obtained for each variable were compared with the values obtained for wqinsf in the 22 monitored wells fig 6 according to the original nsf index 9 1 of the monitored wells would have a poor water quality 36 4 a good water quality and 54 4 a regular water quality only wells p7 33 9 and p16 33 0 showed a poor water quality while at p20 the most expressive value of wqinsf 64 4 was observed likewise wells p2 p3 p12 and p22 presented wqinsf values above 60 after adapting the index to the regional conditions the water quality of the wells was good 81 8 of the wells or regular 18 2 wells p7 44 5 p16 42 6 p17 47 1 and p18 46 6 had the lowest index values ranked as regular most of them are located in areas with a medium to high vulnerability to the contamination of the aquifer systems the pediplain domain that is with greater susceptibility of the water body to be affected by a polluting load veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 on the other hand wells p2 76 p3 72 5 p20 72 1 and p22 71 7 were those with the highest index levels fig 6 these wells have in common their location close to the slope zone 450 600 m this sector within the asb has a low to medium natural vulnerability to contamination of the aquifer systems that is there is a lesser susceptibility of the water body to be affected by a polluting load veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 this may in part explain the better water quality in these wells all monitored wells showed that the regionalized index provided higher quality values than those attributed by the wqinsf this result reinforces the need to adapt the index to the local or regional specificities as otherwise an incorrect scenario may be construed leading to failures in the management of the groundwater resources considering that public supply is the predominant use for these waters the wqinsf results demonstrate the need for the waters of wells p7 and p16 to receive an advanced treatment on the other hand considering the results of wqir conventional disinfection treatment is the one indicated for all the other wells thus there is an evident need give particular attention to wells p7 and p16 they are transitioning between the regular and poor quality conditions despite the advantages a wqi has for the management of surface and groundwater resources we must consider the limitations as well inherent to any such model each method has its own merits and flaws and is limited to a certain spectrum of applicable situations dao et al 2020 one such limitation is the eclipsing effect resulting from the aggregation of countless environmental variables into one single number which may result in the attenuation of the negative impact of one of those variables by the stable behavior of the others smith 1990 dao et al 2020 the indices proposed in the literature use different mathematical ways to obtain the wqis aiming to minimize subjectivity and uncertainty and seeking not to be affected by neither overrating eclipsing nor underrating ambiguity de paula filho et al 2020 zotou et al 2019 charoula et al 2020 dao et al 2020 jha et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the approach used in this study shows wqir results as a function of the average value of each monitored hydrogeochemical variable it was then possible to obtain a general picture of the quality of the groundwater used to supply the human population throughout the asb therefore this approach does not consider possible temporal variations in the water quality of the monitored wells notwithstanding the above the representativity of the sampling and the number of wells assessed in the seasonal campaigns covering 30 of all wells used for public water supply reduces the uncertainty regarding the wqir for the monitored period fig 7 shows the distribution map with the spatial behavior of the wqir for the araripe basin throughout the entire monitoring period the distribution map shows a clear water quality sectorization in the basin the lowest quality indexes are predominantly found in urban areas p6 to p19 but also in areas with a lower urban density yet influenced by the agricultural use of the soil p1 and p4 in these areas the waters mostly had a regular quality wells with higher wqir values are associated with low urban density areas in more forested microbasins p20 the use of quality indexes to infer the status of groundwater resources is an important management and communication tool in arid and semiarid areas of developing countries brhane 2018 these regions usually lack permanent monitoring programs which makes it difficult for managers to make adequate decisions brhane 2018 analyzed the quality of groundwater in the tigray region of ethiopiás semiarid using the weighted arithmetic index method rating 95 5 of the wells in the region as excellent while the other wells had water of poor or inadequate quality for human consumption distribution maps also contribute to the understanding of the spatial behavior of hydrogeochemical variables and aquifer quality conditions the spatial behavior of the variables and indexes makes it possible to make informed decisions such as prioritizing areas for immediate mitigation and monitoring actions this tool was applied to groundwater in the city of qus in upper egypt where it revealed a high risk of sewage contamination of the local groundwater resources abdalla and khalil 2018 4 conclusion the spatial and temporal comprehensiveness of the dataset generated in the monitoring allowed us to get a representative picture of the groundwater quality conditions in the asb for the studied period the results show that the waters of all studied wells were beyond the limits recommended by current regulations for at least one hydrogeochemical variable the water quality is mainly affected in wells located in highly urbanized and agricultural areas due to the prolonged drought most of the monitored variables did not show any difference in their behavior during the rainy and dry seasons only nitrate n and turbidity were seasonally affected the empirical cumulative distribution plots allowed identify the hydrogeochemical variables with the most frequent rate of noncompliance with the class 2 maximum allowable values allowed under the brazilian legislation the application of multivariate statistical tools makes it possible to adjust the weights of the attributes and to calibrate the empirical model for the calculation of the wqir thus making the index suitable for the conditions of the brazilian semiarid the calibrated weights for hydrochemical variables followed the order nitrate n bod p po4 3 ttc ph turbidity tds od t this allowed correcting distortions inherent to the use of models prepared for hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical conditions that are different than those of the semiarid region the wqir results showed that 18 2 and 81 8 of the wells had waters with regular and good quality respectively under these conditions the groundwater from 22 wells monitored in the asb could be considered suitable for human consumption after conventional treatment on the other hand these results show that measures must be taken to control and reduce the nutrient and organic loads mainly in urban areas aiming to contain the negative effects of such loads on the quality of aquifer waters in this case such measures must be mainly directed to the upgrade of sewage treatment systems in the different counties of the asb the wqir can be used as an important aquifer management and handling tool in semiarid areas of developing countries it can also help in reducing uncertainties and in the drafting of public policies aimed to technically manage groundwater resources at the same time it

4567,globally speaking groundwater is the predominant source of water for populations living in arid and semiarid regions the tools used to assess the quality of this resource contribute to the water security of the populations that depend on it this study evaluated the quality of groundwater sampled from 22 monitored wells in the araripe sedimentary basin asb located in the brazilian semiarid region we used probability curves to identify the critical variables and a regional water quality index wqir to assess groundwater quality the national sanitation foundation index wqinsf was adapted using multivariate statistical analyses the principal component analysis pca was employed to determine the principal water quality parameters and their weights gis technology was used to build geospatial behavior maps for the hydrogeochemical variables the results for the variables phosphorus nitrate n thermotolerant coliforms ph and turbidity exceeded the regulatory limits mainly in areas affected by anthropogenic sources with an insufficient sewage network nitrate n and turbidity had a marked seasonal behavior the wqir showed that the aquifer s waters can be classified mainly as regular 18 2 or good 82 8 the spatial behavior maps of the hydrogeochemical variables and the wqir allow us to prioritize those areas requiring mitigation and monitoring actions the water quality curves and the wqir are important tools for the management and handling of aquifers this study contributes to the assessment of water quality by policy makers and stakeholders enabling the planning and management of groundwater resources keywords water quality index groundwater quality hydrogeochemistry semiarid region water security water management 1 introduction groundwater is the source of approximately one third of the freshwater consumed to meet all domestic industrial and agricultural needs of the planet especially in arid and semiarid regions where surface water is scarce and unevenly distributed chen et al 2018 in brazil groundwater is a valuable water resource for public and private consumers with a total collected volume above 17 5 km3 year 1 557 m3s 1 taken from more than 2 5 million tubular wells this resource is essential for the national economy and for the health of the population both in rural and urban areas hirata et al 2019 water quality is usually cited as a limiting factor in proposing certain anthropic activities in a region tundisi and tundisi 2016 zhang et al 2018 parrone et al 2020 therefore knowing the physical chemical and biological properties of groundwater resources has a significant role in defining what these resources can be used for human consumption irrigation industrial uses and others zhang et al 2018 schwartz et al 2019 parrone et al 2020 it is well known that pollution from increased agricultural activities industrial development and population growth is becoming a serious problem that clearly compromises the quality of groundwater tundisi and tundisi 2016 mentions that climate change the deterioration of surface water quality and an ever increasing water demand have exponentially increased the usage of groundwater therefore an efficient management of the water resources requires knowledge about the dynamics of the hydrogeological environment and its impact on groundwater quality varnier et al 2017 sindico et al 2018 hirata et al 2019 under this scenario there is an intense search for tools that can optimize costs and time in solving such water related problems zotou et al 2019 charoula et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 physical chemical and bacteriological testing is used to understand the quality of groundwater varnier et al 2017 gabr et al 2020 however the results are complex as they comprise many parameters that are usually systematized for publication and that in general provide a comprehensive assessment of the water quality zhang et al 2019 costa et al 2020 fang et al 2020 with that in mind water quality indexes wqi were developed to address this question and also to facilitate the reporting of the obtained results de paula filho et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wqis incorporate many water quality variables into a single number expressing the quality of the tested water this methodology can help managing the groundwater resources of semiarid regions in developing countries with insufficient water monitoring systems such as in the northeast of brazil brhane 2018 costa et al 2020 gabr et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in this regard the use of indexes that reflect the quality of surface and groundwater has been an important tool as they are the representation of a comprehensive amount of information barilari et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 jha et al 2020 however we should emphasize the need for regionalization of such an index as the vast majority of country wide indexes are based on international standards which differ largely from the regional characteristics of the waters almeida and oliveira 2017 zhang et al 2019 gaikwad et al 2020 jha et al 2020 when defining a new index with a linear combination of variables it is desirable to use multivariate techniques containing the largest amount of information provided by the set of selected variables ferreira et al 2015 gaikwad et al 2020 likewise an important strategy for adapting an index intended to determine the quality of a specific water body is to readjust the weights of each variable component de paula filho et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 this study seeks to assess the groundwater quality and propose a water quality index for the monitored wells in the araripe sedimentary basin located in the semiarid northeast of brazil the formulation of an index suited to the local conditions will contribute to the better management of the multiple groundwater uses and to the water security of the populations living in arid and semiarid regions 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area comprises the eastern sector of asb which is equivalent to 6 500 km2 or 60 of the total area of the sedimentary basin 39 24 38 36 w and 7 00 7 48 s in urban and rural areas of the region groundwater represents the most important source of drinking water for public and private supply considering its multiple uses the metropolitan region of cariri mrc is settled in this sector with a population of about 600 000 inhabitants the mrc depends exclusively on the water provided by the aquifer for public supply irrigation and industry http ipecedata ipece ce gov br the regional climate is characterized by high temperatures and small annual thermal amplitudes with marked rainfall irregularities and an average rainfall of 700 mm yr 1 the area is mainly occupied by caatinga type vegetation 70 and rainforests 4 at higher altitudes exposed soil 21 urban areas 4 3 rivers and flooded areas 0 7 the pedology of the region is predominantly composed of latosols podzolic alluvial and litholic soils cprm 2012 from the geomorphological point of view three distinct domains can be identified the plateau with an altitude between 750 and 900 m the slope zone 450 600 m and the pediplain 450 m cprm 2012 most of the basin is into the pediplain domain the hydrogeological division follows the geomorphology having three main aquifer systems the lower the upper and the middle aquifers with an average thickness of 80 320 and 500 m respectively veríssimo and aguiar 2005 camacho and oliveira 2017 different levels of natural vulnerability to loads of pollutants have been reported for the asb aquifers while such differences are the result of the intrinsic characteristics of each system their lithologic units porosity permeability depth of the static level veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 the classification according to the god level groundwater occurrence overall lithology of aquifer or aquitard and depth to groundwater of the asb foster et al 2006 indicated a slope zone and adjacent areas with a low to medium vulnerability resulting from the low porosity and permeability of the lithotypes permeability and porosity at the plateau and pediplain areas are higher thus resulting in a more significant natural vulnerability of the underlying aquifers veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 moreover the shallower static levels of the pediplain areas may favor the migration and access of certain pollutant species further increasing the risk of groundwater contamination in this context the 22 wells monitored in this study are located within the pediplain zone and overlap with the middle and lower aquifers these the wells are being overused mainly those located in urban areas and with depths ranging between 20 and 150 m cprm 2012 gomes and cavalcante 2017 the recharge of the middle aquifer system comes from the direct infiltration of rainwater 98 and underground springs 2 the monitoring carried out by the local water management authority estimates a water volume of 139 million and 26 million m3 stored in the middle and lower aquifers respectively cprm 2012 camacho and oliveira 2017 despite the intermittent nature of rivers in the semiarid region the natural discharge of the middle and lower aquifers partially guarantees the perennial nature of some stretches of the region s hydrographic network 2 2 groundwater sample collection data from 22 public supply wells located in predominantly urban areas were used the set of wells monitored in this study corresponded to 30 of the total destined for public supply in the eastern sector of the asb cprm 2012 the time series comprises data monitored in 8 seasonal campaigns between 2014 and 2018 made available by the ceará water management company cogerh 0 5 l polyethylene bottles were used to collect the water samples the bottles were previously washed with distilled water the monitored wells were purged at low flow according to standardized sampling protocols abnt 2010 thus regardless of the existing variability in the depths of the wells the purging method ensures that water representative of the formation was captured in order to reflect the chemistry of the groundwater with the least possible uncertainty all samples used in the research were collected after purging at a depth of 30 m in the field a multiparametric probe hanna instruments model hi 98194 was used to monitor the hydrogeological parameters temperature t dissolved oxygen do ph total dissolved solids tds and turbidity ntu hanna instruments model hi 98703 phosphorus p po4 3 nitrate n n no3 biochemical oxygen demand bod and thermotolerant coliforms ttc were determined in the laboratory following the procedures described in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d 2 3 statistical approach a descriptive statistical analysis and empirical quality curves were prepared using the excel software version 2016 the shapiro wilk test was used to assess data normality a hypothesis test was used according to the data distribution behavior parametric or non parametric in order to assess the seasonal behavior of the variables following the behavior of the distribution a correlation coefficient rank was used for measuring the degree of similarity between the hydrogeochemical variables the adequacy of the pca to the asb s hydrogeochemical dataset was tested through the application of the bartlett s sphericity and kaiser meyer olkin kmo tests using the built in function of the redas package r freeware v 0 9 1 bartlett 1951 kaiser 1974 maier 2014 the multivariate principal component analysis pca was used to formulate the wqir using the statistica software version 7 0 the same software was used to prepare the box plot graphics a varimax rotation was applied to the compounds extracted with pca to optimize the solution all measured variables were used for the pca the optimal number of factors extracted was obtained based on the scree plot criterion considering only components with eigenvalues greater than 1 ferreira et al 2015 cecconello et al 2018 2 4 empirical cumulative distributions plots empirical cumulative distributions plots were used to analyze the behavior of each of the hydrogeochemical variables against the allowable thresholds and quality standards established for water intended for human consumption brasil 2008 2017 from the set of raw data we inferred the cumulative probability of non conformity between the obtained values ant the respective groundwater thresholds table 1 the estimated cumulative probability distribution function was used which indicates how often a random variable x concentration of a tested water quality parameter is less than or equal to argument x maximum values allowed by current regulations the value of the cumulative distribution function f x for each real number x is given by eq 1 1 f x p x x p x x is the probability for the variable x to have a value lower than or equal to x the probability to be considered refers to those cases in which it exceeds or does not exceed the value of f x for an x equal to the environmental regulatory standard of each variable under the brazilian legislation brasil 2008 2017 table 1 2 5 wqi calibration using a multivariate analysis the regionalized groundwater quality index wqir considers the same variables as the index of the national sanitation foundation wqinsf and was obtained based on factorial scores according to the degree of relevance of each variable under study the pca allowed us to calibrate the wqir from the dataset collected on the monitoring campaigns this multivariate method is widely used to assess the mechanisms affecting the quality of surface and groundwater badillo camacho et al 2015 gomes and cavalcante 2017 cecconello et al 2018 costa et al 2020 the pca gives the relationship between the variables showing the individual participation of the physical chemical and biological ones the factors or components were generated by the transformation of the original dataset into a correlation matrix and such factors led to a new set of variables called principal components pc which in turn allowed the formulation of new weights for the calculation of the wqir when formulating the wqir the sum of the weights of all individual parameters must be equal to 1 a mathematical transformation was performed on the highest factor loadings that is the normalization of data expressed in different units into values ranging from 0 to 1 by dividing each of the values by the total sum of the factor loadings thus obtaining the calibrated weights cecconello et al 2018 the mathematical formulation is based on the principle that the weighted product of the groundwater quality values of the studied variables is raised to the weight defined for each variable according to their importance pursuant to eq 2 2 wqi r i 1 n q i w i the wqir has a value between 0 and 100 where q i is the quality rating of the ith parameter a number between 0 and 100 obtained from the respective average quality variation curve depending on its concentration or measure and wi is the weight of the ith parameter a number between 0 and 1 assigned according to its importance in explaining the global variability of the water quality and n is the number of variables in the wqir calculation the quality of the monitored water is then classified according to the ratings the classification divide groundwater quality into five categories according to the wqi value excellent 79 wqi 100 good 51 wqi 79 regular 36 wqi 51 bad 19 wqi 36 and very bad wqi 19 waters classified as regular to excellent are appropriate for conventional human consumption treatment bad and very bad waters need advanced treatments if intended for human consumption cetesb 2020 2 6 data spatialization to analyze the spatial behavior of the variables distribution maps based on gis technology were created when used to build forecast surfaces based on limited data it allows a reduction in monitoring costs fang et al 2020 the geostatistical distribution maps for hydrogeochemical variables and water quality index considered the average data values in each monitored well qgis version 3 10 was used to create maps used in the study to display the wells locations and spatial distribution the maps were drawn using the map composer of the qgis freeware the shape used for the delimitation of the basin was obtained from the website of the mineral resources research company cprm the coordinates of each well were obtained with a gnss receiver during the samplings made at each site 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal and spatial behavior of the hydrogeochemical variables table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the dataset obtained from the 22 monitored wells in relation to the maximum allowable values in drinking water mav brasil 2008 2017 there is no mav for phosphorus in drinking water in brazil in this case it was considered the natural background value of 0 03 mg l 1 on average the tested samples were within the reference values except for phosphorus nitrate n and thermotolerant coliforms nitrate is regarded in terms of n having an mav of 10 mg l 1 temperature has no reference values for natural waters according to phil eze 2010 a cv 20 indicates low variability 21 cv 50 is regarded as moderate variability 51 cv 100 indicates high variability and cv 100 is considered to be a very high variability considering this classification and the cv results presented in table 1 temperature ph bod and phosphorus showed a low to moderate variability while tds and do showed a high variability in the monitoring period turbidity nitrate n and thermotolerant coliforms showed a very high variability the monitoring was carried out during the most severe and prolonged drought recorded in the brazilian northeast in the last 60 years for six consecutive years 2012 2017 rainfall levels were up to 50 below the average for the region 600 mm affecting the recharge of the aquifers and the hydrogeochemical quality conditions marengo et al 2018 cunha et al 2019 shubo et al 2020 considering the environmental conditions which resulted in a long drought and a lesser aquifer recharge we performed a comparison of means in order to check whether the monitored variables showed a seasonal variation preliminarily we applied the shapiro wilk s normality test which proved that nitrate n turbidity tds bod and do did not follow a normal distribution pattern p 0 05 the wilcoxon non parametric test was then applied to compare the means the variables t ph bod do tds p po4 3 and ttc did not show statistically significant differences among the different periods fig 2 shows the distribution maps and ranges of values found for the hydrogeochemical variables throughout the monitoring period the well water in higher areas close to the slope zone were generally below 28 3 c cooler than those located in the pediplain while wells located at altitudes below 450 m and around urban areas were warmer approaching 30 c the narrower soil layers the urban impermeable surfaces and the higher ambient temperatures may have contributed to this result fig 2a the mean ph values were above the lower limit provided for by brazilian regulations and did not exceed the upper threshold 9 5 however 33 of the samples showed values below the lower ph threshold ph 6 0 fig 2b there was a differentiation between two different sectors of the basin mainly related to the type of soil predominating in each sector wells in areas with predominantly deeper acidic oxisols tend to have a more acidic ph in their waters p6 to p19 on the other hand wells in areas with thinner soils upon the bedrock litholic soils tend to have higher ph values p1 p4 p5 and p22 because of the nonnormality of the data a spearman rank correlation matrix was used p 0 05 the ph showed significant inverse correlation with nitrate n r 0 52 and positive with do r 0 56 during the monitoring period do concentrations were below 5 0 mg l 1 in all wells fig 2c and in terms of saturation we could see two distinct sectors the first one includes the wells located in areas of greater urban density where do concentrations ranged between 0 7 and 1 5 mg l 1 in the second sector which included areas where rural activities predominate concentrations were on average higher than 1 7 mg l 1 p13 reaching as high as 3 7 mg l 1 p12 as it has no contact with the surface groundwater tends to have low oxygen concentrations in general tds values were lower than the mav fig 2d wells close to the highest areas of the plateau had tds values below 256 mg l 1 on the other hand those located in intensely urbanized areas p13 to p19 were above 360 mg l 1 there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the values of tds and nitrate n r 0 67 the natural hydrogeological characteristics provide for a greater dissolution and accumulation of solids as the climate the weathering of rocks and the contact with litholic soils promote the diffusion of such solids into the aqueous environment andrade et al 2012 alencar et al 2019 according to gomes and cavalcante 2017 the increase in tds depends on climatic conditions with the highest concentrations of salts occurring during the dry season bod expresses the amount of molecular oxygen needed to mineralize organic matter aerobically decomposed by living organisms there is no standard established in the brazilian regulations for this variable as indicated by hazelton and murphy 2007 typical bod values in unpolluted natural waters are below 5 0 mg o2 l 1 a bod level between 1 0 and 2 0 mg o2 l 1 is an indication of very clean water 3 0 to 5 0 mg o2 l 1 moderately clean water and a bod 5 mg o2 l 1 means that there is a nearby source of pollution at bod levels of 100 mg o2 l 1 or higher the water supply is considered to be heavily polluted with organic waste bod values were less than 5 0 mg o2 l 1 in all wells evaluated during the monitoring therefore the waters of the asb wells are moderately free of organic pollution well p4 presented the highest bod 3 9 mg o2 l 1 fig 2e factors related to the agricultural use of the soil and a greater vulnerability to organic contamination may explain this result wells in more densely populated areas with low sewage coverage are more prone to percolation of organic contaminants found in effluents such as in p17 p18 and p19 when evaluating the physical chemical and microbiological quality of groundwater in the southwest of the state of bahia ne brazil dourado et al 2018 obtained bod readings between 17 3 mg l 1 and 20 1 mg l 1 higher than those obtained in this study for the asb thermotolerant coliforms ttc and escherichia coli were found in all monitored wells with higher values in areas of greater urban density fig 2f a deficient collection and treatment of domestic sewage is the main driver of microbiological groundwater pollution alves et al 2008 abdelkader et al 2012 dourado et al 2018 elevated ttc levels were found in p4 11680 mpn 100 ml p6 1102 mpn 100 ml p7 251 mpn 100 ml p11 308 mpn 100 ml and p16 1782 mpn 100 ml ttc and turbidity showed a statistically significant correlation r 0 54 for the data set coliform contaminated wells is a recurrent problem in ne brazil mainly due to a deficient domestic sewage collection and treatment infrastructure hirata et al 2019 phosphorus concentrations exceeded the natural background level 0 03 mg l 1 in all wells the highest readings 0 50 mg l 1 were found in wells p1 p20 and p18 located in a rural area with sparse vegetation on exposed soil and on urban soil respectively fig 2g these results are similar to those reported by oliveira et al 2019 who assessed the hydrochemistry of wells in rural areas of ne brazil finding excessive phosphorus values in 65 of the tested samples phosphates in water can have a natural origin resulting from the decomposition of biological matter and the leaching of minerals they may also have an anthropogenic origin resulting from the leaching of agricultural fertilizers or from failing wastewater treatment processes fang et al 2020 the insufficient sewage infrastructure throughout the asb and a poor effluent management contribute to the pollution of surface and groundwater resources as a result of a disorderly urban expansion there was a progressive reduction in the sewage system coverage rate from 2006 to 2015 coverage decreased from 52 18 to 37 24 as the sewage collection network could not keep up with urban growth sousa et al 2020 only nitrate n and turbidity showed a statistically significant difference between the rainy and dry seasons p 0 05 fig 3 shows the seasonal behavior of the concentrations of nitrate n and turbidity the median concentration of nitrate n in the rainy season 5 1 mg no3 l 1 was higher than the one found in the dry period 4 5 mg n no3 l 1 an inverse behavior was observed for turbidity which went from 0 41 ntu in the dry season to 0 60 ntu in the rainy one when analyzing the interrelationship between hydrogeochemical variables in an aquifer in nigeria adekunle et al 2007 determined a positive significant correlation p 0 05 between turbidity and nitrate n r 0 70 in the present study the mean turbidity values in the dry and rainy seasons were 3 3 and 1 3 ntu respectively in both climatic seasons nitrate n concentrations in the waters of the urban areas of the asb were high p13 to p19 being up to 1 7 to 5 5 times higher than the mav 17 mg l 1 in p19 and 54 1 mg l 1 in p16 on the other hand rural areas with a high nitrogen supply well drained soils and little vegetation which are very common in the asb pose a particular risk of groundwater nitrate contamination igrac 2014 these areas therefore need to be monitored having in mind that agricultural practices are heavily dependent on the use of chemical fertilizers natural nitrate n concentrations were generally lower than 10 mg l 1 however the results in fig 3 a show the influence of human activities on nutrient concentrations in the basin s most urbanized areas the limited coverage of the sewage collection network in the region 20 contributes to this result furthermore the use of single household sewage treatment mechanisms i e septic tanks predominates in the region just like the disposal of raw effluents into streams and rivers significantly affecting the quality of groundwater abdalla and khalil 2018 the large scale use of septic tanks may strongly affect the quality of groundwater due to the propagation of the effluent plume which may percolate to the aquifer barilari et al 2020 the extreme turbidity values in the waters of wells p6 and p16 were recorded in both climatic seasons fig 3b they were above the potability standards required by brazilian regulations with mean values reaching 5 5 ntu p16 in the dry season and 8 1 ntu p6 in the rainy one with the arrival of the rainy season and the consequent recharge of the aquifers there was a mild increase in the turbidity readings of the monitored wells this can be explained by the geological characteristics of the asb as it has cover strata composed mainly of sandstones overlaid by unconsolidated clay sediments 3 2 regulatory compliance of the wells the empirical cumulative distribution plots on fig 4 show the compliance or noncompliance of the results of a given hydrogeochemical variable with the maximum allowable values established by the countrýs regulations brasil 2008 2017 close to 32 70 of the tested samples had ph values outside the allowable range established by brazilian regulations for groundwater 6 0 9 5 table 1 wells p4 5 92 p7 4 43 p8 5 17 p9 5 64 p15 5 52 p16 5 47 p17 5 17 and p18 4 26 presented mean values below the mav fig 4a previous studies conducted on water from tubular wells also located in the asb reported ph readings ranging between 6 2 and 7 6 franca et al 2006 close to 5 7 of all turbidity results were above the mav fig 4b especially in the rainy season this occurred in 19 out of the 22 monitored wells the results that did not exceed the mav showed range between 0 1 and 4 8 ntu the concentrations of total dissolved solids ranged between 48 5 and 952 mg l 1 table 1 while 100 of the tested samples had concentrations lower than the allowable regulatory threshold fig 4c even though there is no regulatory limit for dissolved oxygen the obtained readings are within those normally found in groundwater fig 4d it is normal to find low do concentrations in groundwater as this resource has little or no contact with the atmosphere on the other hand low do concentrations can also be related to polluting sources where o2 is consumed in the decomposition of abundant biological material brasil 2017 nitrate n and phosphate showed the highest number of readings not in compliance with the regulatory limits 41 30 of the tested samples had nitrate n concentrations above 10 mg l 1 fig 4e as previously discussed this can be mainly attributed to anthropogenic contamination by domestic effluents the other results were in accordance with the mav values varied between 0 1 and 9 75 mg l 1 phosphorus is also considered a critical groundwater quality variable in the asb fig 4f a geochemical mechanism that may have contributed to this result is soil saturation and the low oxygen saturation conditions of the aquifer allowing the release of orthophosphate into the water when sorption sites on mineral surfaces are saturated with orthophosphate or other ions any additional orthophosphate added to the water will remain in solution likewise when the soil approaches or reaches saturation the dissolved phosphorus can be transported to deeper portions of the unsaturated zone and to the underlying aquifer as the soil s water leaches down at low oxygen concentrations iron oxides can dissolve and release the adsorbed phosphorus back into the water with a consequent increase in the dissolved phosphorus concentrations however this mechanism needs to be better evaluated in the asb as the dissolution of iron oxides in the aquifer also depends on biological mechanisms carried out by specific bacteria domagalski and johnson 2012 king et al 2015 the biochemical oxygen demand bod results showed means ranging from 2 80 to 3 97 mg l 1 table 1 which are within the regulatory limits fig 4g 100 of the samples had thermotolerant coliform e coli levels above the regulatory limits fig 4h out of 154 raw water samples 85 had 1 mpn 11 had 2 to 1000 mpn and the remaining 4 had 11 000 to 93 300 mpn these results are an indication of fecal contamination and of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in a groundwater quality study conducted in riachão do jacuípe in the state of bahia brazil almeida and mello 2019 detected the presence of thermotolerant coliforms in 100 and e coli in 66 7 of the monitored wells the rating of the waters of each well was defined based on the monitored hydrogeochemical variables considering that such waters are predominantly used for human consumption all the wells were in compliance with the regulations in terms of turbidity total dissolved solids and biological oxygen demand however all the wells were noncompliant on phosphorus and coliforms eight wells had a mean ph lower than that required by the regulations and none exceeded the maximum allowed ph wells p15 p16 p17 and p18 had a greater number of variables in violation of the respective mav brasil 2008 2017 considering the groundwater rating guidelines provided for in the brazilian environmental legislation brasil 2008 2017 all the wells can be rated as class ii these waters can therefore be used for human consumption after a conventional water treatment as they had at least one variable not in compliance with the mavs brasil 2008 2017 despite the limited number of parameters in this classification it is important to note that the chosen ones have critical effects on the quality of groundwater in several arid and semiarid regions worldwide as such parameters affect the predominant uses of such waters ferreira et al 2015 dourado et al 2018 maia et al 2019 gaikwad et al 2020 3 3 regionalized wqi for the araripe sedimentary basin a quality index adjusted to the hydrogeochemical conditions of the asb is herein proposed as a tool for the assessment of the groundwater quality in the basin according to the bartlett s sphericity test the parson s correlation matrix involving the hydrogeochemical variables data has been significantly different from an identity matrix the obtained p value was significantly less than 0 05 p 2 2 10 16 the result of the kmo test confirmed that the sample was adequate or sufficient kmo 0 5 and that the data set is suitable for component analysis the scree plot obtained from the eigenvalues showed that considering the entire data set the first four components are the most significant the eigenvalues for each pc comply with the exclusion criteria where each component must show a variance higher than that showed by a simple variable pc1 2 46 pc2 1 55 pc3 1 20 and pc4 1 10 the first four factors explain approximately 70 of the total variance fig 5 shows the largest factor loadings identified for each hydrogeochemical variable in the above mentioned four components the first pc represents the linear combination explaining the maximum variance of the sample whose largest factor loadings were related to nitrate n 0 892 ph 0 800 tds 0 744 and do 0 598 on pc2 the variables with the largest loading are related to the water s organic pollution bod 0 844 and ttc 0 830 p po4 3 0 835 is the most significant variable on pc3 followed by turbidity 0 791 and t 0 551 on pc4 the calibration of the wqir table 2 was done after these results a wqi must be designed for a specific situation occurring within the context of a given hydrographic basin and accounting for the urban industrial diversity of the region the use and occupation of the soil and the regional development pattern zotou et al 2019 charoula et al 2020 jha et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 thus considering the calibrated weights wi the order of relevance of the variables to define the water quality in the asb is nitrate n bod p po4 3 ttc ph turbidity tds do t in contrast with the wqinsf where do and ttc are the most important variables in empirical models the weights of each attribute are influenced by climatic factors geological settings environmental variations and land and water uses ferreira et al 2015 by using multivariate statistics for the selection and grouping of water quality indicators fang et al 2020 were able to assess the most important physical and chemical characteristics of the water to explain the variability in the groundwater quality in dagu river basin china 3 4 temporal and spatial analysis of the water quality a groundwater quality index wqir for the araripe sedimentary basin adapted to the conditions of the brazilian semiarid region was formulated using a multivariate analysis to obtain new weights the results obtained for the regionalized index considering the mean values obtained for each variable were compared with the values obtained for wqinsf in the 22 monitored wells fig 6 according to the original nsf index 9 1 of the monitored wells would have a poor water quality 36 4 a good water quality and 54 4 a regular water quality only wells p7 33 9 and p16 33 0 showed a poor water quality while at p20 the most expressive value of wqinsf 64 4 was observed likewise wells p2 p3 p12 and p22 presented wqinsf values above 60 after adapting the index to the regional conditions the water quality of the wells was good 81 8 of the wells or regular 18 2 wells p7 44 5 p16 42 6 p17 47 1 and p18 46 6 had the lowest index values ranked as regular most of them are located in areas with a medium to high vulnerability to the contamination of the aquifer systems the pediplain domain that is with greater susceptibility of the water body to be affected by a polluting load veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 on the other hand wells p2 76 p3 72 5 p20 72 1 and p22 71 7 were those with the highest index levels fig 6 these wells have in common their location close to the slope zone 450 600 m this sector within the asb has a low to medium natural vulnerability to contamination of the aquifer systems that is there is a lesser susceptibility of the water body to be affected by a polluting load veríssimo and aguiar 2005 tavares et al 2009 this may in part explain the better water quality in these wells all monitored wells showed that the regionalized index provided higher quality values than those attributed by the wqinsf this result reinforces the need to adapt the index to the local or regional specificities as otherwise an incorrect scenario may be construed leading to failures in the management of the groundwater resources considering that public supply is the predominant use for these waters the wqinsf results demonstrate the need for the waters of wells p7 and p16 to receive an advanced treatment on the other hand considering the results of wqir conventional disinfection treatment is the one indicated for all the other wells thus there is an evident need give particular attention to wells p7 and p16 they are transitioning between the regular and poor quality conditions despite the advantages a wqi has for the management of surface and groundwater resources we must consider the limitations as well inherent to any such model each method has its own merits and flaws and is limited to a certain spectrum of applicable situations dao et al 2020 one such limitation is the eclipsing effect resulting from the aggregation of countless environmental variables into one single number which may result in the attenuation of the negative impact of one of those variables by the stable behavior of the others smith 1990 dao et al 2020 the indices proposed in the literature use different mathematical ways to obtain the wqis aiming to minimize subjectivity and uncertainty and seeking not to be affected by neither overrating eclipsing nor underrating ambiguity de paula filho et al 2020 zotou et al 2019 charoula et al 2020 dao et al 2020 jha et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the approach used in this study shows wqir results as a function of the average value of each monitored hydrogeochemical variable it was then possible to obtain a general picture of the quality of the groundwater used to supply the human population throughout the asb therefore this approach does not consider possible temporal variations in the water quality of the monitored wells notwithstanding the above the representativity of the sampling and the number of wells assessed in the seasonal campaigns covering 30 of all wells used for public water supply reduces the uncertainty regarding the wqir for the monitored period fig 7 shows the distribution map with the spatial behavior of the wqir for the araripe basin throughout the entire monitoring period the distribution map shows a clear water quality sectorization in the basin the lowest quality indexes are predominantly found in urban areas p6 to p19 but also in areas with a lower urban density yet influenced by the agricultural use of the soil p1 and p4 in these areas the waters mostly had a regular quality wells with higher wqir values are associated with low urban density areas in more forested microbasins p20 the use of quality indexes to infer the status of groundwater resources is an important management and communication tool in arid and semiarid areas of developing countries brhane 2018 these regions usually lack permanent monitoring programs which makes it difficult for managers to make adequate decisions brhane 2018 analyzed the quality of groundwater in the tigray region of ethiopiás semiarid using the weighted arithmetic index method rating 95 5 of the wells in the region as excellent while the other wells had water of poor or inadequate quality for human consumption distribution maps also contribute to the understanding of the spatial behavior of hydrogeochemical variables and aquifer quality conditions the spatial behavior of the variables and indexes makes it possible to make informed decisions such as prioritizing areas for immediate mitigation and monitoring actions this tool was applied to groundwater in the city of qus in upper egypt where it revealed a high risk of sewage contamination of the local groundwater resources abdalla and khalil 2018 4 conclusion the spatial and temporal comprehensiveness of the dataset generated in the monitoring allowed us to get a representative picture of the groundwater quality conditions in the asb for the studied period the results show that the waters of all studied wells were beyond the limits recommended by current regulations for at least one hydrogeochemical variable the water quality is mainly affected in wells located in highly urbanized and agricultural areas due to the prolonged drought most of the monitored variables did not show any difference in their behavior during the rainy and dry seasons only nitrate n and turbidity were seasonally affected the empirical cumulative distribution plots allowed identify the hydrogeochemical variables with the most frequent rate of noncompliance with the class 2 maximum allowable values allowed under the brazilian legislation the application of multivariate statistical tools makes it possible to adjust the weights of the attributes and to calibrate the empirical model for the calculation of the wqir thus making the index suitable for the conditions of the brazilian semiarid the calibrated weights for hydrochemical variables followed the order nitrate n bod p po4 3 ttc ph turbidity tds od t this allowed correcting distortions inherent to the use of models prepared for hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical conditions that are different than those of the semiarid region the wqir results showed that 18 2 and 81 8 of the wells had waters with regular and good quality respectively under these conditions the groundwater from 22 wells monitored in the asb could be considered suitable for human consumption after conventional treatment on the other hand these results show that measures must be taken to control and reduce the nutrient and organic loads mainly in urban areas aiming to contain the negative effects of such loads on the quality of aquifer waters in this case such measures must be mainly directed to the upgrade of sewage treatment systems in the different counties of the asb the wqir can be used as an important aquifer management and handling tool in semiarid areas of developing countries it can also help in reducing uncertainties and in the drafting of public policies aimed to technically manage groundwater resources at the same time it

4568,this study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts using real historical and counterfactual natural simulations from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and phase 6 cmip6 general circulation models gcms a cluster analysis is implemented to select independent gcms and to decrease the high computational time of the urban flood modeling a two step spatiotemporal statistical downscaling based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution parameters is performed to meet the requirement of a fine scale precipitation resolution for the urban flood simulations using the downscaled distribution parameters the intensity duration frequency idf curves and composite design storms for four return periods of 2 10 20 and 50 years are created to be used as the inputs of an infoworks icm hydrodynamic model for a case study in antwerp city belgium the fraction of attributable risk far framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory are used to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on urban pluvial flooding the results show that the gev parameters of location and scale nicely follow the power relation providing an opportunity for the temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes a disagreement is found between the gcms on the contribution of anthropogenic climate factors on pluvial flooding some illustrating a higher probability of flooding due to anthropogenic climate impacts and some a lower one it can therefore be concluded that the urban flooding in antwerp is not attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts keywords extreme precipitation urban flood generalized extreme value gev parameters scaling relations cmip6 gcms fraction of attributable risk 1 introduction one of the clearest signs of the climate system response to the increase of anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions is the recorded exceptional warm years in the global mean temperature records harrington et al 2019 according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the total anthropogenic ghg emissions increased over 1970 to 2010 and were the highest in human history in the last decade of this period pachauri and meyer 2014 the importance of climate change is due to the imposing changes and creating challenges in different contexts such as environment e g land and water society e g health and wellness food management and insurance and policymaking knutson et al 2017 among them urban flooding is of high importance since it can influence the people s lives urban interconnected infrastructure systems and urban management dawson et al 2008 sörensen et al 2016 it is therefore essential to thoroughly assess the vulnerability of urban areas and the climate related risks entailed zhai et al 2018 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a destructive extreme events such as urban flooding around the world have moved up in the public policy agenda in recent years and raised the interest of experts decision makers and the general public in understanding and explaining such extreme events from a climatic standpoint tabari et al 2020 as a result the science of extreme event attribution has recently emerged with the key research objective of estimating the extent of anthropogenic and natural climate influences on the changes in the probability and magnitude of extreme events lott and stott 2016 stott et al 2016 sarojini et al 2016 coupled general circulation models gcms are the most commonly used models of the climate system which provide fast track assessments for detection and attribution purposes stott et al 2016 by comparing real world simulations all and counterfactual natural world simulations i e unaffected by anthropogenic influences nat of gcms the fraction of attributable risk far method was introduced by allen 2003 to quantify how far human activities contribute to extreme events the far framework was later linked to the causal counterfactual probability theory pearl 2009 by hannart et al 2016 to unveil causal links between anthropogenic influences and extreme events there are many works done in different aspects of attribution by using gcms for instance wolski et al 2014 compared real world climate and hydrological simulations with simulations in which humans ghg emission is omitted to investigate the contribution of anthropogenic ghg emissions to river flood risk in the okavango basin southern africa cho et al 2016 used the historical single forcing experiments in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to explore the anthropogenic footprint of climate change in the june 2013 flood of northern india lewis et al 2019 employed multi model and single member ensembles of gcms to analyze anthropogenic climate influences on temperature and precipitation extremes in australia detection of the forcing induced by rising ghg implemented by wang et al 2020b showed that this rise largely accounts for the trend in observed data tabari et al 2020 employed both cmip5 and cmip6 gcms to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on extreme precipitation anomalies in europe the main limitation for hydrological attribution analyses is the coarse resolutions of gcms that do not consider fine scale heterogeneities in the climate variability and change tabari et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 kim et al 2020 for the flood modeling of small urban catchments precipitation data with spatial and temporal scales of 1 10 km2 and a few minutes are needed ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 the coarse time resolution gcm simulations cannot therefore be implemented directly in hydrological applications tabari 2019 as they may lead to an underestimation of the actual value of the maximum accumulations morbidelli et al 2020 and the climate change impact hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 the climate information which is derived for fine scales usually assumes that the local climate is influenced by the interaction between large scale atmospheric characteristics and local features trzaska and schnarr 2014 downscaling is the procedure of adding spatial and temporal information of these local features to coarser gcm data to create finer data usable for the local models e g models used for urban hydrology and flooding there are two approaches of downscaling dynamical and statistical trzaska and schnarr 2014 due to the high computational demand for dynamical downscaling statistical downscaling is commonly applied in hydrological studies najafi et al 2011 willems and vrac 2011 sunyer et al 2015 mukundan et al 2019 to replace the dynamical downscaling approach or refine the climate model projections the attribution of urban flooding to anthropogenic influences has received less attention which is addressed in this study this is despite the fact that nearly 54 of the population in the world inhabits in cities which is projected to reach up to 66 by 2050 andimuthu et al 2019 apart from a dense urban population there is a high density of infrastructures that are often extensively interconnected urban flooding may accordingly lead to cross sectoral cascading infrastructure system failures hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b managing storm water in cities which have high possibilities of flooding is therefore a major concern despite this importance a methodological framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to anthropogenic climate influences is lacking urban flooding is typically modeled using hydrodynamic models based on detailed and physical properties and processes of the sewer system under study the high computational expense of these models is problematic when a large ensemble of climate models is used as inputs of hydrodynamic models for the impact assessment of anthropogenic forcings one of the solutions to reduce the computational time and to lessen biases in the ensemble statistics resulting from the interdependence between climate models is the subsampling of the models mendlik and gobiet 2016 by removing redundant information while ensuring proper coverage of uncertainties curry and webster 2011 this study aims at proposing a framework to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate influences to urban pluvial floods to tackle the issue of coarse scale simulations of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms used for the attribution analysis a two step spatiotemporal downscaling is implemented the 100 year 10 minute observational precipitation data of uccle station in central belgium are used as the benchmark for the downscaling of climate model precipitation simulations to reduce the computational cost of the infoworks hydrodynamic modeling and to investigate the independence of climate models a cluster analysis of the gcms is applied by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution and calculating precipitation intensities idf curves are developed to derive composite storms which are used as the inputs for the hydrodynamic model finally a comparison between the probability of flooding for historical real world and natural counterfactual model simulations is made using the far framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory to quantify the influences of anthropogenic climate factors on urban flooding in antwerp 2 study area the case study selected for this study is antwerp city which is the second largest city in belgium with a population of 526 000 on january 1st 2019 statbel 2019 situated in the north of the country in the central coordinate of 51 13 n and 04 24 e the total area of antwerp is 205 km2 there are nine districts in antwerp berendrecht zandvliet lillo antwerp ekeren merksem borgerhout deurne berchem hoboken and wilrijk antwerp city is located at the scheldt river basin which makes it one of the most important seaports of europe antwerp has faced pluvial floods due to extreme local rainstorms in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 being close to the north sea its weather is characterized as maritime fig 1 a illustrates the sewer network of antwerp city the city s drainage system is a gravity driven branched and mostly a combined system which is also accompanied by hydraulic structures such as weirs and orifices li and willems 2020 the land use of the study area is represented in fig s1 the continuous urban fabric class is dominant 80 with impermeable land covers i e urban structures transport networks and artificially surfaced areas the discontinuous urban fabric class is defined as the area where the impermeable features buildings roads and artificially surfaced areas range from 30 to 80 of the land coverage associated with the vegetated areas and bare surfaces that also occupy a significant surface the high ratio of impervious surfaces could lead to a high level of runoff which can exceed the capacity of the sewer networks and cause flooding 3 data for this study 100 year precipitation data 1901 2000 with a time interval of 10 min from uccle station in belgium is used in addition hourly rainfall time series of 6 neighboring stations are used these stations are located around the studied area in antwerp fig 1b owing to the close proximity of these stations with uccle station and a relatively flat topography of the flanders region precipitation at the studied stations is expected to follow a similar pattern the long term precipitation data are not available at the additional stations and the entire recorded data at these stations are used to validate the bias correction results derived from uccle observations table 1 lists all the stations and their data availability in addition to the observed data daily precipitation data from 13 cmip5 and 9 cmip6 gcms were extracted for the grid cell covering the antwerp city using the nearest neighbor method each of these models provides historical real and natural counterfactual precipitation time series which are used for the attribution analysis the model simulations for the external natural forcing only historicalnat experiment and historical forcing historical experiment for the 1901 2000 period are used the choice of gcms was determined by the availability of daily precipitation for the historicalnat and historical experiments for the period 1901 2000 the name of the models along with their spatial resolution are listed in table 2 4 methods an overview of the proposed framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding is presented in fig 2 the framework includes several steps which are briefly explained below 4 1 cluster analysis by applying an areal reduction factor clustering is a set of techniques to create subgroups within a dataset the ones that are located in the same group are similar and are dissimilar from the members within other groups boehmke 2017 the greater the homogeneity in the group and the larger the difference with other groups the more distinct clustering would be implemented kumar et al 2006 k means clustering is the widely used unsupervised prototype based algorithm for splitting the data into user specified k groups in this method each cluster is represented by its center corresponding to the mean of the points which are assigned to the cluster kumar et al 2006 the basic idea behind k means clustering is to define clusters in a way to ensure the minimum variation within clusters kassambara 2018 the hartigan wong algorithm is a well known algorithm in which the within cluster variation is calculated by summing up the squared distances between xi data point that belongs to cluster ck and the mean value of points belonging to cluster ck as given below kassambara 2018 1 w c k x i c k x i μ k 2 thus the total within cluster variation can be calculated as the sum of w ck as presented in eq 2 kassambara 2018 it identifies the level of clustering compactness and presents the goodness of clustering 2 total withinss k w c k k x i c k x i μ k 2 the aim is to investigate the relationship between different model outputs and check which could locate in the same sub group this can reduce the number of time series to be run in the hydrodynamic model in this study for all the 44 climate model precipitation simulations 13 cmip5 and 9 cmip6 each having historical and natural and the uccle data the period of 100 years 1901 2000 is selected to obtain distinct clusters the data for each climate model is divided by the corresponding areal reduction factor described in section 4 1 1 and the similarities described in section 4 1 2 are calculated 4 1 1 areal reduction factor to bridge the scale mismatch between point observations and grid averaged model simulations the areal reduction factor arf is used without applying an arf the difference between the precipitation intensities of observations and climate model simulations could be due to both the bias in model simulations and the scale mismatch between observations and simulations unfairly giving a higher weight to finer resolution models in the cluster analysis in this study arf is calculated using an empirical formula suggested by keers and wescott 1977 explained in kjeldsen 2007 as shown in eq 3 the formula has two parameters of d duration and a area the area is calculated by extracting the latitude and longitude of each grid that covers antwerp city and converting the grid resolution in degree to km one degree of latitude is 111 km however one degree of longitude depends on the latitude and changes from 111 km to 0 moving from the equator to the poles using trigonometry one degree of longitude for the grid covering the antwerp city with a latitude of 51 2 n is estimated to be 70 15 km table 3 lists the empirical parameters to be quantified in eq 3 by obtaining a which is the spatial resolution of the climate models the parameters of m and n are computed for the duration of d 24 hr since the aggregation level of the climate model simulations is 24 h 3 a r f 1 n d m 4 1 2 similarity for the cluster analysis the similarities between clusters should be identified independence between climate models in terms of future climate change signals and the skill of models to represent historical climate are two commonly used measures for the cluster analysis in future climate change studies sanderson et al 2015 mendlik and gobiet 2016 dalelane et al 2018 the former is not relevant for an attribution analysis as the first application of the cluster analysis for the attribution study we thus replace future climate change signals with relative changes of extreme precipitation values between the historical and natural simulations the two similarity measures selected for this study are defined as 4 s 1 i his i obs 5 s 2 i his i nat where i obs i his and i nat are average return levels of observational model historical and model natural data respectively an average return level is calculated by taking the average of return levels for the four selected return periods of 2 10 20 and 50 years to leave out the effect of the fitting errors of theoretical distributions on the similarity measures and consequently on the defined clusters the return levels corresponding to the mentioned return periods are calculated using the empirical distributions k mean clustering method is applied by using r package cluster and is visualized via r package factoextra 4 2 gev distribution and annual maxima extreme precipitation values are determined using the annual maxima method generalized extreme value gev distribution is widely used to represent annual maxima series courty et al 2019 tabari 2020 to describe the probability of occurrence of extreme events the tail of the distribution should be analyzed tails follow a separate distribution beside the distribution for the whole population equation 6 indicates cdf cumulative distribution function of the gev distribution 6 f x exp 1 κ i μ σ 1 κ f o r κ 0 exp exp i μ σ f o r κ 0 where i is the precipitation intensity and μ σ and κ are the location scale and shape parameters of gev respectively the parameters μ and σ have the same unit as intensity while the shape parameter is unitless estimation of the shape parameter is challenging since it is very sensitive to the record length the gev parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the 100 year precipitation model simulations and the uccle station precipitation are divided into two periods of 70 years 1901 1970 for the calibration and 30 years 1971 2000 for the validation next the gev distribution function is fitted to the annual maxima series for 26 aggregation levels 10 min 30 min 1 hr 2hr 24 hr for the 70 and 30 year periods separately the gev parameters are accordingly estimated for each aggregation level as for the climate models selected by the clustering analysis the annual maxima series are first modified by model specific arfs and then gev distribution is fitted to them 4 3 two step downscaling because of the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of climate model outputs a two step spatiotemporal downscaling method is applied to implement the comparison between the model and the observed distribution parameters the uccle observation data are taken as the benchmark the spatial downscaling is performed to correct the intrinsic bias of gcm extreme precipitation simulations and the temporal downscaling to meet the need for a fine time scale precipitation for urban flooding analyses the conventional bias correction methods construct transfer functions for one or more statistics between the historical simulations of climate models and observations and apply the same bias correction factors cfs to future model simulations we modify the procedure for our application in such a way that the derived cfs are applied on the gcm natural simulations by assuming the same bias for the historical and natural simulations in addition instead of correcting the bias in the mean and variance of precipitation data done in the conventional bias correction methods we correct the bias in three characteristics of the precipitation distribution more specifically we correct the bias in the three gev parameters the location parameter describing the center of the distribution an indicator of the mean the scale parameter describing the deviation around the mean an indicator of the variance and the shape parameter describing the tail behavior of the distribution for our distribution based bias correction the precipitation data of the climate models are first modified by the model specific arfs the cfs are then calculated for each cmip5 and cmip6 model separately by dividing the gev parameters of the model historical simulations by the observed gev parameters for the calibration period 1901 1970 7 cf μ μ obs μ sim arf 8 cf σ σ obs σ sim arf 9 cf κ κ obs κ sim arf where sim arf denotes model simulations after applying arfs the model specific cfs are then applied on the relevant gev parameters of the model historical simulations for the validation period 1971 2000 the model extreme precipitation intensities for the 1971 2000 period are calculated based on the bias corrected gev parameters for the second step of the statistical downscaling temporal disaggregation based on the fractal self similarity characteristic of precipitation garcía marín et al 2019 the relations between the distribution parameters and precipitation duration are measured to derive precipitation quantiles of gcms for the aggregation levels smaller than daily to assess the relationship between the distribution parameters and event duration according to menabde et al 1999 it can be assumed that μ and σ scale with duration d with a power law courty et al 2019 made the same assumption but in case they assert a single gradient of scaling they may scale independently 10 μ d a d α 11 σ d b d β the coefficients of a and α are the scaling parameters for μ and b and β are the scaling parameters for σ the power alpha and the coefficient a are calibrated these relations are used to obtain extreme precipitation for smaller scales from daily down to 10 min 24 hr 23 hr 1 hr 30 min 10 min the results show a strong power relation for the scale and location parameters while such relation is not seen for the shape parameter thus for each model we keep the shape parameter unchanged and use the daily shape parameter for the respective model as done in previous studies e g kristvik et al 2019 it is more favorable than artificially restricting the gev shape parameter to be zero which is the case for gumbel and two parameter extreme value type i distributions courty et al 2019 cannon and innocenti 2019 because it may lead to an underestimation of precipitation intensity particularly in high return periods koutsoyiannis 2004a b 4 4 intensity duration frequency idf curves the design of the current infrastructures dealing with extreme precipitation and flooding is based on precipitation intensity duration frequency idf curves these curves provide useful information for municipal sectors in the process of designing and managing sewer systems the lied assumption behind it is that extremes will not differ significantly over time within the drainage area cheng and aghakouchak 2014 idf curves are typically based on historical precipitation data and depict precipitation intensity and frequency in different durations they are developed using the probability distribution fitted to precipitation peaks to estimate the intensity and return period tfwala et al 2017 prior to developing idf curves the extreme value distribution must be implemented which in this study is done using gev and the distribution parameters are calibrated the distribution parameters for different durations are obtained by substituting different desired durations in eqs 10 and 11 and the corresponding precipitation intensities for a specified probability are calculated by inverting the cdf courty et al 2019 12 i d t μ d σ d a d α b d β y where i d t denotes the precipitation intensity for the duration d and the return period t and y is defined based on t and the shape parameter κ as 13 y ln 1 1 t κ 1 κ in which t is computed using the probability function f as 14 t 1 1 f the precipitation intensity is calculated for different aggregation levels ranging between 10 min and 24 hr and for the return periods of 2 10 20 and 50 years 4 5 composite design storms a composite design storm is an artificial storm that includes all precipitation events with durations from a desired minimum to the desired maximum in a single storm for a specific precipitation return period the composite design hyetographs can have different typical shapes such as a constant precipitation intensity over time rectangular hyetograph the maximum precipitation intensity either at the beginning or end of its duration triangular hyetograph and the maximum intensity at the center chicago type hyetograph wartalska et al 2020 the last type is employed here in which the composite storms are designed based on the entire idf curve keifer and chu 1957 15 r d i d d d i where r is the instantaneous intensity by substituting eq 12 in the above equation r becomes 16 r α 1 a d α β 1 b d β y the relation between time and duration is defined as 17 t d m a x d 2 where d m a x is a desired maximum of the whole storm duration it is seen from eq 17 that a symmetric storm around t d m a x 2 is designed if a stepwise equivalent of eq 15 is desired for numerical simulations the average of instantaneous intensities over each step is used 18 r i i 1 d i 1 i i 1 d i i i d i 1 d i where r i i 1 is the average instantaneous intensity which is assumed to be constant from t i to t i 1 and subscripts i and i 1 indicate entities at these points of time a maximum storm duration of 12 h and a fixed time step of 10 min is chosen to produce the composite design storms of this study according to eq 18 in this case the storm has a maximum intensity at 6 h from the start of the storm with symmetric steps before and after it in total 88 composite storms are constructed 2 simulations historical and natural multiplied by 4 return periods 2 10 20 and 50 years for 6 cmip5 and 5 cmip6 models selected models via the cluster analysis 4 6 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model for antwerp city is implemented in the infoworks environment innovyze 2019 following regional guidelines aquafin 2005 the model consists of a 1d sewer model and a 2d mesh model which respectively simulate the flow in the sewer network and the flow routing on the surface using the wallingford method kemanga 2019 li and willems 2020 the 1d 2d covers the city center while the 1d 0d model covers all 9 districts of antwerp the domain of the 1d 0d model consists of 45 225 small sub catchments which were discretized based on the location and geometry of building blocks and the actual topography within the model extent table 4 in each sub catchment unit the flow in the sewer network is simulated as 1d flow by making use of saint venant equations and then routed to the underground sewer network through a predesignated inlet node table 4 presents the number of the key components of the antwerp s hydrodynamic model the rainfall runoff process in the 1d hydrodynamic model is modeled using semi distributed modeling and exceedance flow process more specifically a fixed runoff coefficient 0 05 and 0 9 respectively for permeable and impermeable surfaces is used to estimate the runoff volume and it is routed to the underground sewers by a double linear reservoir method kemanga 2019 li and willems 2020 in the case of flooding surcharged water is stored in some virtual reservoirs with the shape of inverted cones on the top of manholes and later the stored water returns to the sewer system when the system gains enough capacity this simplification does not allow to compute the spatial extent of surface flooding but it allows to compute the locations and severity of flooding with good accuracy while keeping the computation time limited bermúdez et al 2018 eighty eight composite design storms are used as the inputs for running the simulations in 1d 0d hydrodynamic model together with the composite water levels for the scheldt river composite inflow and wastewater data due to a lack of continuous monitoring the interaction between the sewer system and the river together with dry weather flows is based on a fixed boundary scenario li and willems 2019 the surface flow in each sub catchment is lumped and mostly dominated by the digital elevation model the surfaces are divided into two groups the open areas such as streets and open spaces recreation and the building structures in which the runoff occurs through roofs and wastewater the model parameters of surface hydrological models and the interactions of sub surface and surface are based on empirical values 4 7 fraction of attributable risk there have been many studies discussing the trends of anthropogenic climate influences on extreme temperature and precipitation fischer and knutti 2015 however for the first time allen 2003 assessed this contribution in a deterministic way which is called the fraction of attributable risk far this framework quantifies the extent of the impact of human activities on extreme events such as flood or drought far is expressed by the following equation stott et al 2004 19 far 1 p n a t p a l l where in risk based approaches one discusses the probability of occurrence of a climate event in two states the state considering anthropogenic climate influence real world with the probability of p a l l the state without anthropogenic climate factors having the probability of p n a t for the probabilities of flood occurrence all the composite storms are run in the infoworks icm hydrodynamic model we estimate the probability of flooding for factual p a l l and counterfactual p n a t worlds by dividing the number of the flooded nodes under each composite storm over the total number of nodes 20a p n a t n f l o o d e d n a t n t o t a l 20b p a l l n f l o o d e d a l l n t o t a l where n f l o o d e d a l l n f l o o d e d n a t and n t o t a l are the number of flooded nodes for factual and counterfactual worlds and the total number of nodes respectively hannart et al 2016 made a mathematical connection between far and the causal counterfactual probability theory pearl 2009 the causal inference for extremes aims at discovering and quantifying cause and effect relations between anthropogenic climate impacts and extreme events runge et al 2019 in this theory three facets of causality for the extreme event attribution are described as i necessary causation where the occurrence of extreme events effect is due to the presence of anthropogenic forcings cause but may also be due to other factors ii sufficient causation where anthropogenic forcings drive the occurrence of extreme events but may not be required for extreme events to occur and iii necessary and sufficient causation where the first and second facets both hold hannart and naveau 2018 climate models with and without external anthropogenic climate forcing enable us to differentiate between the probabilities of sufficient causation ps and necessary causation pn and to compute the probability of necessary and sufficient causation pns in a deterministic sense these probabilities of causation are defined as follows 21a pn m a x 1 p n a t p a l l 0 21b ps m a x 1 1 p a l l 1 p n a t 0 21c pns m a x p a l l p n a t 0 whenever p a l l p n a t pn matches with the far in other words a far between zero and one indicates the degree of such necessary causation these new measures have been rarely used in previous extreme event attribution studies 5 results and discussion 5 1 validation of the downscaling methods 5 1 1 validation of the bias correction method the bias correction results are validated by comparing the raw and bias corrected extreme precipitation simulations of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms against uccle observations for the validation period 1971 2000 fig 3 the results show that the raw extreme precipitation simulations of the gcms significantly underestimate the observations the underestimation of extreme precipitation by gcms has numerously been reported in previous studies e g sillmann et al 2013 that is attributed to their low horizontal resolution and a poor representation parametrization of sub grid physical processes such as surface fluxes and radiative heating cloud and precipitation micro physics turbulence and convection yano 2016 the distribution based bias correction considerably reduces the underestimation of extreme precipitation especially for the cmip5 gcms whose raw simulations have a larger bias compared to the cmip6 gcms fig 3 while the range of the bias corrected cmip5 simulations covers the observed extremes for the return periods of 4 years the bias corrected cmip6 simulations are unable to capture the observed more extreme events 5 1 2 validation of the scaling relations derived from the observations fitting the gev distribution is done for uccle and 6 neighboring stations for different aggregation levels to derive the scaling relations table 5 for uccle station a very good fit between duration and the location and scale parameters is observed with r2 close to 1 indicating a strong relationship of the parameters with the duration fig s2 however no specific relation is observed for the shape parameter for uccle station not shown to check the validity of the results obtained at uccle station the powers of alpha and beta and the coefficients of a and b are compared with the corresponding values at the other stations the results of the comparison generally validate the scaling relations obtained at uccle station for the next steps which is a strong power relationship of the location and scale parameters with duration for the temporal downscaling procedure cannon and innocenti 2019 assumed a single power for both gev parameters of scale and location however here we calculate two powers for the two parameters for more accurate estimations and this is apparent from the difference between the two power α and β in table 4 table 5 also confirms the power relation between duration and the gev parameters of scale and location suggested by courty et al 2019 for the downscaling of the extreme precipitation 5 2 selection of effectively distinct models to reduce the computational time needed for flood simulations which will be discussed later a selection procedure for the climate models is adopted this selection procedure uses a k means clustering method to create groups of models with similarities as one of the criteria for the cluster analysis is to evaluate the performance of climate model simulations based on observations extreme precipitation intensities are calculated for different return periods using an empirical distribution for both simulated and observed data for the 1901 2000 period to this end the model simulations are modified by arfs to make gridded precipitation comparable with point station precipitation the arfs of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms are listed in table 6 the computed arfs range from 0 76 to 0 83 indicating 20 32 underestimation of precipitation extremes by the climate models this underestimation is because of a spatial scale mismatch between station observations and model outputs as the latter represents area averages rather than point values specifically extreme precipitation values obtained from station observations are expected to be more intense compared with the ones from gridded model output chen and knutson 2008 because of the smoothing associated with the spatial averaging of precipitation characteristics over the model grid cells sivapalan and blöschl 1998 a fundamental issue in the cluster analysis is to determine the number of clusters christiansen 2007 which was found to influence the clustering results wang et al 2020a the choice of the number of clusters is based on a trade off between the computation time for the flood modeling and the bias a smaller number of clusters decreases the computation time however increases the possible bias from a smaller sample size and vice versa accordingly the search space for the optimum number of clusters is limited to the range of 4 6 for the 9 cmip6 gcms and 5 8 for the 13 cmip5 gcms five is found to be the optimum number of clusters for both cmip5 and cmip6 ensembles one important issue for the optimum number of clusters by the k means algorithm is that it only considers statistical measures and not the physical meaning for clustering leckebusch et al 2008 especially when the optimal number of clusters is small the algorithm can combine climate models simualting larger and smaller historical extremes compared to the natural ones or those simulating a large over and under estimation of observed events we thus take into account the physical soundness of the statistical clustering fig 4 illustrates the clusters of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms respectively the selection of the models was performed according to the following steps the model which had s 1 first similarity measure eq 4 closest to 1 was chosen as the representative of each cluster the plane shown in fig 4 was divided into four subregions by two lines s 1 1 and s 2 1 second similarity measure eq 5 if one or both of these lines crossed a cluster that cluster was also divided into subclusters and the above selection criterion was employed for each subcluster in order to select one representative from each of them this is the case for clusters 3 and 2 in the cmip5 and cmip6 ensembles which were divided into two subclusters by s 2 1 in the mentioned clusters the climate models indicate a different behavior large over and under estimation of observations and or larger and smaller historical extremes compared to the natural ones locating them on different sides of the line s1 1 or s2 1 we then select one model from each subcluster which means selecting two models from the mentioned clusters our results confirm earlier arguments that climate models are not independent sanderson et al 2015 merrifield et al 2020 making it difficult to justify model democracy knutti et al 2017 aside from interdependence among the climate models of the same center interdependence exists between the models of different centers in agreement with the results of previous studies leduc et al 2016 the selected models according to the selection procedure are shown in table 2 5 3 spatiotemporal downscaling table 7 indicates the cfs obtained for the cmip5 and cmip6 models for the daily aggregation level for the cmip5 gcms the cfs for the scale and location parameters are above one which expresses that all the parameters of uccle have larger values compared to the model simulations however the cfs for the shape parameter are smaller than one as for the cmip6 gcms the values for the scale and location parameters are greater for uccle data except for the ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models the cmip6 models show larger variations for the shape parameter compared to the cmip5 models for the temporal downscaling an assumption was made to use the same α 0 6426 and β 0 6662 calibrated of the observed data for the period 1971 2000 therefore the coefficients of a and b can be obtained for all models consequently the scale and location parameters of aggregation levels down to 10 min are calculated the results for the coefficients of a and b for the cmip5 and cmip6 models are presented in table 8 the coefficients are quite in the same range the cmip5 gcms have relatively smaller coefficients comparing to the cmip6 gcms in addition cesm2 has very high intensities which were caused by a large difference between its shape parameter values of the calibration and validation periods this large difference impacts the corrected shape parameter after multiplying by its bias correction factor i e after spatial downscaling cesm2 model was thus removed from the selected cmip6 models the idf curves of historical and natural simulations of the selected cmip5 and cmip6 models are shown for four return periods in figs s3 s6 based on the idf curves composite design storms of historical and natural simulations for the cmip5 and cmip6 models are drawn for four return periods in figs s7 s10 fig 5 illustrates a comparison of composite storms derived from historical and natural simulations of two selected cmip6 gcms with different behaviors anthropogenic climate influences have intensified the composite storms in the ipsl cm6a lr gcm noticeably moving the hyetograph upward an opposite pattern is seen for the gfdl esm4 gcm where composite storms derived from natural simulations are far larger than those from historical simulations this opposite pattern points to the large uncertainty of extreme precipitation simulations from gcms 5 4 attribution analysis the results of far for the selected cmip5 and cmip6 models are shown in fig 6 a positive sign of far indicates a larger number of flooded nodes of historical than natural data meaning that anthropogenic climate factors have risen the probability of pluvial flooding in the study area in contrast a negative far value depicts the opposite of this conclusion as suggested by bellprat and doblas reyes 2016 the event attribution of this study assesses climate models separately rather than considering them in one ensemble this suggestion provides better results since it reflects the model inadequacies individually it could be seen from fig 6 that far results of models significantly differ which shows the appropriateness of individual assessment of the models unlike many of the attribution studies that have large scales such as fischer and knutti 2015 and king et al 2016 this study implements a local scale study necessary for urban flood analyses restricting the analysis to a grid cell of global climate models for local impact studies however leads to a high level of internal variability compared to larger scales the negative far can be due to larger precipitation quantiles in natural simulations than in historical simulations for some gcms namely can esm2 mri cgcm3 gfdl esm4 and miroc6 not shown the higher natural return levels are also reflected in the fitted gev parameters of the validation period of the mentioned models as well as csiro mk3 the results show that for the cmip5 gcms cnrm cm5 and ccsm models have the highest positive far among the other models the far values from cnrm cm5 rise from t 2 to 10 years and fall afterward while those of the ccsm model monotonically increase with the return period inversely can esm2 and csiro mk3 result in the highest negative far can esm2 has a decreasing trend of far against the return period while csiro mk3 s trend is the other way around for the cmip6 gcms ipsl cm6 a lr and nor esm2 models possess the largest positive far ipsl cm6 a lr far monotonically increases with respect to t while the trend of nor esm2 is like the cnrm cm5 model from the cmip5 ensemble in contrast the highest negative far among the cmip6 models belongs to gfdl esm4 and miroc6 which show a larger absolute value of far for bigger return periods previous studies have shown an increasing trend of future extreme precipitation changes with the event extremity hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 myhre et al 2019 tabari 2021 due to a larger contribution of atmospheric moisture changes thermodynamic effects than atmospheric circulation changes dynamic effects to more extreme precipitation chen et al 2019 such behavior was not found for historical human related climate impacts on urban flooding in antwerp belgium where the ensemble median far for all cmip models is equal to 0 141 0 136 0 059 and 0 092 for 2 10 20 and 50 year floods respectively it is attributed to the noisier pattern of more extreme precipitation and thus more intense floods at the local scale the undetectability of historical climate change signals in urban flood intensity is also expected for other regions due to the high internal variability of extreme patterns at a local scale which needs further research our findings show a large uncertainty in the far results ranging from large negative to large positive values the uncertainty in far values is always model based lott and stott 2016 the large climate model uncertainty for projected extreme precipitation has previously been reported tabari et al 2019 kim et al 2020 tabari 2020 lehner et al 2020 which stems from structural discrepancies between gcms and the way they respond to external forcings lehner et al 2020 such as different parameterizations of some processes and numerical approximations naveau et al 2020 the causal counterfactual probability theory confirms the far results while providing further information table 9 as for the far the gcms present different results for the causal counterfactual probability theory the results from the ccsm and cnrm cm5 gcms from the cmip5 ensemble and the ipsl cm6a lr and noresm2 lm gcms from the cmip6 ensemble provide a medium to high likelihood pn 0 3 of urban flooding occurrence due to anthropogenic climate impacts in a necessary causation view it implies that urban flooding would not have likely happened without anthropogenic climate impacts given that both urban flooding and anthropogenic climate impacts did in fact happen in other words anthropogenic climate factors can be considered a necessary cause of urban flooding or anthropogenic climate factors are required for urban flooding to happen but that other factors might also be needed in contrast the results of the causal counterfactual probability theory from the cmip5 can esm2 model and the cmip6 gfdl esm4 and miroc6 models with ps 0 3 reveal that urban flooding of high return periods would have likely happened in the presence of anthropogenic climate impacts given that urban flooding and anthropogenic climate impacts did not happen however there is low evidence pns 0 24 that urban flooding would have happened in the presence of anthropogenic climate impacts and that urban flooding would not have happened without anthropogenic climate impacts the overall results imply that urban flooding events in antwerp city cannot be attributed to anthropogenic climate influences however an extreme event could take place due to internal natural variability thus it is not reasonable to attribute the extreme events only to human impacts in the current study not all floods are attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts the attribution analysis results for urban flooding were also confirmed by the results of extreme precipitation derived from an empirical distribution the models with a positive far value and the necessary causation pn probability of 0 for urban flooding also have larger extreme precipitation in the historical simulations compared to natural simulations also the models with a negative far value and the sufficient causation ps probability of 0 show a smaller historical extreme precipitation than natural extreme precipitation it refuses the possible effect of the bias in theoretical distribution fitting and the flood modeling on the uncertainty of the attribution analysis results this study is restricted to be implemented on one grid cell of global climate models in which the precipitation has a high internal variability hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 for time series representing larger regions of the world the anthropogenic climate impacts are more detectable since the internal variability in larger spatial scales reduces and this allows the human induced signals to appear earlier king et al 2015 most of the attribution studies are implemented on large global or continental scales fischer and knutti 2015 li et al 2017 tabari et al 2020 in which the signals are more robust and detectable higher signal to noise ratios it is especially important for extreme precipitation with the high internal variability noise while the scale matters less for extreme temperature kirchmeier young et al 2019 in this regard tabari et al 2020 considered latitudinal precipitation average precipitation for all model grids in each latitude for a continental attribution study over europe to decrease internal variability and obtain stronger anthropogenic climate signals they found that anthropogenic climate influences have altered the present modes of climatic variability and increased extreme precipitation anomalies across the continent with a 41 anthropogenic contribution for mid 50 60 latitudes where belgium is located a comparison of flood volumes derived from historical and natural simulations validates the attribution analysis results fig 7 the varying pattern of the flood volume with the ensemble climate model and return period is consistent with that of the flood probability in the far framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory it is also found that although the flood volume increases with the return period for both historical and natural simulations anthropogenic climate influences do not increase with the return period as an example of the antwerp network fig 8 illustrates the maximum flood depth of ccsm model nodes for historical and natural model outputs of a 50 year return period as indicated by the large positive far value and pn 0 526 of the ccsm model the flooded nodes in historical simulations are far larger than those in natural simulations the flooded nodes are also distributed over the studied network 6 conclusions and recommendations this study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts the proposed framework is applied to urban pluvial flooding in antwerp city using uccle observed precipitation data along with natural and historical simulations of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms the results indicate that almost half of the models have a positive far showing a higher ratio of flooded nodes in the historical real world case in most of cases it was expected that historical precipitation leads to more flooding than the natural one the climate models generally do not indicate a solid agreement on the contribution of human activities as the major cause of the pluvial flooding the results of the causal counterfactual probability theory confirm the discrepancy between gcms while the anthropogenic climate influence is virtually certainly a sufficient cause for urban flooding based on the results of some gcms it is a necessary cause based on the results of some other gcms it is none of the causes based on the rest of gcms the proposed framework in this study for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical climate change can be further improved in future research our framework makes use of the cluster analysis to select the representative climate models in order to decrease the running time of the flood modeling using data driven approaches li and willems 2020 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a or a combined data driven and physically based model structure wolfs and willems 2017 for the flood modeling are other alternatives to reduce the computational time coarse scale climate models used in this study parametrize sub grid processes e g convection which is a source of bias in their simulations prein et al 2015 yuval and o gorman 2020 high resolution climate models in which deep convection is explicitly represented by the model grid convection permitting models cpms with a grid spacing of 4 km are able to more realistically simulate extreme precipitation with high local sub daily accumulations prein et al 2015 tabari et al 2016 kendon et al 2017 fosser et al 2020 however producing century long simulations crucial for the attribution analysis by cpms is not currently computationally feasible and will remain beyond the reach for the foreseeable future our results reveal that the major driver of pluvial flooding in antwerp can be local factors such as urban expansion where build up areas were more than doubled from 1976 to 2000 poelmans et al 2010 it led to an increase in surface runoffs poelmans et al 2010 and peak flows akter et al 2018 the excess water flows resulting from the urban expansion cannot be handled by the existing urban sewage network in antwerp and may lead to flooding the importance of green and blue spaces to reduce the risk of urban pluvial flooding in antwerp was however well recognized by the authorities who plan to expand these spaces in the future huyghe et al 2021 the possible influence of historical urbanization on the urban flooding in antwerp requires further research cmip5 cmip6 models used in this study have a poor and simplified representation of urban land use and statistical downscaling cannot fully reproduce urban signals dynamical downscaling of these coarse scale models to derive cpms have important benefits for the representation of small scale orography and variations of surface fields prein et al 2015 paving the way for an improved assessment of local urbanization impact a distribution based downscaling method was used in this study to spatially and temporally downscale precipitation extremes as the inputs of the hydrodynamic model this method can also be performed with other extreme value analysis methods and theoretical distributions to explore the sensitivity of the results to the statistical methodology tabari 2021 using other bias correction methods such as quantile mapping maraun et al 2010 and quantile delta mapping cannon et al 2015 and other temporal disaggregation techniques such as hyetos kossieris et al 2018 cascade güntner et al 2001 mudrain koutsoyiannis et al 2003 artificial neural network mirhosseini et al 2014 and k nearest neighbor lu and qin 2014 provide an opportunity to compare the results of different downscaling methods and quantify the related uncertainty by including all influencing factors on climate change assessments uncertainty in the results can be more effectively decomposed into contributing sources tabari et al 2019 we employed two statistical methods of the fractional attributable risk and the causal counterfactual probability theory to attribute the changes in the probability of urban pluvial flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts we defined the probability of flooding over the study sewer network as the ratio of the number of the flooded nodes over the total number of nodes the probability of flooding can also be estimated per node where the probability of exceeding a certain quantile derived from pre industrial control simulations pi experiment as a benchmark is compared between historical and natural simulations it is also possible to extend the attribution analysis of the urban flooding for the future climate when human induced climate impacts are stronger it is expected that the fraction of attributable risk gets positive and stronger in the future the spatial pooling of extreme precipitation values over neighboring grid cells e g 3 3 arrays hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 rather than using single grid box values may also reduce internal variability and lead to the emergence of anthropogenic signals from background noise besides the fractional attributable risk and the causal counterfactual probability theory optimal fingerprinting allen and stott 2003 is another widely used

4568,this study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts using real historical and counterfactual natural simulations from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and phase 6 cmip6 general circulation models gcms a cluster analysis is implemented to select independent gcms and to decrease the high computational time of the urban flood modeling a two step spatiotemporal statistical downscaling based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution parameters is performed to meet the requirement of a fine scale precipitation resolution for the urban flood simulations using the downscaled distribution parameters the intensity duration frequency idf curves and composite design storms for four return periods of 2 10 20 and 50 years are created to be used as the inputs of an infoworks icm hydrodynamic model for a case study in antwerp city belgium the fraction of attributable risk far framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory are used to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on urban pluvial flooding the results show that the gev parameters of location and scale nicely follow the power relation providing an opportunity for the temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes a disagreement is found between the gcms on the contribution of anthropogenic climate factors on pluvial flooding some illustrating a higher probability of flooding due to anthropogenic climate impacts and some a lower one it can therefore be concluded that the urban flooding in antwerp is not attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts keywords extreme precipitation urban flood generalized extreme value gev parameters scaling relations cmip6 gcms fraction of attributable risk 1 introduction one of the clearest signs of the climate system response to the increase of anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions is the recorded exceptional warm years in the global mean temperature records harrington et al 2019 according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the total anthropogenic ghg emissions increased over 1970 to 2010 and were the highest in human history in the last decade of this period pachauri and meyer 2014 the importance of climate change is due to the imposing changes and creating challenges in different contexts such as environment e g land and water society e g health and wellness food management and insurance and policymaking knutson et al 2017 among them urban flooding is of high importance since it can influence the people s lives urban interconnected infrastructure systems and urban management dawson et al 2008 sörensen et al 2016 it is therefore essential to thoroughly assess the vulnerability of urban areas and the climate related risks entailed zhai et al 2018 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a destructive extreme events such as urban flooding around the world have moved up in the public policy agenda in recent years and raised the interest of experts decision makers and the general public in understanding and explaining such extreme events from a climatic standpoint tabari et al 2020 as a result the science of extreme event attribution has recently emerged with the key research objective of estimating the extent of anthropogenic and natural climate influences on the changes in the probability and magnitude of extreme events lott and stott 2016 stott et al 2016 sarojini et al 2016 coupled general circulation models gcms are the most commonly used models of the climate system which provide fast track assessments for detection and attribution purposes stott et al 2016 by comparing real world simulations all and counterfactual natural world simulations i e unaffected by anthropogenic influences nat of gcms the fraction of attributable risk far method was introduced by allen 2003 to quantify how far human activities contribute to extreme events the far framework was later linked to the causal counterfactual probability theory pearl 2009 by hannart et al 2016 to unveil causal links between anthropogenic influences and extreme events there are many works done in different aspects of attribution by using gcms for instance wolski et al 2014 compared real world climate and hydrological simulations with simulations in which humans ghg emission is omitted to investigate the contribution of anthropogenic ghg emissions to river flood risk in the okavango basin southern africa cho et al 2016 used the historical single forcing experiments in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to explore the anthropogenic footprint of climate change in the june 2013 flood of northern india lewis et al 2019 employed multi model and single member ensembles of gcms to analyze anthropogenic climate influences on temperature and precipitation extremes in australia detection of the forcing induced by rising ghg implemented by wang et al 2020b showed that this rise largely accounts for the trend in observed data tabari et al 2020 employed both cmip5 and cmip6 gcms to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on extreme precipitation anomalies in europe the main limitation for hydrological attribution analyses is the coarse resolutions of gcms that do not consider fine scale heterogeneities in the climate variability and change tabari et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 kim et al 2020 for the flood modeling of small urban catchments precipitation data with spatial and temporal scales of 1 10 km2 and a few minutes are needed ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 the coarse time resolution gcm simulations cannot therefore be implemented directly in hydrological applications tabari 2019 as they may lead to an underestimation of the actual value of the maximum accumulations morbidelli et al 2020 and the climate change impact hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 the climate information which is derived for fine scales usually assumes that the local climate is influenced by the interaction between large scale atmospheric characteristics and local features trzaska and schnarr 2014 downscaling is the procedure of adding spatial and temporal information of these local features to coarser gcm data to create finer data usable for the local models e g models used for urban hydrology and flooding there are two approaches of downscaling dynamical and statistical trzaska and schnarr 2014 due to the high computational demand for dynamical downscaling statistical downscaling is commonly applied in hydrological studies najafi et al 2011 willems and vrac 2011 sunyer et al 2015 mukundan et al 2019 to replace the dynamical downscaling approach or refine the climate model projections the attribution of urban flooding to anthropogenic influences has received less attention which is addressed in this study this is despite the fact that nearly 54 of the population in the world inhabits in cities which is projected to reach up to 66 by 2050 andimuthu et al 2019 apart from a dense urban population there is a high density of infrastructures that are often extensively interconnected urban flooding may accordingly lead to cross sectoral cascading infrastructure system failures hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b managing storm water in cities which have high possibilities of flooding is therefore a major concern despite this importance a methodological framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to anthropogenic climate influences is lacking urban flooding is typically modeled using hydrodynamic models based on detailed and physical properties and processes of the sewer system under study the high computational expense of these models is problematic when a large ensemble of climate models is used as inputs of hydrodynamic models for the impact assessment of anthropogenic forcings one of the solutions to reduce the computational time and to lessen biases in the ensemble statistics resulting from the interdependence between climate models is the subsampling of the models mendlik and gobiet 2016 by removing redundant information while ensuring proper coverage of uncertainties curry and webster 2011 this study aims at proposing a framework to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate influences to urban pluvial floods to tackle the issue of coarse scale simulations of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms used for the attribution analysis a two step spatiotemporal downscaling is implemented the 100 year 10 minute observational precipitation data of uccle station in central belgium are used as the benchmark for the downscaling of climate model precipitation simulations to reduce the computational cost of the infoworks hydrodynamic modeling and to investigate the independence of climate models a cluster analysis of the gcms is applied by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution and calculating precipitation intensities idf curves are developed to derive composite storms which are used as the inputs for the hydrodynamic model finally a comparison between the probability of flooding for historical real world and natural counterfactual model simulations is made using the far framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory to quantify the influences of anthropogenic climate factors on urban flooding in antwerp 2 study area the case study selected for this study is antwerp city which is the second largest city in belgium with a population of 526 000 on january 1st 2019 statbel 2019 situated in the north of the country in the central coordinate of 51 13 n and 04 24 e the total area of antwerp is 205 km2 there are nine districts in antwerp berendrecht zandvliet lillo antwerp ekeren merksem borgerhout deurne berchem hoboken and wilrijk antwerp city is located at the scheldt river basin which makes it one of the most important seaports of europe antwerp has faced pluvial floods due to extreme local rainstorms in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 being close to the north sea its weather is characterized as maritime fig 1 a illustrates the sewer network of antwerp city the city s drainage system is a gravity driven branched and mostly a combined system which is also accompanied by hydraulic structures such as weirs and orifices li and willems 2020 the land use of the study area is represented in fig s1 the continuous urban fabric class is dominant 80 with impermeable land covers i e urban structures transport networks and artificially surfaced areas the discontinuous urban fabric class is defined as the area where the impermeable features buildings roads and artificially surfaced areas range from 30 to 80 of the land coverage associated with the vegetated areas and bare surfaces that also occupy a significant surface the high ratio of impervious surfaces could lead to a high level of runoff which can exceed the capacity of the sewer networks and cause flooding 3 data for this study 100 year precipitation data 1901 2000 with a time interval of 10 min from uccle station in belgium is used in addition hourly rainfall time series of 6 neighboring stations are used these stations are located around the studied area in antwerp fig 1b owing to the close proximity of these stations with uccle station and a relatively flat topography of the flanders region precipitation at the studied stations is expected to follow a similar pattern the long term precipitation data are not available at the additional stations and the entire recorded data at these stations are used to validate the bias correction results derived from uccle observations table 1 lists all the stations and their data availability in addition to the observed data daily precipitation data from 13 cmip5 and 9 cmip6 gcms were extracted for the grid cell covering the antwerp city using the nearest neighbor method each of these models provides historical real and natural counterfactual precipitation time series which are used for the attribution analysis the model simulations for the external natural forcing only historicalnat experiment and historical forcing historical experiment for the 1901 2000 period are used the choice of gcms was determined by the availability of daily precipitation for the historicalnat and historical experiments for the period 1901 2000 the name of the models along with their spatial resolution are listed in table 2 4 methods an overview of the proposed framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding is presented in fig 2 the framework includes several steps which are briefly explained below 4 1 cluster analysis by applying an areal reduction factor clustering is a set of techniques to create subgroups within a dataset the ones that are located in the same group are similar and are dissimilar from the members within other groups boehmke 2017 the greater the homogeneity in the group and the larger the difference with other groups the more distinct clustering would be implemented kumar et al 2006 k means clustering is the widely used unsupervised prototype based algorithm for splitting the data into user specified k groups in this method each cluster is represented by its center corresponding to the mean of the points which are assigned to the cluster kumar et al 2006 the basic idea behind k means clustering is to define clusters in a way to ensure the minimum variation within clusters kassambara 2018 the hartigan wong algorithm is a well known algorithm in which the within cluster variation is calculated by summing up the squared distances between xi data point that belongs to cluster ck and the mean value of points belonging to cluster ck as given below kassambara 2018 1 w c k x i c k x i μ k 2 thus the total within cluster variation can be calculated as the sum of w ck as presented in eq 2 kassambara 2018 it identifies the level of clustering compactness and presents the goodness of clustering 2 total withinss k w c k k x i c k x i μ k 2 the aim is to investigate the relationship between different model outputs and check which could locate in the same sub group this can reduce the number of time series to be run in the hydrodynamic model in this study for all the 44 climate model precipitation simulations 13 cmip5 and 9 cmip6 each having historical and natural and the uccle data the period of 100 years 1901 2000 is selected to obtain distinct clusters the data for each climate model is divided by the corresponding areal reduction factor described in section 4 1 1 and the similarities described in section 4 1 2 are calculated 4 1 1 areal reduction factor to bridge the scale mismatch between point observations and grid averaged model simulations the areal reduction factor arf is used without applying an arf the difference between the precipitation intensities of observations and climate model simulations could be due to both the bias in model simulations and the scale mismatch between observations and simulations unfairly giving a higher weight to finer resolution models in the cluster analysis in this study arf is calculated using an empirical formula suggested by keers and wescott 1977 explained in kjeldsen 2007 as shown in eq 3 the formula has two parameters of d duration and a area the area is calculated by extracting the latitude and longitude of each grid that covers antwerp city and converting the grid resolution in degree to km one degree of latitude is 111 km however one degree of longitude depends on the latitude and changes from 111 km to 0 moving from the equator to the poles using trigonometry one degree of longitude for the grid covering the antwerp city with a latitude of 51 2 n is estimated to be 70 15 km table 3 lists the empirical parameters to be quantified in eq 3 by obtaining a which is the spatial resolution of the climate models the parameters of m and n are computed for the duration of d 24 hr since the aggregation level of the climate model simulations is 24 h 3 a r f 1 n d m 4 1 2 similarity for the cluster analysis the similarities between clusters should be identified independence between climate models in terms of future climate change signals and the skill of models to represent historical climate are two commonly used measures for the cluster analysis in future climate change studies sanderson et al 2015 mendlik and gobiet 2016 dalelane et al 2018 the former is not relevant for an attribution analysis as the first application of the cluster analysis for the attribution study we thus replace future climate change signals with relative changes of extreme precipitation values between the historical and natural simulations the two similarity measures selected for this study are defined as 4 s 1 i his i obs 5 s 2 i his i nat where i obs i his and i nat are average return levels of observational model historical and model natural data respectively an average return level is calculated by taking the average of return levels for the four selected return periods of 2 10 20 and 50 years to leave out the effect of the fitting errors of theoretical distributions on the similarity measures and consequently on the defined clusters the return levels corresponding to the mentioned return periods are calculated using the empirical distributions k mean clustering method is applied by using r package cluster and is visualized via r package factoextra 4 2 gev distribution and annual maxima extreme precipitation values are determined using the annual maxima method generalized extreme value gev distribution is widely used to represent annual maxima series courty et al 2019 tabari 2020 to describe the probability of occurrence of extreme events the tail of the distribution should be analyzed tails follow a separate distribution beside the distribution for the whole population equation 6 indicates cdf cumulative distribution function of the gev distribution 6 f x exp 1 κ i μ σ 1 κ f o r κ 0 exp exp i μ σ f o r κ 0 where i is the precipitation intensity and μ σ and κ are the location scale and shape parameters of gev respectively the parameters μ and σ have the same unit as intensity while the shape parameter is unitless estimation of the shape parameter is challenging since it is very sensitive to the record length the gev parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the 100 year precipitation model simulations and the uccle station precipitation are divided into two periods of 70 years 1901 1970 for the calibration and 30 years 1971 2000 for the validation next the gev distribution function is fitted to the annual maxima series for 26 aggregation levels 10 min 30 min 1 hr 2hr 24 hr for the 70 and 30 year periods separately the gev parameters are accordingly estimated for each aggregation level as for the climate models selected by the clustering analysis the annual maxima series are first modified by model specific arfs and then gev distribution is fitted to them 4 3 two step downscaling because of the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of climate model outputs a two step spatiotemporal downscaling method is applied to implement the comparison between the model and the observed distribution parameters the uccle observation data are taken as the benchmark the spatial downscaling is performed to correct the intrinsic bias of gcm extreme precipitation simulations and the temporal downscaling to meet the need for a fine time scale precipitation for urban flooding analyses the conventional bias correction methods construct transfer functions for one or more statistics between the historical simulations of climate models and observations and apply the same bias correction factors cfs to future model simulations we modify the procedure for our application in such a way that the derived cfs are applied on the gcm natural simulations by assuming the same bias for the historical and natural simulations in addition instead of correcting the bias in the mean and variance of precipitation data done in the conventional bias correction methods we correct the bias in three characteristics of the precipitation distribution more specifically we correct the bias in the three gev parameters the location parameter describing the center of the distribution an indicator of the mean the scale parameter describing the deviation around the mean an indicator of the variance and the shape parameter describing the tail behavior of the distribution for our distribution based bias correction the precipitation data of the climate models are first modified by the model specific arfs the cfs are then calculated for each cmip5 and cmip6 model separately by dividing the gev parameters of the model historical simulations by the observed gev parameters for the calibration period 1901 1970 7 cf μ μ obs μ sim arf 8 cf σ σ obs σ sim arf 9 cf κ κ obs κ sim arf where sim arf denotes model simulations after applying arfs the model specific cfs are then applied on the relevant gev parameters of the model historical simulations for the validation period 1971 2000 the model extreme precipitation intensities for the 1971 2000 period are calculated based on the bias corrected gev parameters for the second step of the statistical downscaling temporal disaggregation based on the fractal self similarity characteristic of precipitation garcía marín et al 2019 the relations between the distribution parameters and precipitation duration are measured to derive precipitation quantiles of gcms for the aggregation levels smaller than daily to assess the relationship between the distribution parameters and event duration according to menabde et al 1999 it can be assumed that μ and σ scale with duration d with a power law courty et al 2019 made the same assumption but in case they assert a single gradient of scaling they may scale independently 10 μ d a d α 11 σ d b d β the coefficients of a and α are the scaling parameters for μ and b and β are the scaling parameters for σ the power alpha and the coefficient a are calibrated these relations are used to obtain extreme precipitation for smaller scales from daily down to 10 min 24 hr 23 hr 1 hr 30 min 10 min the results show a strong power relation for the scale and location parameters while such relation is not seen for the shape parameter thus for each model we keep the shape parameter unchanged and use the daily shape parameter for the respective model as done in previous studies e g kristvik et al 2019 it is more favorable than artificially restricting the gev shape parameter to be zero which is the case for gumbel and two parameter extreme value type i distributions courty et al 2019 cannon and innocenti 2019 because it may lead to an underestimation of precipitation intensity particularly in high return periods koutsoyiannis 2004a b 4 4 intensity duration frequency idf curves the design of the current infrastructures dealing with extreme precipitation and flooding is based on precipitation intensity duration frequency idf curves these curves provide useful information for municipal sectors in the process of designing and managing sewer systems the lied assumption behind it is that extremes will not differ significantly over time within the drainage area cheng and aghakouchak 2014 idf curves are typically based on historical precipitation data and depict precipitation intensity and frequency in different durations they are developed using the probability distribution fitted to precipitation peaks to estimate the intensity and return period tfwala et al 2017 prior to developing idf curves the extreme value distribution must be implemented which in this study is done using gev and the distribution parameters are calibrated the distribution parameters for different durations are obtained by substituting different desired durations in eqs 10 and 11 and the corresponding precipitation intensities for a specified probability are calculated by inverting the cdf courty et al 2019 12 i d t μ d σ d a d α b d β y where i d t denotes the precipitation intensity for the duration d and the return period t and y is defined based on t and the shape parameter κ as 13 y ln 1 1 t κ 1 κ in which t is computed using the probability function f as 14 t 1 1 f the precipitation intensity is calculated for different aggregation levels ranging between 10 min and 24 hr and for the return periods of 2 10 20 and 50 years 4 5 composite design storms a composite design storm is an artificial storm that includes all precipitation events with durations from a desired minimum to the desired maximum in a single storm for a specific precipitation return period the composite design hyetographs can have different typical shapes such as a constant precipitation intensity over time rectangular hyetograph the maximum precipitation intensity either at the beginning or end of its duration triangular hyetograph and the maximum intensity at the center chicago type hyetograph wartalska et al 2020 the last type is employed here in which the composite storms are designed based on the entire idf curve keifer and chu 1957 15 r d i d d d i where r is the instantaneous intensity by substituting eq 12 in the above equation r becomes 16 r α 1 a d α β 1 b d β y the relation between time and duration is defined as 17 t d m a x d 2 where d m a x is a desired maximum of the whole storm duration it is seen from eq 17 that a symmetric storm around t d m a x 2 is designed if a stepwise equivalent of eq 15 is desired for numerical simulations the average of instantaneous intensities over each step is used 18 r i i 1 d i 1 i i 1 d i i i d i 1 d i where r i i 1 is the average instantaneous intensity which is assumed to be constant from t i to t i 1 and subscripts i and i 1 indicate entities at these points of time a maximum storm duration of 12 h and a fixed time step of 10 min is chosen to produce the composite design storms of this study according to eq 18 in this case the storm has a maximum intensity at 6 h from the start of the storm with symmetric steps before and after it in total 88 composite storms are constructed 2 simulations historical and natural multiplied by 4 return periods 2 10 20 and 50 years for 6 cmip5 and 5 cmip6 models selected models via the cluster analysis 4 6 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model for antwerp city is implemented in the infoworks environment innovyze 2019 following regional guidelines aquafin 2005 the model consists of a 1d sewer model and a 2d mesh model which respectively simulate the flow in the sewer network and the flow routing on the surface using the wallingford method kemanga 2019 li and willems 2020 the 1d 2d covers the city center while the 1d 0d model covers all 9 districts of antwerp the domain of the 1d 0d model consists of 45 225 small sub catchments which were discretized based on the location and geometry of building blocks and the actual topography within the model extent table 4 in each sub catchment unit the flow in the sewer network is simulated as 1d flow by making use of saint venant equations and then routed to the underground sewer network through a predesignated inlet node table 4 presents the number of the key components of the antwerp s hydrodynamic model the rainfall runoff process in the 1d hydrodynamic model is modeled using semi distributed modeling and exceedance flow process more specifically a fixed runoff coefficient 0 05 and 0 9 respectively for permeable and impermeable surfaces is used to estimate the runoff volume and it is routed to the underground sewers by a double linear reservoir method kemanga 2019 li and willems 2020 in the case of flooding surcharged water is stored in some virtual reservoirs with the shape of inverted cones on the top of manholes and later the stored water returns to the sewer system when the system gains enough capacity this simplification does not allow to compute the spatial extent of surface flooding but it allows to compute the locations and severity of flooding with good accuracy while keeping the computation time limited bermúdez et al 2018 eighty eight composite design storms are used as the inputs for running the simulations in 1d 0d hydrodynamic model together with the composite water levels for the scheldt river composite inflow and wastewater data due to a lack of continuous monitoring the interaction between the sewer system and the river together with dry weather flows is based on a fixed boundary scenario li and willems 2019 the surface flow in each sub catchment is lumped and mostly dominated by the digital elevation model the surfaces are divided into two groups the open areas such as streets and open spaces recreation and the building structures in which the runoff occurs through roofs and wastewater the model parameters of surface hydrological models and the interactions of sub surface and surface are based on empirical values 4 7 fraction of attributable risk there have been many studies discussing the trends of anthropogenic climate influences on extreme temperature and precipitation fischer and knutti 2015 however for the first time allen 2003 assessed this contribution in a deterministic way which is called the fraction of attributable risk far this framework quantifies the extent of the impact of human activities on extreme events such as flood or drought far is expressed by the following equation stott et al 2004 19 far 1 p n a t p a l l where in risk based approaches one discusses the probability of occurrence of a climate event in two states the state considering anthropogenic climate influence real world with the probability of p a l l the state without anthropogenic climate factors having the probability of p n a t for the probabilities of flood occurrence all the composite storms are run in the infoworks icm hydrodynamic model we estimate the probability of flooding for factual p a l l and counterfactual p n a t worlds by dividing the number of the flooded nodes under each composite storm over the total number of nodes 20a p n a t n f l o o d e d n a t n t o t a l 20b p a l l n f l o o d e d a l l n t o t a l where n f l o o d e d a l l n f l o o d e d n a t and n t o t a l are the number of flooded nodes for factual and counterfactual worlds and the total number of nodes respectively hannart et al 2016 made a mathematical connection between far and the causal counterfactual probability theory pearl 2009 the causal inference for extremes aims at discovering and quantifying cause and effect relations between anthropogenic climate impacts and extreme events runge et al 2019 in this theory three facets of causality for the extreme event attribution are described as i necessary causation where the occurrence of extreme events effect is due to the presence of anthropogenic forcings cause but may also be due to other factors ii sufficient causation where anthropogenic forcings drive the occurrence of extreme events but may not be required for extreme events to occur and iii necessary and sufficient causation where the first and second facets both hold hannart and naveau 2018 climate models with and without external anthropogenic climate forcing enable us to differentiate between the probabilities of sufficient causation ps and necessary causation pn and to compute the probability of necessary and sufficient causation pns in a deterministic sense these probabilities of causation are defined as follows 21a pn m a x 1 p n a t p a l l 0 21b ps m a x 1 1 p a l l 1 p n a t 0 21c pns m a x p a l l p n a t 0 whenever p a l l p n a t pn matches with the far in other words a far between zero and one indicates the degree of such necessary causation these new measures have been rarely used in previous extreme event attribution studies 5 results and discussion 5 1 validation of the downscaling methods 5 1 1 validation of the bias correction method the bias correction results are validated by comparing the raw and bias corrected extreme precipitation simulations of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms against uccle observations for the validation period 1971 2000 fig 3 the results show that the raw extreme precipitation simulations of the gcms significantly underestimate the observations the underestimation of extreme precipitation by gcms has numerously been reported in previous studies e g sillmann et al 2013 that is attributed to their low horizontal resolution and a poor representation parametrization of sub grid physical processes such as surface fluxes and radiative heating cloud and precipitation micro physics turbulence and convection yano 2016 the distribution based bias correction considerably reduces the underestimation of extreme precipitation especially for the cmip5 gcms whose raw simulations have a larger bias compared to the cmip6 gcms fig 3 while the range of the bias corrected cmip5 simulations covers the observed extremes for the return periods of 4 years the bias corrected cmip6 simulations are unable to capture the observed more extreme events 5 1 2 validation of the scaling relations derived from the observations fitting the gev distribution is done for uccle and 6 neighboring stations for different aggregation levels to derive the scaling relations table 5 for uccle station a very good fit between duration and the location and scale parameters is observed with r2 close to 1 indicating a strong relationship of the parameters with the duration fig s2 however no specific relation is observed for the shape parameter for uccle station not shown to check the validity of the results obtained at uccle station the powers of alpha and beta and the coefficients of a and b are compared with the corresponding values at the other stations the results of the comparison generally validate the scaling relations obtained at uccle station for the next steps which is a strong power relationship of the location and scale parameters with duration for the temporal downscaling procedure cannon and innocenti 2019 assumed a single power for both gev parameters of scale and location however here we calculate two powers for the two parameters for more accurate estimations and this is apparent from the difference between the two power α and β in table 4 table 5 also confirms the power relation between duration and the gev parameters of scale and location suggested by courty et al 2019 for the downscaling of the extreme precipitation 5 2 selection of effectively distinct models to reduce the computational time needed for flood simulations which will be discussed later a selection procedure for the climate models is adopted this selection procedure uses a k means clustering method to create groups of models with similarities as one of the criteria for the cluster analysis is to evaluate the performance of climate model simulations based on observations extreme precipitation intensities are calculated for different return periods using an empirical distribution for both simulated and observed data for the 1901 2000 period to this end the model simulations are modified by arfs to make gridded precipitation comparable with point station precipitation the arfs of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms are listed in table 6 the computed arfs range from 0 76 to 0 83 indicating 20 32 underestimation of precipitation extremes by the climate models this underestimation is because of a spatial scale mismatch between station observations and model outputs as the latter represents area averages rather than point values specifically extreme precipitation values obtained from station observations are expected to be more intense compared with the ones from gridded model output chen and knutson 2008 because of the smoothing associated with the spatial averaging of precipitation characteristics over the model grid cells sivapalan and blöschl 1998 a fundamental issue in the cluster analysis is to determine the number of clusters christiansen 2007 which was found to influence the clustering results wang et al 2020a the choice of the number of clusters is based on a trade off between the computation time for the flood modeling and the bias a smaller number of clusters decreases the computation time however increases the possible bias from a smaller sample size and vice versa accordingly the search space for the optimum number of clusters is limited to the range of 4 6 for the 9 cmip6 gcms and 5 8 for the 13 cmip5 gcms five is found to be the optimum number of clusters for both cmip5 and cmip6 ensembles one important issue for the optimum number of clusters by the k means algorithm is that it only considers statistical measures and not the physical meaning for clustering leckebusch et al 2008 especially when the optimal number of clusters is small the algorithm can combine climate models simualting larger and smaller historical extremes compared to the natural ones or those simulating a large over and under estimation of observed events we thus take into account the physical soundness of the statistical clustering fig 4 illustrates the clusters of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms respectively the selection of the models was performed according to the following steps the model which had s 1 first similarity measure eq 4 closest to 1 was chosen as the representative of each cluster the plane shown in fig 4 was divided into four subregions by two lines s 1 1 and s 2 1 second similarity measure eq 5 if one or both of these lines crossed a cluster that cluster was also divided into subclusters and the above selection criterion was employed for each subcluster in order to select one representative from each of them this is the case for clusters 3 and 2 in the cmip5 and cmip6 ensembles which were divided into two subclusters by s 2 1 in the mentioned clusters the climate models indicate a different behavior large over and under estimation of observations and or larger and smaller historical extremes compared to the natural ones locating them on different sides of the line s1 1 or s2 1 we then select one model from each subcluster which means selecting two models from the mentioned clusters our results confirm earlier arguments that climate models are not independent sanderson et al 2015 merrifield et al 2020 making it difficult to justify model democracy knutti et al 2017 aside from interdependence among the climate models of the same center interdependence exists between the models of different centers in agreement with the results of previous studies leduc et al 2016 the selected models according to the selection procedure are shown in table 2 5 3 spatiotemporal downscaling table 7 indicates the cfs obtained for the cmip5 and cmip6 models for the daily aggregation level for the cmip5 gcms the cfs for the scale and location parameters are above one which expresses that all the parameters of uccle have larger values compared to the model simulations however the cfs for the shape parameter are smaller than one as for the cmip6 gcms the values for the scale and location parameters are greater for uccle data except for the ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models the cmip6 models show larger variations for the shape parameter compared to the cmip5 models for the temporal downscaling an assumption was made to use the same α 0 6426 and β 0 6662 calibrated of the observed data for the period 1971 2000 therefore the coefficients of a and b can be obtained for all models consequently the scale and location parameters of aggregation levels down to 10 min are calculated the results for the coefficients of a and b for the cmip5 and cmip6 models are presented in table 8 the coefficients are quite in the same range the cmip5 gcms have relatively smaller coefficients comparing to the cmip6 gcms in addition cesm2 has very high intensities which were caused by a large difference between its shape parameter values of the calibration and validation periods this large difference impacts the corrected shape parameter after multiplying by its bias correction factor i e after spatial downscaling cesm2 model was thus removed from the selected cmip6 models the idf curves of historical and natural simulations of the selected cmip5 and cmip6 models are shown for four return periods in figs s3 s6 based on the idf curves composite design storms of historical and natural simulations for the cmip5 and cmip6 models are drawn for four return periods in figs s7 s10 fig 5 illustrates a comparison of composite storms derived from historical and natural simulations of two selected cmip6 gcms with different behaviors anthropogenic climate influences have intensified the composite storms in the ipsl cm6a lr gcm noticeably moving the hyetograph upward an opposite pattern is seen for the gfdl esm4 gcm where composite storms derived from natural simulations are far larger than those from historical simulations this opposite pattern points to the large uncertainty of extreme precipitation simulations from gcms 5 4 attribution analysis the results of far for the selected cmip5 and cmip6 models are shown in fig 6 a positive sign of far indicates a larger number of flooded nodes of historical than natural data meaning that anthropogenic climate factors have risen the probability of pluvial flooding in the study area in contrast a negative far value depicts the opposite of this conclusion as suggested by bellprat and doblas reyes 2016 the event attribution of this study assesses climate models separately rather than considering them in one ensemble this suggestion provides better results since it reflects the model inadequacies individually it could be seen from fig 6 that far results of models significantly differ which shows the appropriateness of individual assessment of the models unlike many of the attribution studies that have large scales such as fischer and knutti 2015 and king et al 2016 this study implements a local scale study necessary for urban flood analyses restricting the analysis to a grid cell of global climate models for local impact studies however leads to a high level of internal variability compared to larger scales the negative far can be due to larger precipitation quantiles in natural simulations than in historical simulations for some gcms namely can esm2 mri cgcm3 gfdl esm4 and miroc6 not shown the higher natural return levels are also reflected in the fitted gev parameters of the validation period of the mentioned models as well as csiro mk3 the results show that for the cmip5 gcms cnrm cm5 and ccsm models have the highest positive far among the other models the far values from cnrm cm5 rise from t 2 to 10 years and fall afterward while those of the ccsm model monotonically increase with the return period inversely can esm2 and csiro mk3 result in the highest negative far can esm2 has a decreasing trend of far against the return period while csiro mk3 s trend is the other way around for the cmip6 gcms ipsl cm6 a lr and nor esm2 models possess the largest positive far ipsl cm6 a lr far monotonically increases with respect to t while the trend of nor esm2 is like the cnrm cm5 model from the cmip5 ensemble in contrast the highest negative far among the cmip6 models belongs to gfdl esm4 and miroc6 which show a larger absolute value of far for bigger return periods previous studies have shown an increasing trend of future extreme precipitation changes with the event extremity hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 myhre et al 2019 tabari 2021 due to a larger contribution of atmospheric moisture changes thermodynamic effects than atmospheric circulation changes dynamic effects to more extreme precipitation chen et al 2019 such behavior was not found for historical human related climate impacts on urban flooding in antwerp belgium where the ensemble median far for all cmip models is equal to 0 141 0 136 0 059 and 0 092 for 2 10 20 and 50 year floods respectively it is attributed to the noisier pattern of more extreme precipitation and thus more intense floods at the local scale the undetectability of historical climate change signals in urban flood intensity is also expected for other regions due to the high internal variability of extreme patterns at a local scale which needs further research our findings show a large uncertainty in the far results ranging from large negative to large positive values the uncertainty in far values is always model based lott and stott 2016 the large climate model uncertainty for projected extreme precipitation has previously been reported tabari et al 2019 kim et al 2020 tabari 2020 lehner et al 2020 which stems from structural discrepancies between gcms and the way they respond to external forcings lehner et al 2020 such as different parameterizations of some processes and numerical approximations naveau et al 2020 the causal counterfactual probability theory confirms the far results while providing further information table 9 as for the far the gcms present different results for the causal counterfactual probability theory the results from the ccsm and cnrm cm5 gcms from the cmip5 ensemble and the ipsl cm6a lr and noresm2 lm gcms from the cmip6 ensemble provide a medium to high likelihood pn 0 3 of urban flooding occurrence due to anthropogenic climate impacts in a necessary causation view it implies that urban flooding would not have likely happened without anthropogenic climate impacts given that both urban flooding and anthropogenic climate impacts did in fact happen in other words anthropogenic climate factors can be considered a necessary cause of urban flooding or anthropogenic climate factors are required for urban flooding to happen but that other factors might also be needed in contrast the results of the causal counterfactual probability theory from the cmip5 can esm2 model and the cmip6 gfdl esm4 and miroc6 models with ps 0 3 reveal that urban flooding of high return periods would have likely happened in the presence of anthropogenic climate impacts given that urban flooding and anthropogenic climate impacts did not happen however there is low evidence pns 0 24 that urban flooding would have happened in the presence of anthropogenic climate impacts and that urban flooding would not have happened without anthropogenic climate impacts the overall results imply that urban flooding events in antwerp city cannot be attributed to anthropogenic climate influences however an extreme event could take place due to internal natural variability thus it is not reasonable to attribute the extreme events only to human impacts in the current study not all floods are attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts the attribution analysis results for urban flooding were also confirmed by the results of extreme precipitation derived from an empirical distribution the models with a positive far value and the necessary causation pn probability of 0 for urban flooding also have larger extreme precipitation in the historical simulations compared to natural simulations also the models with a negative far value and the sufficient causation ps probability of 0 show a smaller historical extreme precipitation than natural extreme precipitation it refuses the possible effect of the bias in theoretical distribution fitting and the flood modeling on the uncertainty of the attribution analysis results this study is restricted to be implemented on one grid cell of global climate models in which the precipitation has a high internal variability hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 for time series representing larger regions of the world the anthropogenic climate impacts are more detectable since the internal variability in larger spatial scales reduces and this allows the human induced signals to appear earlier king et al 2015 most of the attribution studies are implemented on large global or continental scales fischer and knutti 2015 li et al 2017 tabari et al 2020 in which the signals are more robust and detectable higher signal to noise ratios it is especially important for extreme precipitation with the high internal variability noise while the scale matters less for extreme temperature kirchmeier young et al 2019 in this regard tabari et al 2020 considered latitudinal precipitation average precipitation for all model grids in each latitude for a continental attribution study over europe to decrease internal variability and obtain stronger anthropogenic climate signals they found that anthropogenic climate influences have altered the present modes of climatic variability and increased extreme precipitation anomalies across the continent with a 41 anthropogenic contribution for mid 50 60 latitudes where belgium is located a comparison of flood volumes derived from historical and natural simulations validates the attribution analysis results fig 7 the varying pattern of the flood volume with the ensemble climate model and return period is consistent with that of the flood probability in the far framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory it is also found that although the flood volume increases with the return period for both historical and natural simulations anthropogenic climate influences do not increase with the return period as an example of the antwerp network fig 8 illustrates the maximum flood depth of ccsm model nodes for historical and natural model outputs of a 50 year return period as indicated by the large positive far value and pn 0 526 of the ccsm model the flooded nodes in historical simulations are far larger than those in natural simulations the flooded nodes are also distributed over the studied network 6 conclusions and recommendations this study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts the proposed framework is applied to urban pluvial flooding in antwerp city using uccle observed precipitation data along with natural and historical simulations of the cmip5 and cmip6 gcms the results indicate that almost half of the models have a positive far showing a higher ratio of flooded nodes in the historical real world case in most of cases it was expected that historical precipitation leads to more flooding than the natural one the climate models generally do not indicate a solid agreement on the contribution of human activities as the major cause of the pluvial flooding the results of the causal counterfactual probability theory confirm the discrepancy between gcms while the anthropogenic climate influence is virtually certainly a sufficient cause for urban flooding based on the results of some gcms it is a necessary cause based on the results of some other gcms it is none of the causes based on the rest of gcms the proposed framework in this study for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical climate change can be further improved in future research our framework makes use of the cluster analysis to select the representative climate models in order to decrease the running time of the flood modeling using data driven approaches li and willems 2020 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a or a combined data driven and physically based model structure wolfs and willems 2017 for the flood modeling are other alternatives to reduce the computational time coarse scale climate models used in this study parametrize sub grid processes e g convection which is a source of bias in their simulations prein et al 2015 yuval and o gorman 2020 high resolution climate models in which deep convection is explicitly represented by the model grid convection permitting models cpms with a grid spacing of 4 km are able to more realistically simulate extreme precipitation with high local sub daily accumulations prein et al 2015 tabari et al 2016 kendon et al 2017 fosser et al 2020 however producing century long simulations crucial for the attribution analysis by cpms is not currently computationally feasible and will remain beyond the reach for the foreseeable future our results reveal that the major driver of pluvial flooding in antwerp can be local factors such as urban expansion where build up areas were more than doubled from 1976 to 2000 poelmans et al 2010 it led to an increase in surface runoffs poelmans et al 2010 and peak flows akter et al 2018 the excess water flows resulting from the urban expansion cannot be handled by the existing urban sewage network in antwerp and may lead to flooding the importance of green and blue spaces to reduce the risk of urban pluvial flooding in antwerp was however well recognized by the authorities who plan to expand these spaces in the future huyghe et al 2021 the possible influence of historical urbanization on the urban flooding in antwerp requires further research cmip5 cmip6 models used in this study have a poor and simplified representation of urban land use and statistical downscaling cannot fully reproduce urban signals dynamical downscaling of these coarse scale models to derive cpms have important benefits for the representation of small scale orography and variations of surface fields prein et al 2015 paving the way for an improved assessment of local urbanization impact a distribution based downscaling method was used in this study to spatially and temporally downscale precipitation extremes as the inputs of the hydrodynamic model this method can also be performed with other extreme value analysis methods and theoretical distributions to explore the sensitivity of the results to the statistical methodology tabari 2021 using other bias correction methods such as quantile mapping maraun et al 2010 and quantile delta mapping cannon et al 2015 and other temporal disaggregation techniques such as hyetos kossieris et al 2018 cascade güntner et al 2001 mudrain koutsoyiannis et al 2003 artificial neural network mirhosseini et al 2014 and k nearest neighbor lu and qin 2014 provide an opportunity to compare the results of different downscaling methods and quantify the related uncertainty by including all influencing factors on climate change assessments uncertainty in the results can be more effectively decomposed into contributing sources tabari et al 2019 we employed two statistical methods of the fractional attributable risk and the causal counterfactual probability theory to attribute the changes in the probability of urban pluvial flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts we defined the probability of flooding over the study sewer network as the ratio of the number of the flooded nodes over the total number of nodes the probability of flooding can also be estimated per node where the probability of exceeding a certain quantile derived from pre industrial control simulations pi experiment as a benchmark is compared between historical and natural simulations it is also possible to extend the attribution analysis of the urban flooding for the future climate when human induced climate impacts are stronger it is expected that the fraction of attributable risk gets positive and stronger in the future the spatial pooling of extreme precipitation values over neighboring grid cells e g 3 3 arrays hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 rather than using single grid box values may also reduce internal variability and lead to the emergence of anthropogenic signals from background noise besides the fractional attributable risk and the causal counterfactual probability theory optimal fingerprinting allen and stott 2003 is another widely used

4569,we present a synthetic hydraulic analysis of the propagation of oscillatory perturbations in a two dimensional saturated zone bounded above by a capillary fringe unsaturated flows are simulated in a physical model using a hysteretic form of richards equation parameterized using the van genuchten water retention curve and the mualem hydraulic conductivity equation for a sand loam and intermediate soil soil type affects periodic responses as a function of their hydrodynamic and van genuchten properties we first analyze the effect of various hydraulic or signal properties on the oscillatory responses simulated at different locations and depths we then test the imaging potential of oscillatory responses recorded in the saturated zone to spatially charaterize homogeneous or heterogeneous soils also considering the effect of period of oscillation we find that a separation of these responses into amplitude phase couples permits to dissociate the characterization of different hydraulic properties periodic amplitudes decay with distance mainly as a function of hydraulic conductivity and phase lags decrease with frequency due to storage in the capillary fringe thus responses amplitude appears to be especially sensitive to conductivity k which allows to isolate this property from the others phases can then be used to better characterize the vertical flows effect through the van genuchten parameters α and n higher periods will tend to accentuate the unsaturated flows effect on the responses and can therefore be adopted for a better characterization of α and n however using low period responses can also be useful as they provide better estimates of conductivity values in media with low heterogeneities we consider this work as a useful preliminary analysis for future sandbox or field real cases applications and provide advices for such applications in the discussion keywords van genuchten periodic signal imaging subsurface tomography vadose zone 1 introduction in hydraulic characterization of unconfined aquifers by pumping tests identifying the impact of the capillary fringe on saturated flows remains a non trivial task indeed the unsaturated zone can contribute substantially to the flows in the saturated zone through vertical fluxes neuman 1972 mishra et al 2012 lin et al 2017 therefore a rigorous interpretation of these tests requires a quantification of these vertical fluxes and a characterization of the hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone in addition a spatial characterization of the hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity of unconfined aquifer including its cover can substantially improve our comprehension of the processes of recharge and contaminant transport in the critical zone this can be performed with a hydraulic tomography approach in which a physical numerical model is used in an inversion process to retrieve the hydraulic properties by fitting hydraulic head measurements usually in such approach these hydraulic heads are measured simultaneously in multiple wells and at multiple depths in response to cross wells perturbations yeh and lee 2007 yeh et al 2013 liu et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 in the literature several hydraulic tomography of unconfined aquifers have already been performed on field or laboratory applications in particular on field cases applications the boise hydrogeophysical research site bhrs has been particularly studied cardiff et al 2009 2012 2013a 2019 cardiff and barrash 2011 rabinovich et al 2015 hochstetler et al 2016 however in these applications the authors considered that the drainage occurring during their tests was instantaneous and did not generate delayed responses effect thus they simulated only the saturated flows in the aquifer in order to characterize the conductivity and specific storage fields it is shown that this approximation is acceptable when a specific yield value is employed for the drainage in the early time pumping cardiff and barrash 2011 cardiff et al 2012 however to apply this method the effective porosity must trigger instantaneous drainage at the beginning of the pumping or the effective porosity must contribute only for a negligible vertical flux compared to the horizontal fluxes generated by pumping cardiff and barrash 2011 mao et al 2013a have presented a theoretical analysis of the application of hydraulic tomography on an unconfined aquifer also taking into account hydraulic properties related to the unsaturated flows pore size distribution parameters and saturated water content this approach has been successfully applied theoretically and experimentally in sandboxes with an analysis of temporal drawdown curves in response to constant rate pumping mao et al 2013b zhao et al 2015 however to date a real field case application following this method has not been presented therefore further recommendations have been provided for adapting such process in real applications in mao et al 2013a and zhao et al 2015 the major concerns in its application remains effect of noise on the data and the necessity to assess a sufficient amount of information on both the saturated flows rather horizontal and the unsaturated flows rather vertical in the dataset oscillatory pumping tests can improve the quality of hydraulic data and thus the characterization of unconfined aquifers including the effect of the marginal capillary zone during the last decades applications of oscillatory excitations in the identification of the hydraulic properties of aquifers have been widely explored both theoretically and experimentally black and kipp 1981 rasmussen et al 2000 2003 renner and messar 2006 fokker et al 2013 fischer et al 2018 2020a 2020b salina et al 2019 cardiff et al 2019 the imaging potential of such data has been studied in cardiff et al 2013b and their advantages in field application have been discussed in bakhos et al 2014 in terms of ability to easily eliminate noises from the measurements and in cardiff and barrash 2014 for configuring the period of oscillation in order to investigate different flowpaths in the aquifer the propagation of oscillatory signals in soils under conditions of variable saturation has been analyzed in several works with numerical data revil et al 2008 shoushtari et al 2015 or laboratory data cartwright et al 2003 2004 cartwright 2014 all these works discuss the effect of hysteresis existing for unsaturated flows and having an impact on the oscillatory responses this hysteresis effect is due to the wetting and dewatering processes of soils that generate loops in the water content curves these scanning loops can be modeled with hydrodynamic dependent unsaturated flows parameters effects of air entrapment during soils wetting can also temporarily affect the saturated water content value kool and parker 1987 several analytical solutions have recently been proposed for the estimation of soils hydraulic property values in unconfined aquifers from oscillatory signal responses dagan and rabinovich 2014 huang et al 2019 cheng and renner 2018 however it is still rare for spatial variability to be taken into account in characterization applications considering both the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic properties furthermore the information brought by oscillatory responses for the spatial characterization of unconfined aquifers still needs to be investigated with this work our aim is to further investigate the effect of oscillatory flows generated at the limit of the saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer in order to propose a preliminary analysis of this type of data for future characterization application in particular hydraulic tomography for this purpose we simulated flows associated to extraction injection oscillations in a synthetic sandbox with a physical numerical model we first present an analysis of the effect of different soil properties on the oscillatory responses then we focus more particularly on the effect of conductivity k and the unsaturated van genuchten parameters α and n and study the possibility to spatially characterize these properties with the information carried in the oscillatory responses finally we discuss our analysis and imaging results in order to provide some advices for future works of hydraulic tomography using this type of data 2 presentation of the model we developed a physics based model of an unconfined soils with variable saturation with comsol multiphysics see fig 1 this model represents a 2 d side views of a synthetic sandbox at a metric scale 3 m wide for 1 m depth we considered the initial water table to be 50 cm below the surface thus initially half of the model is saturated and the other half unsaturated the modeled sandbox is equipped with a pumping injection point hereafter noted s and measurement axes at distances of 20 40 and 60 cm from the pumping axis in which hydraulic pressure responses are simulated at different depths of the saturated zone 60 and 90 cm in order to take into account the capillary fringe effect on the saturated responses we simulated water flows with richards formulation of the continuity equation for a 2d side viewed temporal model 1 c m s e s h t k k r h p z q where t is time s h p is the hydraulic pressure m at a given depth z m k is the hydraulic conductivity m s s is the storage coefficient m 1 related to the soil compressibility s e denotes the effective saturation c m is the specific moisture capacity m 1 k r is the relative permeability and q is the darcy s velocity at the pumping locations m s we consider that no vertical flows occur at the upper boundary of the sandbox during the simulations the other boundaries are impervious implying a finite volume of water in the sandbox no inlet or outlet the flows in the model are then solved within an adaptive size triangular mesh with a finite element method this model simulates in time the hydraulic pressures in the variably saturated soil in response to a sinusoidal oscillating perturbation injecting and extracting successively a same amount of water 2 q q a s i n 2 π pe t where q is the extraction injection flowrate m3 s q a is the oscillating flowrate amplitude m3 s and and pe is the oscillating flowrate period s s e c m and k r are calculated with the van genuchten equations these equations are dependent on the groundwater pressure h p h z i e if the water at a given location x z is at an atmospheric pressure or not 3 s e 1 1 α h p n 1 1 n i f h p 0 s e 1 i f h p 0 4 c m α 1 1

θ r are the saturated and residual water content a hysteretic effect occurs in unsaturated soils inducing a difference in the dewatering and the wetting of the soil in this study a spatial and temporal frequency dependent hysteresis effect is implemented in the model based on the formulation of revil et al 2008 for periodic sources and the observations made in shoushtari et al 2015 that hysteresis effects attenuates with distance to the signal source the hysteresis is generated by computing dynamic values of α and n following the induced periodic movement over space and time 6 α t α mean 1 m h y s t min z p z z h y s t 1 m h y s t sin 2 π t p e where m hyst is the magnitude of the hysteresis effect α mean represents the mean value of α 1 m z p is the pumping depth m and z hyst is the distance of attenuation of the hysteresis effect hereafter 50 cm a similar formulation is also used to compute n t considering a n mean value we briefly present in fig 2 the effects of the simulated hysteresis on the saturation level and the simulated pressures in our model after one cycle of pumping injection the saturation level will not come back to its origin when incorporating a hysteresis effect a part of the mobilized water will remain in the unsaturated zone generating a lowering of the saturation level after several cycles the effect generates a global decrease of the saturated unsaturated interface in the unsaturated zone the shape of the signal becomes deformed by the hysteresis effect especially observable for the period of 30 min wherein it cannot be considered as a sinusoidal form anymore the effect of the period of oscillation is also more important in the unsaturated zone where the oscillatory response tends to vanish faster in terms of amplitude than in the saturated zone when the period of the signal is decreased in the saturated zone the hysteresis effect does not seem to modify the shape of the signal directly thus the pressure responses in the saturated zone contain a sinusoidal part h osc in response to the oscillating signal that can be written 7 h osc h a s i n 2 π pe t h p π 180 where h a is the oscillating response amplitude m and h p is the oscillating response phase lag to the signal source these oscillatory parts can be extracted from the head responses through a fast fourier transform fft directly in terms of timeless amplitudes h a and phases h p we simulated and observed the oscillatory responses in the saturated zone for different types of soils by modifying the property values inputs in the model hereafter in this work we principally compare these responses in sand in loam or an intermediate soil with properties between sand and loam ones the hydraulic property values employed for these two configurations are presented in table 1 and were chosen mainly according to the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda in leij et al 1996 and to previous works in the unconfined aquifers literature for the hydrogeological soil properties we chose constant values also based on what can be usually found in the literature θ r 0 05 θ s 0 40 and s 10 5 m 1 we considered a m hyst 25 magnitude hysteresis effect in the unsaturated zone based on the recommendations in kool and parker 1987 fig 3 presents the differences between our simulated sand and loam soils in terms of unsaturated flows i e effective saturation profiles water content curves and hysteresis effects on the responses in the saturated zone it can be noted that this hysteresis effect shown in fig 2 is more important in sand than in loam 3 comparative analysis of the effect of various soil properties on the oscillatory responses by simulating flows during pumping and injection phases in sand and loam fig 4 we can clearly observe the different types of flows that will be mobilized in these two configurations vertical flows will occur in the unsaturated zone horizontal in depths of the saturated zone and mixed vertical horizontal flows near the saturated unsaturated interface it can also be observed from the arrows sizes proportional to the flow intensity in the unsaturated zone in fig 4 that vertical flows are in proportion more important in sand than in loam we first evaluated how oscillatory responses i e amplitudes phase lags are affected by variations of individual parameters values for the intermediate soil table 1 using a pumping amplitude of q a 1 ml s and period of oscillation p e 15 min in fig 5 we present the variations induced in the amplitude and phases responses at the different locations when modifying the conductivity and anisotropy values of our intermediate soil to values corresponding rather to sand soil ones or rather to loam soil ones the absolute responses presented for the intermediate soil in the middle column of the figure globally show an amplitude decrease and phase increase with the radial distance to the perturbation source point s however the oscillation better propagates in the deep saturated zone below s than near the unsaturated one as amplitudes are higher and phases lower below s even if these simulation points are more distant to the source than the ones above s it clearly appears that the oscillatory responses are affected by the conductivity and its anisotropy especially in terms of amplitudes for a similar perturbation the amplitude responses will be higher in loam than in sand oppositely the phases will become globally lower when applied in loam and higher in sand however in this case the conductivity seems to more particularly affect the phases of responses associated to horizontal flows below s the degree of anisotropy will have a similar but less important effect than conductivities on amplitude responses becoming more important in loam with higher anisotropy the phase responses are especially affected when lowering the anisotropy generating higher phases in sand when moving away from the perturbation source fig 6 presents a similar analysis with the van genuchten parameters α and n associated to the unsaturated flows these parameters also affect the oscillatory responses but in a different manner than conductivity parameter α appears to affect the differences in the responses above and below s in fact its modification will generate more important variations in terms of amplitude above s denoting an effect on the vertical flows impacts it will also affect the phase responses but rather reducing the vertical differences in loam and accentuating it in sand thus again generating responses variations vertically parameter n in contrary generates variations affecting essentially the phases of the responses accentuating them and their vertical differences in loam and lowering them in sand the phase variations remain constant with distance to s this suggests a more local impact at the perturbation point that is then propagated to the other responses as for the previous conductivity analysis the effects on the responses induced by α and n are opposites when tending to one or another sand or loam property value this already suggest that quantitatively analyzing the responses spatially and vertically could allow to assess a soil s saturated and unsaturated hydraulic property values a third similar analysis has been conducted on other parameters not necessarily linked to the two types of soil loam and sand considered in this study this analysis is presented in fig 7 with the effect of the period of oscillation the saturated water content of the soil and the magnitude of hysteresis effect the period of oscillation influences the distance of propagation of the perturbation in the soil a lower period will attenuate more rapidly with distance to s an opposite effect is observed when increasing the period a vertical effect of the period can also be observed the period tends to accentuate the vertical difference observed in the responses above and below s when it is decreased more important horizontal flows and to reduce this difference for higher periods the saturated water content generates a similar effect but with opposite variations in fact a higher saturated content will accentuate the vertical differences in the responses while a lower saturated content will reduce the vertical differences the hysteresis effect occurring in the unsaturated zone does not substantially affects the oscillatory responses in the considered range of periods of oscillation 5 to 30 min except a global low increase of the phase responses that can be observed for a high hysteresis magnitude nevertheless fig 2 shows that this effect affects the mean saturation level over time however when performing a fft analysis on the pressure responses this mean level can be isolated this first comparative analysis shows that the spatial oscillatory responses are differently affected by the different soil properties and signal parameters one advantage of oscillatory responses is that they can be easily dissociated into amplitudes and phases which are also differently affected by each properties therefore this type of responses could be used to assess the values of different soil properties 4 imaging potential of the oscillatory responses in the saturated zone 4 1 inverse problem in order to analyze if and how responses to oscillatory signals may provide information in order to image the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties in an aquifer we have re interpreted generated oscillatory responses in our sand or loam soils models through inversion processes the inverse problem is based on objective functions which quantify the gap between responses simulated through a physical model for given property values and a set of observed responses that one wants to interpret these objective functions also incorporate a priori information on the property values in order to overcome the issue of non unicity of the solution we use our model presented in section 2 to generate oscillatory responses for different values of conductivities k and van genuchten parameters α and n this operation can be mathematically written 8 d f p where d is a m d 1 vector containing the amplitude and phase responses simulated at each measurement location f is the solver of the numerical model and p is a m p 1 vector containing distributed values of k α and n in logarithmic scale using logarithmic values permits avoiding negative values during the optimization process a simultaneous optimization of different properties in the iterative inversion process can lead to a divergence of the process furthermore as shown in previous section the amplitude responses appear to be especially sensitive to conductivity therefore we decided to perform our inversion process sequentially with two different objective functions ψ k and ψ α n that are conceived to successively optimize the hydraulic conductivity k only with the amplitude responses and then the van genuchten parameters α and n by adding the phase responses in the process 9 ψ k d a m p o b s d a m p t r a m p 1 d a m p o b s d a m p p k p r i o r p k t c k 1 p k p r i o r p k 10 ψ α n d o b s d t r 1 d o b s d p α n p r i o r p α n t c α n 1 p α n p r i o r p α n where ψ designates the objective functions for determining k or α and n from the information carried by the amplitude and phase responses contained in a m d vector d obs r σ 2 id m d is a m d m d diagonal matrix holding variances σ 2 on the amplitude σ 2 0 1 cm and phase responses σ 2 1 d amp obs and r amp designate the sub

matrix holding covariances constraining the hydraulic property values and their distribution p k p α n c k and c α n designate the sub vectors and sub matrices associated to k or α and n the inversion process consists in an iterative process aiming to minimize the values of these objectives function successively by updating deterministically the property values in the model via the computation of a jacobian matrix tarantola and valette 1982 11 f i j f i p j δ p f i p j δ p where f i j represents the sensitivity of a data i to modification δ p 10 2 on the property value j during the first inversion sequence the update of the conductivity values from an iteration k 1 to k is given by 12 p k k p k k 1 f k t r amp 1 f k c k 1 1 f k t r amp 1 d amp obs d amp c k 1 p k prior p k where f k is the jacobian matrix described in eq 11 performing the sensibility analysis between the k values and amplitude responses during the second inversion sequence the update of the van genuchten parameters values from an iteration k 1 to k is given by 13 p α n k p α n k 1 f α n t r 1 f α n c α n 1 1 f α n t r 1 d o b s d c α n 1 p α n p r i o r p α n where f α n is the jacobian matrix described in eq 11 performing the sensibility analysis between the α and n values and amplitude and phase responses at the end of the inversion the standard deviations on the inverted property values can be obtained from the square roots values of the diagonal entries of matrix c post using the last iterations jacobian matrices 14 c post f t r 1 f c 1 1 performing an inversion in this way by isolating the k values in the process we could improve the stability of the inversion and accelerate its convergence to more realistic solutions in fact the results presented hereafter show that the amplitude responses can be closely reproduced by optimizing the k field regardless of the van genuchten parameters the remaining amplitude and phase differences can then be adjusted by optimizing the van genuchten parameters in fact we have also tested inversions simultaneously optimizing k α and n that did not converge in particular it seems that a good assumptions on k is required prior to the optimization of the van genuchten parameters for all inversion applications presented hereafter we did not consider any hysteresis effect on the responses simulated in the inversions even if the observed data were generated with a 25 hysteresis magnitude 4 2 homogeneous cases applications inversions have been performed with oscillatory responses generated in homogeneous loams or sands using property values presented in table 1 for this generation we applied an injection extraction rate aiming to generate similar pressure amplitudes 10 cm at the perturbation point in both type of soil i e q a 1 ml s in loam and q a 10 ml s in sand the generated responses have been noised 2 added noise for the imaging applications the hydraulic properties were optimized within two blocks one superficial block between 0 and 65 cm depth and one deep block between 65 and 100 cm depth thus in our inversions the number of property values to be inverted was m p 6 2 distributed values for each property for a dataset composed of m d 7 amplitude phase responses couples we considered a diagonal covariance matrix for c with a 0 01 variance on each property value we initialized our inversions with the medium soil properties see table 1 so that we would be able to estimate if the information carried by the oscillatory responses would permit to partially or totally recover the loam and sand properties used for their generation the anisotropy of the medium was considered as known figs 8 and 9 present the inversion results obtained with oscillatory responses generated with different oscillation periods 5 and 30 min respectively in loam and in sand accurate conductivity values can be obtained from the amplitude responses alone for both type of soils and any oscillation period a slightly more accurate result is obtained with lower periods thus most of the amplitude responses can be reconstructed by optimizing the conductivities then the remaining responses differences in terms of amplitudes and phases can be essentially linked the unsaturated flows and the van genuchten parameters unsurprisingly these properties were optimized only in the upper blocks of the models associated to the unsaturated zone for α the accuracy of the characterization seems more period dependent better assumptions being systematically obtained with the 30 min periodic responses i e a lower frequency regarding n the accuracy appears to be more related to the soil with better quantifications obtained in sands rather than in loams globally we observe that the oscillatory responses measured in the saturated zone provide sufficient information to distinguish the type of soil type in the medium they can also allow the quantification of accurate properties values associated to the saturated and the unsaturated flows without necessarily having to simulate a hysteresis effect 4 3 simplified applications for heterogeneous cases we have then performed inversions with oscillatory responses simulated in simplistic heterogeneous cases see fig 10 in a wider sandbox 3 6 m width these cases consisted in 3 perturbations points black dots in fig 10 in a medium soil as described in table 1 surrounded by sand or loam areas in the saturated or unsaturated zones the velocity vectors simulated at each observation point white dots in fig 10 show that the generated flows are differently affected in each areas of the model most important velocities are observed in the sand areas both in saturated and unsaturated zones therefore in order to efficiently characterize the whole heterogeneity it is necessary to cross interpret data generated by signal sources located at different locations hydraulic tomography principle thus for the inversions we have simultaneously inverted the responses generated with each of the three perturbation sources these responses have been noised 2 added noise for the imaging applications we considered the anisotropy of the medium and also the properties of the soil at the perturbation locations to be known we have performed two types of inversions in a first inversion we have considered having a certain prior knowledge on the existing contrast in the soil and therefore invert properties within delineated zones in a second inversion we did not consider this knowledge and inverted the properties within a grid regularly distributed in 2d in the saturated zone and in 1d in the unsaturated zone see dotted lines delineations in fig 12 for our zoned inversions the number of property values to be inverted was m p 12 4 zoned values for each property for a dataset composed of m d 45 amplitude phase responses couples 15 responses obtained for each perturbation we considered a diagonal covariance matrix for c with a 0 01 variance on each property value we have tested different combinations of responses generated with lower or higher periods of oscillation 5 15 or 30 min in terms of imaging efficiency and for different heterogeneity configurations 3 4 sand 3 4 loam and half sand half loam the best imaging results obtained are presented in fig 11 here again amplitude responses alone are sufficient to reconstruct the heterogeneous contrast in the conductivity field for each period of oscillation tested the inverted conductivity values however do not always exactly match the true ones it appears that a contrasted soil half sand half loam zones is better characterized with higher periods of oscillation while a less contrasted medium is better characterized with lower periods concerning the van genuchten parameters optimized with the remaining differences in the amplitude and phase responses that could not be reproduced with conductivity alone they are better characterized with the higher period of oscillation in each case as for the homogeneous cases they can be characterized only in the unsaturated zone of the soil and do not image heterogeneities in the saturated zone parameter α appears to be more reliable than n for the interpretation of heterogeneity in the capillary fringe in fact in our results inverted n values are good for the upper left zone but not always for the upper right one while α values are always coherent in both corners for our distributed inversions the number of property values to be inverted was m p 123 41 distributed values for each property we constrained the spatial distribution of the inverted property values with an exponential variogram model with a range of 2 to compute the covariance values in matrix c we inverted the responses generated in the half sand half loam heterogeneous configuration with a period of oscillation of 30 min according to the best result configuration in the zoned inversions the inverted property fields and their associated normalized standard deviations are presented in fig 12 the inverted property values globally do not match the true ones they are mostly underestimated this can be explained by the lack of spatial constraints in this inversion that allows optimization process to generate local equivalent property values for the reproduction of the data especially for k which is optimized first however the trends and localizations of the heterogeneous contrasts can be imaged in both the saturated and unsaturated areas in the conductivity field the conductivity field is mainly sensible to the sand zones in the saturated area according to the distribution of its uncertainties on the other hand again unsurprisingly the van genuchten parameters image only the heterogeneities in the unsaturated area however in this distributed inversion it appears that α rather image the loam areas while n rather image the sand areas the uncertainty analysis shows a globally higher local sensitivity near the perturbation sources for n and a more homogeneous sensitivity among the whole unsaturated area for α 5 discussion 5 1 effects of hydraulic properties on the saturated responses our hydraulic analysis presented in this article tends to indicate that the different hydraulic properties considered k α and n affect differently the measured oscillatory responses in the saturated zone and that their relation to such type of responses is also conditioned to different factors such as the depth of the source or the measurement locations the conductivity k globally appears as the most interesting hydraulic property to be characterized with oscillatory responses in fact it is highly linked to the amplitude of the responses more than the other studied properties and thus can be easily isolated from these other properties when analyzing the responses basing our inversions of k on the amplitudes alone resulted indeed in good characterizations of its distributions in each configuration even without considering accurate van genuchten parameters this observation is in agreement with other works on unconfined media huang et al 2019 analyzed the sensitivity of oscillatory responses in unconfined aquifers through an analytic solution and noted the same high sensibility of the responses to k however this observation does not seem specific to oscillatory data in fact in their hydraulic tomography applications taking account unsaturated flows mao et al 2013b and zhao et al 2015 also observed that the contrasts in conductivity fields could be globally well imaged with responses to constant rates pumping mao et al 2013b even noticed the same fact that saturated flows properties could be well characterized even without accurate guesses on the unsaturated ones concerning the van genuchten parameters there is currently no previous studies taking them into account in a characterization of an unconfined aquifer with oscillatory signals mao et al 2013b and zhao et al 2015 employed the gardner russo s model to simulate the unsaturated flows and found that its parameters could be well characterized only in the unsaturated area in our study we observed that the oscillatory responses in the saturated zone are affected by both α and n with various intensities depending on the period of oscillation the type of soil and the type of flows generated the effect of n appears to be more related to the local response at the perturbation source local fluxes while α generates a more distributed effect on the responses vertical flows affecting the whole capillary fringe the imaging potential of α therefore appears as more reliable at the scale considered in our results metric scale trying to link this hydraulic behavior to geological explanations is a complex topic that is discussed in the literature it is mainly accepted that α is related to the air entry suction of the soil and n to the distribution of the pore size benson et al 2014 observed that for a uniform sand the breadth of the particle size influenced n while α was more linked to a median value of the particle size indicating a more integrative effect porebska et al 2006 noted that n was directly dependent to their soil composition sand clay silt which we also observe in our results while parameter α appeared to be more related to the granulometry of the sample 5 2 advantages of oscillatory signals and period dependent effects separating the responses signals into amplitude and phase allow for a better separation of the information contained in the data absolute amplitudes can be used to specifically characterize the conductivity k and appear to carry already a sufficient amount of information to interpret its variations around the perturbation points which can then be used to guide the characterization of the unsaturated flows parameters this possibility of separating the responses into amplitudes and phases in real cases can be achieved only if the responses reach a simple harmonic motion mainly after several periods the conditions allowing to reach this conditions are described in bakhos et al 2014 and in huang et al 2019 oscillatory signals also offers the possibility to be easily extractable from other sources of signals or noises techniques to efficiently process field oscillatory responses are proposed in bakhos et al 2014 it can also be noted that oscillatory responses generated with wetting dewatering of an unsaturated soil potentially allow to assess mean values of α and n in the water content curves while responses associated to constant pumping would characterize only the van genuchten values associated to the dewatering part of the curve due to the hysteresis scanning loops effect the effect of the period of oscillation on the flows generated in an aquifer has been discussed in previous works rabinovich et al 2015 cardiff et al 2013b fischer et al 2018 2020b globally according to these works decreasing the period of oscillation accentuate flows in the most conductive and mobilizable areas of the field and in the vicinity of the pumping injection location as water in the unsaturated zone represents a less mobilizable source of water than the volume in the saturated area it appears as logical that a lower period of oscillation accentuate the horizontal flows and does not allow for a good characterization of the unsaturated area in their field applications rasmussen et al 2003 observed in fact that with a very low period of oscillation the responses generated in an unconfined aquifer could be assimilated to confined medium responses therefore low periods of oscillations may be employed with care for unconfined aquifers according to several previous works on this topic rasmussen et al 2003 rabinovich et al 2015 cardiff et al 2019 cardiff et al 2019 also suggested that for high frequencies period 1 min the existing models such as the richards based may become inaccurate according to our results if lower periods provided better imaging results for k when the medium was homogeneous or with lowly contrasted heterogeneities a higher period of oscillation should be adopted if one wants to characterize draining effects parameters especially for α n being more related to local responses seems less dependent to the period however when dealing with higher period signals hysteresis effects should be considered with unsaturated flows in our results for periods between 5 and 30 min and at a metric scale we show that we can neglect its effects on the responses only for the responses in the saturated zone experiments made in cartwright 2014 and shoushtari et al 2015 are in agreement with this observation when the period of oscillation remain relatively low however the authors noted that for high periods of oscillations reaching several hours or more the hysteresis effect could become important even on the responses in the saturated zone and should be taken into account 5 3 toward real cases the analysis proposed in this article represents a preliminary work for future real cases tomographic applications it remains theoretical and real cases applications would face other problematics not considered in our models such as the impact of environmental noise on the data however it provides some information and methods that may be helpful for a better setup of oscillatory data interpretation in an unconfined aquifer a first adaptation for a field application would be to consider 3 d flows with boundary conditions often not affecting the perturbed volume therefore we have also simulated flows in a cylindrical homogeneous model with a similar geometry but a constant head boundary condition located far away from the perturbation source point s 50 m away this configuration thus considers volumetric effects and a theoretical infinite volume as water can enter or leave the model through the constant head boundary these consideration are more realistic for a field case we compare the responses simulated in this way in sand and loam to our 2 d model previously discussed in fig 13 in order to generate a signal of similar amplitude at the perturbation source it is necessary to increase its flowrate amplitude 40 times in loam 30 times in sand however the spatial responses simulated in this way will be different from the ones obtained in the 2 d finite volume model the attenuation of amplitude responses and the phase lags increase with distance become more important in the cylindrical infinite volume model in order to generate responses in the cylindrical model that are closer to the 2 d ones it is necessary to also increase the period of oscillation and the signal source depth relatively more in loam than in sand if the adopted cylindrical model remains very simplistic compared to real field it permits to provide insights on what configuration parameters should be especially considered for fields applications i e flowrate amplitude signal source depth and oscillation period and how to adapt to different type of soils 5 4 imaging potential in tomographic applications according to the results presented in this work having measurements and perturbation locations distributed spatially and also at different depths of the aquifer might provide different information on the different hydraulic properties horizontal flows effects might be better characterized by deeper responses or perturbation while the vertical flows effects can be better characterized by perturbation and measurements near the unsaturated zone this accumulation of distributed perturbations and information is furthermore a well known and widely used technique for the characterization of aquifers in hydraulic tomography furthermore we could observe that the localization of the signal source in depth was crucial for the characterization of the unsaturated area it is in fact necessary to generate a movement of the saturated unsaturated interface in order to generate vertical flows mainly with a source close to this interface or at this interface directly such as tide periodic sources mao et al 2013a provided several conditions on the dataset to perform accurate hydraulic tomography of unconfined aquifers in particular they recommend to measure fluxes in addition to pressure data and to couple different type of data in order to better characterize the heterogeneity of the medium ideally the different data should also identify flow processes in the saturated and the unsaturated zone separately yeh et al 2008 coupling geophysical data allowing to image water content variations in the soil and heterogeneity contrasts could greatly improve the imaging results indeed our inversions constrained with zones that can be typically delineated from geophysical interpretations showed better results than the regularly distributed ones in the method and the imaging applications presented in this work we consider prerequisites knowledges on the properties in particular we assume the storage coefficient the anisotropy and the saturated and residual water content of the medium to be known therefore for a real application case using the inversion method proposed in this paper one would need to estimate these values for this purpose cheng and renner 2018 proposed analytical solutions comparing pressures amplitude and phase responses measured above and below an oscillatory source to its flow rate signal allowing to estimate the anisotropy and storage coefficient at the perturbation location these solutions provide local estimates that can then be used for the imaging application however even if the storage coefficient remains unknown it is possible to image diffusivity d k s s thus inverting k and s s together estimations of water contents constants would be more complicate in field applications but important impacts on the oscillatory responses can be observed only for large variations in their values according to our analysis in section 3 thus an average guess may be sufficient for an imaging application 6 summary and conclusion this article presents a numerical analysis for the hydraulic interpretation of oscillatory responses measured in an unconfined media at a metric scale and including the effect of the capillary fringe it represents a useful preliminary work for future real cases tomographic applications in unconfined media sandbox or field cases as it permits to point out several comments concerning the characterization of the hydraulic properties k α and n with such data 1 conductivity k is highly correlated to the amplitude of the oscillatory responses compared to the other hydraulic properties thus a good characterization of the conductivity distribution in an unsaturated media can be obtained separately with the amplitudes of the responses alone and independently from the unsaturated properties 2 the van genuchten parameters α and n related to unsaturated flows also affect the responses in the saturated zone they can be assessed in a second step from the amplitude and phase responses that could not be reproduced by the previously reconstructed conductivity 3 in a heterogeneous soil interpreting oscillatory responses in the aforementioned way allows for a coherent reconstruction of the k field that can then be used to guide the van genuchten parameters characterization the α and n values can be characterized only in the unsaturated zone and α appears to better image the heterogeneities than n at this scale 4 the period of oscillation of the signal tends to accentuate rather horizontal flows for low periods and generate more vertical flows effects on the responses for high periods low periods signals are useful to an accurate assessment of the conductivity values in the saturated area however for the characterization of the unsaturated area high periods of oscillations provide more information but may also be subject to more important hysteresis effects nevertheless for the periods considered in this study 5 to 30 min these effects could be neglected these comments may represent interesting advices for real cases applications however other problematics not taken into account in this work might also be considered real cases applications are naturally more complex than the model studied in this work and effect of noise on the measurements also represents a common problematic in such cases a commonly employed and efficient technique that reduce uncertainties in real field applications is hydraulic tomography this technique based on a crossed interpretation of responses to perturbations obtained at several locations and depths should therefore be considered in association with periodic signals for the spatial characterization of unconfined aquifers properties in future field applications addition of other types of data such as geophysical information could also greatly improve the inversion

4569,we present a synthetic hydraulic analysis of the propagation of oscillatory perturbations in a two dimensional saturated zone bounded above by a capillary fringe unsaturated flows are simulated in a physical model using a hysteretic form of richards equation parameterized using the van genuchten water retention curve and the mualem hydraulic conductivity equation for a sand loam and intermediate soil soil type affects periodic responses as a function of their hydrodynamic and van genuchten properties we first analyze the effect of various hydraulic or signal properties on the oscillatory responses simulated at different locations and depths we then test the imaging potential of oscillatory responses recorded in the saturated zone to spatially charaterize homogeneous or heterogeneous soils also considering the effect of period of oscillation we find that a separation of these responses into amplitude phase couples permits to dissociate the characterization of different hydraulic properties periodic amplitudes decay with distance mainly as a function of hydraulic conductivity and phase lags decrease with frequency due to storage in the capillary fringe thus responses amplitude appears to be especially sensitive to conductivity k which allows to isolate this property from the others phases can then be used to better characterize the vertical flows effect through the van genuchten parameters α and n higher periods will tend to accentuate the unsaturated flows effect on the responses and can therefore be adopted for a better characterization of α and n however using low period responses can also be useful as they provide better estimates of conductivity values in media with low heterogeneities we consider this work as a useful preliminary analysis for future sandbox or field real cases applications and provide advices for such applications in the discussion keywords van genuchten periodic signal imaging subsurface tomography vadose zone 1 introduction in hydraulic characterization of unconfined aquifers by pumping tests identifying the impact of the capillary fringe on saturated flows remains a non trivial task indeed the unsaturated zone can contribute substantially to the flows in the saturated zone through vertical fluxes neuman 1972 mishra et al 2012 lin et al 2017 therefore a rigorous interpretation of these tests requires a quantification of these vertical fluxes and a characterization of the hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone in addition a spatial characterization of the hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity of unconfined aquifer including its cover can substantially improve our comprehension of the processes of recharge and contaminant transport in the critical zone this can be performed with a hydraulic tomography approach in which a physical numerical model is used in an inversion process to retrieve the hydraulic properties by fitting hydraulic head measurements usually in such approach these hydraulic heads are measured simultaneously in multiple wells and at multiple depths in response to cross wells perturbations yeh and lee 2007 yeh et al 2013 liu et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 in the literature several hydraulic tomography of unconfined aquifers have already been performed on field or laboratory applications in particular on field cases applications the boise hydrogeophysical research site bhrs has been particularly studied cardiff et al 2009 2012 2013a 2019 cardiff and barrash 2011 rabinovich et al 2015 hochstetler et al 2016 however in these applications the authors considered that the drainage occurring during their tests was instantaneous and did not generate delayed responses effect thus they simulated only the saturated flows in the aquifer in order to characterize the conductivity and specific storage fields it is shown that this approximation is acceptable when a specific yield value is employed for the drainage in the early time pumping cardiff and barrash 2011 cardiff et al 2012 however to apply this method the effective porosity must trigger instantaneous drainage at the beginning of the pumping or the effective porosity must contribute only for a negligible vertical flux compared to the horizontal fluxes generated by pumping cardiff and barrash 2011 mao et al 2013a have presented a theoretical analysis of the application of hydraulic tomography on an unconfined aquifer also taking into account hydraulic properties related to the unsaturated flows pore size distribution parameters and saturated water content this approach has been successfully applied theoretically and experimentally in sandboxes with an analysis of temporal drawdown curves in response to constant rate pumping mao et al 2013b zhao et al 2015 however to date a real field case application following this method has not been presented therefore further recommendations have been provided for adapting such process in real applications in mao et al 2013a and zhao et al 2015 the major concerns in its application remains effect of noise on the data and the necessity to assess a sufficient amount of information on both the saturated flows rather horizontal and the unsaturated flows rather vertical in the dataset oscillatory pumping tests can improve the quality of hydraulic data and thus the characterization of unconfined aquifers including the effect of the marginal capillary zone during the last decades applications of oscillatory excitations in the identification of the hydraulic properties of aquifers have been widely explored both theoretically and experimentally black and kipp 1981 rasmussen et al 2000 2003 renner and messar 2006 fokker et al 2013 fischer et al 2018 2020a 2020b salina et al 2019 cardiff et al 2019 the imaging potential of such data has been studied in cardiff et al 2013b and their advantages in field application have been discussed in bakhos et al 2014 in terms of ability to easily eliminate noises from the measurements and in cardiff and barrash 2014 for configuring the period of oscillation in order to investigate different flowpaths in the aquifer the propagation of oscillatory signals in soils under conditions of variable saturation has been analyzed in several works with numerical data revil et al 2008 shoushtari et al 2015 or laboratory data cartwright et al 2003 2004 cartwright 2014 all these works discuss the effect of hysteresis existing for unsaturated flows and having an impact on the oscillatory responses this hysteresis effect is due to the wetting and dewatering processes of soils that generate loops in the water content curves these scanning loops can be modeled with hydrodynamic dependent unsaturated flows parameters effects of air entrapment during soils wetting can also temporarily affect the saturated water content value kool and parker 1987 several analytical solutions have recently been proposed for the estimation of soils hydraulic property values in unconfined aquifers from oscillatory signal responses dagan and rabinovich 2014 huang et al 2019 cheng and renner 2018 however it is still rare for spatial variability to be taken into account in characterization applications considering both the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic properties furthermore the information brought by oscillatory responses for the spatial characterization of unconfined aquifers still needs to be investigated with this work our aim is to further investigate the effect of oscillatory flows generated at the limit of the saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer in order to propose a preliminary analysis of this type of data for future characterization application in particular hydraulic tomography for this purpose we simulated flows associated to extraction injection oscillations in a synthetic sandbox with a physical numerical model we first present an analysis of the effect of different soil properties on the oscillatory responses then we focus more particularly on the effect of conductivity k and the unsaturated van genuchten parameters α and n and study the possibility to spatially characterize these properties with the information carried in the oscillatory responses finally we discuss our analysis and imaging results in order to provide some advices for future works of hydraulic tomography using this type of data 2 presentation of the model we developed a physics based model of an unconfined soils with variable saturation with comsol multiphysics see fig 1 this model represents a 2 d side views of a synthetic sandbox at a metric scale 3 m wide for 1 m depth we considered the initial water table to be 50 cm below the surface thus initially half of the model is saturated and the other half unsaturated the modeled sandbox is equipped with a pumping injection point hereafter noted s and measurement axes at distances of 20 40 and 60 cm from the pumping axis in which hydraulic pressure responses are simulated at different depths of the saturated zone 60 and 90 cm in order to take into account the capillary fringe effect on the saturated responses we simulated water flows with richards formulation of the continuity equation for a 2d side viewed temporal model 1 c m s e s h t k k r h p z q where t is time s h p is the hydraulic pressure m at a given depth z m k is the hydraulic conductivity m s s is the storage coefficient m 1 related to the soil compressibility s e denotes the effective saturation c m is the specific moisture capacity m 1 k r is the relative permeability and q is the darcy s velocity at the pumping locations m s we consider that no vertical flows occur at the upper boundary of the sandbox during the simulations the other boundaries are impervious implying a finite volume of water in the sandbox no inlet or outlet the flows in the model are then solved within an adaptive size triangular mesh with a finite element method this model simulates in time the hydraulic pressures in the variably saturated soil in response to a sinusoidal oscillating perturbation injecting and extracting successively a same amount of water 2 q q a s i n 2 π pe t where q is the extraction injection flowrate m3 s q a is the oscillating flowrate amplitude m3 s and and pe is the oscillating flowrate period s s e c m and k r are calculated with the van genuchten equations these equations are dependent on the groundwater pressure h p h z i e if the water at a given location x z is at an atmospheric pressure or not 3 s e 1 1 α h p n 1 1 n i f h p 0 s e 1 i f h p 0 4 c m α 1 1

θ r are the saturated and residual water content a hysteretic effect occurs in unsaturated soils inducing a difference in the dewatering and the wetting of the soil in this study a spatial and temporal frequency dependent hysteresis effect is implemented in the model based on the formulation of revil et al 2008 for periodic sources and the observations made in shoushtari et al 2015 that hysteresis effects attenuates with distance to the signal source the hysteresis is generated by computing dynamic values of α and n following the induced periodic movement over space and time 6 α t α mean 1 m h y s t min z p z z h y s t 1 m h y s t sin 2 π t p e where m hyst is the magnitude of the hysteresis effect α mean represents the mean value of α 1 m z p is the pumping depth m and z hyst is the distance of attenuation of the hysteresis effect hereafter 50 cm a similar formulation is also used to compute n t considering a n mean value we briefly present in fig 2 the effects of the simulated hysteresis on the saturation level and the simulated pressures in our model after one cycle of pumping injection the saturation level will not come back to its origin when incorporating a hysteresis effect a part of the mobilized water will remain in the unsaturated zone generating a lowering of the saturation level after several cycles the effect generates a global decrease of the saturated unsaturated interface in the unsaturated zone the shape of the signal becomes deformed by the hysteresis effect especially observable for the period of 30 min wherein it cannot be considered as a sinusoidal form anymore the effect of the period of oscillation is also more important in the unsaturated zone where the oscillatory response tends to vanish faster in terms of amplitude than in the saturated zone when the period of the signal is decreased in the saturated zone the hysteresis effect does not seem to modify the shape of the signal directly thus the pressure responses in the saturated zone contain a sinusoidal part h osc in response to the oscillating signal that can be written 7 h osc h a s i n 2 π pe t h p π 180 where h a is the oscillating response amplitude m and h p is the oscillating response phase lag to the signal source these oscillatory parts can be extracted from the head responses through a fast fourier transform fft directly in terms of timeless amplitudes h a and phases h p we simulated and observed the oscillatory responses in the saturated zone for different types of soils by modifying the property values inputs in the model hereafter in this work we principally compare these responses in sand in loam or an intermediate soil with properties between sand and loam ones the hydraulic property values employed for these two configurations are presented in table 1 and were chosen mainly according to the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda in leij et al 1996 and to previous works in the unconfined aquifers literature for the hydrogeological soil properties we chose constant values also based on what can be usually found in the literature θ r 0 05 θ s 0 40 and s 10 5 m 1 we considered a m hyst 25 magnitude hysteresis effect in the unsaturated zone based on the recommendations in kool and parker 1987 fig 3 presents the differences between our simulated sand and loam soils in terms of unsaturated flows i e effective saturation profiles water content curves and hysteresis effects on the responses in the saturated zone it can be noted that this hysteresis effect shown in fig 2 is more important in sand than in loam 3 comparative analysis of the effect of various soil properties on the oscillatory responses by simulating flows during pumping and injection phases in sand and loam fig 4 we can clearly observe the different types of flows that will be mobilized in these two configurations vertical flows will occur in the unsaturated zone horizontal in depths of the saturated zone and mixed vertical horizontal flows near the saturated unsaturated interface it can also be observed from the arrows sizes proportional to the flow intensity in the unsaturated zone in fig 4 that vertical flows are in proportion more important in sand than in loam we first evaluated how oscillatory responses i e amplitudes phase lags are affected by variations of individual parameters values for the intermediate soil table 1 using a pumping amplitude of q a 1 ml s and period of oscillation p e 15 min in fig 5 we present the variations induced in the amplitude and phases responses at the different locations when modifying the conductivity and anisotropy values of our intermediate soil to values corresponding rather to sand soil ones or rather to loam soil ones the absolute responses presented for the intermediate soil in the middle column of the figure globally show an amplitude decrease and phase increase with the radial distance to the perturbation source point s however the oscillation better propagates in the deep saturated zone below s than near the unsaturated one as amplitudes are higher and phases lower below s even if these simulation points are more distant to the source than the ones above s it clearly appears that the oscillatory responses are affected by the conductivity and its anisotropy especially in terms of amplitudes for a similar perturbation the amplitude responses will be higher in loam than in sand oppositely the phases will become globally lower when applied in loam and higher in sand however in this case the conductivity seems to more particularly affect the phases of responses associated to horizontal flows below s the degree of anisotropy will have a similar but less important effect than conductivities on amplitude responses becoming more important in loam with higher anisotropy the phase responses are especially affected when lowering the anisotropy generating higher phases in sand when moving away from the perturbation source fig 6 presents a similar analysis with the van genuchten parameters α and n associated to the unsaturated flows these parameters also affect the oscillatory responses but in a different manner than conductivity parameter α appears to affect the differences in the responses above and below s in fact its modification will generate more important variations in terms of amplitude above s denoting an effect on the vertical flows impacts it will also affect the phase responses but rather reducing the vertical differences in loam and accentuating it in sand thus again generating responses variations vertically parameter n in contrary generates variations affecting essentially the phases of the responses accentuating them and their vertical differences in loam and lowering them in sand the phase variations remain constant with distance to s this suggests a more local impact at the perturbation point that is then propagated to the other responses as for the previous conductivity analysis the effects on the responses induced by α and n are opposites when tending to one or another sand or loam property value this already suggest that quantitatively analyzing the responses spatially and vertically could allow to assess a soil s saturated and unsaturated hydraulic property values a third similar analysis has been conducted on other parameters not necessarily linked to the two types of soil loam and sand considered in this study this analysis is presented in fig 7 with the effect of the period of oscillation the saturated water content of the soil and the magnitude of hysteresis effect the period of oscillation influences the distance of propagation of the perturbation in the soil a lower period will attenuate more rapidly with distance to s an opposite effect is observed when increasing the period a vertical effect of the period can also be observed the period tends to accentuate the vertical difference observed in the responses above and below s when it is decreased more important horizontal flows and to reduce this difference for higher periods the saturated water content generates a similar effect but with opposite variations in fact a higher saturated content will accentuate the vertical differences in the responses while a lower saturated content will reduce the vertical differences the hysteresis effect occurring in the unsaturated zone does not substantially affects the oscillatory responses in the considered range of periods of oscillation 5 to 30 min except a global low increase of the phase responses that can be observed for a high hysteresis magnitude nevertheless fig 2 shows that this effect affects the mean saturation level over time however when performing a fft analysis on the pressure responses this mean level can be isolated this first comparative analysis shows that the spatial oscillatory responses are differently affected by the different soil properties and signal parameters one advantage of oscillatory responses is that they can be easily dissociated into amplitudes and phases which are also differently affected by each properties therefore this type of responses could be used to assess the values of different soil properties 4 imaging potential of the oscillatory responses in the saturated zone 4 1 inverse problem in order to analyze if and how responses to oscillatory signals may provide information in order to image the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties in an aquifer we have re interpreted generated oscillatory responses in our sand or loam soils models through inversion processes the inverse problem is based on objective functions which quantify the gap between responses simulated through a physical model for given property values and a set of observed responses that one wants to interpret these objective functions also incorporate a priori information on the property values in order to overcome the issue of non unicity of the solution we use our model presented in section 2 to generate oscillatory responses for different values of conductivities k and van genuchten parameters α and n this operation can be mathematically written 8 d f p where d is a m d 1 vector containing the amplitude and phase responses simulated at each measurement location f is the solver of the numerical model and p is a m p 1 vector containing distributed values of k α and n in logarithmic scale using logarithmic values permits avoiding negative values during the optimization process a simultaneous optimization of different properties in the iterative inversion process can lead to a divergence of the process furthermore as shown in previous section the amplitude responses appear to be especially sensitive to conductivity therefore we decided to perform our inversion process sequentially with two different objective functions ψ k and ψ α n that are conceived to successively optimize the hydraulic conductivity k only with the amplitude responses and then the van genuchten parameters α and n by adding the phase responses in the process 9 ψ k d a m p o b s d a m p t r a m p 1 d a m p o b s d a m p p k p r i o r p k t c k 1 p k p r i o r p k 10 ψ α n d o b s d t r 1 d o b s d p α n p r i o r p α n t c α n 1 p α n p r i o r p α n where ψ designates the objective functions for determining k or α and n from the information carried by the amplitude and phase

matrix holding covariances constraining the hydraulic property values and their distribution p k p α n c k and c α n designate the sub vectors and sub matrices associated to k or α and n the inversion process consists in an iterative process aiming to minimize the values of these objectives function successively by updating deterministically the property values in the model via the computation of a jacobian matrix tarantola and valette 1982 11 f i j f i p j δ p f i p j δ p where f i j represents the sensitivity of a data i to modification δ p 10 2 on the property value j during the first

is the jacobian matrix described in eq 11 performing the sensibility analysis between the k values and amplitude responses during the second inversion sequence the update of the van genuchten

described in eq 11 performing the sensibility analysis between the α and n values and amplitude and phase responses at the end of the inversion the standard deviations on the inverted property values can be obtained from the square roots values of the diagonal entries of matrix c post using the last iterations jacobian matrices 14 c post f t r 1 f c 1 1 performing an inversion in this way by isolating the k values in the process we could improve the stability of the inversion and accelerate its convergence to more realistic solutions in fact the results presented hereafter show that the amplitude responses can be closely reproduced by optimizing the k field regardless of the van genuchten parameters the remaining amplitude and phase differences can then be adjusted by optimizing the van genuchten parameters in fact we have also tested inversions simultaneously optimizing k α and n that did not converge in particular it seems that a good assumptions on k is required prior to the optimization of the van genuchten parameters for all inversion applications presented hereafter we did not consider any hysteresis effect on the responses simulated in the inversions even if the observed data were generated with a 25 hysteresis magnitude 4 2 homogeneous cases applications inversions have been performed with oscillatory responses generated in homogeneous loams or sands using property values presented in table 1 for this generation we applied an injection extraction rate aiming to generate similar pressure amplitudes 10 cm at the perturbation point in both type of soil i e q a 1 ml s in loam and q a 10 ml s in sand the generated responses have been noised 2 added noise for the imaging applications the hydraulic properties were optimized within two blocks one superficial block between 0 and 65 cm depth and one deep block between 65 and 100 cm depth thus in our inversions the number of property values to be inverted was m p 6 2 distributed values for each property for a dataset composed of m d 7 amplitude phase responses couples we considered a diagonal covariance matrix for c with a 0 01 variance on each property value we initialized our inversions with the medium soil properties see table 1 so that we would be able to estimate if the information carried by the oscillatory responses would permit to partially or totally recover the loam and sand properties used for their generation the anisotropy of the medium was considered as known figs 8 and 9 present the inversion results obtained with oscillatory responses generated with different oscillation periods 5 and 30 min respectively in loam and in sand accurate conductivity values can be obtained from the amplitude responses alone for both type of soils and any oscillation period a slightly more accurate result is obtained with lower periods thus most of the amplitude responses can be reconstructed by optimizing the conductivities then the remaining responses differences in terms of amplitudes and phases can be essentially linked the unsaturated flows and the van genuchten parameters unsurprisingly these properties were optimized only in the upper blocks of the models associated to the unsaturated zone for α the accuracy of the characterization seems more period dependent better assumptions being systematically obtained with the 30 min periodic responses i e a lower frequency regarding n the accuracy appears to be more related to the soil with better quantifications obtained in sands rather than in loams globally we observe that the oscillatory responses measured in the saturated zone provide sufficient information to distinguish the type of soil type in the medium they can also allow the quantification of accurate properties values associated to the saturated and the unsaturated flows without necessarily having to simulate a hysteresis effect 4 3 simplified applications for heterogeneous cases we have then performed inversions with oscillatory responses simulated in simplistic heterogeneous cases see fig 10 in a wider sandbox 3 6 m width these cases consisted in 3 perturbations points black dots in fig 10 in a medium soil as described in table 1 surrounded by sand or loam areas in the saturated or unsaturated zones the velocity vectors simulated at each observation point white dots in fig 10 show that the generated flows are differently affected in each areas of the model most important velocities are observed in the sand areas both in saturated and unsaturated zones therefore in order to efficiently characterize the whole heterogeneity it is necessary to cross interpret data generated by signal sources located at different locations hydraulic tomography principle thus for the inversions we have simultaneously inverted the responses generated with each of the three perturbation sources these responses have been noised 2 added noise for the imaging applications we considered the anisotropy of the medium and also the properties of the soil at the perturbation locations to be known we have performed two types of inversions in a first inversion we have considered having a certain prior knowledge on the existing contrast in the soil and therefore invert properties within delineated zones in a second inversion we did not consider this knowledge and inverted the properties within a grid regularly distributed in 2d in the saturated zone and in 1d in the unsaturated zone see dotted lines delineations in fig 12 for our zoned inversions the number of property values to be inverted was m p 12 4 zoned values for each property for a dataset composed of m d 45 amplitude phase responses couples 15 responses obtained for each perturbation we considered a diagonal covariance matrix for c with a 0 01 variance on each property value we have tested different combinations of responses generated with lower or higher periods of oscillation 5 15 or 30 min in terms of imaging efficiency and for different heterogeneity configurations 3 4 sand 3 4 loam and half sand half loam the best imaging results obtained are presented in fig 11 here again amplitude responses alone are sufficient to reconstruct the heterogeneous contrast in the conductivity field for each period of oscillation tested the inverted conductivity values however do not always exactly match the true ones it appears that a contrasted soil half sand half loam zones is better characterized with higher periods of oscillation while a less contrasted medium is better characterized with lower periods concerning the van genuchten parameters optimized with the remaining differences in the amplitude and phase responses that could not be reproduced with conductivity alone they are better characterized with the higher period of oscillation in each case as for the homogeneous cases they can be characterized only in the unsaturated zone of the soil and do not image heterogeneities in the saturated zone parameter α appears to be more reliable than n for the interpretation of heterogeneity in the capillary fringe in fact in our results inverted n values are good for the upper left zone but not always for the upper right one while α values are always coherent in both corners for our distributed inversions the number of property values to be inverted was m p 123 41 distributed values for each property we constrained the spatial distribution of the inverted property values with an exponential variogram model with a range of 2 to compute the covariance values in matrix c we inverted the responses generated in the half sand half loam heterogeneous configuration with a period of oscillation of 30 min according to the best result configuration in the zoned inversions the inverted property fields and their associated normalized standard deviations are presented in fig 12 the inverted property values globally do not match the true ones they are mostly underestimated this can be explained by the lack of spatial constraints in this inversion that allows optimization process to generate local equivalent property values for the reproduction of the data especially for k which is optimized first however the trends and localizations of the heterogeneous contrasts can be imaged in both the saturated and unsaturated areas in the conductivity field the conductivity field is mainly sensible to the sand zones in the saturated area according to the distribution of its uncertainties on the other hand again unsurprisingly the van genuchten parameters image only the heterogeneities in the unsaturated area however in this distributed inversion it appears that α rather image the loam areas while n rather image the sand areas the uncertainty analysis shows a globally higher local sensitivity near the perturbation sources for n and a more homogeneous sensitivity among the whole unsaturated area for α 5 discussion 5 1 effects of hydraulic properties on the saturated responses our hydraulic analysis presented in this article tends to indicate that the different hydraulic properties considered k α and n affect differently the measured oscillatory responses in the saturated zone and that their relation to such type of responses is also conditioned to different factors such as the depth of the source or the measurement locations the conductivity k globally appears as the most interesting hydraulic property to be characterized with oscillatory responses in fact it is highly linked to the amplitude of the responses more than the other studied properties and thus can be easily isolated from these other properties when analyzing the responses basing our inversions of k on the amplitudes alone resulted indeed in good characterizations of its distributions in each configuration even without considering accurate van genuchten parameters this observation is in agreement with other works on unconfined media huang et al 2019 analyzed the sensitivity of oscillatory responses in unconfined aquifers through an analytic solution and noted the same high sensibility of the responses to k however this observation does not seem specific to oscillatory data in fact in their hydraulic tomography applications taking account unsaturated flows mao et al 2013b and zhao et al 2015 also observed that the contrasts in conductivity fields could be globally well imaged with responses to constant rates pumping mao et al 2013b even noticed the same fact that saturated flows properties could be well characterized even without accurate guesses on the unsaturated ones concerning the van genuchten parameters there is currently no previous studies taking them into account in a characterization of an unconfined aquifer with oscillatory signals mao et al 2013b and zhao et al 2015 employed the gardner russo s model to simulate the unsaturated flows and found that its parameters could be well characterized only in the unsaturated area in our study we observed that the oscillatory responses in the saturated zone are affected by both α and n with various intensities depending on the period of oscillation the type of soil and the type of flows generated the effect of n appears to be more related to the local response at the perturbation source local fluxes while α generates a more distributed effect on the responses vertical flows affecting the whole capillary fringe the imaging potential of α therefore appears as more reliable at the scale considered in our results metric scale trying to link this hydraulic behavior to geological explanations is a complex topic that is discussed in the literature it is mainly accepted that α is related to the air entry suction of the soil and n to the distribution of the pore size benson et al 2014 observed that for a uniform sand the breadth of the particle size influenced n while α was more linked to a median value of the particle size indicating a more integrative effect porebska et al 2006 noted that n was directly dependent to their soil composition sand clay silt which we also observe in our results while parameter α appeared to be more related to the granulometry of the sample 5 2 advantages of oscillatory signals and period dependent effects separating the responses signals into amplitude and phase allow for a better separation of the information contained in the data absolute amplitudes can be used to specifically characterize the conductivity k and appear to carry already a sufficient amount of information to interpret its variations around the perturbation points which can then be used to guide the characterization of the unsaturated flows parameters this possibility of separating the responses into amplitudes and phases in real cases can be achieved only if the responses reach a simple harmonic motion mainly after several periods the conditions allowing to reach this conditions are described in bakhos et al 2014 and in huang et al 2019 oscillatory signals also offers the possibility to be easily extractable from other sources of signals or noises techniques to efficiently process field oscillatory responses are proposed in bakhos et al 2014 it can also be noted that oscillatory responses generated with wetting dewatering of an unsaturated soil potentially allow to assess mean values of α and n in the water content curves while responses associated to constant pumping would characterize only the van genuchten values associated to the dewatering part of the curve due to the hysteresis scanning loops effect the effect of the period of oscillation on the flows generated in an aquifer has been discussed in previous works rabinovich et al 2015 cardiff et al 2013b fischer et al 2018 2020b globally according to these works decreasing the period of oscillation accentuate flows in the most conductive and mobilizable areas of the field and in the vicinity of the pumping injection location as water in the unsaturated zone represents a less mobilizable source of water than the volume in the saturated area it appears as logical that a lower period of oscillation accentuate the horizontal flows and does not allow for a good characterization of the unsaturated area in their field applications rasmussen et al 2003 observed in fact that with a very low period of oscillation the responses generated in an unconfined aquifer could be assimilated to confined medium responses therefore low periods of oscillations may be employed with care for unconfined aquifers according to several previous works on this topic rasmussen et al 2003 rabinovich et al 2015 cardiff et al 2019 cardiff et al 2019 also suggested that for high frequencies period 1 min the existing models such as the richards based may become inaccurate according to our results if lower periods provided better imaging results for k when the medium was homogeneous or with lowly contrasted heterogeneities a higher period of oscillation should be adopted if one wants to characterize draining effects parameters especially for α n being more related to local responses seems less dependent to the period however when dealing with higher period signals hysteresis effects should be considered with unsaturated flows in our results for periods between 5 and 30 min and at a metric scale we show that we can neglect its effects on the responses only for the responses in the saturated zone experiments made in cartwright 2014 and shoushtari et al 2015 are in agreement with this observation when the period of oscillation remain relatively low however the authors noted that for high periods of oscillations reaching several hours or more the hysteresis effect could become important even on the responses in the saturated zone and should be taken into account 5 3 toward real cases the analysis proposed in this article represents a preliminary work for future real cases tomographic applications it remains theoretical and real cases applications would face other problematics not considered in our models such as the impact of environmental noise on the data however it provides some information and methods that may be helpful for a better setup of oscillatory data interpretation in an unconfined aquifer a first adaptation for a field application would be to consider 3 d flows with boundary conditions often not affecting the perturbed volume therefore we have also simulated flows in a cylindrical homogeneous model with a similar geometry but a constant head boundary condition located far away from the perturbation source point s 50 m away this configuration thus considers volumetric effects and a theoretical infinite volume as water can enter or leave the model through the constant head boundary these consideration are more realistic for a field case we compare the responses simulated in this way in sand and loam to our 2 d model previously discussed in fig 13 in order to generate a signal of similar amplitude at the perturbation source it is necessary to increase its flowrate amplitude 40 times in loam 30 times in sand however the spatial responses simulated in this way will be different from the ones obtained in the 2 d finite volume model the attenuation of amplitude responses and the phase lags increase with distance become more important in the cylindrical infinite volume model in order to generate responses in the cylindrical model that are closer to the 2 d ones it is necessary to also increase the period of oscillation and the signal source depth relatively more in loam than in sand if the adopted cylindrical model remains very simplistic compared to real field it permits to provide insights on what configuration parameters should be especially considered for fields applications i e flowrate amplitude signal source depth and oscillation period and how to adapt to different type of soils 5 4 imaging potential in tomographic applications according to the results presented in this work having measurements and perturbation locations distributed spatially and also at different depths of the aquifer might provide different information on the different hydraulic properties horizontal flows effects might be better characterized by deeper responses or perturbation while the vertical flows effects can be better characterized by perturbation and measurements near the unsaturated zone this accumulation of distributed perturbations and information is furthermore a well known and widely used technique for the characterization of aquifers in hydraulic tomography furthermore we could observe that the localization of the signal source in depth was crucial for the characterization of the unsaturated area it is in fact necessary to generate a movement of the saturated unsaturated interface in order to generate vertical flows mainly with a source close to this interface or at this interface directly such as tide periodic sources mao et al 2013a provided several conditions on the dataset to perform accurate hydraulic tomography of unconfined aquifers in particular they recommend to measure fluxes in addition to pressure data and to couple different type of data in order to better characterize the heterogeneity of the medium ideally the different data should also identify flow processes in the saturated and the unsaturated zone separately yeh et al 2008 coupling geophysical data allowing to image water content variations in the soil and heterogeneity contrasts could greatly improve the imaging results indeed our inversions constrained with zones that can be typically delineated from geophysical interpretations showed better results than the regularly distributed ones in the method and the imaging applications presented in this work we consider prerequisites knowledges on the properties in particular we assume the storage coefficient the anisotropy and the saturated and residual water content of the medium to be known therefore for a real application case using the inversion method proposed in this paper one would need to estimate these values for this purpose cheng and renner 2018 proposed analytical solutions comparing pressures amplitude and phase responses measured above and below an oscillatory source to its flow rate signal allowing to estimate the anisotropy and storage coefficient at the perturbation location these solutions provide local estimates that can then be used for the imaging application however even if the storage coefficient remains unknown it is possible to image diffusivity d k s s thus inverting k and s s together estimations of water contents constants would be more complicate in field applications but important impacts on the oscillatory responses can be observed only for large variations in their values according to our analysis in section 3 thus an average guess may be sufficient for an imaging application 6 summary and conclusion this article presents a numerical analysis for the hydraulic interpretation of oscillatory responses measured in an unconfined media at a metric scale and including the effect of the capillary fringe it represents a useful preliminary work for future real cases tomographic applications in unconfined media sandbox or field cases as it permits to point out several comments concerning the characterization of the hydraulic properties k α and n with such data 1 conductivity k is highly correlated to the amplitude of the oscillatory responses compared to the other hydraulic properties thus a good characterization of the conductivity distribution in an unsaturated media can be obtained separately with the amplitudes of the responses alone and independently from the unsaturated properties 2 the van genuchten parameters α and n related to unsaturated flows also affect the responses in the saturated zone they can be assessed in a second step from the amplitude and phase responses that could not be reproduced by the previously reconstructed conductivity 3 in a heterogeneous soil interpreting oscillatory responses in the aforementioned way allows for a coherent reconstruction of the k field that can then be used to guide the van genuchten parameters characterization the α and n values can be characterized only in the unsaturated zone and α appears to better image the heterogeneities than n at this scale 4 the period of oscillation of the signal tends to accentuate rather horizontal flows for low periods and generate more vertical flows effects on the responses for high periods low periods signals are useful to an accurate assessment of the conductivity values in the saturated area however for the characterization of the unsaturated area high periods of oscillations provide more information but may also be subject to more important hysteresis effects nevertheless for the periods considered in this study 5 to 30 min these effects could be neglected these comments may represent interesting advices for real cases applications however other problematics not taken into account in this work might also be considered real cases applications are naturally more complex than the model studied in this work and effect of noise on the measurements also represents a common problematic in such cases a commonly employed and efficient technique that reduce uncertainties in real field applications is hydraulic tomography this technique based on a crossed interpretation of responses to perturbations obtained at several locations and depths should therefore be considered in association with periodic signals for the spatial characterization of unconfined aquifers properties in future field applications addition of other types of data such as geophysical information could also greatly improve the inversion
