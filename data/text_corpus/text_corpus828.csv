4140,groundwater interacts with porewater within clay rich sequences however the effects of aquitard porewater on groundwater quality are generally poorly understood this study explores potential links between porewater chemistry in a thick clay rich sequence of quaternary sediments and groundwater quality in the north china plain ncp one of china s most important water supply aquifers previous studies have hypothesised the release of salinity fluoride and sulphate from aquitards in response to intensive pumping without explicitly analysing the chemistry of aquitard porewaters this study further investigated this hypothesis through targeted analysis of porewater chemistry profiles through the ncp sedimentary sequence two cores were analysed one in the central plain hengshui hs and the other in the coastal plain cangzhou cz both areas have experienced significant groundwater extraction over recent decades from confined aquifers inter layered with clays aqueous extraction ae and squeezing se methods were both used to assess porewater chemistry the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater are closer to those of the squeezed porewater which can be regarded as more closely corresponding to in situ porewater compositions than ae profiles chloride was generally consistent between the two methods while sulphate and fluoride concentrations were greater using ae ranging from 340 to 48 700 mg l and 8 8 to 144 mg l compared to 350 to 8860 mg l and 0 2 to 4 3 mg l using se respectively the much greater concentrations of fluoride derived from the ae method indicates a high susceptibility to release during changes to the ambient geochemical environment while the primary fluoride sources in groundwater and porewater are likely minerals from weathering of volcanic rocks in the sedimentary sequence release into groundwater appears linked to common geochemical influences such as high na ca ratio increased during cation exchange and the presence of iron and aluminium oxides providing sorption sites the primary source of solutes is interpreted to be different in each profile with evapotranspiration important in the central plain and marine solutes important in the coastal profile indicating significant storage of salinity fluoride and sulphate within low permeability sediments our data supports the hypothesis that release of these ions is driving degradation of groundwater quality in response to decades of intensive groundwater extraction which is an ongoing threat to the quality of groundwater in the ncp keywords clay rich aquitard groundwater aquitard porewater high fluoride north china plain 1 introduction in unconsolidated sedimentary basins clay rich aquitards are more widespread than aquifers by scale and volume hendry and wassenaar 2011 yet their influence on groundwater quality is still generally poorly understood back 1986 clay rich aquitards have begun to receive growing attention due to their natural low permeability which can be useful in long term waste disposal impeding inter aquifer leakage and acting as underground geotechnical liners or protective barriers against pollution yanful et al 1990 rowe et al 1993 hendry et al 2013 harrington et al 2013 groundwater flow and solute transport in aquifers is mainly dominated by advection freeze and cherry 1979 in contrast porewater movement and solute transport in aquitards has been shown to be dominated by molecular diffusion e g desaulniers et al 1981 hendry and wassenaar 1999 2009 hendry et al 2000 mazurek et al 2011 hendry et al 2013 han et al 2020 groundwater a valuable freshwater resource throughout the world sustains the domestic agricultural industrial water demands for human society throughout semi arid and arid areas particularly where surface water is unavailable giordano 2009 groundwater storage depletion due to overexploitation has been revealed in many such regions of the world e g konikow and neuzil 2007 reilly et al 2008 rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 mohamed et al 2016 and ibrahem 2019 including the north china plain ncp cao et al 2013 hu et al 2016 previous studies have focused on hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater pumped from these aquifers however few studies have investigated the chemistry of porewater in clay rich aquitard layers understanding this may be very important in determining the long term impact of intensive groundwater pumping as well as paleo climate change on solute transport processes in multi layered aquifer aquitard systems han et al 2020 1 1 flow and solute transport of porewater in clays the slow movement of aquitard porewater within low permeability sediments which often contains high salinity means that such porewater usually enters adjacent aquifers over long time periods and may not be noticeable due to dilution and more rapid flow of freshwater in the aquifers ultrafiltration by shales and compacted clay minerals may be responsible for the high salinity pore fluids and mineral deposits in aquitards hanshaw and coplen 1973 the passage of sodium chloride relative to water can be restricted by some compacted clay minerals with nacl rich solutions and the scale of the cation exchange capacity of the clay per unit interstitial volume determines the release of the solution ions in clay layer porewater mckelvey and milne 1962 certain variables e g specific clay mineralogy porosity permeability and salinity concentration can affect the salt filtering phenomenon in clayey layers due to high salinity porewater movement under subsurface hydraulic pressure milne et al 1962 batlle aguilar et al 2016 reviewed typical hydraulic conductivity and leakage rates in argillaceous aquitards by comparing hydraulic and chemical methods the typical vertical hydraulic conductivity values in argillaceous aquitards vary in the range of 10 12 10 9m s based on hydraulic methods while the porewater velocity values estimated using chemical methods usually range from 0 01 to 1 mm y and the timescale of porewater movement is varying depending on different tracers examined batlle aguilar et al 2016 although hydraulic and environmental tracer methods can also be used to investigate aquitard porewater and solute transport they may be limited by the complexity of sampling methods the timescales involved and relatively poorly studied fluid solute transport processes in aquitard systems in order to better characterize the clay water environment porewater extraction techniques can be used to obtain natural ion concentrations and isotopic ratios these include centrifugation squeezing extraction se aqueous extraction ae also known as leaching vacuum distillation azeotropic distillation and direct equilibration as summarized by sacchi et al 2001 and mazurek et al 2011 all techniques can extract free water from clays while only some may sample water strongly bound to the clay surfaces sacchi et al 2001 the se and centrifuging methods may decrease the concentration of the extracted solution with increasing pressure centrifuging and ae methods can induce oxidation of solid phases ph change of the solution and dissolution of carbonate minerals ion exchange and salt dissolution may also be induced by the ae method all techniques suffer limitations and will be unable to obtain complete porewater extraction with un altered chemistry wersin et al 2016 this means it is generally favorable to compare results from at least two different extraction methods multiple studies have compared results obtained by different methods for clay rich rock sequences wersin et al 2013 2016 wang et al 2013 mazurek et al 2015 the chloride concentrations of centrifuged porewater present greater fluctuations than porewater extracted by ae but produce similar trends overall wang et al 2013 in spite of the water rock interaction during experiments ae has been used as a relatively reliable approach for obtaining anion concentrations in aquitards e g gaucher et al 2009 mazurek et al 2012 wersin et al 2013 and mazurek et al 2015 conducted various methods to analyze the chloride and sulfate concentration profiles on thick clay rich aquitards they found that if anion exclusion is considered the chloride concentrations show good consistency between ae and se methods however the sulfate concentrations obtained by different methods are inconsistent this might be related to the dissolution of sulfur rich minerals e g gypsum wersin et al 2013 or the inevitable oxidation reactions experienced during the sampling or experiments de craen et al 2004 1 2 aquitards and groundwater depletion in the north china plain the north china plain ncp has been the subject of concerns over groundwater depletion and a series of related environmental issues e g land subsidence seawater intrusion ground collapse ground fissure groundwater pollution etc these issues have arisen due to long term groundwater over exploitation predominantly from the deep freshwater bearing confined aquifers of the plain cao et al 2013 the ncp is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world covering an area of approximately 150 000 km2 60 of which is underlain by brackish or saline groundwater total dissolved solids tds 2 g l chen et al 2005 currently groundwater provides 70 of the total water supply mainly for sustaining agricultural irrigation cao et al 2013 previous studies based on hydraulic dynamics and environmental tracers from aquifers have focused on groundwater storage change cao et al 2014 regional groundwater flow paths zhang et al 1997 chen et al 2005 cao et al 2016 hydrogeological parameters groundwater age dating and the palaeohydrological processes chen et al 2003 matsumoto et al 2018 and sustainability of groundwater resources chen et al 2005 cao et al 2013 only two locations have previously been investigated to examine the controls on aquitard porewater geochemistry and related paleo environment focusing on boreholes near the coast at tianjin li et al 2013 2014 2017 and cangzhou kwong et al 2015 however few studies have focused on the potential migration of shallow saline groundwater and or associated contaminants such as fluoride into deep aquifers in areas where aquitards which may contain high salinity porewater are interbedded with sand in the central and coastal area of the ncp the groundwater from the deep confined aquifer was previously characterized by artesian flow with upward gradients 60 years ago while at present it is characterized by downward flow gradients following long term intensive groundwater withdrawals cao et al 2013 it has been reported that the release of aquitard porewater may be responsible for elevated fluoride concentrations in groundwater observed in parts of the ncp based on comparison of land subsidence rates associated with aquitard compaction and changes in f concentrations in groundwater over time su et al 2018 migration and or release of saline aquitard porewater containing fluoride and other contaminants under the influence of intensive extraction may pose a groundwater quality threat and a major challenge for the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in the future this study examines a comparative analysis of clay rich aquitard porewater from two representative boreholes at hengshui and cangzhou located in the ncp s central and coastal plain respectively the main objectives were to i investigate and compare the hydrochemical compositions of aquitard porewater obtained by aqueous extraction and squeezing methods at two boreholes ii reveal the controls on dissolved fluoride and sulphate in aquitard porewater to further constrain the porewater origin and to understand potential water rock interactions and iii delineate the relationship between porewater and groundwater for the environmental implications associated with the potential migration of high salinity porewater into the adjacent aquifers high fluoride groundwater and groundwater salinization have been ongoing groundwater quality problems in the ncp threatening the sustainable usage of water from the aquifer system many previous studies have paid attention to groundwater hydrochemistry for the aquifers of the north china plain however the hydrochemical characteristics of aquitard porewater and their relationship with the aquifer groundwater has been poorly understood by examining the porewater hydrochemical profiles and correlating these with groundwater hydochemical data and other lines of evidence mineralogical composition location of marine transgression regression events we provide new insights into the origin and distribution of fluoride in aquitard porewater and aquifer groundwater similarly the comparison of aquitard porewater using two different techniques aqueous leaching vs squeezing helps to further understand the key processes involved in release of pore water and solutes to groundwater 2 site description the north china plain ncp located in northeastern china is a thick cenozoic sedimentary basin topographic elevation varies from approximately 100 m above sea level m a s l in the western piedmont to 1 2 m a s l in the east near bohai bay fig 1 the plain is in a semi arid region with a continental monsoon climate mean annual temperature is 12 c and average annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 600 mm with mean annual potential evaporation from 1100 to 1800 mm chen et al 2005 the ncp can be geographically divided into three major zones piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain fig 1 the main rivers include the yellow river the haihe river the luanhe river and the grand canal along with their tributaries most rivers flow only during the rainy season indicating disconnection with the underlying water table the quaternary sediments ranging in thickness between 150 and 600 m are composed of four main aquifer units fig 2 separated by aquitards chen 1999 from west to east the sediments become finer and permeability gradually decreases while the thickness of low permeability layers increases and groundwater quality gradually becomes more saline aquifer i is an unconfined aquifer with a thickness of approximately 60 m this generally consists of coarse sand in the piedmont and fine sand in the coastal plain aquifer ii with a thickness of approximately 60 m is a shallow unconfined unit in the piedmont and becomes confined in the central and coastal plain the strata are mainly composed of gravel and medium fine sand aquifer i and ii contain saline groundwater with tds concentrations 2 g l in most of the central and coastal plain aquifer iii is a confined aquifer with a thickness of 90 m and depth ranging from 170 to 350 m this unit is mainly composed of sandy gravel in the piedmont and medium to fine sand in the central and coastal plain it contains fresh groundwater with tds concentrations of 0 3 0 5 g l chen et al 2003 aquifer iv is a deep confined aquifer with a thickness of 50 60 m located 350 m below ground surface consisting of cemented sandy gravel and sand layers of approximately 20 40 m thickness groundwater in this unit has tds concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 g l in the central plain and 1 5 to 2 g l in the coastal plain aquifers iii and iv are the main targets of groundwater exploitation in the ncp this study considers the effect caused by the exploitation of groundwater and hydrochemical compositions of porewater in the upper low permeability layer s between unconfined and confined aquifers and related fluid solute migration and its controlling factors other studies have examined the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the major aquifers and its main controlling factors e g chen et al 2005 the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquitard s within the top 170 m of the system is thought to range between 10 5 10 6 m d and 10 6 10 8 for the deeper aquitard s below 170 m depth guo et al 2014 based on the conceptual hydrogeological cross section from shijiazhuang hengshui to cangzhou towards the coastline proposed by zhang et al 1997 and modified by cao et al 2016 two representative boreholes hs and cz were drilled at hengshui located in the jizhong depression belonging to the drainage discharge zone of the piedmont plain in august 2013 and cangzhou in the jixian uplift coastal plain in may 2012 the depths of the boreholes are 130 m and 450 m respectively they are characterized by clay silty clay silt and sand for the hs borehole the clay rich aquitard layers were interbedded with sand layers which mainly occur at the intervals 23 32 m aquifer i 69 90 m aquifer ii and 125 m aquifer iii respectively fig 3 for the cz borehole the clay rich aquitard was thicker and more continuous with sand layers observed at depth intervals of 109 4 117 6 m aquifer ii 261 8 274 9 m aquifer iii 314 0 320 6 m aquifer iii and 326 9 333 7 m aquifer iii data from the hs borehole were based on experimental work conducted in this study while data from the cz borehole is based on results reported in a previous study kwong et al 2013 from 1975 to 2000 in the hengshui area the average groundwater level of deep aquifers changed from approximately 12 m below ground level m b g l in 1975 to 46 m b g l in 2000 and the decline was far greater than that in the shallow aquifer fig s1 groundwater level monitoring results fig s2 show a constant trend in the unconfined aquifer containing relatively saline water not utilized for irrigation and a steady declining trend with seasonal fluctuation in the confined aquifers due to intensive pumping for agricultural irrigation the wells with a depth range of 170 350 m show great variation in groundwater levels reaching 80 m below the ground surface level at shen county in 2014 the groundwater quality in the hengshui area has been characterized as a fresh saline fresh profile with the bottom boundary of the saline fresh interface ranging from 50 m to 70 m b g l in the 1960 s due to groundwater over exploitation the shallow saline groundwater has been migrating downwards into the deeper aquifer and the position of the interface has varied between 60 and 80 m b g l the saline fresh groundwater interface in the hengshui borehole in this study was located at approximately 65 m depth from the ground surface by the end of 2015 cumulative land subsidence in hengshui city had reached 1 6 m with a subsidence rate range of 30 50 mm a cgs 2017 groundwater level decline in the cone of depression associated with groundwater over extraction at cangzhou is one of the most serious land subsidence areas of china water levels dropped from 50 m b g l in 1975 to 107 m b g l in 2003 with a decline of 60 m within the past three decades su et al 2018 the area has experienced cumulative land subsidence of 2 7 m during 1975 2015 with a subsiding rate of 30 mm a cgs 2017 with the highest rate of 118 6 mm a occurring in the late 1990 s the highest fluoride concentration of deep groundwater was observed to be 8 8 mg l with an average value of 2 3 mg l while in shallow groundwater it reached 6 0 mg l with a mean value of 2 0 mg l song et al 2016 deep groundwater exploitation has been banned in the center of cangzhou city since 2006 this slowed the land subsidence rate however subsidence has been spreading into the surrounding area since the late pleistocene the eastern north china plain has experienced three major transgression events fig 1 including the cangdong intrusion the xianxian intrusion and the cangxi intrusion with the time periods of 5 0 3 5 ka 8 5 5 5 ka and 20 40 ka respectively yang et al 1979 yang and chen 1985 for the canghzou borehole in this study the depth of the fresh saline groundwater interfaces associated with marine transgressions are at depths of 60 65 m b g l and 100 m b g l respectively in addition volcanic rocks are locally present in the lithological profile at cangzhou and to the east in the cangxian uplift area the buried depth of volcanic rocks is 320 370 m and in huanghua depression the buried depth is approximately 300 420 m quaternary volcanic activities in north china mainly occurred between the late and middle pleistocene 0 8 0 1 ma b p chen et al 2001 the main volcanic rocks in this area are basalt and tuff the maximum thickness of basalt is 20 m with a typical thickness of 2 8 m and the maximum thickness of tuff is 30 m with a general thickness of 1 6 m near the cz borehole the thickness of tuff rock is 17 m shao et al 1983 3 sampling and analytical procedures core samples from the two boreholes were collected for analysis of a suite of physical chemical and isotopic characteristics at varying depth and spatial resolution at the hs borehole samples for major ion and stable isotopes analysis were taken at approximately 1 m intervals yielding 110 samples a total of 78 core samples were collected at an average interval of 7 m within the cz borehole for major ions and stable isotopes analysis reported elsewhere in han et al 2020 at the hs borehole the outer core 2mm of samples was shaved off and discarded in situ to avoid potential fluid contamination occurring during the drilling process the shaved core samples of 30 cm length were packaged in tinfoil and then wax sealed in a cutting ring of appropriate size for core samples 20 cm in length samples were cut and vacuum sealed in foodsaver bags all samples were stored below 4 c until analysis 15 samples at average spacing of 8 m were vacuum wrapped in foodsaver bags for x ray diffraction xrd analysis of mineralogy gravimetric water contents of each core sample were obtained using oven drying 100 g 0 01 g of core sample was oven dried in a crucible at 105 110 c for 24 hrs and then cooled in desiccators to avoid re absorption of water from the atmosphere the gravimetric water was calculated by w a t e r w e t s o i l w e i g h t d r y s o i l w e i g h t d r y s o i l w e i g h t 100 aqueous leaching 1 5 extraction on air dry sample using the method outlined by sacchi et al 2001 was applied to extract porewater from the core samples to analyze major ions 100 g 0 01 g of air dried crushed core sample was put into clean and dry glass jars with water tight lids and 500 ml of deionized water was added the samples were loaded in an end over end mixer and left to mix over 24 48 hrs after mixing samples were left stationary and clarified with the clear liquid in the upper part of the jar filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and the remaining mixture centrifuged and filtered again the extracted water samples were stored in clean labelled plastic bottles below 4 c until analysis they were then analysed using ion chromatography ic for concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 f no3 in the chemical laboratory of flinders university australia based on the analysis of periodic replicates taken throughout the analysis program the precision for the analysed ions was 2 5 major ion concentrations obtained by the 1 5 dilution method were then converted into porewater concentrations according to the method outlined in priestley et al 2017 selected trace elements in the extracted water samples were also measured by icp ms with precision of approximately 5 after every ten samples analysis of a known standard was conducted to allow assessment and correction for any instrumental drift porewater major ion data were also determine using the mechanical squeezing method se for the hs borehole the method used followed that reported in liu et al 2015 and niu et al 2016 for the cz borehole major hydrochemical compositions were measured using ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics 1100 as reported in kwong et al 2015 with the qa qc steps reported therein instrumental analytical errors were reported to range from 0 9 to 8 8 while charge balance errors ranged from 0 3 8 7 with only 13 of the groundwater samples having cbe 5 xrd analyses were conducted in december 2013 for determining the sediment mineral compositions of 15 core samples using a panalytical x pert pro mpd 40 kv 40 ma cu kɑ radiation 2θ range 5 70 c in the analytical laboratory of the beijing research institute of uranium geology near the hs borehole 12 representative groundwater samples were collected from production wells with depths ranging between 45 and 156 m in august 2013 the well locations can be seen in fig s3c the wells were purged for at least half an hour and groundwater sampled after constant values of electrical conductivity ec had been established physico chemical parameters ph ec and temperature were measured in situ using a portable hq40d meter hach at each well alkalinity was determined by titration with hcl 0 22 n on filtered samples in the field the hydrochemical results including major cations and trace elements were measured by icp aes icap6300 thermo and icp ms 7500c agilent respectively concentrations of cl no3 and so4 2 were determined using ion chromatography ics2000 dionex 10 of the water samples were analysed for repeat measurement and the error was found to be within 5 in all cases charge balance errors for the hs groundwater ranged from 0 6 7 5 with most below 5 approximately 20 of groundwater samples had a charge balance error above 5 i e between 5 and 7 5 which is attributed to minor errors introduced during the dilution process to further characterize the groundwater hydrochemistry 63 groundwater samples collected from 20 to 527 m depth wells in the hengshui area fig s3b reported by liu et al 2015 with detailed methods and qa qc procedures reported therein in the cangzhou area we compiled the published results for 37 groundwater samples from different depths ranging from 5 to 700 m wells including 19 shallow water samples and 18 deep water samples fig s4 from chen et al 2003 2005 and xu 2009 charge balance errors in all analyses for groundwater samples are 9 detailed sampling and analysis methods can be found therein groundwater hydrochemical data for the two areas are synthesized in tables s1 and s2 4 results 4 1 characterization of aquitard aquifer sediments the sediments encountered in the hengshui area in the central plain of the ncp are characterized by clay rich facies with interbedded sand layers and lenses while the cangzhou area in the coastal plain has continuous clay rich aquitard layers which locally exceed 100 m thickness fig 3 the gravimetric water contents gwc along the hs core profile varied from 12 5 to 36 4 fig 3a the gwc showed a slight decreasing trend with increasing depth ranging from 15 7 to 32 9 average 23 0 in the shallow sequence 40 m depth 15 3 to 36 4 mean 21 5 for 40 70 m depth and 12 5 to 26 5 mean 19 3 for the deeper part 80 m depth for the cz borehole the gwc ranged from 4 5 to 19 2 fig 3b and the bulk density from 1 9 2 3 g cm3 the gwc fluctuated but again decreased with increasing depth the gwc above 160 m depth varied from 19 2 to 8 7 average 15 while it ranged between 7 0 and 18 2 average 11 3 between 160 300 m and 4 5 to 15 9 average 9 5 below 300 m depth likely reflecting a greater level of sediment compaction with depth the proportion of the mineralogical compositions of 15 core samples collected from hs borehole are shown in fig s5 the main minerals include quartz clay minerals feldspars carbonates and hornblende the hornblende contents decrease within the clay rich layers the clay minerals ranging from 3 2 to 37 8 of total mineralogy are anti correlated with the sum of carbonate minerals mainly calcite and dolomite the proportion of clay minerals at hs varies greatly and does not change regularly with depth in the sequence clay minerals 2 µm mainly include smectite and illite in total accounting for 66 83 followed by chlorite and kaolinite fig s6 4 2 aquitard porewater chemistry 4 2 1 aqueous extraction summary statistics min max median from aqueous leaching analysis for 110 samples from the hs borehole are shown in table 1 depth tds profiles are shown in fig 3 while the profiles for various major ions are shown in figs 4 and 5 tds concentrations in hs porewater varied between 1 14 and 71 02 g l with an average of 11 2 g l and the peak occurring at approximately 20 m it is hypothesized the peak represents the depth where evaporating groundwater discharge from the ncp piedmont flow system is preserved in porewater cao et al 2016 han et al 2020 porewaters in the aquitard are generally classified as sodium sulfate chloride type waters consistent with having experienced salinization by evapo concentration major ion concentration profiles yield very similar patterns between different ions measured in the hs borehole with most ions peaking at around 20 m depth the major exception is nitrate which shows a general decrease with depth consistent with an anthropogenic source at the surface e g han et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the concentrations vary between 0 7 and 200 mg l in the top 25 m decreasing to a narrower range of 1 1 8 0 mg l at depths below 90 m the hydrochemical compositions of all waters are dominated by na and so4 2 followed by ca2 and cl fluoride concentrations vary within a wide range 8 8 143 9 mg l mean 40 5 mg l with the peak at around 20 m depth in general the concentrations were highest within clay and silty clay rich sediment above the major sand layer at 65 90 m depth decreasing below this depth fig 5 the profiles of sulphate and chloride in porewater and groundwater are similar with a more pronounced bulge in porewater concentrations between approximately 5 and 50 m depth fig 5 compared with the proportion of clays in the core fig s7 the ions are more concentrated in the clay rich sediments in the top layer within 65 m of the surface this pattern is also broadly consistent with the observed fluoride sulphate chloride and nitrate concentrations in groundwater which are elevated in wells between 20 and 70 m fig 5d trace elements such as b sr v fe as zn and mn were also measured for the porewater extracted by the ae method table 1 the b fe mn zn and sr depth profiles fig 6 also show obvious peaks at the depth of 20 m and become relatively constant below a depth of 80 m arsenic concentrations of porewater on the contrary showed low values within this depth range and increased with depth the v contents in porewater also increase with depth but become more constant below the 100 m depth correspondence between as and v concentrations in groundwater within similar sedimentary material has previously been noted in associated with geogenic sources of these elements controlled by the sorption desorption of oxy anion forming elements scanlon et al 2009 4 3 squeezing extraction method 4 3 1 hs borehole porewater was also extracted from 51 of the core samples using the squeezing method see section 3 which yielded significantly lower tds concentrations from 0 8 to 16 0 g l average 6 0 g l and lower concentrations of certain porewater major ions table 1 fig 4 the major ion depth profiles obtained by the two methods figs 4 and 5 show that the peak concentration of most ions is consistent appearing around 20 m with similar curve shaped advection diffusion profiles for most major ions however there is significant offset in the concentrations of certain elements e g sodium potassium fluoride and sulphate most ions exhibit a high level of variability with depth in the upper layer e g top 20 m and become relatively constant with increasing depth this is more pronounced in the ae method results than the se method the cl concentrations show relatively good consistency between the two extraction methods e g in comparison to so4 2 f and major cation concentrations agreeing with the comparative findings from wersin et al 2013 in the upper layer within 25 m depth so4 2 concentrations obtained by the ae method are significantly higher than the se method similar to previous studies of porewater in thick argillaceous rock wersin et al 2016 with the increase of depth the difference of so4 2 concentration obtained by the two methods becomes less obvious the pattern of ca concentrations with depth is different between the two methods with a significant concentration bulge observed in the ae samples not seen in the se method analysis it has previously been shown that concentrations of cations in porewater are affected by cation exchange and mineral dissolution precipitation reactions during preparation of samples using the ae method wersin et al 2016 the concentrations of potassium fig 4d and fluoride fig 5c obtained by ae method are consistently significantly higher than the se method up to two orders of magnitude higher 4 3 2 cz borehole major ion depth profiles of porewater hydrochemical compositions for 66 core samples from the cz borehole using squeezing only are shown in fig 5 and table 1 the tds concentrations ranged from 0 4 to 14 3 g l average 2 5 g l with highest values in the top 100 m the major ion depth profiles fig 7 showed obvious peaks for k na ca2 so4 2 cl and other major ions within the depth range 40 80 m the main cation is dominated by na and the main anion is dominated by cl and so4 2 these concentrations peaked at approximately 78 m before decreasing to minimum values at approximately 135 m then maintaining constant concentrations below this depth the cl concentrations and depth profile closely resemble so4 2 while mg2 and ca2 also show close resemblance notably the fluoride and nitrate concentrations showed different concentration vs depth patterns to most major ions suggesting a decoupling of behavior relative to most other hydrochemical constituents the reasons i e cause of fluoride enrichment relative to other ions is discussed further below in section 5 1 and 5 3 no3 exhibits wide scatter at all depths and a slight increase with depth ranging between 1 4 and 121 5 mg l mean 28 0 mg l fluoride concentrations show a gradual increase with depth down to 150 m followed by relatively constant concentrations to 450 m comparing the cz profiles with the hs profile squeezing results the contents of most ions in the cz porewater are higher than the hs porewater with the exception of k no3 and f fig s8 this likely reflects a higher proportion of marine derived solutes in porewater in the coastal plain 4 4 groundwater chemistry statistical analyses for hydrochemical data from groundwater at two areas are shown in figs 8 and 9 the tds concentrations range from 1 7 to 11 4 g l mean 6 0 g l in the hs shallow groundwater 20 70 m well depth n 15 and from 0 5 to 4 6 g l mean 0 9 g l in hs deep groundwater 125 527 m well depth n 60 in the cz groundwater tds ranges from 0 3 to 11 5 g l mean 2 5 g l in shallow groundwater 5 30 m well depth n 19 and 0 5 to 2 8 g l mean 1 2 g l in deep groundwater 300 700 m well depth n 18 respectively major anions are dominated by so4 2 and cl in the hengshui region comprising 14 63 and 27 68 of total anions in shallow groundwater respectively while cl is dominant in cangzhou groundwater which is also characterized by a dominance of na among cations fluoride concentrations range from 0 4 to 3 3 mg l mean 1 6 mg l for hs shallow groundwater and from 0 3 to 2 7 mg l mean 0 8 mg l for hs deep groundwater while these range from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l mean 0 5 mg l for cz shallow groundwater and 1 1 to 6 2 mg l mean 3 5 mg l for cz deep groundwater respectively as illustrated by fig 9 the shallow groundwater in the hengshui area is characterized by na mg cl so4 or na mg so4 cl type water while na cl so4 or na hco3 so4 cl type for the deep groundwater in the cangzhou area the shallow groundwater is mainly featured by na mg so4 cl or na mg so4 cl type and the deep groundwater by na cl type the coastal saline groundwater especially in the deep aquifers is considered to be slow moving nearly stagnant xu 2009 the f concentrations of deep groundwater in cangzhou area is significantly higher than in shallow groundwater 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between two porewater extraction methods hs borehole the hydrochemical compositions obtained by the ae and se methods display comparable trends with depth at the hs borehole and in most cases comparable ranges of concentration values however noticeably higher concentrations of tds and certain ions e g sulphate fluoride potassium calcium were obtained using the ae method using the se method ion concentrations are assumed to reflect only the composition of free porewater whereas porewater extracted by ae method includes both free porewater and interlayer strongly bound water and may be affected by dissolution of soluble salts this has previously been shown to lead to higher ionic concentrations than squeezing results e g sacchi et al 2001 possible reasons may include the effect of pressure change oxygen intrusion leading to redox condition and ph change and temperature induced modification of water rock interactions brightman et al 1985 reeder et al 1992 mazurek et al 2015 wersin et al 2016 the data from the hs borehole is consistent with a greater degree of water rock reaction occurring during the ae method compared to se with ions known to be commonly impacted by ion exchange oxidation and precipitation dissolution reactions e g na k ca so4 most notably different in the two profiles fluoride mobility is also known to be highly redox and ph sensitive in similar environments and mobilization typically occurs in conjunction with cation exchange between na and ca e g currell et al 2011 in contrast more conservative ions such as chloride exhibit relatively consistent profiles between the two methods fig 5a sporadically higher cl contents in the squeezed samples around 100 m depth may be due to samples for the two methods being collected from depths slightly offset from one another or increasing salinity of the squeezed porewater sacchi et al 2001 the pattern indicates dissolution of halite is not a major influence as this would be expected to significantly increase cl concentrations in the ae results sulphate is the predominant major anion in the hs profile as illustrated in fig 5b there is an apparent mismatch between so4 2 concentrations from ae compared to that from se in the depth range of 5 20 m with the ae derived so4 2 concentrations up to 5 5 times greater and only slightly higher concentrations for the ae method in the depth range 20 130 m this may be attributed to dissolution of sulphate bearing evaporite phases e g gypsum glauber salt or celestite or pyrite and or organic matter oxidation during the ae process reduction in so4 2 concentration during squeezing tests may take place due to advective displacement by microbial sulphate reduction wersin et al 2013 the presence of gypsum was observed but not pyrite in the samples collected from the hs borehole this and the fact that the offset mostly occurs in the shallow part of the sediment profile where evaporite minerals are hypothesized to have accumulated in discharging groundwater suggests the additional sulphate in the ae profile derives from gypsum dissolution consistent with under saturation observed in the groundwater sampled in the nearby wells fig s9 long term consumption of drinking water from groundwater sources with excessive fluoride can lead to serious fluorosis as observed in many countries farooqi et al 2007 edmunds and smedley 2013 ali et al 2016 rashid et al 2018 high fluoride groundwater in aquifers has been extensively researched however few studies have focused on fluoride in aquitard porewater as a potential source in groundwater at the hengshui borehole the highest fluoride concentration of the aquitard porewater obtained by the ae method is 33 times greater than that obtained by the se method several geochemical processes may be responsible for the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater including release through water rock interaction dissolution and or desorption geothermal or volcanic activity gaciri and davies 1993 smedley et al 2002 coetsiers et al 2008 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the fluoride concentration in groundwater also depends on the surrounding ph and temperature saxena and ahmed 2003 valenzuela vasquez et al 2006 although it is difficult to obtain the ph value of the in situ porewater the ph values of the groundwater in the hengshui area are mainly distributed between 7 2 and 8 8 fig s10 with an average value of 8 0 it can be speculated that the porewater exists in an alkaline environment which favors fluoride enrichment through competitive sorption by hco3 currell et al 2011 higher fluoride contents of aquitard porewater obtained by the ae can be explained by a high proportion of fluoride being released through either water rock interaction triggered by the aqueous extraction method e g de sorption and or dissolution and or greater concentrations of f within the fluid strongly bound to clay minerals released using the method but not during squeezing a recent survey of elevated fluoride in global groundwater shows that igneous rocks are the dominant source followed by sedimentary rocks including those derived from igneous parent materials chowdhury et al 2019 occurrence of volcaniclastic rock mainly tuff and basalt has been reported in the stratum of the early pleistocene in the ncp at the hengshui area shao et al 1983 these rocks contain f bearing minerals such as amphibole including hornblende biotite apatite and fluorite shao et al 1983 tian 1984 ni and chen 1985 which are potential potential primary mineral sources of f dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 the hs borehole does not directly intersect these volcanic strata and it is therefore more likely that f is associated with the sedimentary material derived from the weathering of these underlying and nearby volcanic rocks during the quaternary period it is likely f originally contained in the above mineral phases is enriched within the clay rich horizons of these sediments due to the presence of a relatively high density of sorption sites comparing xrd results fig s5 with the fluoride profile of hs fig 5c doesn t reveal any correlation between high fluoride porewater concentrations and any particular mineral component e g higher hornblende content suggesting secondary sorption mediated release of f from clays as a major source of input into surrounding groundwater as suggested by currell et al 2011 na concentrations obtained by ae are also significantly greater than those obtained by se reaching a maximum difference of 4500 mg l at a depth of approximately 20 m this may similarly like so4 relate to evaporite dissolution e g mirabilite and other na so4 based phases and or weakly bound exchangeable sodium liberated during the ae experiment the ca2 concentration derived from the ae method showed enrichment and a very wide range of variation in the upper layer within 25 m depth consistent with the hypothesized gypsum dissolution and a similarly constant trend in the lower layer similar to the se method profile mg2 concentration profiles exhibited more limited difference between the two extraction methods noticeable difference in k concentrations were observed suggesting k is also associated with weakly bound ions liberated during the leaching process due to the potential concurrent cation exchange and mineral dissolution reactions and changing solid liquid ratio during the ae tests the cation composition in the porewater cannot be directly obtained by ae the cation exchange capacity cec is predominantly controlled by the structural negative charge of the smectite and illite wersin et al 2016 the apparent mismatch in cation compositions of porewater at shallow depths may thus be related to the high fraction of smectite and illite within the upper 40 m of the profile see fig s6 5 2 relationship between porewater and groundwater chemistry in the hs profile the porewaters are more saline than aquifer groundwaters in the upper layer although the concentrations of major ions in the groundwater show a similar pattern with values close to or slightly less than porewater concentrations obtained by both methods it may be expected that the relatively inter bedded nature of the sediments results in a high degree of mixing and less clear separation of composition between aquifer and aquitard layers resulting in a greater degree of mixing than is seen at the cz profile however there is significant variability in compositions with depth that broadly mirror the porewater chemistry trends as discussed above there is differentiation in the groundwater chemistry above and below the major aquitard layer e g for chloride sulphate and nitrate particularly however some elevated concentrations are observed in deep wells possibly due to some localized mixing across the aquitard the hydrochemical characteristics of aquifer groundwater are closer to those of the squeezed porewater indicating the squeezing data can be more closely regarded as in situ porewater that readily mixes with and contributes to groundwater in the aquifer wersin et al 2016 it is also noticeable that no3 concentrations are relatively high in groundwater at depths of 40 80 m indicating that the hydrodynamic conditions and groundwater chemistry of shallow groundwater above the main clay layer are actively influenced by human activity below 100 m depth nitrate concentrations in porewater and groundwater decline although they are still locally considerable indicating some degree of bypass flow han et al 2016 currell and han 2017 in the cangzhou area shallow and deep groundwater chemistry show more distinctive separation figs 7 and 9 the tds contents of the shallow groundwater from well depths 30 m ranged between 0 3 and 11 5 g l mean 2 5 g l n 19 compared to 0 5 2 8 g l mean 1 2 g l n 18 for wells between 236 and 450 m depth as illustrated in fig 3b the salinity range in porewater and groundwater are close to each other in the shallow layer however the deep groundwater in the confined aquifers is significantly fresher than the porewater in the deep aquitard generally there is a pattern of saltwater overlying fresher water within the cangzhou aquifer aquitard system likely reflecting the history of marine transgression regression within the ncp coastal plain discussed further in 5 3 compared with the hydrochemical compositions of squeezed porewater major ions of the shallow groundwater at cz are more variable in composition this suggests that the hydrochemistry of shallow groundwater is more susceptible to surface environmental influences such as rainfall recharge and irrigation infiltration than porewater the concentrations of na ca2 k and so4 2 in the deep groundwater 200 m are close to those in the squeezed porewater indicating that the free porewater is connected to the surrounding aquifer in general the major ions profiles in the squeezed porewater are in good agreement with nearby groundwater samples particularly in the deep samples indicating that these reflect the in situ porewater compositions only the f contents in groundwater are less than or close to aquitard porewater from both shallow and deep aquifer aquitard systems indicating a potential for enrichment if the store of f is released e g through water rock interaction there were wide variations in the no3 concentration 1 4 to 121 5 mg l in aquitard porewater however the no3 concentration of the deep groundwater 300 m depth 0 3 1 0 mg l is far less than the porewater presumably due to the presence of the relatively thick clay rich aquitard layers 5 3 controls on porewater hydrochemical depth patterns at two profiles 5 3 1 difference in the history of solute emplacement and movement central vs coastal plains although the curve shapes of the major ion depth profiles of the hs and cz boreholes show similarities the peak depths and maximum concentrations of ions are quite different this may be related to the sedimentary environment depositional history groundwater flow regime and climate change experienced over time in the two localities the central plain hs and coastal plain cz of the ncp notably the coastal plain has been impacted by inundation by seawater throughout glacial interglacial cycles in the quaternary whereas the hengshui region has not been covered by seawater in the quaternary fig 1 cl br mass ratios of groundwater at hengshui range from 1077 6 to 1614 3 which is significantly greater than the ratio 292 for seawater indicating likely dissolution of halite δ34s values of dissolved sulphate have a range of 17 9 18 9 v cdt in the groundwater at hengshui which is below the δ34sso4 value 21 rees et al 1978 for marine origin in addition strontium isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr with a range of 0 71196 0 71280 are much higher than seawater 0 709073 0 000003 denison et al 1994 all these data are consistent with the fact that the hengshui area was not affected by palaeo marine transgression for the cangzhou area the δ34sso4 value of groundwater mainly from aquifers iii and iv has a range of 15 9 22 9 li et al 2011 with a widely range of cl br mass ratio 138 1 4836 4 chen et al 2005 indicating mixing between groundwater and relict seawater may be partially responsible for groundwater salinization fig 10 shows that the relatively higher cl porewater at cz has cl br ratios closer to normal seawater ratio precluding halite dissolution fig 11 presents the relationship between cl br ratios and cl concentrations for groundwater samples collected from piedmont central and coastal plains at the hs borehole dissolution of halite may be mainly responsible for the high cl br ratios at hs consistent with evaporative concentration of solutes rather than a marine source as described in section 2 hengshui is located at the front margin break of slope of the alluvial and diluvial fan of the ncp central plain area this been characterized as being affected by inland salinization zhang et al 1987 the groundwater recharged in the piedmont meets the multilayered structure interbedded with less permeable aquitard layers triggering upward discharge intercepted by evapotranspiration resulting in solute and evaporite mineral accumulation cao et al 2016 han et al 2020 due to high evapotranspiration rates considerable concentration of solutes likely occurred in this zone supported by the mapping of saline lakes and other surface water bodies in the area han et al 2020 it is suspected this was particularly important during the warming period of the holocene in the eastern ncp yang et al 1979 the different palaeo environment at the two borehole sites in the central and coastal plain respectively can thus help to explain certain features of the hydrochemical profiles such as a relatively important role for evaporite mineral dissolution gypsum sodium sulphate salts and minor halite in the hs borehole compared to the cz borehole and a greater role of the aquitard in limiting mixing and propagation of solutes down the profile in the cz borehole consistent with a greater degree of diffusion controlled solute transport modelling by han et al 2020 explored the relative role of advective and diffusive transport and showed that the solute profiles in the coastal plain aquitards are likely never reached equilibrium with respect to the seawater boundary during the cycle of marine transgression regression in the quaternary based on the diffusion model of aquitard porewater mazurek et al 2009 since cl and br are conservative tracers and they have the similar diffusion properties pearson et al 2011 the residual seawater may retain the ratio during the diffusion process in clay rich aquitards compared with the plots for the hengshui area figs s11 and s12 the molar ratios of porewater and groundwater at the cangzhou area are close to these in normal seawater 650 for br cl and 0 05 for so4 cl respectively showing the marine contribution to the water salinity relatively low so4 cl ratios for the cz porewater also indicate that the sulfate reduction likely occurred in the clay rich aquitard this is consistent with the potential reductive environment for so4 2 in the deep groundwater from the coastal deposits zhang et al 1997 li et al 2011 5 3 2 fluoride enrichment mechanism s research into deteriorating groundwater quality in the eastern ncp has examined drivers of high salinity and high fluoride concentrations e g jia et al 2018 however little attention has been paid to the aquitard porewater chemistry at hs high fluoride porewater is mainly distributed within the top 60 m relatively high fluoride concentrations at very shallow depths at hs may partly be explained by evaporation near the ground surface and groundwater discharge in low lying areas in accordance with the solute concentration mechanism outlined above in 5 3 1 however given the observed cl concentrations which would behave conservatively during such evaporation the level of enrichment in f requires additional water rock interaction processes previous reviews of high fluoride groundwater in china have shown geogenic sources and water rock interactions to be important wen et al 2013 jia et al 2018 the elevated fluoride concentrations in aquitard porewater may originate from the weathering and dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals as discussed above in 5 1 which have a likely volcanic origin variations of hornblende with depth fig s13 indicate that abundance of volcanic minerals may be controlled by weathering under the alternately warm and cold climate periods of the quaternary ni and chen 1985 with increasing depth f contents of the squeezed porewater are positively correlated with na ca2 and mg2 especially below 20 m fig s14 with a more obvious positive correlation between na and f lower ca2 contents in this fluoride enriched water may result from ion exchange between ca2 and na2 on clays fluoride bearing groundwater are typically of nahco3 type and have low ca concentrations with neutral alkaline ph values 7 9 edmunds and smedley 2013 as illustrated by fig s15 both in cangzhou and hengshui high fluoride groundwater has ph values within this range leading to lower ca2 30 mg l and higher na 400 mg l for deep groundwater likely due to cation exchange this is also supported by higher na ca ratios in the high fluoride groundwater in both areas with positive correlation between f concentrations and na ca ratios table s3 a similar correlation in groundwater between f and increasing na ca ratios has been noted in many studies as fluorite solubility equilibrium limits the addition of f into the aqueous phase where ca is more concentrated e g appelo and postma 2005 the fluoride contents in the sediments at hs borehole range from 14 to 1690 mg kg with an average value of 780 mg kg liu et al 2015 and have an obvious positive relationship with al2o3 and fe2o3 wu 2015 this is consistent with f desorption from these phases under the influence of high ph and low ca content in groundwater currell et al 2011 moreover fluoride concentrations in the ae porewater below 20 m depth are positively correlated with various other elements at the hs borehole withρvalues of 0 80 for mo 0 80 for b 0 75 for cr 0 37 for ni 0 02 for fe 0 53 for mn and 0 29 for zn table s4 suggesting these may undergo similar release through desorption under changing ambient geochemical conditions during the analysis fluoride concentration in normal seawater is 1 3 mg l however it is currently as high as 6 2 mg l in the deep groundwater from aquifer iii at the cangzhou area as illustrated in fig s16 the deposits in aquifer iii contains the high contents of apatite and amphibole f bearing minerals which corresponds with higher fluoride in the groundwater of this aquifer the third aquifer group of deep groundwater is the main water source exploited in cangzhou with a depth range of 150 350 m and a ph range of 8 8 5 conducive to the enrichment of fluoride tian 1994 apart from the geological source of f during the deposition process since quaternary the alternation of cold and warm paleoclimate also greatly affected the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater the arid and semi arid climate in the middle pleistocene may have resulted in the enrichment of high fluoride groundwater in aquifer iii relative to the other aquifers in porewater fluoride reaches a concentration 9 8 mg l in the squeezed aquitard porewater at 135 m depth of the cz borehole significantly higher than normal seawater or the ambient groundwater this indicates that apart from marine transgression evapotranspiration and water rock interaction are significant factors the fluoride content in groundwater may be enriched with increasing residence time nordstrom and jenne 1977 nordstrom et al 1989 wang and cheng 2001 smedley et al 2002 edmunds and smedley 2005 and a longer porewater residence expected within the clay rich aquitard layer in the cz profile may explain the relatively higher f concentrations in aquitard porewater compared to groundwater particularly in the deeper parts of the profile 5 3 3 influence of the intensive pumping on hydrochemistry of aquitard porewater aquifer groundwater system konikow and neuzil 2007 estimated groundwater depletion from representative confining layers for different aquifer systems and found that nearly all the irreversible depletion of groundwater due to abstraction from aquifers is contributed by loss from confining layers i e aquitards land subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation will change the hydraulic properties of aquifer aquitard systems irreversibly ding et al 2012 cao et al 2013 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 lead to the loss of groundwater storage capacity smith et al 2017 gong et al 2018 herrera garcía et al 2021 and affect the groundwater quality erban et al 2013 few studies have examined long term water quality implications of such depletion e g through the release of solutes from clays into adjacent aquifers in response to groundwater depletion the main pumping layer of deep groundwater at cangzhou area is aquifer iii which provides approximately 90 of the total groundwater extracted ren 1991 compared with the piedmont alluvial diluvial plain deposits such as those at hengshui the deposits at 150 350 m depth range in cangzhou area are characterized by low permeability with a thickness of 179 m for the accumulated clay rich layer this creates a large risk of land subsidence and potential large store of porewater that could be released into the aquifers in response to pumping zhu et al 2014 estimated long term depletion from the confining units of the aquifer system in cangzhou implying that 57 6 of the withdrawals could be derived from depletion in confining units declining groundwater level can result in the compaction of confining units and the elastic compression of sand layers meanwhile the decrease of hydraulic pressure can enhance the porewater released from the aquitard su et al 2018 documented increasing concentrations of fluoride in groundwater within the ncp which they attributed to the release of f from clays during compaction in response to high rates of groundwater extraction the fluoride contents in the squeezed aquitard porewater are close to or slightly above that of aquifer groundwater at hengshui and cangzhou area however the ae results show significant potential for enrichment of fluoride under conditions of changing ambient geochemistry which may be analogous to changes occurring when this water is released from the aquitards into the aquifers in response to compaction further detailed geochemical studies would be recommended to examine the precise sequence of reactions involved within the aquitard aquifer system to better constrain this process 5 4 environmental implications and significance based on the revised conceptual model of groundwater flow system in the ncp cao et al 2016 groundwater flow in the hengshui region is supplied laterally from mountain front recharge subjected to evaporation during flow and upward discharge and mixing with downward recharge in the surface layer resulting due to artificially increased water input from irrigation return flow the coastal plain area is a relatively stagnant flow system with lower advective velocity influenced by compaction caused by land subsidence large scale exploitation of deep groundwater over the past half century has led to the continuous decline of groundwater levels compared with the artesian state of deep aquifers before the 1960 s in the coastal area the downward vertical hydraulic gradient in the aquifers has gradually increased which promotes vertical groundwater leakage from shallow to deep aquifers the deep groundwater exploited mainly derives from lateral recharge and leakage from elastic release of sand layers and compaction of clay rich aquitards the latter two have been estimated to account for 88 2 of the total yield zhang 1991 tian 1994 the average renewal rate is about 3 a for the shallow aquifer 150 m and 0 12 a for the deep confined aquifers from 1990 to 2000 chen et al 2009 indicating that large scale groundwater exploitation is capturing effectively unrenewable groundwater the average depth of deep groundwater level before 1969 at hengshui area was close to the land surface with locally artesian flow while the average depth at the center of the deep groundwater level depression reached 30 1 m in 1984 ming 1986 82 5 m in 2001 and 110 8 m in 2019 water resources bulletin of hebei province due to shallow saline water not having been exploited the average depth of shallow groundwater was retained in the range of 0 5 m thus the downward vertical hydraulic gradients have also greatly increased abandoned wells can provide a short cut flow path for the downward migration of the shallow saline water in these areas currell and han 2017 the geophysical log data show that the annual average downward movement rate of the fresh saltwater interface in hengshui area is 0 4 m a with elevated groundwater salinity observed in deep aquifers song et al 2007 indicating the exploitation of fresh groundwater has modified the distribution of shallow saline groundwater the exploitation and utilization of shallower brackish water resources reducing the head difference between deep and shallow aquifers may be one strategy for helping slow the downward movement of fresh saltwater interface into the deeper fresh aquifer layers the compaction caused by groundwater over exploitation leads to land subsidence along with the water release from the clay rich aquitard this process also modifies the hydrochemical characteristics of aquifers as discussed above fluoride is abundant in porewater and is released under specific geochemical conditions ph and na ca ratio resulting in increasing fluoride contents in the groundwater long term utilization of deep f bearing groundwater for irrigation may also lead to the accumulation of fluoride in soil profiles and plant species under the influence of et increase the fluoride content in shallow groundwater and even reduce agricultural productivity at cangzhou lei et al 2007 there are 1 02 million people living in the hengshui area and 4 5 million people in cangzhou drinking water with high fluoride contents creating a chronic public health burden lei et al 2007 yang 2010 in hengshui nearly 370 000 fluorosis patients are now receiving water from the central south north water diversion accounting for 36 1 of the total number of fluorosis patients yang 2010 inter basin water diversion has also alleviated water shortage and associated consequences caused by groundwater exploitation in semi arid areas such as the ncp contributing to groundwater level recovery already observed in the ncp during 2015 2019 long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however in terms of land subsidence current research indicates most aquifers experience only a small amount of reversible deformation especially when subsidence has occurred over a long period of time wanamaker 2020 therefore the impact of land subsidence whether on changing permeability or modifying groundwater quality may be effectively permanent artificial recharge has been applied to control land subsidence and achieved positive effects in many areas lebbe et al 1995 portugal et al 2006 hellauer et al 2018 although this is an indirect effect e g limiting depletion rates within aquifers to control aquitard compaction and cannot be applied to aquitard layers which have experienced irreversible subsidence aquitards have important influences on the hydrochemical characteristics of aquifers back 1986 water and salt movement are controlled by advection and diffusion batlle aguilar et al 2016 although the groundwater hydraulic gradient has been downward for some decades no due to the intense exploitation porewater profiles at hs and cz indicate that solute profiles have not reached a new equilibrium state under the current hydraulic gradient even in the relatively more permeable hengshui sediments a desalination effect in the top shallow layer is evident with low fluoride contents due to the warm and wet climate since the holocene and the recent infiltration of rainfall and irrigation return flow deep groundwater chemistry is conducive to fluoride enrichment to reduce the deep exploitation of groundwater and or artificially recharge deep groundwater development of brackish or saline water desalination technology could be considered which may reduce the hydraulic pressure difference between the shallow and deep aquifers and prevent further release of pore water from aquitards enriching fluoride and other elements in the adjacent groundwater another urgent priority is the effective plugging and abandonment of legacy wells to preventing the downward intrusion of shallow groundwater with high salinity and nitrate concentrations into deep aquifers 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the hydrochemical characteristics of aquitard porewater and aquifer groundwater at hengshui and cangzhou located in the central and coastal plain of the ncp respectively the major ion concentrations of aquitard porewater yielded similar shaped depth profiles with their peak concentrations observed between 20 and 80 m comparing the hydrochemical compositions of aquitard porewater obtained by aqueous extraction ae and squeezing extraction se it was found that cl contents showed good consistency however less conservative ions such as so4 2 and major cations were higher in porewater obtained by ae likely associated with the dissolution of sulfate rich evaporite minerals e g gypsum and cation exchange during the extraction the fluoride concentrations of aquitard porewater obtained by the ae method were up to 33 times greater than those obtained by the se method indicating the great sensitivity of fluoride to changes in the geochemical environment this gives clues to the possible reasons for long term enrichment of fluoride in groundwater from the ncp suggesting that geochemical changes associated with the release of aquitard porewater in response to intensive groundwater extraction may be contributing significantly to increasing groundwater fluoride concentrations the major ion profiles in squeezed porewater at the two boreholes showed good agreement with nearby groundwater samples indicating the in situ relationship between the free porewater and groundwater the downward hydraulic gradients caused by the intensive exploitation at hengshui and cangzhou areas have not yet changed the significantly observed diffusion dominated hydrochemical profiles of aquitard porewater indicating that these are still far from equilibrium with respect to the current hydrological regime we conclude that holistic analyses of groundwater quality require sampling not just of wells within the major permeable aquifer material but also profiling of porewater chemistry throughout an aquifer aquitard system we also propose recommendations for improving the adverse long term implications of high fluoride groundwater

4140,groundwater interacts with porewater within clay rich sequences however the effects of aquitard porewater on groundwater quality are generally poorly understood this study explores potential links between porewater chemistry in a thick clay rich sequence of quaternary sediments and groundwater quality in the north china plain ncp one of china s most important water supply aquifers previous studies have hypothesised the release of salinity fluoride and sulphate from aquitards in response to intensive pumping without explicitly analysing the chemistry of aquitard porewaters this study further investigated this hypothesis through targeted analysis of porewater chemistry profiles through the ncp sedimentary sequence two cores were analysed one in the central plain hengshui hs and the other in the coastal plain cangzhou cz both areas have experienced significant groundwater extraction over recent decades from confined aquifers inter layered with clays aqueous extraction ae and squeezing se methods were both used to assess porewater chemistry the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater are closer to those of the squeezed porewater which can be regarded as more closely corresponding to in situ porewater compositions than ae profiles chloride was generally consistent between the two methods while sulphate and fluoride concentrations were greater using ae ranging from 340 to 48 700 mg l and 8 8 to 144 mg l compared to 350 to 8860 mg l and 0 2 to 4 3 mg l using se respectively the much greater concentrations of fluoride derived from the ae method indicates a high susceptibility to release during changes to the ambient geochemical environment while the primary fluoride sources in groundwater and porewater are likely minerals from weathering of volcanic rocks in the sedimentary sequence release into groundwater appears linked to common geochemical influences such as high na ca ratio increased during cation exchange and the presence of iron and aluminium oxides providing sorption sites the primary source of solutes is interpreted to be different in each profile with evapotranspiration important in the central plain and marine solutes important in the coastal profile indicating significant storage of salinity fluoride and sulphate within low permeability sediments our data supports the hypothesis that release of these ions is driving degradation of groundwater quality in response to decades of intensive groundwater extraction which is an ongoing threat to the quality of groundwater in the ncp keywords clay rich aquitard

responsible for the high salinity pore fluids and mineral deposits in aquitards hanshaw and coplen 1973 the passage of sodium chloride relative to water can be restricted by some compacted clay minerals with nacl rich solutions and the scale of the cation exchange capacity of the clay per unit interstitial volume determines the release of the solution ions in clay layer porewater mckelvey and milne 1962 certain variables e g specific clay mineralogy porosity permeability and salinity concentration can affect the salt filtering phenomenon in clayey layers due to high salinity porewater movement under subsurface hydraulic pressure milne et al 1962 batlle aguilar et al 2016 reviewed typical hydraulic conductivity and leakage rates in argillaceous aquitards by comparing hydraulic and chemical methods the typical vertical hydraulic conductivity values in argillaceous aquitards vary in the range of 10 12 10 9m s based on hydraulic methods while the porewater velocity values estimated using chemical methods usually range from 0 01 to 1 mm y and the timescale of porewater movement is varying depending on different tracers examined batlle aguilar et al 2016 although hydraulic and environmental tracer methods can also be used to investigate aquitard porewater and solute transport they may be limited by the complexity of sampling methods the timescales involved and relatively poorly studied fluid solute transport processes in aquitard systems in order to better characterize the clay water environment porewater extraction techniques can be used to obtain natural ion concentrations and isotopic ratios these include centrifugation squeezing extraction se aqueous extraction ae also known as leaching vacuum distillation azeotropic distillation and direct equilibration as summarized by sacchi et al 2001 and mazurek et al 2011 all techniques can extract free water from clays while only some may sample water strongly bound to the clay surfaces sacchi et al 2001 the se and centrifuging methods may decrease the concentration of the extracted solution with increasing pressure centrifuging and ae methods can induce oxidation of solid phases ph change of the solution and dissolution of carbonate minerals ion exchange and salt dissolution may also be induced by the ae method all techniques suffer limitations and will be unable to obtain complete porewater extraction with un altered chemistry wersin et al 2016 this means it is generally favorable to compare results from at least two different extraction methods multiple studies have compared results obtained by different methods for clay rich rock sequences wersin et al 2013 2016 wang et al 2013 mazurek et al 2015 the chloride concentrations of centrifuged porewater present greater fluctuations than porewater extracted by ae but produce similar trends overall wang et al 2013 in spite of the water rock interaction during experiments ae has been used as a relatively reliable approach for obtaining anion concentrations in aquitards e g gaucher et al 2009 mazurek et al 2012 wersin et al 2013 and mazurek et al 2015 conducted various methods to analyze the chloride and sulfate concentration profiles on thick clay rich aquitards they found that if anion exclusion is considered the chloride concentrations show good consistency between ae and se methods however the sulfate concentrations obtained by different methods are inconsistent this might be related to the dissolution of sulfur rich minerals e g gypsum wersin et al 2013 or the inevitable oxidation reactions experienced during the sampling or experiments de craen et al 2004 1 2 aquitards and groundwater depletion in the north china plain the north china plain ncp has been the subject of concerns over groundwater depletion and a series of related environmental issues e g land subsidence seawater intrusion ground collapse ground fissure groundwater pollution etc these issues have arisen due to long term groundwater over exploitation predominantly from the deep freshwater bearing confined aquifers of the plain cao et al 2013 the ncp is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world covering an area of approximately 150 000 km2 60 of which is underlain by brackish or saline groundwater total dissolved solids tds 2 g l chen et al 2005 currently groundwater provides 70 of the total water supply mainly for sustaining agricultural irrigation cao et al 2013 previous studies based on hydraulic dynamics and environmental tracers from aquifers have focused on groundwater storage change cao et al 2014 regional groundwater flow paths zhang et al 1997 chen et al 2005 cao et al 2016 hydrogeological parameters groundwater age dating and the palaeohydrological processes chen et al 2003 matsumoto et al 2018 and sustainability of groundwater resources chen et al 2005 cao et al 2013 only two locations have previously been investigated to examine the controls on aquitard porewater geochemistry and related paleo environment focusing on boreholes near the coast at tianjin li et al 2013 2014 2017 and cangzhou kwong et al 2015 however few studies have focused on the potential migration of shallow saline groundwater and or associated contaminants such as fluoride into deep aquifers in areas where aquitards which may contain high salinity porewater are interbedded with sand in the central and coastal area of the ncp the groundwater from the deep confined aquifer was previously characterized by artesian flow with upward gradients 60 years ago while at present it is characterized by downward flow gradients following long term intensive groundwater withdrawals cao et al 2013 it has been reported that the release of aquitard porewater may be responsible for elevated fluoride concentrations in groundwater observed in parts of the ncp based on comparison of land subsidence rates associated with aquitard compaction and changes in f concentrations in groundwater over time su et al 2018 migration and or release of saline aquitard porewater containing fluoride and other contaminants under the influence of intensive extraction may pose a groundwater quality threat and a major challenge for the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in the future this study examines a comparative analysis of clay rich aquitard porewater from two representative boreholes at hengshui and cangzhou located in the ncp s central and coastal plain respectively the main objectives were to i investigate and compare the hydrochemical compositions of aquitard porewater obtained by aqueous extraction and squeezing methods at two boreholes ii reveal the controls on dissolved fluoride and sulphate in aquitard porewater to further constrain the porewater origin and to understand potential water rock interactions and iii delineate the relationship between porewater and groundwater for the environmental implications associated with the potential migration of high salinity porewater into the adjacent aquifers high fluoride groundwater and groundwater salinization have been ongoing groundwater quality problems in the ncp threatening the sustainable usage of water from the aquifer system many previous studies have paid attention to groundwater hydrochemistry for the aquifers of the north china plain however the hydrochemical characteristics of aquitard porewater and their relationship with the aquifer groundwater has been poorly understood by examining the porewater hydrochemical profiles and correlating these with groundwater hydochemical data and other lines of evidence mineralogical composition location of marine transgression regression events we provide new insights into the origin and distribution of fluoride in aquitard porewater and aquifer groundwater similarly the comparison of aquitard porewater using two different techniques aqueous leaching vs squeezing helps to further understand the key processes involved in release of pore water and solutes to groundwater 2 site description the north china plain ncp located in northeastern china is a thick cenozoic sedimentary basin topographic elevation varies from approximately 100 m above sea level m a s l in the western piedmont to 1 2 m a s l in the east near bohai bay fig 1 the plain is in a semi arid region with a continental monsoon climate mean annual temperature is 12 c and average annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 600 mm with mean annual potential evaporation from 1100 to 1800 mm chen et al 2005 the ncp can be geographically divided into three major zones piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain fig 1 the main rivers include the yellow river the haihe river the luanhe river and the grand canal along with their tributaries most rivers flow only during the rainy season indicating disconnection with the underlying water table the quaternary sediments ranging in thickness between 150 and 600 m are composed of four main aquifer units fig 2 separated by aquitards chen 1999 from west to east the sediments become finer and permeability gradually decreases while the thickness of low permeability layers increases and groundwater quality gradually becomes more saline aquifer i is an unconfined aquifer with a thickness of approximately 60 m this generally consists of coarse sand in the piedmont and fine sand in the coastal plain aquifer ii with a thickness of approximately 60 m is a shallow unconfined unit in the piedmont and becomes confined in the central and coastal plain the strata are mainly composed of gravel and medium fine sand aquifer i and ii contain saline groundwater with tds concentrations 2 g l in most of the central and coastal plain aquifer iii is a confined aquifer with a thickness of 90 m and depth ranging from 170 to 350 m this unit is mainly composed of sandy gravel in the piedmont and medium to fine sand in the central and coastal plain it contains fresh groundwater with tds concentrations of 0 3 0 5 g l chen et al 2003 aquifer iv is a deep confined aquifer with a thickness of 50 60 m located 350 m below ground surface consisting of cemented sandy gravel and sand layers of approximately 20 40 m thickness groundwater in this unit has tds concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 g l in the central plain and 1 5 to 2 g l in the coastal plain aquifers iii and iv are the main targets of groundwater exploitation in the ncp this study considers the effect caused by the exploitation of groundwater and hydrochemical compositions of porewater in the upper low permeability layer s between unconfined and confined aquifers and related fluid solute migration and its controlling factors other studies have examined the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the major aquifers and its main controlling factors e g chen et al 2005 the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquitard s within the top 170 m of the system is thought to range between 10 5 10 6 m d and 10 6 10 8 for the deeper aquitard s below 170 m depth guo et al 2014 based on the conceptual hydrogeological cross section from shijiazhuang hengshui to cangzhou towards the coastline proposed by zhang et al 1997 and modified by cao et al 2016 two representative boreholes hs and cz were drilled at hengshui located in the jizhong depression belonging to the drainage discharge zone of the piedmont plain in august 2013 and cangzhou in the jixian uplift coastal plain in may 2012 the depths of the boreholes are 130 m and 450 m respectively they are characterized by clay silty clay silt and sand for the hs borehole the clay rich aquitard layers were interbedded with sand layers which mainly occur at the intervals 23 32 m aquifer i 69 90 m aquifer ii and 125 m aquifer iii respectively fig 3 for the cz borehole the clay rich aquitard was thicker and more continuous with sand layers observed at depth intervals of 109 4 117 6 m aquifer ii 261 8 274 9 m aquifer iii 314 0 320 6 m aquifer iii and 326 9 333 7 m aquifer iii data from the hs borehole were based on experimental work conducted in this study while data from the cz borehole is based on results reported in a previous study kwong et al 2013 from 1975 to 2000 in the hengshui area the average groundwater level of deep aquifers changed from approximately 12 m below ground level m b g l in 1975 to 46 m b g l in 2000 and the decline was far greater than that in the shallow aquifer fig s1 groundwater level monitoring results fig s2 show a constant trend in the unconfined aquifer containing relatively saline water not utilized for irrigation and a steady declining trend with seasonal fluctuation in the confined aquifers due to intensive pumping for agricultural irrigation the wells with a depth range of 170 350 m show great variation in groundwater levels reaching 80 m below the ground surface level at shen county in 2014 the groundwater quality in the hengshui area has been characterized as a fresh saline fresh profile with the bottom boundary of the saline fresh interface ranging from 50 m to 70 m b g l in the 1960 s due to groundwater over exploitation the shallow saline groundwater has been migrating downwards into the deeper aquifer and the position of the interface has varied between 60 and 80 m b g l the saline fresh groundwater interface in the hengshui borehole in this study was located at approximately 65 m depth from the ground surface by the end of 2015 cumulative land subsidence in hengshui city had reached 1 6 m with a subsidence rate range of 30 50 mm a cgs 2017 groundwater level decline in the cone of depression associated with groundwater over extraction at cangzhou is one of the most serious land subsidence areas of china water levels dropped from 50 m b g l in 1975 to 107 m b g l in 2003 with a decline of 60 m within the past three decades su et al 2018 the area has experienced cumulative land subsidence of 2 7 m during 1975 2015 with a subsiding rate of 30 mm a cgs 2017 with the highest rate of 118 6 mm a occurring in the late 1990 s the highest fluoride concentration of deep groundwater was observed to be 8 8 mg l with an average value of 2 3 mg l while in shallow groundwater it reached 6 0 mg l with a mean value of 2 0 mg l song et al 2016 deep groundwater exploitation has been banned in the center of cangzhou city since 2006 this slowed the land subsidence rate however subsidence has been spreading into the surrounding area since the late pleistocene the eastern north china plain has experienced three major transgression events fig 1 including the cangdong intrusion the xianxian intrusion and the cangxi intrusion with the time periods of 5 0 3 5 ka 8 5 5 5 ka and 20 40 ka respectively yang et al 1979 yang and chen 1985 for the canghzou borehole in this study the depth of the fresh saline groundwater interfaces associated with marine transgressions are at depths of 60 65 m b g l and 100 m b g l respectively in addition volcanic rocks are locally present in the lithological profile at cangzhou and to the east in the cangxian uplift area the buried depth of volcanic rocks is 320 370 m and in huanghua depression the buried depth is approximately 300 420 m quaternary volcanic activities in north china mainly occurred between the late and middle pleistocene 0 8 0 1 ma b p chen et al 2001 the main volcanic rocks in this area are basalt and tuff the maximum thickness of basalt is 20 m with a typical thickness of 2 8 m and the maximum thickness of tuff is 30 m with a general thickness of 1 6 m near the cz borehole the thickness of tuff rock is 17 m shao et al 1983 3 sampling and analytical procedures core samples from the two boreholes were collected for analysis of a suite of physical chemical and isotopic characteristics at varying depth and spatial resolution at the hs borehole samples for major ion and stable isotopes analysis were taken at approximately 1 m intervals yielding 110 samples a total of 78 core samples were collected at an average interval of 7 m within the cz borehole for major ions and stable isotopes analysis reported elsewhere in han et al 2020 at the hs borehole the outer core 2mm of samples was shaved off and discarded in situ to avoid potential fluid contamination occurring during the drilling process the shaved core samples of 30 cm length were packaged in tinfoil and then wax sealed in a cutting ring of appropriate size for core samples 20 cm in length samples were cut and vacuum sealed in foodsaver bags all samples were stored below 4 c until analysis 15 samples at average spacing of 8 m were vacuum wrapped in foodsaver bags for x ray diffraction xrd analysis of mineralogy gravimetric water contents of each core sample were obtained using oven drying 100 g 0 01 g of core sample was oven dried in a crucible at 105 110 c for 24 hrs and then cooled in desiccators to avoid re absorption of water from the atmosphere the gravimetric water was calculated by w a t e r w e t s o i l w e i g h t d r y s o i l w e i g h t d r y s o i l w e i g h t 100 aqueous leaching 1 5 extraction on air dry sample using the method outlined by sacchi et al 2001 was applied to extract porewater from the core samples to analyze major ions 100 g 0 01 g of air dried crushed core sample was put into clean and dry glass jars with water tight lids and 500 ml of deionized water was added the samples were loaded in an end over end mixer and left to mix over 24 48 hrs after mixing samples were left stationary and clarified with the clear liquid in the upper part of the jar filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and the remaining mixture centrifuged and filtered again the extracted water samples were stored in clean labelled plastic bottles below 4 c until analysis they were then analysed using ion chromatography ic for concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 f no3 in the chemical laboratory of flinders university australia based on the analysis of periodic replicates taken throughout the analysis program the precision for the analysed ions was 2 5 major ion concentrations obtained by the 1 5 dilution method were then converted into porewater concentrations according to the method outlined in priestley et al 2017 selected trace elements in the extracted water samples were also measured by icp ms with precision of approximately 5 after every ten samples analysis of a known standard was conducted to allow assessment and correction for any instrumental drift porewater major ion data were also determine using the mechanical squeezing method se for the hs borehole the method used followed that reported in liu et al 2015 and niu et al 2016 for the cz borehole major hydrochemical compositions were measured using ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics 1100 as reported in kwong et al 2015 with the qa qc steps reported therein instrumental analytical errors were reported to range from 0 9 to 8 8 while charge balance errors ranged from 0 3 8 7 with only 13 of the groundwater samples having cbe 5 xrd analyses were conducted in december 2013 for determining the sediment mineral compositions of 15 core samples using a panalytical x pert pro mpd 40 kv 40 ma cu kɑ radiation 2θ range 5 70 c in the analytical laboratory of the beijing research institute of uranium geology near the hs borehole 12 representative groundwater samples were collected from production wells with depths ranging between 45 and 156 m in august 2013 the well locations can be seen in fig s3c the wells were purged for at least half an hour and groundwater sampled after constant values of electrical conductivity ec had been established physico chemical parameters ph ec and temperature were measured in situ using a portable hq40d meter hach at each well alkalinity was determined by titration with hcl 0 22 n on filtered samples in the field the hydrochemical results including major cations and trace elements were measured by icp aes icap6300 thermo and icp ms 7500c agilent respectively concentrations of cl no3 and so4 2 were determined using ion chromatography ics2000 dionex 10 of the water samples were analysed for repeat measurement and the error was found to be within 5 in all cases charge balance errors for the hs groundwater ranged from 0 6 7 5 with most below 5 approximately 20 of groundwater samples had a charge balance error above 5 i e between 5 and 7 5 which is attributed to minor errors introduced during the dilution process to further characterize the groundwater hydrochemistry 63 groundwater samples collected from 20 to 527 m depth wells in the hengshui area fig s3b reported by liu et al 2015 with detailed methods and qa qc procedures reported therein in the cangzhou area we compiled the published results for 37 groundwater samples from different depths ranging from 5 to 700 m wells including 19 shallow water samples and 18 deep water samples fig s4 from chen et al 2003 2005 and xu 2009 charge balance errors in all analyses for groundwater samples are 9 detailed sampling and analysis methods can be found therein groundwater hydrochemical data for the two areas are synthesized in tables s1 and s2 4 results 4 1 characterization of aquitard aquifer sediments the sediments encountered in the hengshui area in the central plain of the ncp are characterized by clay rich facies with interbedded sand layers and lenses while the cangzhou area in the coastal plain has continuous clay rich aquitard layers which locally exceed 100 m thickness fig 3 the gravimetric water contents gwc along the hs core profile varied from 12 5 to 36 4 fig 3a the gwc showed a slight decreasing trend with increasing depth ranging from 15 7 to 32 9 average 23 0 in the shallow sequence 40 m depth 15 3 to 36 4 mean 21 5 for 40 70 m depth and 12 5 to 26 5 mean 19 3 for the deeper part 80 m depth for the cz borehole the gwc ranged from 4 5 to 19 2 fig 3b and the bulk density from 1 9 2 3 g cm3 the gwc fluctuated but again decreased with increasing depth the gwc above 160 m depth varied from 19 2 to 8 7 average 15 while it ranged between 7 0 and 18 2 average 11 3 between 160 300 m and 4 5 to 15 9 average 9 5 below 300 m depth likely reflecting a greater level of sediment compaction with depth the proportion of the mineralogical compositions of 15 core samples collected from hs borehole are shown in fig s5 the main minerals include quartz clay minerals feldspars carbonates and hornblende the hornblende contents decrease within the clay rich layers the clay minerals ranging from 3 2 to 37 8 of total mineralogy are anti correlated with the sum of carbonate minerals mainly calcite and dolomite the proportion of clay minerals at hs varies greatly and does not change regularly with depth in the sequence clay minerals 2 µm mainly include smectite and illite in total accounting for 66 83 followed by chlorite and kaolinite fig s6 4 2 aquitard porewater chemistry 4 2 1 aqueous extraction summary statistics min max median from aqueous leaching analysis for 110 samples from the hs borehole are shown in table 1 depth tds profiles are shown in fig 3 while the profiles for various major ions are shown in figs 4 and 5 tds concentrations in hs porewater varied between 1 14 and 71 02 g l with an average of 11 2 g l and the peak occurring at approximately 20 m it is hypothesized the peak represents the depth where evaporating groundwater discharge from the ncp piedmont flow system is preserved in porewater cao et al 2016 han et al 2020 porewaters in the aquitard are generally classified as sodium sulfate chloride type waters consistent with having experienced salinization by evapo concentration major ion concentration profiles yield very similar patterns between different ions measured in the hs borehole with most ions peaking at around 20 m depth the major exception is nitrate which shows a general decrease with depth consistent with an anthropogenic source at the surface e g han et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the concentrations vary between 0 7 and 200 mg l in the top 25 m decreasing to a narrower range of 1 1 8 0 mg l at depths below 90 m the hydrochemical compositions of all waters are dominated by na and so4 2 followed by ca2 and cl fluoride concentrations vary within a wide range 8 8 143 9 mg l mean 40 5 mg l with the peak at around 20 m depth in general the concentrations were highest within clay and silty clay rich sediment above the major sand layer at 65 90 m depth decreasing below this depth fig 5 the profiles of sulphate and chloride in porewater and groundwater are similar with a more pronounced bulge in porewater concentrations between approximately 5 and 50 m depth fig 5 compared with the proportion of clays in the core fig s7 the ions are more concentrated in the clay rich sediments in the top layer within 65 m of the surface this pattern is also broadly consistent with the observed fluoride sulphate chloride and nitrate concentrations in groundwater which are elevated in wells between 20 and 70 m fig 5d trace elements such as b sr v fe as zn and mn were also measured for the porewater extracted by the ae method table 1 the b fe mn zn and sr depth profiles fig 6 also show obvious peaks at the depth of 20 m and become relatively constant below a depth of 80 m arsenic concentrations of porewater on the contrary showed low values within this depth range and increased with depth the v contents in porewater also increase with depth but become more constant below the 100 m depth correspondence between as and v concentrations in groundwater within similar sedimentary material has previously been noted in associated with geogenic sources of these elements controlled by the sorption desorption of oxy anion forming elements scanlon et al 2009 4 3 squeezing extraction method 4 3 1 hs borehole porewater was also extracted from 51 of the core samples using the squeezing method see section 3 which yielded significantly lower tds concentrations from 0 8 to 16 0 g l average 6 0 g l and lower concentrations of certain porewater major ions table 1 fig 4 the major ion depth profiles obtained by the two methods figs 4 and 5 show that the peak concentration of most ions is consistent appearing around 20 m with similar curve shaped advection diffusion profiles for most major ions however there is significant offset in the concentrations of certain elements e g sodium potassium fluoride and sulphate most ions exhibit a high level of variability with depth in the upper layer e g top 20 m and become relatively constant with increasing depth this is more pronounced in the ae method results than the se method the cl concentrations show relatively good consistency between the two extraction methods e g in comparison to so4 2 f and major cation concentrations agreeing with the comparative findings from wersin et al 2013 in the upper layer within 25 m depth so4 2 concentrations obtained by the ae method are significantly higher than the se method similar to previous studies of porewater in thick argillaceous rock wersin et al 2016 with the increase of depth the difference of so4 2 concentration obtained by the two methods becomes less obvious the pattern of ca concentrations with depth is different between the two methods with a significant concentration bulge observed in the ae samples not seen in the se method analysis it has previously been shown that concentrations of cations in porewater are affected by cation exchange and mineral dissolution precipitation reactions during preparation of samples using the ae method wersin et al 2016 the concentrations of potassium fig 4d and fluoride fig 5c obtained by ae method are consistently significantly higher than the se method up to two orders of magnitude higher 4 3 2 cz borehole major ion depth profiles of porewater hydrochemical compositions for 66 core samples from the cz borehole using squeezing only are shown in fig 5 and table 1 the tds concentrations ranged from 0 4 to 14 3 g l average 2 5 g l with highest values in the top 100 m the major ion depth profiles fig 7 showed obvious peaks for k na ca2 so4 2 cl and other major ions within the depth range 40 80 m the main cation is dominated by na and the main anion is dominated by cl and so4 2 these concentrations peaked at approximately 78 m before decreasing to minimum values at approximately 135 m then maintaining constant concentrations below this depth the cl concentrations and depth profile closely resemble so4 2 while mg2 and ca2 also show close resemblance notably the fluoride and nitrate concentrations showed different concentration vs depth patterns to most major ions suggesting a decoupling of behavior relative to most other hydrochemical constituents the reasons i e cause of fluoride enrichment relative to other ions is discussed further below in section 5 1 and 5 3 no3 exhibits wide scatter at all depths and a slight increase with depth ranging between 1 4 and 121 5 mg l mean 28 0 mg l fluoride concentrations show a gradual increase with depth down to 150 m followed by relatively constant concentrations to 450 m comparing the cz profiles with the hs profile squeezing results the contents of most ions in the cz porewater are higher than the hs porewater with the exception of k no3 and f fig s8 this likely reflects a higher proportion of marine derived solutes in porewater in the coastal plain 4 4 groundwater chemistry statistical analyses for hydrochemical data from groundwater at two areas are shown in figs 8 and 9 the tds concentrations range from 1 7 to 11 4 g l mean 6 0 g l in the hs shallow groundwater 20 70 m well depth n 15 and from 0 5 to 4 6 g l mean 0 9 g l in hs deep groundwater 125 527 m well depth n 60 in the cz groundwater tds ranges from 0 3 to 11 5 g l mean 2 5 g l in shallow groundwater 5 30 m well depth n 19 and 0 5 to 2 8 g l mean 1 2 g l in deep groundwater 300 700 m well depth n 18 respectively major anions are dominated by so4 2 and cl in the hengshui region comprising 14 63 and 27 68 of total anions in shallow groundwater respectively while cl is dominant in cangzhou groundwater which is also characterized by a dominance of na among cations fluoride concentrations range from 0 4 to 3 3 mg l mean 1 6 mg l for hs shallow groundwater and from 0 3 to 2 7 mg l mean 0 8 mg l for hs deep groundwater while these range from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l mean 0 5 mg l for cz shallow groundwater and 1 1 to 6 2 mg l mean 3 5 mg l for cz deep groundwater respectively as illustrated by fig 9 the shallow groundwater in the hengshui area is characterized by na mg cl so4 or na mg so4 cl type water while na cl so4 or na hco3 so4 cl type for the deep groundwater in the cangzhou area the shallow groundwater is mainly featured by na mg so4 cl or na mg so4 cl type and the deep groundwater by na cl type the coastal saline groundwater especially in the deep aquifers is considered to be slow moving nearly stagnant xu 2009 the f concentrations of deep groundwater in cangzhou area is significantly higher than in shallow groundwater 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between two porewater extraction methods hs borehole the hydrochemical compositions obtained by the ae and se methods display comparable trends with depth at the hs borehole and in most cases comparable ranges of concentration values however noticeably higher concentrations of tds and certain ions e g sulphate fluoride potassium calcium were obtained using the ae method using the se method ion concentrations are assumed to reflect only the composition of free porewater whereas porewater extracted by ae method includes both free porewater and interlayer strongly bound water and may be affected by dissolution of soluble salts this has previously been shown to lead to higher ionic concentrations than squeezing results e g sacchi et al 2001 possible reasons may include the effect of pressure change oxygen intrusion leading to redox condition and ph change and temperature induced modification of water rock interactions brightman et al 1985 reeder et al 1992 mazurek et al 2015 wersin et al 2016 the data from the hs borehole is consistent with a greater degree of water rock reaction occurring during the ae method compared to se with ions known to be commonly impacted by ion exchange oxidation and precipitation dissolution reactions e g na k ca so4 most notably different in the two profiles fluoride mobility is also known to be highly redox and ph sensitive in similar environments and mobilization typically occurs in conjunction with cation exchange between na and ca e g currell et al 2011 in contrast more conservative ions such as chloride exhibit relatively consistent profiles between the two methods fig 5a sporadically higher cl contents in the squeezed samples around 100 m depth may be due to samples for the two methods being collected from depths slightly offset from one another or increasing salinity of the squeezed porewater sacchi et al 2001 the pattern indicates dissolution of halite is not a major influence as this would be expected to significantly increase cl concentrations in the ae results sulphate is the predominant major anion in the hs profile as illustrated in fig 5b there is an apparent mismatch between so4 2 concentrations from ae compared to that from se in the depth range of 5 20 m with the ae derived so4 2 concentrations up to 5 5 times greater and only slightly higher concentrations for the ae method in the depth range 20 130 m this may be attributed to dissolution of sulphate bearing evaporite phases e g gypsum glauber salt or celestite or pyrite and or organic matter oxidation during the ae process reduction in so4 2 concentration during squeezing tests may take place due to advective displacement by microbial sulphate reduction wersin et al 2013 the presence of gypsum was observed but not pyrite in the samples collected from the hs borehole this and the fact that the offset mostly occurs in the shallow part of the sediment profile where evaporite minerals are hypothesized to have accumulated in discharging groundwater suggests the additional sulphate in the ae profile derives from gypsum dissolution consistent with under saturation observed in the groundwater sampled in the nearby wells fig s9 long term consumption of drinking water from groundwater sources with excessive fluoride can lead to serious fluorosis as observed in many countries farooqi et al 2007 edmunds and smedley 2013 ali et al 2016 rashid et al 2018 high fluoride groundwater in aquifers has been extensively researched however few studies have focused on fluoride in aquitard porewater as a potential source in groundwater at the hengshui borehole the highest fluoride concentration of the aquitard porewater obtained by the ae method is 33 times greater than that obtained by the se method several geochemical processes may be responsible for the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater including release through water rock interaction dissolution and or desorption geothermal or volcanic activity gaciri and davies 1993 smedley et al 2002 coetsiers et al 2008 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the fluoride concentration in groundwater also depends on the surrounding ph and temperature saxena and ahmed 2003 valenzuela vasquez et al 2006 although it is difficult to obtain the ph value of the in situ porewater the ph values of the groundwater in the hengshui area are mainly distributed between 7 2 and 8 8 fig s10 with an average value of 8 0 it can be speculated that the porewater exists in an alkaline environment which favors fluoride enrichment through competitive sorption by hco3 currell et al 2011 higher fluoride contents of aquitard porewater obtained by the ae can be explained by a high proportion of fluoride being released through either water rock interaction triggered by the aqueous extraction method e g de sorption and or dissolution and or greater concentrations of f within the fluid strongly bound to clay minerals released using the method but not during squeezing a recent survey of elevated fluoride in global groundwater shows that igneous rocks are the dominant source followed by sedimentary rocks including those derived from igneous parent materials chowdhury et al 2019 occurrence of volcaniclastic rock mainly tuff and basalt has been reported in the stratum of the early pleistocene in the ncp at the hengshui area shao et al 1983 these rocks contain f bearing minerals such as amphibole including hornblende biotite apatite and fluorite shao et al 1983 tian 1984 ni and chen 1985 which are potential potential primary mineral sources of f dharmagunawardhane et al 2016 the hs borehole does not directly intersect these volcanic strata and it is therefore more likely that f is associated with the sedimentary material derived from the weathering of these underlying and nearby volcanic rocks during the quaternary period it is likely f originally contained in the above mineral phases is enriched within the clay rich horizons of these sediments due to the presence of a relatively high density of sorption sites comparing xrd results fig s5 with the fluoride profile of hs fig 5c doesn t reveal any correlation between high fluoride porewater concentrations and any particular mineral component e g higher hornblende content suggesting secondary sorption mediated release of f from clays as a major source of input into surrounding groundwater as suggested by currell et al 2011 na concentrations obtained by ae are also significantly greater than those obtained by se reaching a maximum difference of 4500 mg l at a depth of approximately 20 m this may similarly like so4 relate to evaporite dissolution e g mirabilite and other na so4 based phases and or weakly bound exchangeable sodium liberated during the ae experiment the ca2 concentration derived from the ae method showed enrichment and a very wide range of variation in the upper layer within 25 m depth consistent with the hypothesized gypsum dissolution and a similarly constant trend in the lower layer similar to the se method profile mg2 concentration profiles exhibited more limited difference between the two extraction methods noticeable difference in k concentrations were observed suggesting k is also associated with weakly bound ions liberated during the leaching process due to the potential concurrent cation exchange and mineral dissolution reactions and changing solid liquid ratio during the ae tests the cation composition in the porewater cannot be directly obtained by ae the cation exchange capacity cec is predominantly controlled by the structural negative charge of the smectite and illite wersin et al 2016 the apparent mismatch in cation compositions of porewater at shallow depths may thus be related to the high fraction of smectite and illite within the upper 40 m of the profile see fig s6 5 2 relationship between porewater and groundwater chemistry in the hs profile the porewaters are more saline than aquifer groundwaters in the upper layer although the concentrations of major ions in the groundwater show a similar pattern with values close to or slightly less than porewater concentrations obtained by both methods it may be expected that the relatively inter bedded nature of the sediments results in a high degree of mixing and less clear separation of composition between aquifer and aquitard layers resulting in a greater degree of mixing than is seen at the cz profile however there is significant variability in compositions with depth that broadly mirror the porewater chemistry trends as discussed above there is differentiation in the groundwater chemistry above and below the major aquitard layer e g for chloride sulphate and nitrate particularly however some elevated concentrations are observed in deep wells possibly due to some localized mixing across the aquitard the hydrochemical characteristics of aquifer groundwater are closer to those of the squeezed porewater indicating the squeezing data can be more closely regarded as in situ porewater that readily mixes with and contributes to groundwater in the aquifer wersin et al 2016 it is also noticeable that no3 concentrations are relatively high in groundwater at depths of 40 80 m indicating that the hydrodynamic conditions and groundwater chemistry of shallow groundwater above the main clay layer are actively influenced by human activity below 100 m depth nitrate concentrations in porewater and groundwater decline although they are still locally considerable indicating some degree of bypass flow han et al 2016 currell and han 2017 in the cangzhou area shallow and deep groundwater chemistry show more distinctive separation figs 7 and 9 the tds contents of the shallow groundwater from well depths 30 m ranged between 0 3 and 11 5 g l mean 2 5 g l n 19 compared to 0 5 2 8 g l mean 1 2 g l n 18 for wells between 236 and 450 m depth as illustrated in fig 3b the salinity range in porewater and groundwater are close to each other in the shallow layer however the deep groundwater in the confined aquifers is significantly fresher than the porewater in the deep aquitard generally there is a pattern of saltwater overlying fresher water within the cangzhou aquifer aquitard system likely reflecting the history of marine transgression regression within the ncp coastal plain discussed further in 5 3 compared with the hydrochemical compositions of squeezed porewater major ions of the shallow groundwater at cz are more variable in composition this suggests that the hydrochemistry of shallow groundwater is more susceptible to surface environmental influences such as rainfall recharge and irrigation infiltration than porewater the concentrations of na ca2 k and so4 2 in the deep groundwater 200 m are close to those in the squeezed porewater indicating that the free porewater is connected to the surrounding aquifer in general the major ions profiles in the squeezed porewater are in good agreement with nearby groundwater samples particularly in the deep samples indicating that these reflect the in situ porewater compositions only the f contents in groundwater are less than or close to aquitard porewater from both shallow and deep aquifer aquitard systems indicating a potential for enrichment if the store of f is released e g through water rock interaction there were wide variations in the no3 concentration 1 4 to 121 5 mg l in aquitard porewater however the no3 concentration of the deep groundwater 300 m depth 0 3 1 0 mg l is far less than the porewater presumably due to the presence of the relatively thick clay rich aquitard layers 5 3 controls on porewater hydrochemical depth patterns at two profiles 5 3 1 difference in the history of solute emplacement and movement central vs coastal plains although the curve shapes of the major ion depth profiles of the hs and cz boreholes show similarities the peak depths and maximum concentrations of ions are quite different this may be related to the sedimentary environment depositional history groundwater flow regime and climate change experienced over time in the two localities the central plain hs and coastal plain cz of the ncp notably the coastal plain has been impacted by inundation by seawater throughout glacial interglacial cycles in the quaternary whereas the hengshui region has not been covered by seawater in the quaternary fig 1 cl br mass ratios of groundwater at hengshui range from 1077 6 to 1614 3 which is significantly greater than the ratio 292 for seawater indicating likely dissolution of halite δ34s values of dissolved sulphate have a range of 17 9 18 9 v cdt in the groundwater at hengshui which is below the δ34sso4 value 21 rees et al 1978 for marine origin in addition strontium isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr with a range of 0 71196 0 71280 are much higher than seawater 0 709073 0 000003 denison et al 1994 all these data are consistent with the fact that the hengshui area was not affected by palaeo marine transgression for the cangzhou area the δ34sso4 value of groundwater mainly from aquifers iii and iv has a range of 15 9 22 9 li et al 2011 with a widely range of cl br mass ratio 138 1 4836 4 chen et al 2005 indicating mixing between groundwater and relict seawater may be partially responsible for groundwater salinization fig 10 shows that the relatively higher cl porewater at cz has cl br ratios closer to normal seawater ratio precluding halite dissolution fig 11 presents the relationship between cl br ratios and cl concentrations for groundwater samples collected from piedmont central and coastal plains at the hs borehole dissolution of halite may be mainly responsible for the high cl br ratios at hs consistent with evaporative concentration of solutes rather than a marine source as described in section 2 hengshui is located at the front margin break of slope of the alluvial and diluvial fan of the ncp central plain area this been characterized as being affected by inland salinization zhang et al 1987 the groundwater recharged in the piedmont meets the multilayered structure interbedded with less permeable aquitard layers triggering upward discharge intercepted by evapotranspiration resulting in solute and evaporite mineral accumulation cao et al 2016 han et al 2020 due to high evapotranspiration rates considerable concentration of solutes likely occurred in this zone supported by the mapping of saline lakes and other surface water bodies in the area han et al 2020 it is suspected this was particularly important during the warming period of the holocene in the eastern ncp yang et al 1979 the different palaeo environment at the two borehole sites in the central and coastal plain respectively can thus help to explain certain features of the hydrochemical profiles such as a relatively important role for evaporite mineral dissolution gypsum sodium sulphate salts and minor halite in the hs borehole compared to the cz borehole and a greater role of the aquitard in limiting mixing and propagation of solutes down the profile in the cz borehole consistent with a greater degree of diffusion controlled solute transport modelling by han et al 2020 explored the relative role of advective and diffusive transport and showed that the solute profiles in the coastal plain aquitards are likely never reached equilibrium with respect to the seawater boundary during the cycle of marine transgression regression in the quaternary based on the diffusion model of aquitard porewater mazurek et al 2009 since cl and br are conservative tracers and they have the similar diffusion properties pearson et al 2011 the residual seawater may retain the ratio during the diffusion process in clay rich aquitards compared with the plots for the hengshui area figs s11 and s12 the molar ratios of porewater and groundwater at the cangzhou area are close to these in normal seawater 650 for br cl and 0 05 for so4 cl respectively showing the marine contribution to the water salinity relatively low so4 cl ratios for the cz porewater also indicate that the sulfate reduction likely occurred in the clay rich aquitard this is consistent with the potential reductive environment for so4 2 in the deep groundwater from the coastal deposits zhang et al 1997 li et al 2011 5 3 2 fluoride enrichment mechanism s research into deteriorating groundwater quality in the eastern ncp has examined drivers of high salinity and high fluoride concentrations e g jia et al 2018 however little attention has been paid to the aquitard porewater chemistry at hs high fluoride porewater is mainly distributed within the top 60 m relatively high fluoride concentrations at very shallow depths at hs may partly be explained by evaporation near the ground surface and groundwater discharge in low lying areas in accordance with the solute concentration mechanism outlined above in 5 3 1 however given the observed cl concentrations which would behave conservatively during such evaporation the level of enrichment in f requires additional water rock interaction processes previous reviews of high fluoride groundwater in china have shown geogenic sources and water rock interactions to be important wen et al 2013 jia et al 2018 the elevated fluoride concentrations in aquitard porewater may originate from the weathering and dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals as discussed above in 5 1 which have a likely volcanic origin variations of hornblende with depth fig s13 indicate that abundance of volcanic minerals may be controlled by weathering under the alternately warm and cold climate periods of the quaternary ni and chen 1985 with increasing depth f contents of the squeezed porewater are positively correlated with na ca2 and mg2 especially below 20 m fig s14 with a more obvious positive correlation between na and f lower ca2 contents in this fluoride enriched water may result from ion exchange between ca2 and na2 on clays fluoride bearing groundwater are typically of nahco3 type and have low ca concentrations with neutral alkaline ph values 7 9 edmunds and smedley 2013 as illustrated by fig s15 both in cangzhou and hengshui high fluoride groundwater has ph values within this range leading to lower ca2 30 mg l and higher na 400 mg l for deep groundwater likely due to cation exchange this is also supported by higher na ca ratios in the high fluoride groundwater in both areas with positive correlation between f concentrations and na ca ratios table s3 a similar correlation in groundwater between f and increasing na ca ratios has been noted in many studies as fluorite solubility equilibrium limits the addition of f into the aqueous phase where ca is more concentrated e g appelo and postma 2005 the fluoride contents in the sediments at hs borehole range from 14 to 1690 mg kg with an average value of 780 mg kg liu et al 2015 and have an obvious positive relationship with al2o3 and fe2o3 wu 2015 this is consistent with f desorption from these phases under the influence of high ph and low ca content in groundwater currell et al 2011 moreover fluoride concentrations in the ae porewater below 20 m depth are positively correlated with various other elements at the hs borehole withρvalues of 0 80 for mo 0 80 for b 0 75 for cr 0 37 for ni 0 02 for fe 0 53 for mn and 0 29 for zn table s4 suggesting these may undergo similar release through desorption under changing ambient geochemical conditions during the analysis fluoride concentration in normal seawater is 1 3 mg l however it is currently as high as 6 2 mg l in the deep groundwater from aquifer iii at the cangzhou area as illustrated in fig s16 the deposits in aquifer iii contains the high contents of apatite and amphibole f bearing minerals which corresponds with higher fluoride in the groundwater of this aquifer the third aquifer group of deep groundwater is the main water source exploited in cangzhou with a depth range of 150 350 m and a ph range of 8 8 5 conducive to the enrichment of fluoride tian 1994 apart from the geological source of f during the deposition process since quaternary the alternation of cold and warm paleoclimate also greatly affected the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater the arid and semi arid climate in the middle pleistocene may have resulted in the enrichment of high fluoride groundwater in aquifer iii relative to the other aquifers in porewater fluoride reaches a concentration 9 8 mg l in the squeezed aquitard porewater at 135 m depth of the cz borehole significantly higher than normal seawater or the ambient groundwater this indicates that apart from marine transgression evapotranspiration and water rock interaction are significant factors the fluoride content in groundwater may be enriched with increasing residence time nordstrom and jenne 1977 nordstrom et al 1989 wang and cheng 2001 smedley et al 2002 edmunds and smedley 2005 and a longer porewater residence expected within the clay rich aquitard layer in the cz profile may explain the relatively higher f concentrations in aquitard porewater compared to groundwater particularly in the deeper parts of the profile 5 3 3 influence of the intensive pumping on hydrochemistry of aquitard porewater aquifer groundwater system konikow and neuzil 2007 estimated groundwater depletion from representative confining layers for different aquifer systems and found that nearly all the irreversible depletion of groundwater due to abstraction from aquifers is contributed by loss from confining layers i e aquitards land subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation will change the hydraulic properties of aquifer aquitard systems irreversibly ding et al 2012 cao et al 2013 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 lead to the loss of groundwater storage capacity smith et al 2017 gong et al 2018 herrera garcía et al 2021 and affect the groundwater quality erban et al 2013 few studies have examined long term water quality implications of such depletion e g through the release of solutes from clays into adjacent aquifers in response to groundwater depletion the main pumping layer of deep groundwater at cangzhou area is aquifer iii which provides approximately 90 of the total groundwater extracted ren 1991 compared with the piedmont alluvial diluvial plain deposits such as those at hengshui the deposits at 150 350 m depth range in cangzhou area are characterized by low permeability with a thickness of 179 m for the accumulated clay rich layer this creates a large risk of land subsidence and potential large store of porewater that could be released into the aquifers in response to pumping zhu et al 2014 estimated long term depletion from the confining units of the aquifer system in cangzhou implying that 57 6 of the withdrawals could be derived from depletion in confining units declining groundwater level can result in the compaction of confining units and the elastic compression of sand layers meanwhile the decrease of hydraulic pressure can enhance the porewater released from the aquitard su et al 2018 documented increasing concentrations of fluoride in groundwater within the ncp which they attributed to the release of f from clays during compaction in response to high rates of groundwater extraction the fluoride contents in the squeezed aquitard porewater are close to or slightly above that of aquifer groundwater at hengshui and cangzhou area however the ae results show significant potential for enrichment of fluoride under conditions of changing ambient geochemistry which may be analogous to changes occurring when this water is released from the aquitards into the aquifers in response to compaction further detailed geochemical studies would be recommended to examine the precise sequence of reactions involved within the aquitard aquifer system to better constrain this process 5 4 environmental implications and significance based on the revised conceptual model of groundwater flow system in the ncp cao et al 2016 groundwater flow in the hengshui region is supplied laterally from mountain front recharge subjected to evaporation during flow and upward discharge and mixing with downward recharge in the surface layer resulting due to artificially increased water input from irrigation return flow the coastal plain area is a relatively stagnant flow system with lower advective velocity influenced by compaction caused by land subsidence large scale exploitation of deep groundwater over the past half century has led to the continuous decline of groundwater levels compared with the artesian state of deep aquifers before the 1960 s in the coastal area the downward vertical hydraulic gradient in the aquifers has gradually increased which promotes vertical groundwater leakage from shallow to deep aquifers the deep groundwater exploited mainly derives from lateral recharge and leakage from elastic release of sand layers and compaction of clay rich aquitards the latter two have been estimated to account for 88 2 of the total yield zhang 1991 tian 1994 the average renewal rate is about 3 a for the shallow aquifer 150 m and 0 12 a for the deep confined aquifers from 1990 to 2000 chen et al 2009 indicating that large scale groundwater exploitation is capturing effectively unrenewable groundwater the average depth of deep groundwater level before 1969 at hengshui area was close to the land surface with locally artesian flow while the average depth at the center of the deep groundwater level depression reached 30 1 m in 1984 ming 1986 82 5 m in 2001 and 110 8 m in 2019 water resources bulletin of hebei province due to shallow saline water not having been exploited the average depth of shallow groundwater was retained in the range of 0 5 m thus the downward vertical hydraulic gradients have also greatly increased abandoned wells can provide a short cut flow path for the downward migration of the shallow saline water in these areas currell and han 2017 the geophysical log data show that the annual average downward movement rate of the fresh saltwater interface in hengshui area is 0 4 m a with elevated groundwater salinity observed in deep aquifers song et al 2007 indicating the exploitation of fresh groundwater has modified the distribution of shallow saline groundwater the exploitation and utilization of shallower brackish water resources reducing the head difference between deep and shallow aquifers may be one strategy for helping slow the downward movement of fresh saltwater interface into the deeper fresh aquifer layers the compaction caused by groundwater over exploitation leads to land subsidence along with the water release from the clay rich aquitard this process also modifies the hydrochemical characteristics of aquifers as discussed above fluoride is abundant in porewater and is released under specific geochemical conditions ph and na ca ratio resulting in increasing fluoride contents in the groundwater long term utilization of deep f bearing groundwater for irrigation may also lead to the accumulation of fluoride in soil profiles and plant species under the influence of et increase the fluoride content in shallow groundwater and even reduce agricultural productivity at cangzhou lei et al 2007 there are 1 02 million people living in the hengshui area and 4 5 million people in cangzhou drinking water with high fluoride contents creating a chronic public health burden lei et al 2007 yang 2010 in hengshui nearly 370 000 fluorosis patients are now receiving water from the central south north water diversion accounting for 36 1 of the total number of fluorosis patients yang 2010 inter basin water diversion has also alleviated water shortage and associated consequences caused by groundwater exploitation in semi arid areas such as the ncp contributing to groundwater level recovery already observed in the ncp during 2015 2019 long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however in terms of land subsidence current research indicates most aquifers experience only a small amount of reversible deformation especially when subsidence has occurred over a long period of time wanamaker 2020 therefore the impact of land subsidence whether on changing permeability or modifying groundwater quality may be effectively permanent artificial recharge has been applied to control land subsidence and achieved positive effects in many areas lebbe et al 1995 portugal et al 2006 hellauer et al 2018 although this is an indirect effect e g limiting depletion rates within aquifers to control aquitard compaction and cannot be applied to aquitard layers which have experienced irreversible subsidence aquitards have important influences on the hydrochemical characteristics of aquifers back 1986 water and salt movement are controlled by advection and diffusion batlle aguilar et al 2016 although the groundwater hydraulic gradient has been downward for some decades no due to the intense exploitation porewater profiles at hs and cz indicate that solute profiles have not reached a new equilibrium state under the current hydraulic gradient even in the relatively more permeable hengshui sediments a desalination effect in the top shallow layer is evident with low fluoride contents due to the warm and wet climate since the holocene and the recent infiltration of rainfall and irrigation return flow deep groundwater chemistry is conducive to fluoride enrichment to reduce the deep exploitation of groundwater and or artificially recharge deep groundwater development of brackish or saline water desalination technology could be considered which may reduce the hydraulic pressure difference between the shallow and deep aquifers and prevent further release of pore water from aquitards enriching fluoride and other elements in the adjacent groundwater another urgent priority is the effective plugging and abandonment of legacy wells to preventing the downward intrusion of shallow groundwater with high salinity and nitrate concentrations into deep aquifers 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the hydrochemical characteristics of aquitard porewater and aquifer groundwater at hengshui and cangzhou located in the central and coastal plain of the ncp respectively the major ion concentrations of aquitard porewater yielded similar shaped depth profiles with their peak concentrations observed between 20 and 80 m comparing the hydrochemical compositions of aquitard porewater obtained by aqueous extraction ae and squeezing extraction se it was found that cl contents showed good consistency however less conservative ions such as so4 2 and major cations were higher in porewater obtained by ae likely associated with the dissolution of sulfate rich evaporite minerals e g gypsum and cation exchange during the extraction the fluoride concentrations of aquitard porewater obtained by the ae method were up to 33 times greater than those obtained by the se method indicating the great sensitivity of fluoride to changes in the geochemical environment this gives clues to the possible reasons for long term enrichment of fluoride in groundwater from the ncp suggesting that geochemical changes associated with the release of aquitard porewater in response to intensive groundwater extraction may be contributing significantly to increasing groundwater fluoride concentrations the major ion profiles in squeezed porewater at the two boreholes showed good agreement with nearby groundwater samples indicating the in situ relationship between the free porewater and groundwater the downward hydraulic gradients caused by the intensive exploitation at hengshui and cangzhou areas have not yet changed the significantly observed diffusion dominated hydrochemical profiles of aquitard porewater indicating that these are still far from equilibrium with respect to the current hydrological regime we conclude that holistic analyses of groundwater quality require sampling not just of wells within the major permeable aquifer material but also profiling of porewater chemistry throughout an aquifer aquitard system we also propose recommendations for improving the adverse long term implications of high fluoride groundwater

4141,to explore the permeability and collapsibility characteristics of sandy loess in northern loess plateau of china the in situ tests were carried out by monitoring information of moisture content and collapse deformation in the soil layers the laws in conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration were compared and analyzed the main results are as follows 1 the water infiltrates with funnel shaped the moisture content decreases with the increase of depth under simulated rainfall infiltration all sandy loess layers can be nearly saturated under saturated infiltration 2 the water infiltrating in sandy loess site is fast the infiltration rate decreases with depth as a power function 3 the proportion of water lateral migration in sandy loess site is small for simulated rainfall infiltration the development of cracks experienced three stages of appearing expanding and keeping for saturated infiltration the development of cracks experienced the process of appearing expanding local small cracks cutting the main cracks and the later cracks developing makes the early cracks have trend of bending and closing 4 the differential collapse deformation is most obvious near the test pit boundary and the maximum collapse deformation occurs in the test pit center the collapse deformation caused by rainfall infiltration is only 11 6 of saturated infiltration 5 two conditions must be satisfied at the same time to fully activate the collapsibility of sandy loess firstly the moisture content variation reaches the initial collapse threshold of moisture content increment secondly the moisture state reaching the initial collapse moisture content increment must be kept for enough time 6 the evaluation of site collapsibility type and the calculation of ground collapsibility value can be carried out according to the formula δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i the parameter β and α is selected according to the evaluation type application condition and depth 7 the seepage force drives the silt components moving and changes the original structure of sandy loess which makes the water holding capacity in infiltration stage and water loss capacity in dissipation stage shows in layered distribution along the depth 8 the water dissipation of sandy loess site is accompanied by settlement and lasts for a long time the water dissipation rate decreased exponentially with time in practical application the adverse effect of water dissipation on ground deformation and pile bearing capacity cannot be ignored the research finally provides a new understanding for the mechanism of water physical action and deformation response of sandy loess it is of great significance for correcting and adding the evaluation method of site collapsibility type and ground collapsibility value in sandy loess areas keywords sandy loess permeability collapsibility water dissipation 1 introduction loess is a kind of yellow silt sediment formed by wind deposition in the quaternary period mainly distributed in the middle latitudes of northern and southern hemispheres li et al 2017 2019 it covers in wide areas accounting for about 9 3 of the earth s continent china is the main country of loess distribution in asia as shown in fig 1 a the coverage area across the east west north south direction is also covered more than half the total area is about 63 10 4 km 2 the loess plateau is the main concentration area of loess in china and its typical loess landform and engineering characteristics are deeply concerned by scientists as a kind of sediment originated from wind transferring loess particles are inlaid and contacted to form a skeleton with loose structure and developed macrospores once soaking in water the bond between particles will be destroyed the skeleton structure will collapse and the deformation is obvious the characteristic of producing additional settlement when soaking under self weight or self weight and external load is called as the collapsibility of loess the collapsibility of loess is determined by the collapsibility coefficient δ s h p h p h 0 h p is the stable height of undisturbed soil specimen under a specific load h p is the stable height of the soil specimen when saturated after being stabilized under specific load and h 0 is the original height of specimen according to the chinese national standard gb 50025 2018 the loess with δ s more than 0 015 is collapsible loess zhu et al 2018 collapsibility has serious potential hazards when collapsible loess is used as building ground and subgrade it has high strength and is a good ground bearing layer in natural condition however when it is soaked by water the settlement or uneven settlement will cause because of the sudden collapsibility deformation on the one hand this can result in the cracking or even overturning of buildings on ground on the other hand it makes the loess move downward relative to pile when pile foundation is applied in collapsible loess layer the pull down load generated by the interface friction between pile and soil is equivalent to an additional load acting on pile the pull down load is called as negative skin friction and its value is considerable which can cause the insufficiency of pile bearing capacity or even make the pile foundation failure the obvious harm of loess collapsibility requires engineering practice to avoid its disadvantageous effect as far as possible the premise of this principle is to accurately understand and evaluate the collapsibility characteristics of loess chinese national standard gb 50025 2018 collects and summarizes the research results of loess permeability and collapsibility in different regions of china it confirms the regional characteristics of loess are very strong to facilitate the potential hazard assessment of collapsible loess site and ground the technical standard gives four engineering geological division zones of loess in china fig 1 a they are zone i west of loess plateau zone ii east of loess plateau zone iii south central of loess plateau and zone ⅳ other areas zhu et al 2018 the collapsibility characteristics and level difference of each region are reflected by different evaluation parameters the loess of northern shaanxi is on the northern edge of loess plateau it is the transition zone between sand areas in ningxia and inner mongolia and loess areas in loess plateau it is also the junction areas of engineering geological division zones ii and iv according to the technical standard a part of loess in northern shaanxi is divided into zone ii the other part belongs to zone iv the most areas of zone ii is coverage area of longdong loess the appellation of loess in east gansu longdong loess is typical clayey silt loess which generally has high collapsibility the zone iv represents the weak collapsible areas in the loess plateau however the loess of northern shaanxi has high collapsibility and is obviously mixed with a certain proportion of sand which belongs to sandy loess is it really reasonable to regard it as longdong loess or loess in zone iv there is extremely urgent to study the permeability and collapsing mechanism of sandy loess the evaluation method of collapsible loess site and ground is needed to discuss by obtaining evaluation parameters furthermore it is must be verified whether it is necessary to distinguish the permeability and collapsibility characteristics of this sandy loess from longdong loess and loess of zone iv in the current rough engineering geological division zones the researches results are significant to promote and perfect the current evaluation system of loess site collapsibility deformation and engineering design level scientists and engineers began to study the characteristics of loess in the 1940s turnbull 1948 firstly proposed the origin of american loess harrison and kane 1969 tried to explain the cause of loess collapsibility and test its collapsibility by consolidation test from then on the researches on the mechanism and characteristics of loess collapsibility had been gradually deepened many scholars regarded the collapsibility as inelastic deformation and established the relationship to parameters such as void ratio moisture content suction compressibility preconsolidation pressure consolidation pressure lei et al 2011 ma et al 2005 muñoz castelblanco et al 2011 phienwej et al 1992 reznik 2007 wang et al 2020 xie et al 2018 the collapsibility pressure is an important factor activating collapsibility lin and wang 1988 rabinovich urinov 1974 zhang et al 2018 some reports suggested that the clay content in loess is related to collapsibility probability handy and richard 1973 kim kang 2013 the regional studies related to sedimentary causes were also gradually improved and a typical loess engineering geological division zones had been formed gao 1988 for the mechanism of collapsibility various collapsibility hypotheses were formed in the early period mainly based on the changes of particle adhesion contact mode and structure arrangement such as rheology phase motion catastrophe theory and simple structure frame theory rogers et al 1994 until the 1970s with the maturity of microscopic testing technology researchers began to reconstruct the changes of microstructure and mineral arrangement of loess before and after collapsing through scanning electron microscope sem and energy spectrum analysis grabowska olszewska 1975 liu et al 2015 li et al 2018 the understanding of collapsibility characteristics and mechanism is the base of collapsibility evaluation but if the collapsibility amount of in situ site ground is to be evaluated accurately the water infiltration process must also be fully understood it is the premise of activating collapsibility the analysis of loess permeability process and its influencing factors appeared in many research literatures anpilov sokolov 1993 haeri et al 2012 wei et al 2020 due to the randomness of pore shape and size distribution the uneven resistance of water migration through pores leads to obvious spatial variability of loess permeability hong et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in situ test is the most reliable method to reproduce the infiltrating process and collapsibility amount but it is limited by the large consumption of capital time and labor force the available previous research data are rare and precious in recent years some regional in situ tests of saturated infiltration had emerged in china and other countries the contents includes the distribution of seepage field the shape of wetting front the collapsibility deformation combination of different strata deng et al 2018 gvirtzman et al 2008 huang et al 2006 liu et al 2004 lv et al 2021 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2011 2021 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 in addition xing and liu 2018 studied the influence of different collapsibility amount caused by variable immersion areas on negative friction resistance of pile foundation by in situ collapsing test lu et al 2020 explored the infiltration law in loess site with the ground fissures some existing in situ tests data of collapsible loess infiltrating and collapsing response are included in the chinese national standard it is stipulated in the technical standard that the difference of site collapsibility amount between calculating by laboratory consolidation test and obtaining by in situ test needs to be corrected by coefficient β the recommended values of β for four engineering geological division zones were also given based on the collected in situ infiltrating and collapsing test results zhu et al 2018 shao et al 2015 also collected some in situ tests reports servicing for specific engineering design cases and gave suggestions for β of each engineering geological division zone which are different from that in technical standard a few researches had found that the collapsing characteristics of local areas are different from those of the engineering geological zone that it belonged the β related to regional geology in the local areas had been given by simple in situ permeability tests an et al 2018 to sum up the collapsibility of loess site has great harm to the ground and foundation although sandy loess in northern shaanxi is classified as engineering geological division zone ii or iv in technical standard zhu et al 2018 corresponding regional correction parameters β are also existed but it is mixed with sand and has obvious collapsibility which is not only different from the typical loess of zone ii in longdong areas but also weak collapsible loess of zone iv there is no research literature about the permeability and collapsibility of sandy loess in this area at present whether it is necessary to further refine the engineering geological division zones in the junction areas of zones ii and iv remains to be studied and verified in addition the evaluation of collapsibility in current literature all use condition of saturated infiltration with constant water head especially the in situ permeability tests but the actual collapsibility of site is mostly caused by rainfall infiltration how is the rainfall infiltration law and collapsibility amount when compared to saturated infiltration condition there is no literature report therefore in this paper the in situ tests are carried out under the conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration in sandy loess regions the purpose is to study the law of permeability at the same time the collapsibility characteristics are comprehensively evaluated by combining with laboratory tests results 2 test area as shown in fig 1 a and b the test site is located in youfangzhuang township dingbian county shaanxi province china it is transition area of typical sandy loess in the northern edge of loess plateau the soaking pit is located in an agricultural field in shape of ellipse with major axis of 30 m and minor axis of 20 m the site was leveled and the topsoil was removed before the test the soaking pit was excavated with depth of 70 cm and ground surface in soaking pit was covered by fine sand with thickness of 10 cm as the stratigraphic profile in table 1 the strata of the test site consists of late pleistocene sandy loess layer q3 and middle pleistocene loess layer q2 the upper sandy loess layer is within the depth of 25 m and the properties are shown in table 1 the sandy loess has self weight collapsibility its permeability coefficient is large and vertical and horizontal permeability is close the plasticity index is small q2 loess layer is under the sandy loess layer it has a large thickness and the exploratory hole depth of geotechnical investigation work about 50 m did not penetrate the layer the average value of self weight collapsibility coefficient is 0 005 and there has no collapsibility the permeability coefficient is less than that of sandy loess 3 methods 3 1 test design the test design is shown in fig 2 exploratory wells 1 4 were set with spacing of 7 m and depth of 27 m 27 2 m 20 5 m and 19 m respectively exploratory well 4 is located outside the soaking pit the instruments include moisture meter tdr 3 single point settlement gauge yt dg 0140 settlement mark and pore pressure gauge yt yl 0100 moisture meter is used to test seepage field information two moisture meters were respectively arranged on the left and right sides of exploratory well at a certain depth along the major axis direction except for the left side of exploratory well 1 the moisture meter in this side was replaced by the one in the minor axis direction they were inserted horizontally to the place with 1 m away from the side wall of exploratory well by manual drilling single point settlement gauge tests the interlayer collapsibility information because the connecting rod length of settlement gauge is constant the depth of each flange plate can t be exactly same as that of the moisture meter but as close as possible the self made settlement mark is used as auxiliary monitoring means of ground surface settlement they were arranged along the major axis with spacing 4 m and the minor axis with spacing 3 m two pore pressure gauges were set at the depth of 14 m and 26 m in exploratory well 2 to measure pore water pressure information of different strata the moisture meter single point settlement gauge and pore pressure gauge are automatic monitoring instruments and data acquisition device and solar power supply panel were placed outside the test pit in the major axis direction 3 2 instruments installation the installation method of instruments is as follows 1 the exploratory well with diameter 600 mm was excavated to the predetermined depth 2 as shown in fig 3 a samples were sampled in the west side of exploratory well with a depth interval of 2 m and sent to the laboratory for soil property tests 3 four grooves were carved on the other three sides of exploratory well in total one groove on north side and one groove on south side were used to the guide grooves for fixing data lines of moisture meters two grooves on east side were the guide grooves for fixing connecting rods and data lines of single point settlement gauges 4 the empty soil at the bottom of exploratory well was cleaned the flange plate of single point settlement gauge in bottom of exploratory well was fixed and its depth was measured and recorded then the worker was gradually lifted from bottom to top by manned device the connecting rod was connected and lengthened the sensor and flange plate were installed at predetermined depth the accurate depth of installed flange plate was measured and confirmed to eliminate the depth error caused by installing of course in this process the moisture meters and pore pressure gauge were also installed when manned device was lifted to marked positions of instruments the data lines of three instruments were led into corresponding guide groove and fixed with u shaped clamp all instruments in the exploratory well were installed in this way until reaching to the ground surface 5 exploratory well was backfilled with excavated soil in layer by layer and the compactness was controlled according to the undisturbed soil density the emptily filling thickness of each layer is 500 mm and it was compacted 15 times by heavy hammer the backfilling was recurrently done by this standard until reaching the ground surface and all excavated soil was used up 6 as shown in fig 3 b the top of exploratory well was sealed with compacted 3 7 lime soil the thickness of capping is 10 cm and the diameter is larger than that of exploratory well with 20 cm 7 the steps 1 6 were repeated for other exploratory wells 8 grooving in ground surface along the major axis the data lines from each exploratory well were buried in the groove and gathered to the acquisition box outside the test pit 9 the settlement marks were set by digging holes using luoyang shovel the steel pole of the settlement mark was bound with a black and white meter scale 10 the automatic acquisition devices were installed and debugged 11 the sand in ground surface of test pit was laid 3 3 test process and contents the laboratory tests mainly are some testing of soil properties indexes including the items shown in table 1 and the collapsibility coefficient in the following sections all of them are respectively carried out in strict accordance with the corresponding sections 5 9 17 and 18 of standard for geotechnical testing method cai et al 2019 the in situ tests consist of two parts 1 simulated rainfall infiltration the rainfall is three times of the annual limit rainfall consulted from the region meteorological data the water injection volume is 630 m3 in total as shown in fig 3 d and e the test pit is divided into four parts by the major axis and minor axis four water storage tanks were arranged outside the test pit and each was responsible for 1 4 of test pit area water was injected by perforated water pipes drilling hole in two side and the spacing between adjacent holes is 1 2 m water pipes were independently laid in each 1 4 of test pit area with a spacing of 60 cm and were fixed in ground surface by u shaped clamp there are two length of water pipes in one each 1 4 of test pit area their two ends were connected to four ports set on a water storage tank to inject water simultaneously and efficiently the period of water injection is 2019 9 21 2019 9 27 and there are 6 days in total count in 24 h the water cut off period is 2019 9 27 2019 10 22 and there are 25 days in total 2 saturated infiltration it is as shown in fig 3 f the water storage tanks and water pipes were removed after the end of water cut off period of simulated rainfall infiltration the standard is that the water doesn t infiltrate and the settlement doesn t change then water was injected continuously and the water level was kept between 30 and 35 cm the period of water injection is 2019 10 23 2019 11 10 and there are 18 days in total the monitoring after water cut off was continued until to 2021 1 6 and there are 423 days in total when the water supply was stopped for two months 2020 1 11 drilling holes and sampling were done in and outside the test pit to test the moisture content of soil in different depth during the whole test process the data of moisture content interlayer collapsibility and pore water pressure were automatically collected every two hours the average value of one index in one day was calculated and taken as its representative value the ground surface settlement was observed by a black and white meter scale bound on steel pole of the settlement mark the observation equipment is surveyor s level and the observation period is once a day the settlement value was calculated through comparing with the datum point 4 results 4 1 water infiltration and dissipation the water infiltrating with time is shown in fig 4 in order to eliminate the influence of initial moisture content difference the increment of volumetric moisture content is selected for analysis in the paper the number a and b represent the water injection period and water cut off period in simulated rainfall test c and d are the water injection period and water cut off period in saturated infiltration test the water didn t travel to the position of exploratory well 4 during the whole test process as shown in fig 4 a the simulated rainfall test can be divided into three stages according to the curve shape there are 1 i no infiltration 1 ⅱ rapid water absorption and infiltration and 1 iii water flows through and dissipates the saturated infiltration test can be divided into five stages there are 2 i no infiltration 2 ⅱ rapid water absorption and infiltration 2 iii maintaining the peak moisture content 2 ⅳ water dissipates rapidly and 2 ⅴ water dissipates stably in two tests the following infiltration process can be confirmed from the curve shape of phase ii when the wetting front reaches a certain depth the soil unit in front of the wetting front is in dry state it can be soaked rapidly to make the wetting front advance to its position however at this time the containing moisture level of this soil unit is still low the infiltration power is less than the infiltration resistance it can absorb the outflow water from unit behind it to make its containing moisture state increase rapidly in this process the wetting peak almost does not advance water is ceaselessly absorbed and accumulated in this soil unit until its moisture content increment reaches a certain extent close to the peak of moisture content increment the infiltration power can break through infiltration resistance and then the wetting peak will continue to advance this infiltration process is similar to pulse development process li 2010 for simulated rainfall infiltration test seepage directly enters the dissipation period after reaching the peak for saturated infiltration test the constant water head can ensure continuous supply of water and there is a peak holding section 2 iii with same end time to water injection period only when the water supply disappears seepage enters dissipation section of 2 ⅳ and 2 ⅴ in addition the water head condition also affects infiltration and dissipation mode in depth direction in simulated rainfall test the moisture content of section 2 ii for shallow soil increases rapidly and the cliff type dissipation appears after this section the rising rate of section 2 ii for deep soil decreases and there is continuous dissipation after the peak value but there is no such phenomenon in the depth direction for saturated infiltration test the rapid infiltration and dissipation of water in two tests are related to the properties of sandy loess silt are mixed with sand leads to the pore structure is open and connected the permeability and water loss capacity are strong the simulated rainfall infiltration test lasted for 31 days at the end of test fig 4 shows that the moisture meters at 15 m of exploratory well 1 and 8 m of exploratory well 3 just have response to infiltration water for a short time it can be thought the maximum infiltration depths of two exploratory wells are about 15 m and 8 m respectively the water in exploratory well 2 has been flowing through the depth of 6 m but it does not reach the next moisture meter at 10 m the maximum infiltration depth is 6 10 m so the limit infiltration depth of test site appears at the center of test pit exploratory well 1 and the value is 15 m the moisture content increment decreases with the increase of depth the limit infiltration depth of test site in saturated infiltration test is more than 26 m thickness of sandy loess layer at the end of water injection period whole sandy loess layer is soaked and the peak value of moisture content increment at each depth is equivalent this is different from the in situ infiltration test results of clayey silt loess huang et al 2011 and yao et al 2012 investigated and expounded the infiltration and collapsibility law in the depth direction by in situ tests in sites with large thickness clayey silt loess they thought that water infiltrating is easy in shallow soil and the self weight pressure of shallow soil increases with the increase of saturation the deep soil will collapse under the increased overlying soil self weight pressure when it is first infiltrated with the shallow soil continues to absorb water and water infiltrating the deep soil will collapse again under the double effects of the increase of its moisture content and overlying soil self weight this cycle repeats and leads to multiple collapsibility of soil at different depths collapsing makes soil compacted and pore gas pressure increase there is more obvious compaction effect in deeper soil and its pore gas is discharged more difficultly the water infiltrating becomes gradually difficult with the increases of depth therefore it is difficult to experience almost same saturation for soil in a large depth range but for sandy loess site the soil at a certain depth can reach the peak moisture content quickly the upper soil has been in the state of peak moisture content when the deeper soil is first infiltrated so the collapsibility mainly occurs in the process of first infiltration of water although the collapsibility also makes the soil compacted there is no secondary collapsibility because the sand inclusion of loess makes that it is easy for pore gas to be discharged the influence of compaction on permeability is limited and the infiltration capacity isn t obvious attenuation with the depth the variation of residual moisture content after water dissipation doesn t show a consistent law with depth and the water holding capacity of each depth soil is unordered during 200 400 days the residual moisture content of 0 7 m rises the analysis shows that this period is from march to september in the next year which is in the rainy season in northern shaanxi and 0 7 m is the influence depth of atmospheric rainfall in that year 4 2 wetting front and moisture content increment distribution fig 5 is the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content increment in simulated rainfall infiltration test the infiltrating consists of vertical and horizontal seepage the vertical infiltration originates from gravity and suction and the horizontal infiltration is from suction the water head pressure also acts on the vertical and horizontal infiltration but the level is very limited the distribution of infiltration rate and the shape of infiltration zone are decided by water supply soil properties suction gravity and infiltration boundary fig 5 a shows that the wetting front is flat and has a shape of like funnel which is different from the ellipse shape in clayey silt loess site li 2010 yao et al 2012 this difference is mainly own to soil properties during the water injection period the water supply by perforated water pipe makes infiltration uniform in the plane of test pit and the bottom of wetting front is relatively gentle when entering the water cut off period the heterogeneity of permeation gradually becomes obvious the infiltration rate in center of test pit is faster than that in other positions and the shape of wetting front between exploratory well 1 and 2 transits to the cone funnel because when consider the homogeneous stratum the infiltration concentration and ratio between horizontal and vertical infiltration force decrease with the increase of depth in addition the boundary effect is smaller in near the center of test pit the center of test pit is the symmetry axis of infiltration area with shape of ellipse and the infiltration rate and depth are the largest yao et al 2012 in this study the influence of local plane heterogeneity of stratum at the exploratory well 1 also intensified the phenomenon it is also due to the factor of the relative value of infiltrating driving force in two directions the lateral infiltration of sandy loess site is small but the vertical infiltration is obvious the wetting front surface at the boundary of test pit is smooth infiltration spreads in vertical direction and horizontal direction with a infiltration angle of about 10 in fig 5 b the shape of equipotential lines of moisture content increment at the end of test is similar to that of wetting front the moisture content increment gradually decreases with the increase of depth fig 6 is the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content increment in saturated infiltration test the wetting front is still funnel shaped compared with simulated rainfall infiltration the cone shaped wetting front near the center of test pit is gentler and the difference of plane infiltration is slightly smaller the constant water head has water head pressure at the infiltration interface horizontal infiltration is also affected by water head pressure besides suction factor similarly the vertical infiltration is affected by water head pressure gravity and suction therefore the permeability rates in both directions are higher than those of simulated rainfall infiltration the vertical infiltration is significantly faster than horizontal infiltration but the diffusion ratio in both directions still remains about 10 infiltration angle the results in fig 6 b and c are equipotential lines of moisture content increment at 8d and 18d the last day of water injection period a like saturated water rich zone is formed within 7 m under the ground surface at 8d the moisture content increment in the zone is basically equal to experienced peak moisture content increment but its saturation is only 47 64 and the considerable volume of soil pores isn t filled with water fully because the inflow and outflow of water in the pores have reached a balance at the moment for this kind of loess the pores that are not invaded by seepage water are closed pores or small pores which are difficult to open for water and gas circulation and the volume proportion is about 40 under the water rich zone is the unsaturated permeability zone and the moisture content increment decreases with the increase of depth when the infiltration reaches 18 d the sandy loess in the whole depth range is nearly saturated only near the contact interface between q3 sandy loess and q2 loess the moisture content increment decreases slightly in addition local high moisture content zones with strong water holding capacity are alternately distributed with depth red equipotential lines in the figure the phenomenon that moisture content change of sandy loess doesn t decrease with depth in saturated infiltration is different from ordinary loess which is more unfavorable to engineering design and should be paid enough attention 4 3 infiltration rate as shown in fig 7 the regression analysis method based on tests data was introduced to determine the relationship between infiltration time infiltration rate and travel distance of wetting front data in south of exploratory well 3 wasn t be used to analyze due to the influence of boundary the function form with the best fitting effect was chosen it can be known that the infiltration rate decreases with the travel distance of wetting front as a power function formula 1 where ν is the infiltration rate ν 0 represents the infiltration rate of undisturbed soil on the ground surface b is the attenuation coefficient the parameters ν 0 and b are mainly related to soil properties and infiltration conditions corresponding to the function of infiltration rate the infiltration time also follows a power function relationship with the travel distance of wetting front 1 v v 0 z b liu et al 2004 and yao et al 2012 carried out in situ infiltration tests saturated infiltration condition of two clayey silt loess sites in engineering geological zone i the infiltration rate function in this paper is similar to the results proposed by yao et al 2012 but for saturated infiltration test in our study ν 0 is 2 57 9 52 m day and the conversion result is 3 0 11 0 10 3 cm s b is 0 20 0 52 the former is larger than the result 1 16 10 3 cm s of yao et al 2012 and the latter is less than the result 0 46 in yao et al s tests 2012 liu et al 2004 only gave the average vertical permeability rate of 1 61 10 4cm s the values are 3 66 10 4 cm s and 2 3 10 3 cm s respectively in yao et al s tests 2012 and our tests therefore compared with the clayey silt loess site although the infiltration rate function form of sandy loess site is same to that the infiltrating in sandy loess site is easier and the infiltration rate attenuates more slowly with depth water supply also significantly affects the infiltration rate and the average vertical permeability rate of simulated rainfall infiltration is only 7 6 10 4 cm s the vertical infiltration rates under two in situ conditions all are greater than the loess element vertical saturation permeability coefficient of 3 86 10 5 cm s in laboratory test this indicates that the site permeability is higher than that of soil element itself the spatial variation of soil properties and seepage fissures existing in site are main reasons for the difference 4 4 crack development fig 8 shows the crack development in simulated rainfall infiltration test a continuous crack with width 2 mm was finally formed in 30 60 cm around the test pit the crack development process is as follows 1 crack appears and maintains a certain width in 1 day 2 crack width increases in 2 6 days accompanied that local soil blocks peel off and the crack section becomes irregular 3 crack width does not develop basically but the section irregular process continues in 7 31 days during the whole test period the ground surface of crack side near test pit has slightly collapsible subsidence the crack development mechanism is that the vertical and horizontal infiltration in test pit boundary occurs at the same time under the combined action of suction and gravity the range of horizontal seepage in shallow expands with the increase of depth the soil above the wetting front loses its support due to the collapsible subsidence of soil enveloped inside peak plane these soils tilt towards inside of test pit under itself weight and the crack appears fig 9 is the crack development in saturated infiltration test there is little change during the water cut off period and only the cracks in water injection period are showed in the figure except for the first main crack existed in the stage of simulated rainfall infiltration other four main cracks no 2 3 4 and 5 were formed from near to far and distribute within 5 m outside the test pit the spacing is from dense to sparse and the collapsible subsidence is from large to small but the subsidence value is not obvious the obvious stepped cracks sequence of clayey silt loess site does not appear in this test according to the distance the width of cracks 2 4 increases gradually and that of crack 5 decreases in addition to 5 main cracks there are quite a few local small cracks around the main cracks according the process of time the width of cracks 2 and 3 firstly increases and then decreases that of cracks 4 and 5 always increases the typical development mode of single crack is as follows 1 crack appears and ground surface on both sides of crack collapses unevenly 2 crack expands and the collapsing continues 3 local small cracks appear and cut the soil mass of main cracks collapsing still occurs the nearer cracks bended and closed because of the collapsing and the extrusion effect of farther cracks developing 4 5 collapse deformation fig 10 shows the results of interlayer collapse deformation unit thickness in two tests as mentioned above the lower q2 loess layer with large thickness has no collapsibility in addition the collapse deformation of sandy loess layer is obtained by the layering measurement of single point settlement gauge only placed in this layer therefore the underlying q2 loess has no effect on the collapsible deformation of overlying sandy loess layer the collapsible deformation capacity of sandy loess layer decreases with the increase of depth but the exception exist for individual depth because as we all know the collapsibility is mainly controlled by the open structure characteristics of loess generally due to the influence of historical deposition process the deeper loess layer has denser pore structure see void ratio in table 3 however there may be individual exceptions originated from the local randomness of loess depositing process moreover the collapsibility is also affected by the overlying loess pressure and the greater pressure is accompanied with greater collapsibility under the coupling effect of two factors the actual collapsibility changes with the law mentioned in above along the depth the main collapsible deformation of this kind of site occurs suddenly and keeps a short time with the infiltration and the curve of collapse deformation rate in fig 11 is obviously sharper than that of the traditional loess site yao et al 2012 this indicates that the bonding between sandy loess particles is weaker collapsing of the soil structure in one time is more severe of course the amount and rate of collapse deformation are also related to the infiltration conditions those in simulated rainfall infiltration test are less than in saturated infiltration test after the water injection period of saturated infiltration the water dissipation also brings some settlement deformation for shallow soil as detail view in fig 9 a because the saturation of shallow soil is higher and water fills soil pores in process of soaking and collapsing the pores volume filled with water becomes smaller with the water dissipation which results a small sharp drop in deformation this settlement can also bring negative skin friction to foundation pile therefore the science workers should not only pay attention to the collapsible deformation disaster during soaking period corresponding to the period of water infiltration affected by actual atmospheric rainfall in the next year mentioned in section 4 1 the soil of 0 3 m appears deformation rebound in this period it is caused by the shallow soil pores expansion and ground surface soil floating in process of atmospheric rainfall infiltrating after the water dissipating is finished the pores become narrow and this part of deformation recovers fig 12 is the envelope line of total collapse deformation in ground surface along the main axis on the right of main axis there are both accumulation value of interlayer deformation monitoring and direct obtaining value of settlement mark monitoring approximately equal results in two monitoring methods indicate that the monitoring by buried settlement mark is successful it can be seen that the ground surface deformation is symmetrical along the central axis its funnel shape is consistent to infiltration process the collapse also occurs outside the test pit and varies most acutely near the boundary with the gradual approach to test pit center the differential settlement becomes smaller except for nearby the center of test pit there appears steep drop corresponding to the wetting front the maximum collapsible deformation is in the center of test pit the total collapsibility of simulated rainfall infiltration test is 28 mm and that of saturated infiltration test is 241 5 mm according to the latter the site is self weight collapsible loess site it is judged by the principle of more than 70 mm in technical standard zhu et al 2018 so the disaster caused by collapsibility should be fully considered however according to the former the site collapsibility is only 11 6 of the saturated infiltration the site isn t self weight collapsible loess site and the consideration level of collapsibility disaster should become lower therefore the rainfall infiltration can only activate a small part of site collapse potential the currently widely used saturated collapsibility evaluation method has poor effect on coordinating safety and economy 6d and 31d in fig 12 respectively are the water cut off date and test end date in rainfall infiltration stage 50d and 63d are the water cut off date and stable date of settlement monitoring in saturated infiltration stage the collapse deformation in two conditions mainly occurs in water injection process accounting for 76 93 and 84 95 of their total deformation respectively 5 discussions 5 1 difference between simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration to analyze the difference of permeability and collapse deformation between the conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration more clearly the maximum moisture content increment and maximum collapse deformation of soil layers in two tests were done statistics as shown in table 2 the ratio of maximum moisture content increment in two tests decreases with the increase of depth only in the shallow soil of 3 m the saturation of two cases is close and the ratio is more than 80 compared with the moisture content variation the response of collapse deformation is quite different the collapse deformation ratio of two cases firstly increases and then decreases with depth the maximum ratio is 26 07 and the majority is generally within 10 they are far less than the moisture content increment ratio even for the shallow soil with similar saturation in two cases the collapse response of simulated rainfall infiltration is still very small the non correspondence between the collapse deformation ratio and the moisture content increment ratio under two infiltration conditions indicates that the change of moisture content isn t the only condition for activating collapsibility of sandy loess fully analyzing the special collapsibility mechanism of sandy loess two conditions must be met at the same time to activate the collapse potential fully 1 the change of moisture content is greater than the initial threshold of moisture content increment only when the change of soil moisture content reaches a certain level the softening of bonding contact between soil particles is enough to damage the soil skeleton structure under self weight stress of overlying soil and the collapse deformation occurs rapidly this can be explained by the fact that moisture content variation of soil near limit wetting front in simulated rainfall infiltration test accounts for 24 11 59 78 of that in saturated infiltration test but the collapsibility hardly occurs 2 the retention time of moisture state more than the initial moisture content increment is greater than the initial threshold of hold time combined with the analysis in section 4 1 sandy loess is different from clayey silt loess its bonding between particles is low and the fluidity of water and air in pores is good the collapsing of upper soil has a compaction effect to deep soil but which does not significantly change its air out and water out conditions and there is no multiple collapsing along the depth it can be confirmed from the changes of pore water pressure at different depths in fig 13 the better water holding capacity of q2 loess layer at 26 m makes the pore water pressure change in the infiltration process while the pore water pressure of sandy loess layer at 14 m is almost unchanged it is precisely because of this characteristic that the sandy loess is soaked and lost water easily in simulated rainfall infiltration test the saturation of shallow soil is high after the water flows through the soil rapidly the moisture content appears sudden drop and retention time of high saturation is very short the free water in soil pores does not fully change the thickness of water film adsorbed on soil particles before the soil structure adjustment caused by bonding failure responds fully the water has been lost and the activated collapsibility is also small the reason why there is no large collapse deformation for shallow soil with high saturation in simulated rainfall infiltration test is the lack of stage 2 iii moisture content increment always keeps in peak value therefore the collapsibility mechanism of sandy loess is different from that of clayey silt loess which is the essence of the mismatch between moisture content variation and collapsing response under two conditions 5 2 difference between in situ and laboratory saturated collapse according to the technical standard zhu et al 2018 the collapsibility type of collapsible loess site can be determined by the measured value or calculated value of self weight collapsibility δ zs 2 δ zs β 0 i 1 n δ zsi h i where δ zsi is the self weight collapsibility coefficient of soil layer i h i is the thickness of soil layer i β 0 is correction coefficient varying with soil properties of regions and can be taken according to the engineering geological division zones when the collapsible loess site is used as ground its saturated collapsibility value δ s is evaluated as follows 3 δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i where δ si is the collapsibility coefficient of soil layer i β is correction factor considering the soil stress state under the foundation and regions difference it can be selected according to the depth and engineering geological division zones α is soaking probability of soil in different depth the technical standard considers the relationship between calculated value of self weight collapsibility based on laboratory consolidation test and actual collapsibility in two cases for the judgment of site collapsibility type there is item β 0 for considering the regional geology difference for the evaluation of ground collapsibility value there is item β for considering the influence of depth and regional geology difference item α is set for the influence of soaking probability the reason of setting α is that it is found that in situ tests of clayey silt loess in various regions have the following common characteristics after collecting a lot of reliable tests data when the finite surface water infiltrates naturally in plane range the deeper soil is more difficult to reach saturation there seems exist a certain limit infiltration depth this indicates the soaking probability of soil layer decreases with the increase of depth in addition the saturation of complete saturation state in in situ tests is only close to but can t equal to 100 the complete saturation state is generally thought that saturation is more than 80 however the soil specimens at all depths can be fully saturated in laboratory test in order to correct the difference between in situ test and laboratory test the coefficient of soaking probability α is proposed as mentioned in previous chapters the sandy loess in saturated infiltration test can be approximately saturated in all depths but its saturation about 60 is smaller than that of clayey silt loess only in condition of simulated rainfall infiltration can the soaking probability along depth be distinguished table 3 shows the void ratios and collapsibility coefficients in laboratory tests for soil of exploratory wells 1 3 table 4 shows the collapsibility coefficients in in situ tests and laboratory tests for loess layer of exploratory wells 1 3 it is worth noting that the void ratio is the conversion index based on moisture content density and specific gravity obtained in section 3 2 the collapsibility coefficient of loess layer in laboratory test is the mean value of specimens collapsibility coefficients in this depth range in table 3 the collapsibility coefficient of loess layer in in situ test is calculated based on the interlayer collapse deformation measured by single point settlement gauge in fig 10 specifically it is defined as δ s δ h h 0 where δ s is the collapsibility coefficient of loess layer in situ test δ h is the collapse deformation of loess layer in a certain depth range and h 0 is the thickness of loess layer with natural state in a certain depth range the sandy loess area studied in this paper is junction area of engineering geological division zones ii and ⅳ the β 0 of zones ii and ⅳ are 1 2 and 0 5 respectively in the national standard zhu et al 2018 however as shown in table 4 the collapsibility of sandy loess in this area changes obviously with the depth the greater depth is accompanied with smaller β 0 the average value of β 0 in each depth is 1 1 which is closer to but not equal to the value of zone ii parameter β 0 should reflect the influence correction of regional soil properties difference and depth soil properties difference at the same time based on the above analyses it is found that the infiltration and collapsibility of sandy loess site are obviously different from those of clayey silt loess site in zones ii and ⅳ in view of these we propose a new method to evaluate the site collapsibility type and ground collapsibility value in sandy loess regions 1 the calculation formula of collapsibility value is δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i 2 for the evaluation of site collapsibility type δ s and δ si should be replaced by δ zs and δ zsi β is the correction coefficient considering the influence of regional soil properties difference and the depth soil properties difference according to the depth range 2 0 0 10 m and 0 5 below 10 m and to the top of non collapsible soil layer are selected for β respectively see table 4 when rough estimation is made it can also be considered as a whole in all depths following the form in technical standard taking 1 1 3 for the calculation of ground saturated collapsibility value β considers the factors of regional soil properties difference depth soil properties difference and stress state the value is determined according to the principle 2 and meets other requirements of depth in technical standard zhu et al 2018 4 the soaking probability of sandy loess layer under saturated infiltration hardly changes with depth so α isn t only used to adjust the influence of soaking probability in depth direction but also to adjust the influence of infiltration condition for the judgment of site collapsibility type α is taken as 1 0 for the calculation of ground collapsibility value when long term seepage such as water pipe leakage may occur during the ground service period α is taken as 1 0 when only the possible continuous infiltration of extreme rainfall is considered during the ground service period the collapsibility can be reduced appropriately to ensure safety and economy according to the depth range under foundation α is taken as 1 0 0 5 m 0 8 5 10 m 0 6 10 15 m and 0 5 more than 15 m respectively see table 2 it should be emphasized that the basic template of this method originated from the current technical standard its form can be confirmed by other in situ tests collected in the technical standard zhu et al 2018 for the evaluation of site collapsibility type and calculation of ground collapsibility value in sandy loess site new corrected contents including consideration factors and values of parameters are proposed based on the case study in this paper because the test method in this paper is carried out by restoring the actual conditions as much as possible the results are reliable and the new method has a certain reference value in addition due to the limitation of test methods in other literatures it is rare to obtain collapsibility information by layered measuring to determine the parameters values changing with depth therefore there is also necessary to further study and accumulate data to verify and improve the model in the future 5 3 infiltration boundary and water dissipation two months after water cut off in saturated infiltration test holing and sampling is done at 3 6 m 4 2 m and 5 1 m around the test pit and near the exploratory well 2 in test pit to test moisture content as shown in fig 14 the moisture content at 5 1 m is same as the original moisture content of soil layer and the lateral infiltration doesn t reach this position the moisture content at 3 6 m is greater than the original moisture content of soil layer and the value along the depth is basically equal which indicates the water lateral infiltration has exceeded this range at 4 6 m in interval of 3 2 5 1 m its moisture content is also between the moisture content of two boundary position except for the depth range of 5 m affected by the snowfall in this period the moisture content increases obviously with the depth therefore 4 2 m is the current lateral infiltration boundary less than the distribution range of cracks and its moisture content variation along depth represent the infiltration boundary shape as shown by the solid line in figure the vertical limit infiltration depth of exploratory well 2 is explored and approximate 43 m the whole infiltration boundary can be represented by the combination of solid and dotted line in figure combined with section 4 2 the infiltration angle of sandy loess has almost no change during the infiltration process and it is also about 10 the horizontal infiltration is much smaller than the vertical infiltration and infiltration boundary is consistent with the funnel shape mentioned above near the interface of q3 sandy loess layer and q2 loess layer the slightly low permeability of q2 loess makes the water holding state of the side of sandy loess higher but the influence range is limited and only in the range of 2 m depth so the q2 loess layer doesn t obviously affect the water infiltration law of sandy loess layer fig 15 is the water infiltration and dissipation envelope diagram of exploratory well 1 and 2 in saturated infiltration test the soil layer with more moisture content increment in infiltration process has more water dissipation after infiltration and the leftover moisture content increment is smaller this indicates that the potential water storage space and water loss space of the soil layer is large but the variation of void ratio along depth in table 3 isn t consistent with this the analysis shows that the permeability mode of this sandy loess is special seepage force can produce transport effect to some fine silt particles the loose structure produced by mixture of coarse sand particles and fine silt particles provides passageway condition for migration of small particles the water infiltrating from top to bottom drives some fine particles to sink and accumulate gradually when the fine grained soil accumulates to the local maximum density at a certain position too much fine grained soil agglomerates and blocks the transport passageway the fine grained soil no longer moves under the seepage force at this time the water storage space at this position is the smallest and the change of moisture content in infiltration process is the smallest but due to the good water holding capacity of fine grained soil the water loss capacity of this location in water dissipation process becomes weak and the residual moisture content increment is the largest when the water passes through this position the next cycle of soil particle transportation and accumulation begins this repeated circulation makes the water infiltrating and advancing in form of layers the moisture content increase in infiltration process and moisture content dissipation after infiltration also show layered feature it can be confirmed by the moisture content test results of original stratum before infiltration and stratum experienced infiltration as shown in the right side of fig 15 the moisture content of soil layer experienced infiltration presents layered distribution however the layered distribution characteristic of moisture content does not appear in original stratum these facts were also directly observed by eyes during two times excavating exploratory wells stages before and after infiltration the process of water dissipation of sandy loess is also accompanied by settlement deformation and the previous studies do not pay attention to the process of water dissipation fig 16 shows the water dissipation rate of exploratory wells 1 3 the date in figure starts from water cut off period of saturated infiltration test the water dissipation is very fast at the beginning of water cut off and it gradually slows down with passage of time about at 100 d the water dissipation rate tends to be stable the relationship between water dissipation rate and time is not related to the depth and horizontal position the partial coefficients of water dissipation functions of three exploratory wells are close to each other and they are approximately same exponential function table 5 shows the information of total settlement settlement in soaking period and settlement in water dissipation period for exploratory wells 1 3 the settlement value caused by water dissipation is larger within the depth of 3 m and smaller in deeper soil however according to the settlement proportion the proportion of water dissipation settlement in total settlement firstly decreases and then increases with the depth for the deeper soil more than 10 m the proportion is prominent therefore for this kind of sandy loess site we should not only pay attention to the damage of collapsible deformation the damage of deformation caused by water dissipation should not be also ignored in addition we should pay special attention to the problem of time effect although the value of water dissipation deformation is small it lasts for a long time especially for the pile foundation the quite small trend of soil settlement is enough to cause considerable negative skin friction long lasting time results it is difficult to reach the balance of pile soil interaction in a short time to make the negative skin friction disappear this is different from the negative skin friction caused by short term sudden collapse therefore the spatiotemporal variation rules and adverse effects of water dissipation deformation should be taken into important account to the engineering design of such site in the future 6 conclusion in this paper the permeability and collapsibility characteristics of sandy loess in the transition zone of northern loess plateau were studied by in situ tests and laboratory tests including the conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration the main conclusions are as follows 1 the simulated rainfall infiltration can be divided into three stages the limit infiltration depth of test site is 15 m and the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content variation are funnel shaped the moisture content variation decreases with the increase of depth there appears a continuous crack around the test pit and the crack development mode is appearing expanding and keeping 2 the saturated infiltration can be divided into five stages the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content variation are funnel shaped the whole sandy loess layer is close to saturation the compaction effect of upper soil collapsing on lower soil can t change the air out and water out conditions of loess pores and there is no phenomenon of multiple collapsibility varying with depth there are four new continuous cracks around the test pit the crack development mode is appearing expanding local small cracks cutting the main cracks and the later cracks development makes the early cracks have trend of bending and closing 3 the infiltration rate decreases with the travel distance of wetting front as a power function the infiltration rate of sandy loess site is much higher than that of clayey silt loess site and is also higher than the permeability coefficient of sandy loess element the total collapsible deformation of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration are 28 mm and 241 5 mm respectively the site types evaluated by collapsibility value under two infiltration conditions are different and rainfall infiltration can only activate a small part of site collapse potential collapse deformation occurs both inside and outside the test pit the deformation envelope along axis is funnel shaped and its changing near boundary of test pit is the most acute 4 the moisture content variation ratio and collapse deformation ratio of soil layer in the same position under two infiltration conditions has non correspondence the collapsing mechanism of sand loess is special two conditions must be met at the same time to fully activate the collapse potential one is that the moisture content variation is more than the initial collapse threshold of moisture content increment another is that the moisture state more than the initial moisture content increment must keep for enough time 5 the collapsibility type evaluation and ground collapsibility value evaluation of sandy loess site can be carried out according to a new method the calculation formula of collapsibility value is δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i when judging the collapsibility type of site the coefficient β is 2 0 0 10 m 0 5 more than 10 m it is also considered at whole depth β is taken as 1 1 for saturated infiltration the soaking probability coefficient α is 1 0 when rainfall infiltration is considered 1 0 0 5 m 0 8 5 10 m 0 6 10 15 m and 0 5 more than 15 m are taken for α according to the depth range under foundation 6 the permeability mode of sandy loess is special and the driving effect of seepage force on fine particles changes the original structure of soil which makes the soil water holding capacity in infiltration process and soil water loss capacity in dissipation process distribute in layers the water dissipation also produces settlement deformation and lasts for a long time its rate reduces with time as exponential function the adverse effect of water dissipation deformation on ground and pile foundation should be paid full attention credit authorship contribution statement yongguo yao conceptualization

4141,to explore the permeability and collapsibility characteristics of sandy loess in northern loess plateau of china the in situ tests were carried out by monitoring information of moisture content and collapse deformation in the soil layers the laws in conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration were compared and analyzed the main results are as follows 1 the water infiltrates with funnel shaped the moisture content decreases with the increase of depth under simulated rainfall infiltration all sandy loess layers can be nearly saturated under saturated infiltration 2 the water infiltrating in sandy loess site is fast the infiltration rate decreases with depth as a power function 3 the proportion of water lateral migration in sandy loess site is small for simulated rainfall infiltration the development of cracks experienced three stages of appearing expanding and keeping for saturated infiltration the development of cracks experienced the process of appearing expanding local small cracks cutting the main cracks and the later cracks developing makes the early cracks have trend of bending and closing 4 the differential collapse deformation is most obvious near the test pit boundary and the maximum collapse deformation occurs in the test pit center the collapse deformation caused by rainfall infiltration is only 11 6 of saturated infiltration 5 two conditions must be satisfied at the same time to fully activate the collapsibility of sandy loess firstly the moisture content variation reaches the initial collapse threshold of moisture content increment secondly the moisture state reaching the initial collapse moisture content increment must be kept for enough time 6 the evaluation of site collapsibility type and the calculation of ground collapsibility value can be carried out according to the formula δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i the parameter β and α is selected according to the evaluation type application condition and depth 7 the seepage force drives the silt components moving and changes the original structure of sandy loess which makes the water holding capacity in infiltration stage and water loss capacity in dissipation stage shows in layered distribution along the depth 8 the water dissipation of sandy loess site is accompanied by settlement and lasts for a long time the water dissipation rate decreased exponentially with time in practical application the adverse effect of water dissipation on ground deformation and pile bearing capacity cannot be ignored the research finally provides a new understanding for the mechanism of water physical action and deformation response of sandy loess it is of great significance for correcting and adding the evaluation method of site collapsibility type and ground collapsibility value in sandy loess areas keywords sandy loess permeability collapsibility water dissipation 1 introduction loess is a kind of yellow silt sediment formed by wind deposition in the quaternary period mainly distributed in the middle latitudes of northern and southern hemispheres li et al 2017 2019 it covers in wide areas accounting for about 9 3 of the earth s continent china is the main country of loess distribution in asia as shown in fig 1 a the coverage area across the east west north south direction is also covered more than half the total area is about 63 10 4 km 2 the loess plateau is the main concentration area of loess in china and its typical loess landform and engineering characteristics are deeply concerned by scientists as a kind of sediment originated from wind transferring loess particles are inlaid and contacted to form a skeleton with loose structure and developed macrospores once soaking in water the bond between particles will be destroyed the skeleton structure will collapse and the deformation is obvious the characteristic of producing additional settlement when soaking under self weight or self weight and external load is called as the collapsibility of loess the collapsibility of loess is determined by the collapsibility coefficient δ s h p h p h 0 h p is the stable height of undisturbed soil specimen under a specific load h p is the stable height of the soil specimen when saturated after being stabilized under specific load and h 0 is the original height of specimen according to the chinese national standard gb 50025 2018 the loess with δ s more than 0 015 is collapsible loess zhu et al 2018 collapsibility has serious potential hazards when collapsible loess is used as building ground and subgrade it has high strength and is a good ground bearing layer in natural condition however when it is soaked by water the settlement or uneven settlement will cause because of the sudden collapsibility deformation on the one hand this can result in the cracking or even overturning of buildings on ground on the other hand it makes the loess move downward relative to pile when pile foundation is applied in collapsible loess layer the pull down load generated by the interface friction between pile and soil is equivalent to an additional load acting on pile the pull down load is called as negative skin friction and its value is considerable which can cause the insufficiency of pile bearing capacity or even make the pile foundation failure the obvious harm of loess collapsibility requires engineering practice to avoid its disadvantageous effect as far as possible the premise of this principle is to accurately understand and evaluate the collapsibility characteristics of loess chinese national standard gb 50025 2018 collects and summarizes the research results of loess permeability and collapsibility in different regions of china it confirms the regional characteristics of loess are very strong to facilitate the potential hazard assessment of collapsible loess site and ground the technical standard gives four engineering geological division zones of loess in china fig 1 a they are zone i west of loess plateau zone ii east of loess plateau zone iii south central of loess plateau and zone ⅳ other areas zhu et al 2018 the collapsibility characteristics and level difference of each region are reflected by different evaluation parameters the loess of northern shaanxi is on the northern edge of loess plateau it is the transition zone between sand areas in ningxia and inner mongolia and loess areas in loess plateau it is also the junction areas of engineering geological division zones ii and iv according to the technical standard a part of loess in northern shaanxi is divided into zone ii the other part belongs to zone iv the most areas of zone ii is coverage area of longdong loess the appellation of loess in east gansu longdong loess is typical clayey silt loess which generally has high collapsibility the zone iv represents the weak collapsible areas in the loess plateau however the loess of northern shaanxi has high collapsibility and is obviously mixed with a certain proportion of sand which belongs to sandy loess is it really reasonable to regard it as longdong loess or loess in zone iv there is extremely urgent to study the permeability and collapsing mechanism of sandy loess the evaluation method of collapsible loess site and ground is needed to discuss by obtaining evaluation parameters furthermore it is must be verified whether it is necessary to distinguish the permeability and collapsibility characteristics of this sandy loess from longdong loess and loess of zone iv in the current rough engineering geological division zones the researches results are significant to promote and perfect the current evaluation system of loess site collapsibility deformation and engineering design level scientists and engineers began to study the characteristics of loess in the 1940s turnbull 1948 firstly proposed the origin of american loess harrison and kane 1969 tried to explain the cause of loess collapsibility and test its collapsibility by consolidation test from then on the researches on the mechanism and characteristics of loess collapsibility had been gradually deepened many scholars regarded the collapsibility as inelastic deformation and established the relationship to parameters such as void ratio moisture content suction compressibility preconsolidation pressure consolidation pressure lei et al 2011 ma et al 2005 muñoz castelblanco et al 2011 phienwej et al 1992 reznik 2007 wang et al 2020 xie et al 2018 the collapsibility pressure is an important factor activating collapsibility lin and wang 1988 rabinovich urinov 1974 zhang et al 2018 some reports suggested that the clay content in loess is related to collapsibility probability handy and richard 1973 kim kang 2013 the regional studies related to sedimentary causes were also gradually improved and a typical loess engineering geological division zones had been formed gao 1988 for the mechanism of collapsibility various collapsibility hypotheses were formed in the early period mainly based on the changes of particle adhesion contact mode and structure arrangement such as rheology phase motion catastrophe theory and simple structure frame theory rogers et al 1994 until the 1970s with the maturity of microscopic testing technology researchers began to reconstruct the changes of microstructure and mineral arrangement of loess before and after collapsing through scanning electron microscope sem and energy spectrum analysis grabowska olszewska 1975 liu et al 2015 li et al 2018 the understanding of collapsibility characteristics and mechanism is the base of collapsibility evaluation but if the collapsibility amount of in situ site ground is to be evaluated accurately the water infiltration process must also be fully understood it is the premise of activating collapsibility the analysis of loess permeability process and its influencing factors appeared in many research literatures anpilov sokolov 1993 haeri et al 2012 wei et al 2020 due to the randomness of pore shape and size distribution the uneven resistance of water migration through pores leads to obvious spatial variability of loess permeability hong et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in situ test is the most reliable method to reproduce the infiltrating process and collapsibility amount but it is limited by the large consumption of capital time and labor force the available previous research data are rare and precious in recent years some regional in situ tests of saturated infiltration had emerged in china and other countries the contents includes the distribution of seepage field the shape of wetting front the collapsibility deformation combination of different strata deng et al 2018 gvirtzman et al 2008 huang et al 2006 liu et al 2004 lv et al 2021 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2011 2021 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 in addition xing and liu 2018 studied the influence of different collapsibility amount caused by variable immersion areas on negative friction resistance of pile foundation by in situ collapsing test lu et al 2020 explored the infiltration law in loess site with the ground fissures some existing in situ tests data of collapsible loess infiltrating and collapsing response are included in the chinese national standard it is stipulated in the technical standard that the difference of site collapsibility amount between calculating by laboratory consolidation test and obtaining by in situ test needs to be corrected by coefficient β the recommended values of β for four engineering geological division zones were also given based on the collected in situ infiltrating and collapsing test results zhu et al 2018 shao et al 2015 also collected some in situ tests reports servicing for specific engineering design cases and gave suggestions for β of each engineering geological division zone which are different from that in technical standard a few researches had found that the collapsing characteristics of local areas are different from those of the engineering geological zone that it belonged the β related to regional geology in the local areas had been given by simple in situ permeability tests an et al 2018 to sum up the collapsibility of loess site has great harm to the ground and foundation although sandy loess in northern shaanxi is classified as engineering geological division zone ii or iv in technical standard zhu et al 2018 corresponding regional correction parameters β are also existed but it is mixed with sand and has obvious collapsibility which is not only different from the typical loess of zone ii in longdong areas but also weak collapsible loess of zone iv there is no research literature about the permeability and collapsibility of sandy loess in this area at present whether it is necessary to further refine the engineering geological division zones in the junction areas of zones ii and iv remains to be studied and verified in addition the evaluation of collapsibility in current literature all use condition of saturated infiltration with constant water head especially the in situ permeability tests but the actual collapsibility of site is mostly caused by rainfall infiltration how is the rainfall infiltration law and collapsibility amount when compared to saturated infiltration condition there is no literature report therefore in this paper the in situ tests are carried out under the conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration in sandy loess regions the purpose is to study the law of permeability at the same time the collapsibility characteristics are comprehensively evaluated by combining with laboratory tests results 2 test area as shown in fig 1 a and b the test site is located in youfangzhuang township dingbian county shaanxi province china it is transition area of typical sandy loess in the northern edge of loess plateau the soaking pit is located in an agricultural field in shape of ellipse with major axis of 30 m and minor axis of 20 m the site was leveled and the topsoil was removed before the test the soaking pit was excavated with depth of 70 cm and ground surface in soaking pit was covered by fine sand with thickness of 10 cm as the stratigraphic profile in table 1 the strata of the test site consists of late pleistocene sandy loess layer q3 and middle pleistocene loess layer q2 the upper sandy loess layer is within the depth of 25 m and the properties are shown in table 1 the sandy loess has self weight collapsibility its permeability coefficient is large and vertical and horizontal permeability is close the plasticity index is small q2 loess layer is under the sandy loess layer it has a large thickness and the exploratory hole depth of geotechnical investigation work about 50 m did not penetrate the layer the average value of self weight collapsibility coefficient is 0 005 and there has no collapsibility the permeability coefficient is less than that of sandy loess 3 methods 3 1 test design the test design is shown in fig 2 exploratory wells 1 4 were set with spacing of 7 m and depth of 27 m 27 2 m 20 5 m and 19 m respectively exploratory well 4 is located outside the soaking pit the instruments include moisture meter tdr 3 single point settlement gauge yt dg 0140 settlement mark and pore pressure gauge yt yl 0100 moisture meter is used to test seepage field information two moisture meters were respectively arranged on the left and right sides of exploratory well at a certain depth along the major axis direction except for the left side of exploratory well 1 the moisture meter in this side was replaced by the one in the minor axis direction they were inserted horizontally to the place with 1 m away from the side wall of exploratory well by manual drilling single point settlement gauge tests the interlayer collapsibility information because the connecting rod length of settlement gauge is constant the depth of each flange plate can t be exactly same as that of the moisture meter but as close as possible the self made settlement mark is used as auxiliary monitoring means of ground surface settlement they were arranged along the major axis with spacing 4 m and the minor axis with spacing 3 m two pore pressure gauges were set at the depth of 14 m and 26 m in exploratory well 2 to measure pore water pressure information of different strata the moisture meter single point settlement gauge and pore pressure gauge are automatic monitoring instruments and data acquisition device and solar power supply panel were placed outside the test pit in the major axis direction 3 2 instruments installation the installation method of instruments is as follows 1 the exploratory well with diameter 600 mm was excavated to the predetermined depth 2 as shown in fig 3 a samples were sampled in the west side of exploratory well with a depth interval of 2 m and sent to the laboratory for soil property tests 3 four grooves were carved on the other three sides of exploratory well in total one groove on north side and one groove on south side were used to the guide grooves for fixing data lines of moisture meters two grooves on east side were the guide grooves for fixing connecting rods and data lines of single point settlement gauges 4 the empty soil at the bottom of exploratory well was cleaned the flange plate of single point settlement gauge in bottom of exploratory well was fixed and its depth was measured and recorded then the worker was gradually lifted from bottom to top by manned device the connecting rod was connected and lengthened the sensor and flange plate were installed at predetermined depth the accurate depth of installed flange plate was measured and confirmed to eliminate the depth error caused by installing of course in this process the moisture meters and pore pressure gauge were also installed when manned device was lifted to marked positions of instruments the data lines of three instruments were led into corresponding guide groove and fixed with u shaped clamp all instruments in the exploratory well were installed in this way until reaching to the ground surface 5 exploratory well was backfilled with excavated soil in layer by layer and the compactness was controlled according to the undisturbed soil density the emptily filling thickness of each layer is 500 mm and it was compacted 15 times by heavy hammer the backfilling was recurrently done by this standard until reaching the ground surface and all excavated soil was used up 6 as shown in fig 3 b the top of exploratory well was sealed with compacted 3 7 lime soil the thickness of capping is 10 cm and the diameter is larger than that of exploratory well with 20 cm 7 the steps 1 6 were repeated for other exploratory wells 8 grooving in ground surface along the major axis the data lines from each exploratory well were buried in the groove and gathered to the acquisition box outside the test pit 9 the settlement marks were set by digging holes using luoyang shovel the steel pole of the settlement mark was bound with a black and white meter scale 10 the automatic acquisition devices were installed and debugged 11 the sand in ground surface of test pit was laid 3 3 test process and contents the laboratory tests mainly are some testing of soil properties indexes including the items shown in table 1 and the collapsibility coefficient in the following sections all of them are respectively carried out in strict accordance with the corresponding sections 5 9 17 and 18 of standard for geotechnical testing method cai et al 2019 the in situ tests consist of two parts 1 simulated rainfall infiltration the rainfall is three times of the annual limit rainfall consulted from the region meteorological data the water injection volume is 630 m3 in total as shown in fig 3 d and e the test pit is divided into four parts by the major axis and minor axis four water storage tanks were arranged outside the test pit and each was responsible for 1 4 of test pit area water was injected by perforated water pipes drilling hole in two side and the spacing between adjacent holes is 1 2 m water pipes were independently laid in each 1 4 of test pit area with a spacing of 60 cm and were fixed in ground surface by u shaped clamp there are two length of water pipes in one each 1 4 of test pit area their two ends were connected to four ports set on a water storage tank to inject water simultaneously and efficiently the period of water injection is 2019 9 21 2019 9 27 and there are 6 days in total count in 24 h the water cut off period is 2019 9 27 2019 10 22 and there are 25 days in total 2 saturated infiltration it is as shown in fig 3 f the water storage tanks and water pipes were removed after the end of water cut off period of simulated rainfall infiltration the standard is that the water doesn t infiltrate and the settlement doesn t change then water was injected continuously and the water level was kept between 30 and 35 cm the period of water injection is 2019 10 23 2019 11 10 and there are 18 days in total the monitoring after water cut off was continued until to 2021 1 6 and there are 423 days in total when the water supply was stopped for two months 2020 1 11 drilling holes and sampling were done in and outside the test pit to test the moisture content of soil in different depth during the whole test process the data of moisture content interlayer collapsibility and pore water pressure were automatically collected every two hours the average value of one index in one day was calculated and taken as its representative value the ground surface settlement was observed by a black and white meter scale bound on steel pole of the settlement mark the observation equipment is surveyor s level and the observation period is once a day the settlement value was calculated through comparing with the datum point 4 results 4 1 water infiltration and dissipation the water infiltrating with time is shown in fig 4 in order to eliminate the influence of initial moisture content difference the increment of volumetric moisture content is selected for analysis in the paper the number a and b represent the water injection period and water cut off period in simulated rainfall test c and d are the water injection period and water cut off period in saturated infiltration test the water didn t travel to the position of exploratory well 4 during the whole test process as shown in fig 4 a the simulated rainfall test can be divided into three stages according to the curve shape there are 1 i no infiltration 1 ⅱ rapid water absorption and infiltration and 1 iii water flows through and dissipates the saturated infiltration test can be divided into five stages there are 2 i no infiltration 2 ⅱ rapid water absorption and infiltration 2 iii maintaining the peak moisture content 2 ⅳ water dissipates rapidly and 2 ⅴ water dissipates stably in two tests the following infiltration process can be confirmed from the curve shape of phase ii when the wetting front reaches a certain depth the soil unit in front of the wetting front is in dry state it can be soaked rapidly to make the wetting front advance to its position however at this time the containing moisture level of this soil unit is still low the infiltration power is less than the infiltration resistance it can absorb the outflow water from unit behind it to make its containing moisture state increase rapidly in this process the wetting peak almost does not advance water is ceaselessly absorbed and accumulated in this soil unit until its moisture content increment reaches a certain extent close to the peak of moisture content increment the infiltration power can break through infiltration resistance and then the wetting peak will continue to advance this infiltration process is similar to pulse development process li 2010 for simulated rainfall infiltration test seepage directly enters the dissipation period after reaching the peak for saturated infiltration test the constant water head can ensure continuous supply of water and there is a peak holding section 2 iii with same end time to water injection period only when the water supply disappears seepage enters dissipation section of 2 ⅳ and 2 ⅴ in addition the water head condition also affects infiltration and dissipation mode in depth direction in simulated rainfall test the moisture content of section 2 ii for shallow soil increases rapidly and the cliff type dissipation appears after this section the rising rate of section 2 ii for deep soil decreases and there is continuous dissipation after the peak value but there is no such phenomenon in the depth direction for saturated infiltration test the rapid infiltration and dissipation of water in two tests are related to the properties of sandy loess silt are mixed with sand leads to the pore structure is open and connected the permeability and water loss capacity are strong the simulated rainfall infiltration test lasted for 31 days at the end of test fig 4 shows that the moisture meters at 15 m of exploratory well 1 and 8 m of exploratory well 3 just have response to infiltration water for a short time it can be thought the maximum infiltration depths of two exploratory wells are about 15 m and 8 m respectively the water in exploratory well 2 has been flowing through the depth of 6 m but it does not reach the next moisture meter at 10 m the maximum infiltration depth is 6 10 m so the limit infiltration depth of test site appears at the center of test pit exploratory well 1 and the value is 15 m the moisture content increment decreases with the increase of depth the limit infiltration depth of test site in saturated infiltration test is more than 26 m thickness of sandy loess layer at the end of water injection period whole sandy loess layer is soaked and the peak value of moisture content increment at each depth is equivalent this is different from the in situ infiltration test results of clayey silt loess huang et al 2011 and yao et al 2012 investigated and expounded the infiltration and collapsibility law in the depth direction by in situ tests in sites with large thickness clayey silt loess they thought that water infiltrating is easy in shallow soil and the self weight pressure of shallow soil increases with the increase of saturation the deep soil will collapse under the increased overlying soil self weight pressure when it is first infiltrated with the shallow soil continues to absorb water and water infiltrating the deep soil will collapse again under the double effects of the increase of its moisture content and overlying soil self weight this cycle repeats and leads to multiple collapsibility of soil at different depths collapsing makes soil compacted and pore gas pressure increase there is more obvious compaction effect in deeper soil and its pore gas is discharged more difficultly the water infiltrating becomes gradually difficult with the increases of depth therefore it is difficult to experience almost same saturation for soil in a large depth range but for sandy loess site the soil at a certain depth can reach the peak moisture content quickly the upper soil has been in the state of peak moisture content when the deeper soil is first infiltrated so the collapsibility mainly occurs in the process of first infiltration of water although the collapsibility also makes the soil compacted there is no secondary collapsibility because the sand inclusion of loess makes that it is easy for pore gas to be discharged the influence of compaction on permeability is limited and the infiltration capacity isn t obvious attenuation with the depth the variation of residual moisture content after water dissipation doesn t show a consistent law with depth and the water holding capacity of each depth soil is unordered during 200 400 days the residual moisture content of 0 7 m rises the analysis shows that this period is from march to september in the next year which is in the rainy season in northern shaanxi and 0 7 m is the influence depth of atmospheric rainfall in that year 4 2 wetting front and moisture content increment distribution fig 5 is the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content increment in simulated rainfall infiltration test the infiltrating consists of vertical and horizontal seepage the vertical infiltration originates from gravity and suction and the horizontal infiltration is from suction the water head pressure also acts on the vertical and horizontal infiltration but the level is very limited the distribution of infiltration rate and the shape of infiltration zone are decided by water supply soil properties suction gravity and infiltration boundary fig 5 a shows that the wetting front is flat and has a shape of like funnel which is different from the ellipse shape in clayey silt loess site li 2010 yao et al 2012 this difference is mainly own to soil properties during the water injection period the water supply by perforated water pipe makes infiltration uniform in the plane of test pit and the bottom of wetting front is relatively gentle when entering the water cut off period the heterogeneity of permeation gradually becomes obvious the infiltration rate in center of test pit is faster than that in other positions and the shape of wetting front between exploratory well 1 and 2 transits to the cone funnel because when consider the homogeneous stratum the infiltration concentration and ratio between horizontal and vertical infiltration force decrease with the increase of depth in addition the boundary effect is smaller in near the center of test pit the center of test pit is the symmetry axis of infiltration area with shape of ellipse and the infiltration rate and depth are the largest yao et al 2012 in this study the influence of local plane heterogeneity of stratum at the exploratory well 1 also intensified the phenomenon it is also due to the factor of the relative value of infiltrating driving force in two directions the lateral infiltration of sandy loess site is small but the vertical infiltration is obvious the wetting front surface at the boundary of test pit is smooth infiltration spreads in vertical direction and horizontal direction with a infiltration angle of about 10 in fig 5 b the shape of equipotential lines of moisture content increment at the end of test is similar to that of wetting front the moisture content increment gradually decreases with the increase of depth fig 6 is the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content increment in saturated infiltration test the wetting front is still funnel shaped compared with simulated rainfall infiltration the cone shaped wetting front near the center of test pit is gentler and the difference of plane infiltration is slightly smaller the constant water head has water head pressure at the infiltration interface horizontal infiltration is also affected by water head pressure besides suction factor similarly the vertical infiltration is affected by water head pressure gravity and suction therefore the permeability rates in both directions are higher than those of simulated rainfall infiltration the vertical infiltration is significantly faster than horizontal infiltration but the diffusion ratio in both directions still remains about 10 infiltration angle the results in fig 6 b and c are equipotential lines of moisture content increment at 8d and 18d the last day of water injection period a like saturated water rich zone is formed within 7 m under the ground surface at 8d the moisture content increment in the zone is basically equal to experienced peak moisture content increment but its saturation is only 47 64 and the considerable volume of soil pores isn t filled with water fully because the inflow and outflow of water in the pores have reached a balance at the moment for this kind of loess the pores that are not invaded by seepage water are closed pores or small pores which are difficult to open for water and gas circulation and the volume proportion is about 40 under the water rich zone is the unsaturated permeability zone and the moisture content increment decreases with the increase of depth when the infiltration reaches 18 d the sandy loess in the whole depth range is nearly saturated only near the contact interface between q3 sandy loess and q2 loess the moisture content increment decreases slightly in addition local high moisture content zones with strong water holding capacity are alternately distributed with depth red equipotential lines in the figure the phenomenon that moisture content change of sandy loess doesn t decrease with depth in saturated infiltration is different from ordinary loess which is more unfavorable to engineering design and should be paid enough attention 4 3 infiltration rate as shown in fig 7 the regression analysis method based on tests data was introduced to determine the relationship between infiltration time infiltration rate and travel distance of wetting front data in south of exploratory well 3 wasn t be used to analyze due to the influence of boundary the function form with the best fitting effect was chosen it can be known that the infiltration rate decreases with the travel distance of wetting front as a power function formula 1 where ν is the infiltration rate ν 0 represents the infiltration rate of undisturbed soil on the ground surface b is the attenuation coefficient the parameters ν 0 and b are mainly related to soil properties and infiltration conditions corresponding to the function of infiltration rate the infiltration time also follows a power function relationship with the travel distance of wetting front 1 v v 0 z b liu et al 2004 and yao et al 2012 carried out in situ infiltration tests saturated infiltration condition of two clayey silt loess sites in engineering geological zone i the infiltration rate function in this paper is similar to the results proposed by yao et al 2012 but for saturated infiltration test in our study ν 0 is 2 57 9 52 m day and the conversion result is 3 0 11 0 10 3 cm s b is 0 20 0 52 the former is larger than the result 1 16 10 3 cm s of yao et al 2012 and the latter is less than the result 0 46 in yao et al s tests 2012 liu et al 2004 only gave the average vertical permeability rate of 1 61 10 4cm s the values are 3 66 10 4 cm s and 2 3 10 3 cm s respectively in yao et al s tests 2012 and our tests therefore compared with the clayey silt loess site although the infiltration rate function form of sandy loess site is same to that the infiltrating in sandy loess site is easier and the infiltration rate attenuates more slowly with depth water supply also significantly affects the infiltration rate and the average vertical permeability rate of simulated rainfall infiltration is only 7 6 10 4 cm s the vertical infiltration rates under two in situ conditions all are greater than the loess element vertical saturation permeability coefficient of 3 86 10 5 cm s in laboratory test this indicates that the site permeability is higher than that of soil element itself the spatial variation of soil properties and seepage fissures existing in site are main reasons for the difference 4 4 crack development fig 8 shows the crack development in simulated rainfall infiltration test a continuous crack with width 2 mm was finally formed in 30 60 cm around the test pit the crack development process is as follows 1 crack appears and maintains a certain width in 1 day 2 crack width increases in 2 6 days accompanied that local soil blocks peel off and the crack section becomes irregular 3 crack width does not develop basically but the section irregular process continues in 7 31 days during the whole test period the ground surface of crack side near test pit has slightly collapsible subsidence the crack development mechanism is that the vertical and horizontal infiltration in test pit boundary occurs at the same time under the combined action of suction and gravity the range of horizontal seepage in shallow expands with the increase of depth the soil above the wetting front loses its support due to the collapsible subsidence of soil enveloped inside peak plane these soils tilt towards inside of test pit under itself weight and the crack appears fig 9 is the crack development in saturated infiltration test there is little change during the water cut off period and only the cracks in water injection period are showed in the figure except for the first main crack existed in the stage of simulated rainfall infiltration other four main cracks no 2 3 4 and 5 were formed from near to far and distribute within 5 m outside the test pit the spacing is from dense to sparse and the collapsible subsidence is from large to small but the subsidence value is not obvious the obvious stepped cracks sequence of clayey silt loess site does not appear in this test according to the distance the width of cracks 2 4 increases gradually and that of crack 5 decreases in addition to 5 main cracks there are quite a few local small cracks around the main cracks according the process of time the width of cracks 2 and 3 firstly increases and then decreases that of cracks 4 and 5 always increases the typical development mode of single crack is as follows 1 crack appears and ground surface on both sides of crack collapses unevenly 2 crack expands and the collapsing continues 3 local small cracks appear and cut the soil mass of main cracks collapsing still occurs the nearer cracks bended and closed because of the collapsing and the extrusion effect of farther cracks developing 4 5 collapse deformation fig 10 shows the results of interlayer collapse deformation unit thickness in two tests as mentioned above the lower q2 loess layer with large thickness has no collapsibility in addition the collapse deformation of sandy loess layer is obtained by the layering measurement of single point settlement gauge only placed in this layer therefore the underlying q2 loess has no effect on the collapsible deformation of overlying sandy loess layer the collapsible deformation capacity of sandy loess layer decreases with the increase of depth but the exception exist for individual depth because as we all know the collapsibility is mainly controlled by the open structure characteristics of loess generally due to the influence of historical deposition process the deeper loess layer has denser pore structure see void ratio in table 3 however there may be individual exceptions originated from the local randomness of loess depositing process moreover the collapsibility is also affected by the overlying loess pressure and the greater pressure is accompanied with greater collapsibility under the coupling effect of two factors the actual collapsibility changes with the law mentioned in above along the depth the main collapsible deformation of this kind of site occurs suddenly and keeps a short time with the infiltration and the curve of collapse deformation rate in fig 11 is obviously sharper than that of the traditional loess site yao et al 2012 this indicates that the bonding between sandy loess particles is weaker collapsing of the soil structure in one time is more severe of course the amount and rate of collapse deformation are also related to the infiltration conditions those in simulated rainfall infiltration test are less than in saturated infiltration test after the water injection period of saturated infiltration the water dissipation also brings some settlement deformation for shallow soil as detail view in fig 9 a because the saturation of shallow soil is higher and water fills soil pores in process of soaking and collapsing the pores volume filled with water becomes smaller with the water dissipation which results a small sharp drop in deformation this settlement can also bring negative skin friction to foundation pile therefore the science workers should not only pay attention to the collapsible deformation disaster during soaking period corresponding to the period of water infiltration affected by actual atmospheric rainfall in the next year mentioned in section 4 1 the soil of 0 3 m appears deformation rebound in this period it is caused by the shallow soil pores expansion and ground surface soil floating in process of atmospheric rainfall infiltrating after the water dissipating is finished the pores become narrow and this part of deformation recovers fig 12 is the envelope line of total collapse deformation in ground surface along the main axis on the right of main axis there are both accumulation value of interlayer deformation monitoring and direct obtaining value of settlement mark monitoring approximately equal results in two monitoring methods indicate that the monitoring by buried settlement mark is successful it can be seen that the ground surface deformation is symmetrical along the central axis its funnel shape is consistent to infiltration process the collapse also occurs outside the test pit and varies most acutely near the boundary with the gradual approach to test pit center the differential settlement becomes smaller except for nearby the center of test pit there appears steep drop corresponding to the wetting front the maximum collapsible deformation is in the center of test pit the total collapsibility of simulated rainfall infiltration test is 28 mm and that of saturated infiltration test is 241 5 mm according to the latter the site is self weight collapsible loess site it is judged by the principle of more than 70 mm in technical standard zhu et al 2018 so the disaster caused by collapsibility should be fully considered however according to the former the site collapsibility is only 11 6 of the saturated infiltration the site isn t self weight collapsible loess site and the consideration level of collapsibility disaster should become lower therefore the rainfall infiltration can only activate a small part of site collapse potential the currently widely used saturated collapsibility evaluation method has poor effect on coordinating safety and economy 6d and 31d in fig 12 respectively are the water cut off date and test end date in rainfall infiltration stage 50d and 63d are the water cut off date and stable date of settlement monitoring in saturated infiltration stage the collapse deformation in two conditions mainly occurs in water injection process accounting for 76 93 and 84 95 of their total deformation respectively 5 discussions 5 1 difference between simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration to analyze the difference of permeability and collapse deformation between the conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration more clearly the maximum moisture content increment and maximum collapse deformation of soil layers in two tests were done statistics as shown in table 2 the ratio of maximum moisture content increment in two tests decreases with the increase of depth only in the shallow soil of 3 m the saturation of two cases is close and the ratio is more than 80 compared with the moisture content variation the response of collapse deformation is quite different the collapse deformation ratio of two cases firstly increases and then decreases with depth the maximum ratio is 26 07 and the majority is generally within 10 they are far less than the moisture content increment ratio even for the shallow soil with similar saturation in two cases the collapse response of simulated rainfall infiltration is still very small the non correspondence between the collapse deformation ratio and the moisture content increment ratio under two infiltration conditions indicates that the change of moisture content isn t the only condition for activating collapsibility of sandy loess fully analyzing the special collapsibility mechanism of sandy loess two conditions must be met at the same time to activate the collapse potential fully 1 the change of moisture content is greater than the initial threshold of moisture content increment only when the change of soil moisture content reaches a certain level the softening of bonding contact between soil particles is enough to damage the soil skeleton structure under self weight stress of overlying soil and the collapse deformation occurs rapidly this can be explained by the fact that moisture content variation of soil near limit wetting front in simulated rainfall infiltration test accounts for 24 11 59 78 of that in saturated infiltration test but the collapsibility hardly occurs 2 the retention time of moisture state more than the initial moisture content increment is greater than the initial threshold of hold time combined with the analysis in section 4 1 sandy loess is different from clayey silt loess its bonding between particles is low and the fluidity of water and air in pores is good the collapsing of upper soil has a compaction effect to deep soil but which does not significantly change its air out and water out conditions and there is no multiple collapsing along the depth it can be confirmed from the changes of pore water pressure at different depths in fig 13 the better water holding capacity of q2 loess layer at 26 m makes the pore water pressure change in the infiltration process while the pore water pressure of sandy loess layer at 14 m is almost unchanged it is precisely because of this characteristic that the sandy loess is soaked and lost water easily in simulated rainfall infiltration test the saturation of shallow soil is high after the water flows through the soil rapidly the moisture content appears sudden drop and retention time of high saturation is very short the free water in soil pores does not fully change the thickness of water film adsorbed on soil particles before the soil structure adjustment caused by bonding failure responds fully the water has been lost and the activated collapsibility is also small the reason why there is no large collapse deformation for shallow soil with high saturation in simulated rainfall infiltration test is the lack of stage 2 iii moisture content increment always keeps in peak value therefore the collapsibility mechanism of sandy loess is different from that of clayey silt loess which is the essence of the mismatch between moisture content variation and collapsing response under two conditions 5 2 difference between in situ and laboratory saturated collapse according to the technical standard zhu et al 2018 the collapsibility type of collapsible loess site can be determined by the measured value or calculated value of self weight collapsibility δ zs 2 δ zs β 0 i 1 n δ zsi h i where δ zsi is the self weight collapsibility coefficient of soil layer i h i is the thickness of soil layer i β 0 is correction coefficient varying with soil properties of regions and can be taken according to the engineering geological division zones when the collapsible loess site is used as ground its saturated collapsibility value δ s is evaluated as follows 3 δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i where δ si is the collapsibility coefficient of soil layer i β is correction factor considering the soil stress state under the foundation and regions difference it can be selected according to the depth and engineering geological division zones α is soaking probability of soil in different depth the technical standard considers the relationship between calculated value of self weight collapsibility based on laboratory consolidation test and actual collapsibility in two cases for the judgment of site collapsibility type there is item β 0 for considering the regional geology difference for the evaluation of ground collapsibility value there is item β for considering the influence of depth and regional geology difference item α is set for the influence of soaking probability the reason of setting α is that it is found that in situ tests of clayey silt loess in various regions have the following common characteristics after collecting a lot of reliable tests data when the finite surface water infiltrates naturally in plane range the deeper soil is more difficult to reach saturation there seems exist a certain limit infiltration depth this indicates the soaking probability of soil layer decreases with the increase of depth in addition the saturation of complete saturation state in in situ tests is only close to but can t equal to 100 the complete saturation state is generally thought that saturation is more than 80 however the soil specimens at all depths can be fully saturated in laboratory test in order to correct the difference between in situ test and laboratory test the coefficient of soaking probability α is proposed as mentioned in previous chapters the sandy loess in saturated infiltration test can be approximately saturated in all depths but its saturation about 60 is smaller than that of clayey silt loess only in condition of simulated rainfall infiltration can the soaking probability along depth be distinguished table 3 shows the void ratios and collapsibility coefficients in laboratory tests for soil of exploratory wells 1 3 table 4 shows the collapsibility coefficients in in situ tests and laboratory tests for loess layer of exploratory wells 1 3 it is worth noting that the void ratio is the conversion index based on moisture content density and specific gravity obtained in section 3 2 the collapsibility coefficient of loess layer in laboratory test is the mean value of specimens collapsibility coefficients in this depth range in table 3 the collapsibility coefficient of loess layer in in situ test is calculated based on the interlayer collapse deformation measured by single point settlement gauge in fig 10 specifically it is defined as δ s δ h h 0 where δ s is the collapsibility coefficient of loess layer in situ test δ h is the collapse deformation of loess layer in a certain depth range and h 0 is the thickness of loess layer with natural state in a certain depth range the sandy loess area studied in this paper is junction area of engineering geological division zones ii and ⅳ the β 0 of zones ii and ⅳ are 1 2 and 0 5 respectively in the national standard zhu et al 2018 however as shown in table 4 the collapsibility of sandy loess in this area changes obviously with the depth the greater depth is accompanied with smaller β 0 the average value of β 0 in each depth is 1 1 which is closer to but not equal to the value of zone ii parameter β 0 should reflect the influence correction of regional soil properties difference and depth soil properties difference at the same time based on the above analyses it is found that the infiltration and collapsibility of sandy loess site are obviously different from those of clayey silt loess site in zones ii and ⅳ in view of these we propose a new method to evaluate the site collapsibility type and ground collapsibility value in sandy loess regions 1 the calculation formula of collapsibility value is δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i 2 for the evaluation of site collapsibility type δ s and δ si should be replaced by δ zs and δ zsi β is the correction coefficient considering the influence of regional soil properties difference and the depth soil properties difference according to the depth range 2 0 0 10 m and 0 5 below 10 m and to the top of non collapsible soil layer are selected for β respectively see table 4 when rough estimation is made it can also be considered as a whole in all depths following the form in technical standard taking 1 1 3 for the calculation of ground saturated collapsibility value β considers the factors of regional soil properties difference depth soil properties difference and stress state the value is determined according to the principle 2 and meets other requirements of depth in technical standard zhu et al 2018 4 the soaking probability of sandy loess layer under saturated infiltration hardly changes with depth so α isn t only used to adjust the influence of soaking probability in depth direction but also to adjust the influence of infiltration condition for the judgment of site collapsibility type α is taken as 1 0 for the calculation of ground collapsibility value when long term seepage such as water pipe leakage may occur during the ground service period α is taken as 1 0 when only the possible continuous infiltration of extreme rainfall is considered during the ground service period the collapsibility can be reduced appropriately to ensure safety and economy according to the depth range under foundation α is taken as 1 0 0 5 m 0 8 5 10 m 0 6 10 15 m and 0 5 more than 15 m respectively see table 2 it should be emphasized that the basic template of this method originated from the current technical standard its form can be confirmed by other in situ tests collected in the technical standard zhu et al 2018 for the evaluation of site collapsibility type and calculation of ground collapsibility value in sandy loess site new corrected contents including consideration factors and values of parameters are proposed based on the case study in this paper because the test method in this paper is carried out by restoring the actual conditions as much as possible the results are reliable and the new method has a certain reference value in addition due to the limitation of test methods in other literatures it is rare to obtain collapsibility information by layered measuring to determine the parameters values changing with depth therefore there is also necessary to further study and accumulate data to verify and improve the model in the future 5 3 infiltration boundary and water dissipation two months after water cut off in saturated infiltration test holing and sampling is done at 3 6 m 4 2 m and 5 1 m around the test pit and near the exploratory well 2 in test pit to test moisture content as shown in fig 14 the moisture content at 5 1 m is same as the original moisture content of soil layer and the lateral infiltration doesn t reach this position the moisture content at 3 6 m is greater than the original moisture content of soil layer and the value along the depth is basically equal which indicates the water lateral infiltration has exceeded this range at 4 6 m in interval of 3 2 5 1 m its moisture content is also between the moisture content of two boundary position except for the depth range of 5 m affected by the snowfall in this period the moisture content increases obviously with the depth therefore 4 2 m is the current lateral infiltration boundary less than the distribution range of cracks and its moisture content variation along depth represent the infiltration boundary shape as shown by the solid line in figure the vertical limit infiltration depth of exploratory well 2 is explored and approximate 43 m the whole infiltration boundary can be represented by the combination of solid and dotted line in figure combined with section 4 2 the infiltration angle of sandy loess has almost no change during the infiltration process and it is also about 10 the horizontal infiltration is much smaller than the vertical infiltration and infiltration boundary is consistent with the funnel shape mentioned above near the interface of q3 sandy loess layer and q2 loess layer the slightly low permeability of q2 loess makes the water holding state of the side of sandy loess higher but the influence range is limited and only in the range of 2 m depth so the q2 loess layer doesn t obviously affect the water infiltration law of sandy loess layer fig 15 is the water infiltration and dissipation envelope diagram of exploratory well 1 and 2 in saturated infiltration test the soil layer with more moisture content increment in infiltration process has more water dissipation after infiltration and the leftover moisture content increment is smaller this indicates that the potential water storage space and water loss space of the soil layer is large but the variation of void ratio along depth in table 3 isn t consistent with this the analysis shows that the permeability mode of this sandy loess is special seepage force can produce transport effect to some fine silt particles the loose structure produced by mixture of coarse sand particles and fine silt particles provides passageway condition for migration of small particles the water infiltrating from top to bottom drives some fine particles to sink and accumulate gradually when the fine grained soil accumulates to the local maximum density at a certain position too much fine grained soil agglomerates and blocks the transport passageway the fine grained soil no longer moves under the seepage force at this time the water storage space at this position is the smallest and the change of moisture content in infiltration process is the smallest but due to the good water holding capacity of fine grained soil the water loss capacity of this location in water dissipation process becomes weak and the residual moisture content increment is the largest when the water passes through this position the next cycle of soil particle transportation and accumulation begins this repeated circulation makes the water infiltrating and advancing in form of layers the moisture content increase in infiltration process and moisture content dissipation after infiltration also show layered feature it can be confirmed by the moisture content test results of original stratum before infiltration and stratum experienced infiltration as shown in the right side of fig 15 the moisture content of soil layer experienced infiltration presents layered distribution however the layered distribution characteristic of moisture content does not appear in original stratum these facts were also directly observed by eyes during two times excavating exploratory wells stages before and after infiltration the process of water dissipation of sandy loess is also accompanied by settlement deformation and the previous studies do not pay attention to the process of water dissipation fig 16 shows the water dissipation rate of exploratory wells 1 3 the date in figure starts from water cut off period of saturated infiltration test the water dissipation is very fast at the beginning of water cut off and it gradually slows down with passage of time about at 100 d the water dissipation rate tends to be stable the relationship between water dissipation rate and time is not related to the depth and horizontal position the partial coefficients of water dissipation functions of three exploratory wells are close to each other and they are approximately same exponential function table 5 shows the information of total settlement settlement in soaking period and settlement in water dissipation period for exploratory wells 1 3 the settlement value caused by water dissipation is larger within the depth of 3 m and smaller in deeper soil however according to the settlement proportion the proportion of water dissipation settlement in total settlement firstly decreases and then increases with the depth for the deeper soil more than 10 m the proportion is prominent therefore for this kind of sandy loess site we should not only pay attention to the damage of collapsible deformation the damage of deformation caused by water dissipation should not be also ignored in addition we should pay special attention to the problem of time effect although the value of water dissipation deformation is small it lasts for a long time especially for the pile foundation the quite small trend of soil settlement is enough to cause considerable negative skin friction long lasting time results it is difficult to reach the balance of pile soil interaction in a short time to make the negative skin friction disappear this is different from the negative skin friction caused by short term sudden collapse therefore the spatiotemporal variation rules and adverse effects of water dissipation deformation should be taken into important account to the engineering design of such site in the future 6 conclusion in this paper the permeability and collapsibility characteristics of sandy loess in the transition zone of northern loess plateau were studied by in situ tests and laboratory tests including the conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration the main conclusions are as follows 1 the simulated rainfall infiltration can be divided into three stages the limit infiltration depth of test site is 15 m and the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content variation are funnel shaped the moisture content variation decreases with the increase of depth there appears a continuous crack around the test pit and the crack development mode is appearing expanding and keeping 2 the saturated infiltration can be divided into five stages the wetting front and equipotential lines of moisture content variation are funnel shaped the whole sandy loess layer is close to saturation the compaction effect of upper soil collapsing on lower soil can t change the air out and water out conditions of loess pores and there is no phenomenon of multiple collapsibility varying with depth there are four new continuous cracks around the test pit the crack development mode is appearing expanding local small cracks cutting the main cracks and the later cracks development makes the early cracks have trend of bending and closing 3 the infiltration rate decreases with the travel distance of wetting front as a power function the infiltration rate of sandy loess site is much higher than that of clayey silt loess site and is also higher than the permeability coefficient of sandy loess element the total collapsible deformation of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration are 28 mm and 241 5 mm respectively the site types evaluated by collapsibility value under two infiltration conditions are different and rainfall infiltration can only activate a small part of site collapse potential collapse deformation occurs both inside and outside the test pit the deformation envelope along axis is funnel shaped and its changing near boundary of test pit is the most acute 4 the moisture content variation ratio and collapse deformation ratio of soil layer in the same position under two infiltration conditions has non correspondence the collapsing mechanism of sand loess is special two conditions must be met at the same time to fully activate the collapse potential one is that the moisture content variation is more than the initial collapse threshold of moisture content increment another is that the moisture state more than the initial moisture content increment must keep for enough time 5 the collapsibility type evaluation and ground collapsibility value evaluation of sandy loess site can be carried out according to a new method the calculation formula of collapsibility value is δ s i 1 n α β δ si h i when judging the collapsibility type of site the coefficient β is 2 0 0 10 m 0 5 more than 10 m it is also considered at whole depth β is taken as 1 1 for saturated infiltration the soaking probability coefficient α is 1 0 when rainfall infiltration is considered 1 0 0 5 m 0 8 5 10 m 0 6 10 15 m and 0 5 more than 15 m are taken for α according to the depth range under foundation 6 the permeability mode of sandy loess is special and the driving effect of seepage force on fine particles changes the original structure of soil which makes the soil water holding capacity in infiltration process and soil water loss capacity in dissipation process distribute in layers the water dissipation also produces settlement deformation and lasts for a long time its rate reduces with time as exponential function the adverse effect of water dissipation deformation on ground and pile foundation should be paid full attention credit authorship contribution statement yongguo yao conceptualization

coastal plain stream located in the southeastern u s fdom from litter leachate and sodium chloride nacl were injected into the stream under base flow conditions with different flow rates on three separate occasions over a 3 month period field measurements showed that fdom and nacl exhibited different anomalous dynamics characterized by the peak and tailing behaviors of concentration breakthrough curves btc indicating that the transport of fdom was regulated more by physical retention and or biogeochemical recycling than that of nacl the preferential removal of humic fluorescence

kellerman et al 2014 catalán et al 2016 hu et al 2016 xu and guo 2018 garcía et al 2019 and migration of nutrients and contaminants in the aquatic ecosystem kalbitz and wennrich 1998 mukwaturi and lin 2015 sankar et al 2019a dom dynamics and properties in rivers are affected by various hydrological and biogeochemical processes such as hyporheic exchange schaper et al 2019 stream bed adsorption and desorption ye et al 2018 aschermann et al 2019 water column deposition and resuspension wainright and hopkinson 1997 newbold et al 2005 and photochemical and microbial degradation lu et al 2013 cory et al 2015 sankar et al 2019b the transport and fate of dom in rivers however are not fully understood or reliably quantified drummond et al 2014a although many efforts have been made reviewed below this knowledge gap motivated this study over the last two decades many studies have been conducted to understand the influence of biogeochemical reactivity and hydrological processes properties e g discharge transient storage and channel morphology on the uptake and transport of dom in aquatic systems darracq and destouni 2007 drummond et al 2014b fasching et al 2014 cory et al 2015 catalán et al 2016 mineau et al 2016 marcé et al 2018 wise et al 2019 various methods have been used yielding understandings of dom uptake and transport dynamics applicable to different scales and often not comparable for example at the local scale laboratory incubations are a common method to assess the influences of photochemical and biogeochemical degradation of dom and the results generally highlight the importance of source composition characteristics of dom in mediating the rate of dom degradation fellman et al 2009 lu et al 2013 chen et al 2019 at the drainage network scale hydrological processes and network position i e stream order are found to be the primary drivers of dom transport and removal dom is mostly loaded in low order streams during high flow events and removed by photochemical and biological processes in downstream rivers during low flows creed et al 2015 hansen et al 2016 raymond et al 2016 it is however difficult to quantify the combined and respective importance of hydrology and network position and hydrological residence time may be the only available variable integrating the two processes and quantifiable hosen et al 2021 at the reach scale the uptake and transport of dom are studied mostly through coupling laboratory assays with tracer release experiments however the efforts to date of quantifying the reach scale dom dynamics have focused primarily on measuring the spiraling metrics e g uptake length and rate without disentangling the involving processes mineau et al 2016 it remains a challenge to reliably model the uptake and transport of dom at the reach scale due to the random trapping motion and or reaction processes of dom in various components of the river system organic substances at the reach scale might be trapped in the benthic and hyporheic zones and then be slowly released brunke 1999 drummond et al 2014b meanwhile the hydrological and biogeochemical processes interact and co regulate the uptake and transport of dom for instance hyporheic exchange not only affects the dom source and composition but also prolongs the retention of dom in sediments thereby increasing the opportunity for biological interactions hall et al 2002 aubeneau et al 2015 schaper et al 2019 this complexity makes it difficult in reliably quantifying dom uptake and linking it to the responsible process at the reach scale at present there are few modeling studies focused on the dynamics of dom in streams and the classical advection dispersion equation ade and empirical formulas are mostly used to roughly estimate the dom concentration i e dissolved organic carbon doc harvey 2016 in addition the one dimensional transport with inflow and storage otis model as a process based deterministic model has also been successfully applied to simulate the migration behavior of reactive solutes such as nitrogen phosphorous nutrients and dissolved metal elements in rivers gooseff et al 2004 caruso et al 2008 johnson et al 2015 however the deterministic mechanism models usually require detailed mapping of all dominant processes and controlling factors which makes it difficult in capturing the complex uptake and transport of dom in streams affected by various hydro biogeochemical processes this study is the first attempt to apply the fractional derivative model fdm a promising stochastic model metzler and klafter 2000 as an alternative of the deterministic mechanism models to interpret the uptake and transport of dom in streams at the reach scale stochastic models to our best knowledge have seldomly been applied to quantify dom dynamics although they have been applied to model solute transport in streams and rivers boano et al 2014 for example drummond et al 2014a 2014b utilized a continuous time random walk ctrw model to appropriately capture the retention and transport of fine particles in pastoral streams another promising stochastic model for quantifying the fate and transport of colloids in water is the fdm zhang et al 2017 yu et al 2019 where the fractional order derivative which expands the integer order derivative in describing the long range in space and or time variation of pollutant mass and or flux can capture nonlocal i e upscaling transport processes the fdms with a few parameters can well characterize the temporal variation in non markov processes due to solute retention or delayed transport and or the non local spatial correlation due to super diffusion along preferential flow paths metzler and klafter 2000 meerschaert et al 2008 sun et al 2011 wei et al 2017 previous studies have shown that dom dynamics are scale dependent in both time and space e g creed et al 2015 and therefore can show the characteristics of the non markov process and or spatial non locality this study includes three successive components firstly dom leached from litter and a conservative solute sodium chloride nacl were co injected into a second order forested coastal plain stream in the southeastern united states u s dom was measured using an in situ fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom sensor fdom is a sub pool of dom and the source composition characters of fdom are commonly used to infer the source and quality of dom in aquatic environments lu et al 2014 2015 chen et al 2021 hansen et al 2016 fdom is also commonly used as a surrogate for dissolved organic carbon doc in high resolution freshwater monitoring studies because fdom can be directly measured by high frequency in situ sensors and usually shows high correlations with doc e g howard et al 2021 the breakthrough curves btcs of fdom and nacl were measured at a high temporal resolution with data loggers and stream water samples along btcs were collected to analyze doc concentrations secondly a tempered fractional advection dispersion reaction stochastic model tfadrm was constructed to simulate the observed btcs of nacl and natural fdom thirdly fdom spiraling metrics were estimated and analyzed from the experimental data otis model fitting results and tfadrm fitting results using various approaches including the mass balance method hereafter referred to as the btc integrated approach tank et al 2008 and the model parameter method runkel 2007 the simulation results of tfadrm were compared to those from the otis model to check the performance of tfadrm 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our study reach is located in mayfield creek 32 965453 n 87 408953 e alabama which is a second order coastal plain stream situated within the talladega national forest in southeastern u s fig 1 the study area is within the subtropical climate zone the annual mean temperature is 15 and the annual mean precipitation is 672 mm mayfield creek flows northward into the black warrior river that eventually empties itself in the gulf of mexico the watershed area is 17 52 km 2 and the watershed slope is gentle 0 to 1 the average annual discharge of mayfield is 0 308 m 3 s sims 2010 the dominant land cover is forest 95 including hard woods e g oak hickory sweetgum and dogwood and pines e g longleaf shortleaf yellow and loblolly shang 2019 the watershed soil is moderately well drained fine sandy loam and streambed sediments are mainly sandy particles comprising quartz illite montmorillonite and kaolinite 2 2 experimental design and sample collection an 80 meter long stream channel was selected for the tracer experiments figure s1 supplementary material the first 5 15 m section of the study reach is a relatively deep water zone about 1 m in depth under base flow conditions with the presence of woody debris and gravels the water depth decreases rapidly from 1 m to 0 4 m in the 15 30 m section within the 30 80 m section the water level ranges from 0 4 to 0 15 m and the streambed is flat with a relatively constant stream width three field experiments were conducted under different flow conditions on september 3rd november 15th and december 25th 2016 respectively dom leachate and the conservative tracer nacl were co injected into the most upstream point of the studied reach and the btcs were measured 80 m downstream fdom injectate was prepared from leaching experiments to best simulate terrestrial fdom from the study watershed fallen leaves from oak sweetgum and pine near the riverbanks were collected and soaked with the stream water for one to two weeks under a bridge during each experiment the leachate was filtered through a mesh screen with the mesh size of 0 037 mm into a 120 l container the doc and fdom of the leachate were measured see detailed descriptions in section 2 3 for the three tracer releasing experiments different masses of nacl 350 g 150 g and 150 g were added to the filtered leachate the experiments lasted 120 min with a 1 minute recording interval of which the first 30 min showed background values field collected grab samples from the december experiment were collected from the tracer mixture as well as the ambient stream water samples before and during the experiments at downstream at time t 0 10 20 30 50 and 70 min 2 3 biogeochemical parameters the doc concentration was determined using a shimadzu toc v total organic carbon analyzer following the method described in detail by shang et al 2018 a calibration curve was constructed for each run using a potassium hydrogen phthalate solution the instrumental baseline was evaluated by five carbon free ultrapure water samples for each run and the measurement accuracy was examined regularly using a seawater reference standard hansell laboratory http yyy rsmas miami edu groups biogeochem crm html replicate measurements were assessed by two to three randomly selected samples in each run yielding the relative standard deviation of less than 3 69 chloride concentrations were measured using an ion chromatograph dionex dx 600 and the relative standard deviation of replicate measurements was lower than 1 96 dom optical measurements followed the method described in detail by chen et al 2019 briefly the absorbance reading was collected from the wavelength of 190 nm to 670 nm at a 1 nm interval on a uv 1800 shimadzu spectrophotometer three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were obtained on a horiba jobin yvon fluoromax 3 spectrometer with the excitation wavelength from 240 nm to 500 nm by a 5 nm interval and the emission wavelength from 280 nm to 538 nm for every 3 nm the eems were corrected for the inner filter effect blanks and manufacturer s corrections before raman normalization the parallel factor parafac analysis was applied to statistically separate the complex eem mixture into dom components following the method described in stedmon et al 2003 this analysis was carried out in matlab with dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 and split half analysis and random initialization were used 2 4 otis model the otis model is commonly used to characterize conservative and reactive solutes in streams and rivers bencala 1983 the otis model simplifies the river system into two modules namely the river channel and transient storage zone and includes several physical and chemical processes such as advection dispersion single rate mass exchange lateral inflow and first order decay runkel 1998 femeena et al 2020 a detailed description of the otis model is shown in section s 2 1 supplementary material 2 5 stochastic model development the fdms had been widely used to model anomalous transport in which the tempered fractional advection dispersion model tfadm is promising to characterize the retention effect of solutes in immobile phases especially the pre asymptotic transport meerschaert et al 2008 zhang 2010 1a c x t t β c x t t g t l ad c x t β g t m 0 δ x 1b c s x t 0 t g t s c x s d s where c m l3 and cs m l3 are the concentration for chemicals in the open channel and the storage zone respectively the symbol denotes convolution g t t e λ τ α τ α 1 γ 1 α d τ is the memory function which reflects the retention effect of immobile zones to solutes δ is the dirac delta function l ad d 2 x 2 v m x denotes the advection dispersion operator where d l2 t is the dispersion coefficient and v m l t is the model flow velocity m 0 m is the initial mass in the mobile phase since the tracers were added to the mobile zone initially and β t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient defined as the ratio of the immobile mass to the mobile mass at equilibrium a large β means a higher volumetric proportion of the immobile region or mass in the system leading to a heavier late time tail in the tracer btc lu et al 2018 it is noteworthy that an exponential memory function g t s e s t in model 1a leads to the classical ade model with a retardation factor 1 β and a power law memory function in model 1 leads to the standard time fractional advection dispersion equation the tfadm 1 cannot model the solute mass decline due to chemical biological reactions hence we propose the following tempered fractional advection dispersion reaction model tfadrm for characterizing both solute retention and biochemical reaction processes of dom in streams 2a c tot x t t β e λ t α e λ t c tot x t t α β λ α c tot x t l ad c tot x t s x t where c tot x t is the total concentration of dom or fdom including the mobile and immobile phase concentrations s x t is the reaction term which captures the effect of irreversible biochemical processes e g microbial reactivity and or photochemical degradation on the dom or fdom concentration in streams α t α denotes the caputo fractional derivative with index α dimensionless 0 α 1 and λ 1 t is the truncation parameter which controls the time for the power law distributed residence times to transfer to the exponentially distributed residence times and mainly affects the skewness of the btc s late time tail meerschaert et al 2008 in this study the first order reaction was employed namely s x t k r c tot x t where k r 1 t represents the uptake rate of fdom due to the biological and chemical processes in eq 2a the index α decreases with the increase in the degree of solute retention in the stream system such as hyporheic zone sediments aquatic plants etc hence a smaller α captures the longer retention for solutes in the stream the caputo fractional derivative is selected here since this definition allows to use the standard initial condition in the model voller and paola 2010 wei et al 2017 garrard et al 2017 it should be noted that the field experiments measured the in stream fdom concentration mobile phase and in eq 2a the tracer concentration in mobile phase is governed by the following equation 2b c m x t t β e λ t α e λ t c m x t t α β λ α c m x t l ad c m x t β c m x 0 t e λ t τ α 1 γ α d τ s r x t where c m x t is the fdom concentration in the mobile phase and the reaction term in mobile phase is s r x t k r c m x t cm used in tfadrm 2b represents the solute concentration in the mobile phase which is equivalent to the concentration in the open channel i e c in the otis model s1 cim in tfadrm represents the solute concentration in the immobile phase i e solutes trapped in various storage zones which is the same as cs in the otis model s1 ctot is the total solute concentration in both the mobile phase and the immobile phase therefore c tot c m u m c im u im u m u im where u m and u im are the volumes of the mobile and immobile phases respectively in the stream system in this study the sensors were placed in the river channel and hence the measured fdom and cl concentrations were cm in the tfadrm model 2 and c in the otis model s1 notably compared with the classic ade the tfadrm 2 has an extra term on the left hand side the time fractional derivative term acting as the retardation coefficient when the index α is close to 1 therefore the relationship between the model flow velocity and the actual flow velocity va can be approximated by v m 1 β v a where the best fit index α is relatively large see section 3 2 6 spiraling metrics simulation spiraling metrics are often used to evaluate the ability of streams and rivers to migrate and transfer nutrients including the uptake length sw l and transfer coefficient vf l t stream solute workshop 1990 claessens et al 2010 3 s w u k c 4 v f h k c where u l t is the mean stream velocity kc t 1 is the uptake rate coefficient for net removal from the water column and h l is the stream depth uptake length represents the characteristic downstream distance traveled per unit removal of mass from the water column boano et al 2014 which is affected by various hydro biogeochemical processes properties of the stream including hyporheic exchange substrate composition channel type and morphology light availability and microbial degradation johnson et al 2015 notably u in eq 3 represents the average transport velocity for solutes which is usually a constant for a given reach the actual flow velocity va can change in time and space the model flow velocity vm in eq 2 is the upscaled velocity for solutes which also accounts for the retardation effect due to the transient storage zone and hence vm can be larger than va the btc integrated approach usually uses the ratio of background corrected mass of the solute and conservative tracer passing over a station to calculate the dom uptake metrics tank et al 2008 the spiraling metrics can also be estimated using numerical model parameters hereafter referred to as the model parameter method both methods are described in detail in section s 3 1 in supplementary material 3 results 3 1 fluorescent dom in our study site fdom had a positive correlation with the doc concentration shown by figure s2 supplementary material optical measurements provided basic information on the source compositional properties of fdom in mayfield five fluorescence components denoted as c1 to c5 of the dom samples were identified using the parafac method as shown in table 1 and figure s3 in supplementary material c1 excitation emission maxima 250 330 436 nm represented terrestrial humic substances and c2 excitation emission maxima 260 360 508 nm was red shifted relative to c1 corresponding to terrestrial fulvic humic dom c3 excitation emission maxima 305 388 nm was identified as microbially derived dom c4 excitation emission maxima 280 316 nm and c5 excitation emission maxima 250 290 352 nm denoted proteinous compounds correspond to tyrosine like dom and tryptophane like dom respectively as shown in fig 2 humic dom dominated the pool of fdom in mayfield with c1 c2 and c3 accounting for 75 58 3 71 of fdom and proteinous dom is less abundant accounting for 8 81 5 34 of fdom compared to the background value which is the value at time t 0 the samples measured at 10 min which is the peak arrival time had a higher percentage of protein like dom c4 and a lower percentage of the other components the percentage of tryptophan like c5 a bioreactive fluorescent component kept rising after 10 min and the percentage of c5 20 32 at 70 min was higher than its background value 16 20 3 2 tracer btcs and model results this section shows the cl and dom experimental results and the numerical results simulated by the tfadrm 2 and the otis model s1 the sc data measured downstream were converted to cl concentrations since there is a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and fdom concentration fluorescence intensity was taken as a substitute for fdom concentration the cl and fdom concentrations were then normalized by their in stream injected concentrations c 0 note that the background i e the ambient concentration was subtracted before the normalization since the tracers injected into the stream were diluted c 0 is calculated by the following equation 5 c 0 m v d c inject v 1 q δ t v 1 where m m is the tracer mass injected into the stream vd l3 is the diluted volume of the tracer injected into the stream during time δ t t which is 5 s in this study by neglecting the impact of dispersion on dilution because of the relatively small δ t stream transport is usually advection dominated even in base flow cinject m l3 denotes the injected tracer concentration in the barrels v 1 l3 represents the volume of barrels which is 120 l in this study and q l3 t is the stream discharge values of these parameters are listed in table 2 and table s1 supplementary material the field measurements and the best fit numerical results for fdom and cl fig 3 reveal the impact of the hydrologic and biochemical processes on the tracer uptake and transport in the study stream the fdom btcs differ apparently from the cl btcs in the peak concentration and late time tailing first the peak concentration of fdom was lower than that of cl the estimated mass recovery rate of fdom and cl for each experiment shows that the recovery rate of fdom was much lower than that of cl second as shown in the subplots in fig 3 the fdom btcs exhibited a heavier late time tail than the cl btcs suggesting that fdom and cl had different residence time distributions and or cycling pathways in the stream the best fit btcs using the tfadrm 2 and the otis model s1 are shown in fig 3 wherein the parameters were fitted by the trial and error approach which are listed in table 3 and table 4 respectively it should be noted that several physical parameters in the tfadrm i e d and v and otis models i e a as q d and α c were determined by the field measurements and the observed cl data which were not changed in fdom data fitting the otis model fits well the cl and fdom early arrivals and peaks in the btcs but for the tailing portion t 2000 s the concentrations of cl and fdom simulated by the otis model were underestimated as shown in the log log subplots in fig 3 the overall shape of the fdom and cl btcs including especially the peak and the late time tail can be well fitted by the tfadrm 2 parameters α and λ are related to the falling limb and the late time tail characteristics of the btc as shown in table 3 the parameters α and λ used to quantify fdom retention sorption are smaller than those for cl in situ ambient environmental conditions varied across the three experiments which could lead to differences in biogeochemical effects on the fdom concentration resulting in different reaction rates kr as modeled fig 4 shows the temporal variation of the ratio of the normalized concentration for fdom and cl which was calculated as c ratio t c fdom t c 0 f d o m c c l t c 0 c l where c 0 f d o m and c 0 c l are the injected concentrations of fdom and cl respectively during the periods of the rising and falling limbs of the btcs from 500 s to 1400 s most of the values of c r a t i o were less than 1 when the time was larger than 2000 s c r a t i o became larger than 1 fig 5 shows the influences of solute retention due for example to hyporheic exchange and remobilization and the first order biochemical reaction on the btc of fdom by comparing the numerical results of models ade tfadm 1 and tfadrm 2 3 3 fdom spiraling metrics the resultant fdom spiraling metrics calculated by the btc integrated approach and model parameter method are shown in section s 3 2 in supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 tailing behavior of natural fdom in the stream we first distinguish the dynamics of fdom and cl by evaluating the temporal evolution of the relative mass between fdom and cl fig 3 shows that the late time btc tail of cl was relatively stable with the slope varying slightly between 4 1 and 4 0 in a log log plot contrarily the fdom s btc contained apparent noise at the later times and the slope of btc varied between 2 4 to 1 0 in the log log plot from the tfadrm results the parameters α and λ used to describe cl transport were larger than those for fdom first a smaller α captures stronger tracer retention in the immobile phase hence compared with cl a higher mass fraction of fdom might be trapped by sediment and or consumed by biotic actions as mayfield fdom is heavily dominated by humic like compounds that are usually biorefractory but have a strong affinity to mineral surfaces sediment retention is likely the primary responsible mechanism for fdom retention the heavy tailed transport behavior of fdom therefore may be related to adsorption desorption to streambed sediments and suspended particles and or hyporheic exchange which have been identified to influence solute transport in streams by various researchers e g packman and brooks 2001 drummond et al 2014b he et al 2016 xu and guo 2018 second 1 λ describes the time when the late time btc decline rate transfers from a power law function to an exponential function which indicates that the distribution of cl trapping times was close to the exponential function metzler and klafter 2000 zhang 2010 it implies that there was no broad distribution for the mass exchange rates for the conservative tracer cl due to physical adsorption desorption in the stream or in other words the transient storage zones in the study reach cannot trap cl longer enough to form a heavy late time btc tail fig 3 shows that although both the otis model and the tfadrm model can capture the btc of the conservative solute the otis model cannot fit the late time btc as well as the tfadrm the measured fdom btc had a lower peak and a heavier late time tail than those of cl in this study stream when simulating fdom uptake and transport the otis model adds the first order decay λ c and λ s in eq s1 of solutes in the stream channel and the storage zone parameter analysis revealed that a larger λ c resulted in a lower peak and a lighter tail in the btc while a larger λ s mainly resulted in a lighter tail in the btc therefore the otis model cannot accurately describe the late time tailing behavior of fdom without adjusting the physical parameters i e a as and α c in contrast tfadrm has two parameters α and λ to control the tailing behavior and therefore it has better performance in charactering long time btc tailing as shown in fig 4 the value of c r a t i o decreased slightly and most of the values were below 1 from 500 s to 1400 s indicating a larger decrease for the fdom concentration than for cl c r a t i o exhibited an obviously rising trend after 2000 s implying a relatively larger storage of fdom than that of cl in the stream the evolution of c r a t i o suggests that the in stream fdom was likely first trapped within the streambed sediments by physical retention and or microbial immobilization and later released slowly this interpretation falls within the notion that sediments exert strong biophysical controls on dom in streams battin et al 2003 arnon et al 2010 newbold et al 2005 drummond et al 2014b since cl and fdom were co injected into the stream they were subject to the same hydraulic processes such as advection dispersion and hyporheic exchange the peak and the late time tail of their btcs however show different attenuation trends between the two solutes this indicates that the same hydrodynamic effects may have different influences on the uptake and transport of fdom and cl due to their different physical and chemical properties wang et al 2016 dultz et al 2018 while the chloride ion has a uniform size and charge dom contains hundreds of thousands of compounds with different molecular sizes in a large mass range of 0 1 100 kda and charges hawkes et al 2019 in addition natural dom is involved in biogeochemical processes in streams e g microbial uptake and release photochemical alterations and mineral sorption as opposed to cl that tends to show a conservative behavior which can contribute to different btc peaks for fdom and cl several processes can explain why fdom and cl have different tailing behaviors first as mentioned above dom is a complex mixture of compounds of various functional groups and molecular masses dom molecular compounds can bind with sediments through neutral sorption ligand exchange e g om with aliphatic or phenolic oh group and acid or polyvalent cation bridging e g om with negatively charged function groups such as coo kaiser and guggenberger 2003 indeed mineral protection is widely considered as the primary mechanism of preserving organic matter in soils and sediments e g kahle et al 2004 helfrich et al 2007 photodegradation is likely limited and insignificant as the study stream is well shaded by riparian plant canopies thus part of the dom pool might remain in the immobile phases e g benthic and or hyporheic zones for a longer time compared to conservative tracers such as cl especially when the immobile phases streambed have complex pore structures additionally some labile dom compounds may be assimilated by microbes and released as another form of dom during the tracer experiments the evolution of fluorescent components along the btc shows a preferential removal of humic fluorescence than protein fluorescence before the peak arrival specifically the percentage of tryptophan like c5 one of the most bioreactive fluorescent components of natural dom kept rising after 10 min and the percentage of c5 20 32 at 70 min was higher than its background value 16 20 fig 2 because humic fluorescence is usually more refractory to biodegradation but more prone to mineral sorption than protein fluorescence chen et al 2019 hu et al 2021 kalbitz et al 2000 this observation suggests that the early removal of fdom was mediated mostly by physical sorption second the velocity distribution in a water column decreases gradually from the water surface to the bottom i e the riverbed but the geochemical reactions are particularly active in the benthic and hyporheic zones aubeneau et al 2015 therefore when the fdom concentration peak arrives in the stream a fraction of the fdom may diffuse into or be adsorbed by the streambed sediment driven by the concentration gradient and turbulence and then experience physical biochemical processes after the fdom peak passes the fdom trapped in the immobile phase sediments or particles is then slowly released i e remobilization for a long time as cl ions are much smaller than average fdom molecules and do not participate in biochemical reactions they can move in and out of the streambed more freely in other words the transport of cl in streams is less affected by benthic environments resulting in a lighter late time btc tail than that for fdom notably the part of fdom that is irreversibly retained or consumed cannot be detected downstream and does not contribute to the late time tailing behavior in addition for the three field experiments the observed fdom btcs exhibited different late time tailing behaviors suggesting the sensitive response of fdom to ambient environmental conditions under which the three experiments were performed e g temperature light particles and microbes in the stream 4 2 spiraling metrics analysis the standard methods for calculating the spiraling metrics e g the btc integrated approach assume that the concentration of nutrients decays exponentially with distance along the stream because a single first order degradation rate was assumed to remove nutrients from the water column boano et al 2014 however the assumption of a single uptake rate may no longer be valid for stream fdom considering the spatiotemporally heterogeneous hydro biochemical properties and the multi component fdom this discrepancy motivated the development of the tfadrm 2 which assumes a tempered stable density for the memory function describing the channel storage zone mass exchange resulting in the fdom concentration declining as a truncated power law function with distance in other words tfadrm considers multiple rates for mass exchange uptake of fdom in streams which can better capture the observed btc late time tail heavier than the exponential function and therefore provide a reasonable estimate of fdom spiraling metrics the validated applicability of tfadrm 2 implies that fdom uptake in streams is a transient process which cannot reach steady even after a long travel time for the simple tfadrm equation 2 with λ 0 i e without truncation in time and k r 0 i e without first order decay the solute s uptake length scales as γ 2 α 1 α β v m t α slower than linear in time where γ denotes the gamma function at the early time t β 1 α 1 while at the late time t β 1 α 1 the uptake length increases linearly in time as α γ α 2 1 α γ 2 α v m t the faster increasing rate of uptake length is due to the decreasing rate of mobile mass decline in time if the solute also experiences first order decay the above mentioned uptake length would be smaller therefore strictly speaking the uptake length scales non stationarily in time which cannot reach stability in natural streams 4 3 insights from tfadrm the light green area in fig 5 which represents the difference between the solutions of ade and tfadm indicates that solute retention can decrease the btc peak and enhance the late time tailing of the btc the blue shaded region between the results of tfadm and tfadrm shows that the first order biochemical reaction may consume the tracer and cause the decline of the btc peak although it does not significantly affect the btc s late time tail although we cannot quantify the relative importance of physical sorption versus biogeochemical photochemical degradation in the current study our model offers great potential to differentiate these processes with additional constraints on degradation and sorption parameters that can be easily determined in the laboratory we will test this hypothesis in the next study with systematic laboratory experiments and model parameter evaluation the simulation results of tfadrm were compared to those of the otis model to check the performance of tfadrm fig 3 combining the field and laboratory measurements with modeling results our results clearly showed the effects of stream bed retention and chemical degradation on transport and transformation of natural dom in the study reach this study demonstrated great potential of stochastic models in understanding processes and mechanisms regulating the fate of natural dom in fluvial ecosystems 5 conclusion this study explored a novel method model to quantify the dynamics of fdom in streams our study site is a coastal plain stream within a forested watershed which is a typical and prevalent fluvial feature in the southeastern region of the u s we conducted three reach scale field transport experiments under base flow conditions of different flow rates the tempered fractional advection dispersion reaction model tfadrm was then proposed to fit the observed btcs these field experiments and stochastic model analysis led to the following three major conclusions which shed light on the interpretation and quantification of hydrological and biogeochemical controls of natural fdom in streams first field experiments showed that fdom and cl exhibited different transport dynamics represented by the peak and late time tailing of the btc due to their different responses to physical and biochemical factors in the stream fdom had a lower peak and a heavier late time tail in the measured btc and a lower overall recovery rate than cl implying that the transport and removal of fdom were more sensitive to ambient environmental variability the preferential removal of humic fluorescence than protein fluorescence before the btc peak suggests that physical sorption was more important than biological degradation in early fdom removal in mayfield second compared with the fdom experimental data and numerical results of the otis model tfadrm is a promising model to describe the fdom transport process in streams at the reach scale therefore the tfadrm model can provide simulation results for better estimating the fdom spiraling metrics in this study when the btc integrate approach was used the otis data underestimated the fdom s uptake length sw because the otis model overestimates the late time mass decline while the tfadrm data led to a sw closer to that calculated from field experiments complex hydrodynamic processes in stream systems affect the fdom spiraling metrics and the model parameter method based on a single mass exchange rate between the open channel and the storage zones tends to underestimate these effects therefore the tfadrm model that can capture time and space dependent changes may provide a more advantageous approach in simulating the transient uptake dynamics and estimating the rapidly changing uptake metrices of stream fdom third model analysis revealed that solute retention and the first order reaction have different effects on the uptake and transport of fdom in the stream solute retention can lower the peak concentration and enhance the late time btc tail for fdom by comparison biochemical reactions tend to consume fdom and thus decrease the btc peak without significantly affecting the late time tailing behavior of the fdom btc credit authorship contribution

4142,dissolved organic matter dom entering the river networks affects aquatic ecosystems yet it remains difficult to quantify the strength of various environmental factors in controlling reach scale uptake and transport of dom this study combined reach scale field experiments and stochastic modeling to investigate the uptake and transport dynamics of natural fluorescent dom fdom in a forested coastal plain stream located in the southeastern u s fdom from litter leachate and sodium chloride nacl were injected into the stream under base flow conditions with different flow rates on three separate occasions over a 3 month period field measurements showed that fdom and nacl exhibited different anomalous dynamics characterized by the peak and tailing behaviors of concentration breakthrough curves btc indicating that the transport of fdom was regulated more by physical retention and or biogeochemical recycling than that of nacl the preferential removal of humic fluorescence than protein fluorescence before the btc peak suggests that physical sorption was more important than biological degradation in early fdom removal at the field site a tempered fractional advection dispersion reaction model tfadrm was proposed to describe the fdom migration process and estimate the fdom spiraling metrics and the resultant metrics were compared to those from conventionally used btc integrated approach results revealed that solute retention can lower the peak concentration and enhance the late time tail of the fdom btc whereas irreversible biogeochemical reaction processes can consume fdom and decrease the btc peak relative to the commonly used otis model tfadrm can better capture the observed btc late time tail by considering multiple rates for the mass exchange uptake of fdom in streams and therefore this study provided a more reasonable estimate of fdom spiraling metrics and transport dynamics at the reach scale keywords fluorescent dissolved organic matter stochastic model physical retention biochemical process spiraling metrics 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom in streams and rivers mediates key biogeochemical processes such as carbon transfers between terrestrial aquatic and atmospheric reservoirs and energy and substrate flows through aquatic food webs newbold et al 2005 battin et al 2009 fellman et al 2009 lu et al 2014 kellerman et al 2014 catalán et al 2016 hu et al 2016 xu and guo 2018 garcía et al 2019 and migration of nutrients and contaminants in the aquatic ecosystem kalbitz and wennrich 1998 mukwaturi and lin 2015 sankar et al 2019a dom dynamics and properties in rivers are affected by various hydrological and biogeochemical processes such as hyporheic exchange schaper et al 2019 stream bed adsorption and desorption ye et al 2018 aschermann et al 2019 water column deposition and resuspension wainright and hopkinson 1997 newbold et al 2005 and photochemical and microbial degradation lu et al 2013 cory et al 2015 sankar et al 2019b the transport and fate of dom in rivers however are not fully understood or reliably quantified drummond et al 2014a although many efforts have been made reviewed below this knowledge gap motivated this study over the last two decades many studies have been conducted to understand the influence of biogeochemical reactivity and hydrological processes properties e g discharge transient storage and channel morphology on the uptake and transport of dom in aquatic systems darracq and destouni 2007 drummond et al 2014b fasching et al 2014 cory et al 2015 catalán et al 2016 mineau et al 2016 marcé et al 2018 wise et al 2019 various methods have been used yielding understandings of dom uptake and transport dynamics applicable to different scales and often not comparable for example at the local scale laboratory incubations are a common method to assess the influences of photochemical and biogeochemical degradation of dom and the results generally highlight the importance of source composition characteristics of dom in mediating the rate of dom degradation fellman et al 2009 lu et al 2013 chen et al 2019 at the drainage network scale hydrological processes and network position i e stream order are found to be the primary drivers of dom transport and removal dom is mostly loaded in low order streams during high flow events and removed by photochemical and biological processes in downstream rivers during low flows creed et al 2015 hansen et al 2016 raymond et al 2016 it is however difficult to quantify the combined and respective importance of hydrology and network position and hydrological residence time may be the only available variable integrating the two processes and quantifiable hosen et al 2021 at the reach scale the uptake and transport of dom are studied mostly through coupling laboratory assays with tracer release experiments however the efforts to date of quantifying the reach scale dom dynamics have focused primarily on measuring the spiraling metrics e g uptake length and rate without disentangling the involving processes mineau et al 2016 it remains a challenge to reliably model the uptake and transport of dom at the reach scale due to the random trapping motion and or reaction processes of dom in various components of the river system organic substances at the reach scale might be trapped in the benthic and hyporheic zones and then be slowly released brunke 1999 drummond et al 2014b meanwhile the hydrological and biogeochemical processes interact and co regulate the uptake and transport of dom for instance hyporheic exchange not only affects the dom source and composition but also prolongs the retention of dom in sediments thereby increasing the opportunity for biological interactions hall et al 2002 aubeneau et al 2015 schaper et al 2019 this complexity makes it difficult in reliably quantifying dom uptake and linking it to the responsible process at the reach scale at present there are few modeling studies focused on the dynamics of dom in streams and the classical advection dispersion equation ade and empirical formulas are mostly used to roughly estimate the dom concentration i e dissolved organic carbon doc harvey 2016 in addition the one dimensional transport with inflow and storage otis model as a process based deterministic model has also been successfully applied to simulate the migration behavior of reactive solutes such as nitrogen phosphorous nutrients and dissolved metal elements in rivers gooseff et al 2004 caruso et al 2008 johnson et al 2015 however the deterministic mechanism models usually require detailed mapping of all dominant processes and controlling factors which makes it difficult in capturing the complex uptake and transport of dom in streams affected by various hydro biogeochemical processes this study is the first attempt to apply the fractional derivative model fdm a promising stochastic model metzler and klafter 2000 as an alternative of the deterministic mechanism models to interpret the uptake and transport of dom in streams at the reach scale stochastic models to our best knowledge have seldomly been applied to quantify dom dynamics although they have been applied to model solute transport in streams and rivers boano et al 2014 for example drummond et al 2014a 2014b utilized a continuous time random walk ctrw model to appropriately capture the retention and transport of fine particles in pastoral streams another promising stochastic model for quantifying the fate and transport of colloids in water is the fdm zhang et al 2017 yu et al 2019 where the fractional order derivative which expands the integer order derivative in describing the long range in space and or time variation of pollutant mass and or flux can capture nonlocal i e upscaling transport processes the fdms with a few parameters can well characterize the temporal variation in non markov processes due to solute retention or delayed transport and or the non local spatial correlation due to super diffusion along preferential flow paths metzler and klafter 2000 meerschaert et al 2008 sun et al 2011 wei et al 2017 previous studies have shown that dom dynamics are scale dependent in both time and space e g creed et al 2015 and therefore can show the characteristics of the non markov process and or spatial non locality this study includes three successive components firstly dom leached from litter and a conservative solute sodium chloride nacl were co injected into a second order forested coastal plain stream in the southeastern united states u s dom was measured using an in situ fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom sensor fdom is a sub pool of dom and the source composition characters of fdom are commonly used to infer the source and quality of dom in aquatic environments lu et al 2014 2015 chen et al 2021 hansen et al 2016 fdom is also commonly used as a surrogate for dissolved organic carbon doc in high resolution freshwater monitoring studies because fdom can be directly measured by high frequency in situ sensors and usually shows high correlations with doc e g howard et al 2021 the breakthrough curves btcs of fdom and nacl were measured at a high temporal resolution with data loggers and stream water samples along btcs were collected to analyze doc concentrations secondly a tempered fractional advection dispersion reaction stochastic model tfadrm was constructed to simulate the observed btcs of nacl and natural fdom thirdly fdom spiraling metrics were estimated and analyzed from the experimental data otis model fitting results and tfadrm fitting results using various approaches including the mass balance method hereafter referred to as the btc integrated approach tank et al 2008 and the model parameter method runkel 2007 the simulation results of tfadrm were compared to those from the otis model to check the performance of tfadrm 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our study reach is located in mayfield creek 32 965453 n 87 408953 e alabama which is a second order coastal plain stream situated within the talladega national forest in southeastern u s fig 1 the study area is within the subtropical climate zone the annual mean temperature is 15 and the annual mean precipitation is 672 mm mayfield creek flows northward into the black warrior river that eventually empties itself in the gulf of mexico the watershed area is 17 52 km 2 and the watershed slope is gentle 0 to 1 the average annual discharge of mayfield is 0 308 m 3 s sims 2010 the dominant land cover is forest 95 including hard woods e g oak hickory sweetgum and dogwood and pines e g longleaf shortleaf yellow and loblolly shang 2019 the watershed soil is moderately well drained fine sandy loam and streambed sediments are mainly sandy particles comprising quartz illite montmorillonite and kaolinite 2 2 experimental design and sample collection an 80 meter long stream channel was selected for the tracer experiments figure s1 supplementary material the first 5 15 m section of the study reach is a relatively deep water zone about 1 m in depth under base flow conditions with the presence of woody debris and gravels the water depth decreases rapidly from 1 m to 0 4 m in the 15 30 m section within the 30 80 m section the water level ranges from 0 4 to 0 15 m and the streambed is flat with a relatively constant stream width three field experiments were conducted under different flow conditions on september 3rd november 15th and december 25th 2016 respectively dom leachate and the conservative tracer nacl were co injected into the most upstream point of the studied reach and the btcs were measured 80 m downstream fdom injectate was prepared from leaching experiments to best simulate terrestrial fdom from the study watershed fallen leaves from oak sweetgum and pine near the riverbanks were collected and soaked with the stream water for one to two weeks under a bridge during each experiment the leachate was filtered through a mesh screen with the mesh size of 0 037 mm into a 120 l container the doc and fdom of the leachate were measured see detailed descriptions in section 2 3 for the three tracer releasing experiments different masses of nacl 350 g 150 g and 150 g were added to the filtered leachate the experiments lasted 120 min with a 1 minute recording interval of which the first 30 min showed background values field collected grab samples from the december experiment were collected from the tracer mixture as well as the ambient stream water samples before and during the experiments at downstream at time t 0 10 20 30 50 and 70 min 2 3 biogeochemical parameters the doc concentration was determined using a shimadzu toc v total organic carbon analyzer following the method described in detail by shang et al 2018 a calibration curve was constructed for each run using a potassium hydrogen phthalate solution the instrumental baseline was evaluated by five carbon free ultrapure water samples for each run and the measurement accuracy was examined regularly using a seawater reference standard hansell laboratory http yyy rsmas miami edu groups biogeochem crm html replicate measurements were assessed by two to three randomly selected samples in each run yielding the relative standard deviation of less than 3 69 chloride concentrations were measured using an ion chromatograph dionex dx 600 and the relative standard deviation of replicate measurements was lower than 1 96 dom optical measurements followed the method described in detail by chen et al 2019 briefly the absorbance reading was collected from the wavelength of 190 nm to 670 nm at a 1 nm interval on a uv 1800 shimadzu spectrophotometer three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were obtained on a horiba jobin yvon fluoromax 3 spectrometer with the excitation wavelength from 240 nm to 500 nm by a 5 nm interval and the emission wavelength from 280 nm to 538 nm for every 3 nm the eems were corrected for the inner filter effect blanks and manufacturer s corrections before raman normalization the parallel factor parafac analysis was applied to statistically separate the complex eem mixture into dom components following the method described in stedmon et al 2003 this analysis was carried out in matlab with dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 and split half analysis and random initialization were used 2 4 otis model the otis model is commonly used to characterize conservative and reactive solutes in streams and rivers bencala 1983 the otis model simplifies the river system into two modules namely the river channel and transient storage zone and includes several physical and chemical processes such as advection dispersion single rate mass exchange lateral inflow and first order decay runkel 1998 femeena et al 2020 a detailed description of the otis model is shown in section s 2 1 supplementary material 2 5 stochastic model development the fdms had been widely used to model anomalous transport in which the tempered fractional advection dispersion model tfadm is promising to characterize the retention effect of solutes in immobile phases especially the pre asymptotic transport meerschaert et al 2008 zhang 2010 1a c x t t β c x t t g t l ad c x t β g t m 0 δ x 1b c s x t 0 t g t s c x s d s where c m l3 and cs m l3 are the concentration for chemicals in the open channel and the storage zone respectively the symbol denotes convolution g t t e λ τ α τ α 1 γ 1 α d τ is the memory function which reflects the retention effect of immobile zones to solutes δ is the dirac delta function l ad d 2 x 2 v m x denotes the advection dispersion operator where d l2 t is the dispersion coefficient and v m l t is the model flow velocity m 0 m is the initial mass in the mobile phase since the tracers were added to the mobile zone initially and β t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient defined as the ratio of the immobile mass to the mobile mass at equilibrium a large β means a higher volumetric proportion of the immobile region or mass in the system leading to a heavier late time tail in the tracer btc lu et al 2018 it is noteworthy that an exponential memory function g t s e s t in model 1a leads to the classical ade model with a retardation factor 1 β and a power law memory function in model 1 leads to the standard time fractional advection dispersion equation the tfadm 1 cannot model the solute mass decline due to chemical biological reactions hence we propose the following tempered fractional advection dispersion reaction model tfadrm for characterizing both solute retention and biochemical reaction processes of dom in streams 2a c tot x t t β e λ t α e λ t c tot x t t α β λ α c tot x t l ad c tot x t s x t where c tot x t is the total concentration of dom or fdom including the mobile and immobile phase concentrations s x t is the reaction term which captures the effect of irreversible biochemical processes e g microbial reactivity and or photochemical degradation on the dom or fdom concentration in streams α t α denotes the caputo fractional derivative with index α dimensionless 0 α 1 and λ 1 t is the truncation parameter which controls the time for the power law distributed residence times to transfer to the exponentially distributed residence times and mainly affects the skewness of the btc s late time tail meerschaert et al 2008 in this study the first order reaction was employed namely s x t k r c tot x t where k r 1 t represents the uptake rate of fdom due to the biological and chemical processes in eq 2a the index α decreases with the increase in the degree of solute retention in the stream system such as hyporheic zone sediments aquatic plants etc hence a smaller α captures the longer retention for solutes in the stream the caputo fractional derivative is selected here since this definition allows to use the standard initial condition in the model voller and paola 2010 wei et al 2017 garrard et al 2017 it should be noted that the field experiments measured the in stream fdom concentration mobile phase and in eq 2a the tracer concentration in mobile phase is governed by the following equation 2b c m x t t β e λ t α e λ t c m x t t α β λ α c m x t l ad c m x t β c m x 0 t e λ t τ α 1 γ α d τ s r x t where c m x t is the fdom concentration in the mobile phase and the reaction term in mobile phase is s r x t k r c m x t cm used in tfadrm 2b represents the solute concentration in the mobile phase which is equivalent to the concentration in the open channel i e c in the otis model s1 cim in tfadrm represents the solute concentration in the immobile phase i e solutes trapped in various storage zones which is the same as cs in the otis model s1 ctot is the total solute concentration in both the mobile phase and the immobile phase therefore c tot c m u m c im u im u m u im where u m and u im are the volumes of the mobile and immobile phases respectively in the stream system in this study the sensors were placed in the river channel and hence the measured fdom and cl concentrations were cm in the tfadrm model 2 and c in the otis model s1 notably compared with the classic ade the tfadrm 2 has an extra term on the left hand side the time fractional derivative term acting as the retardation coefficient when the index α is close to 1 therefore the relationship between the model flow velocity and the actual flow velocity va can be approximated by v m 1 β v a where the best fit index α is relatively large see section 3 2 6 spiraling metrics simulation spiraling metrics are often used to evaluate the ability of streams and rivers to migrate and transfer nutrients including the uptake length sw l and transfer coefficient vf l t stream solute workshop 1990 claessens et al 2010 3 s w u k c 4 v f h k c where u l t is the mean stream velocity kc t 1 is the uptake rate coefficient for net removal from the water column and h l is the stream depth uptake length represents the characteristic downstream distance traveled per unit removal of mass from the water column boano et al 2014 which is affected by various hydro biogeochemical processes properties of the stream including hyporheic exchange substrate composition channel type and morphology light availability and microbial degradation johnson et al 2015 notably u in eq 3 represents the average transport velocity for solutes which is usually a constant for a given reach the actual flow velocity va can change in time and space the model flow velocity vm in eq 2 is the upscaled velocity for solutes which also accounts for the retardation effect due to the transient storage zone and hence vm can be larger than va the btc integrated approach usually uses the ratio of background corrected mass of the solute and conservative tracer passing over a station to calculate the dom uptake metrics tank et al 2008 the spiraling metrics can also be estimated using numerical model parameters hereafter referred to as the model parameter method both methods are described in detail in section s 3 1 in supplementary material 3 results 3 1 fluorescent dom in our study site fdom had a positive correlation with the doc concentration shown by figure s2 supplementary material optical measurements provided basic information on the source compositional properties of fdom in mayfield five fluorescence components denoted as c1 to c5 of the dom samples were identified using the parafac method as shown in table 1 and figure s3 in supplementary material c1 excitation emission maxima 250 330 436 nm represented terrestrial humic substances and c2 excitation emission maxima 260 360 508 nm was red shifted relative to c1 corresponding to terrestrial fulvic humic dom c3 excitation emission maxima 305 388 nm was identified as microbially derived dom c4 excitation emission maxima 280 316 nm and c5 excitation emission maxima 250 290 352 nm denoted proteinous compounds correspond to tyrosine like dom and tryptophane like dom respectively as shown in fig 2 humic dom dominated the pool of fdom in mayfield with c1 c2 and c3 accounting for 75 58 3 71 of fdom and proteinous dom is less abundant accounting for 8 81 5 34 of fdom compared to the background value which is the value at time t 0 the samples measured at 10 min which is the peak arrival time had a higher percentage of protein like dom c4 and a lower percentage of the other components the percentage of tryptophan like c5 a bioreactive fluorescent component kept rising after 10 min and the percentage of c5 20 32 at 70 min was higher than its background value 16 20 3 2 tracer btcs and model results this section shows the cl and dom experimental results and the numerical results simulated by the tfadrm 2 and the otis model s1 the sc data measured downstream were converted to cl concentrations since there is a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and fdom concentration fluorescence intensity was taken as a substitute for fdom concentration the cl and fdom concentrations were then normalized by their in stream injected concentrations c 0 note that the background i e the ambient concentration was subtracted before the normalization since the tracers injected into the stream were diluted c 0 is calculated by the following equation 5 c 0 m v d c inject v 1 q δ t v 1 where m m is the tracer mass injected into the stream vd l3 is the diluted volume of the tracer injected into the stream during time δ t t which is 5 s in this study by neglecting the impact of dispersion on dilution because of the relatively small δ t stream transport is usually advection dominated even in base flow cinject m l3 denotes the injected tracer concentration in the barrels v 1 l3 represents the volume of barrels which is 120 l in this study and q l3 t is the stream discharge values of these parameters are listed in table 2 and table s1 supplementary material the field measurements and the best fit numerical results for fdom and cl fig 3 reveal the impact of the hydrologic and biochemical processes on the tracer uptake and transport in the study stream the fdom btcs differ apparently from the cl btcs in the peak concentration and late time tailing first the peak concentration of fdom was lower than that of cl the estimated mass recovery rate of fdom and cl for each experiment shows that the recovery rate of fdom was much lower than that of cl second as shown in the subplots in fig 3 the fdom btcs exhibited a heavier late time tail than the cl btcs suggesting that fdom and cl had different residence time distributions and or cycling pathways in the stream the best fit btcs using the tfadrm 2 and the otis model s1 are shown in fig 3 wherein the parameters were fitted by the trial and error approach which are listed in table 3 and table 4 respectively it should be noted that several physical parameters in the tfadrm i e d and v and otis models i e a as q d and α c were determined by the field measurements and the observed cl data which were not changed in fdom data fitting the otis model fits well the cl and fdom early arrivals and peaks in the btcs but for the tailing portion t 2000 s the concentrations of cl and fdom simulated by the otis model were underestimated as shown in the log log subplots in fig 3 the overall shape of the fdom and cl btcs including especially the peak and the late time tail can be well fitted by the tfadrm 2 parameters α and λ are related to the falling limb and the late time tail characteristics of the btc as shown in table 3 the parameters α and λ used to quantify fdom retention sorption are smaller than those for cl in situ ambient environmental conditions varied across the three experiments which could lead to differences in biogeochemical effects on the fdom concentration resulting in different reaction rates kr as modeled fig 4 shows the temporal variation of the ratio of the normalized concentration for fdom and cl which was calculated as c ratio t c fdom t c 0 f d o m c c l t c 0 c l where c 0 f d o m and c 0 c l are the injected concentrations of fdom and cl respectively during the periods of the rising and falling limbs of the btcs from 500 s to 1400 s most of the values of c r a t i o were less than 1 when the time was larger than 2000 s c r a t i o became larger than 1 fig 5 shows the influences of solute retention due for example to hyporheic exchange and remobilization and the first order biochemical reaction on the btc of fdom by comparing the numerical results of models ade tfadm 1 and tfadrm 2 3 3 fdom spiraling metrics the resultant fdom spiraling metrics calculated by the btc integrated approach and model parameter method are shown in section s 3 2 in supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 tailing behavior of natural fdom in the stream we first distinguish the dynamics of fdom and cl by evaluating the temporal evolution of the relative mass between fdom and cl fig 3 shows that the late time btc tail of cl was relatively stable with the slope varying slightly between 4 1 and 4 0 in a log log plot contrarily the fdom s btc contained apparent noise at the later times and the slope of btc varied between 2 4 to 1 0 in the log log plot from the tfadrm results the parameters α and λ used to describe cl transport were larger than those for fdom first a smaller α captures stronger tracer retention in the immobile phase hence compared with cl a higher mass fraction of fdom might be trapped by sediment and or consumed by biotic actions as mayfield fdom is heavily dominated by humic like compounds that are usually biorefractory but have a strong affinity to mineral surfaces sediment retention is likely the primary responsible mechanism for fdom retention the heavy tailed transport behavior of fdom therefore may be related to adsorption desorption to streambed sediments and suspended particles and or hyporheic exchange which have been identified to influence solute transport in streams by various researchers e g packman and brooks 2001 drummond et al 2014b he et al 2016 xu and guo 2018 second 1 λ describes the time when the late time btc decline rate transfers from a power law function to an exponential function which indicates that the distribution of cl trapping times was close to the exponential function metzler and klafter 2000 zhang 2010 it implies that there was no broad distribution for the mass exchange rates for the conservative tracer cl due to physical adsorption desorption in the stream or in other words the transient storage zones in the study reach cannot trap cl longer enough to form a heavy late time btc tail fig 3 shows that although both the otis model and the tfadrm model can capture the btc of the conservative solute the otis model cannot fit the late time btc as well as the tfadrm the measured fdom btc had a lower peak and a heavier late time tail than those of cl in this study stream when simulating fdom uptake and transport the otis model adds the first order decay λ c and λ s in eq s1 of solutes in the stream channel and the storage zone parameter analysis revealed that a larger λ c resulted in a lower peak and a lighter tail in the btc while a larger λ s mainly resulted in a lighter tail in the btc therefore the otis model cannot accurately describe the late time tailing behavior of fdom without adjusting the physical parameters i e a as and α c in contrast tfadrm has two parameters α and λ to control the tailing behavior and therefore it has better performance in charactering long time btc tailing as shown in fig 4 the value of c r a t i o decreased slightly and most of the values were below 1 from 500 s to 1400 s indicating a larger decrease for the fdom concentration than for cl c r a t i o exhibited an obviously rising trend after 2000 s implying a relatively larger storage of fdom than that of cl in the stream the evolution of c r a t i o suggests that the in stream fdom was likely first trapped within the streambed sediments by physical retention and or microbial immobilization and later released slowly this interpretation falls within the notion that sediments exert strong biophysical controls on dom in streams battin et al 2003 arnon et al 2010 newbold et al 2005 drummond et al 2014b since cl and fdom were co injected into the stream they were subject to the same hydraulic processes such as advection dispersion and hyporheic exchange the peak and the late time tail of their btcs however show different attenuation trends between the two solutes this indicates that the same hydrodynamic effects may have different influences on the uptake and transport of fdom and cl due to their different physical and chemical properties wang et al 2016 dultz et al 2018 while the chloride ion has a uniform size and charge dom contains hundreds of thousands of compounds with different molecular sizes in a large mass range of 0 1 100 kda and charges hawkes et al 2019 in addition natural dom is involved in biogeochemical processes in streams e g microbial uptake and release photochemical alterations and mineral sorption as opposed to cl that tends to show a conservative behavior which can contribute to different btc peaks for fdom and cl several processes can explain why fdom and cl have different tailing behaviors first as mentioned above dom is a complex mixture of compounds of various functional groups and molecular masses dom molecular compounds can bind with sediments through neutral sorption ligand exchange e g om with aliphatic or phenolic oh group and acid or polyvalent cation bridging e g om with negatively charged function groups such as coo kaiser and guggenberger 2003 indeed mineral protection is widely considered as the primary mechanism of preserving organic matter in soils and sediments e g kahle et al 2004 helfrich et al 2007 photodegradation is likely limited and insignificant as the study stream is well shaded by riparian plant canopies thus part of the dom pool might remain in the immobile phases e g benthic and or hyporheic zones for a longer time compared to conservative tracers such as cl especially when the immobile phases streambed have complex pore structures additionally some labile dom compounds may be assimilated by microbes and released as another form of dom during the tracer experiments the evolution of fluorescent components along the btc shows a preferential removal of humic fluorescence than protein fluorescence before the peak arrival specifically the percentage of tryptophan like c5 one of the most bioreactive fluorescent components of natural dom kept rising after 10 min and the percentage of c5 20 32 at 70 min was higher than its background value 16 20 fig 2 because humic fluorescence is usually more refractory to biodegradation but more prone to mineral sorption than protein fluorescence chen et al 2019 hu et al 2021 kalbitz et al 2000 this observation suggests that the early removal of fdom was mediated mostly by physical sorption second the velocity distribution in a water column decreases gradually from the water surface to the bottom i e the riverbed but the geochemical reactions are particularly active in the benthic and hyporheic zones aubeneau et al 2015 therefore when the fdom concentration peak arrives in the stream a fraction of the fdom may diffuse into or be adsorbed by the streambed sediment driven by the concentration gradient and turbulence and then experience physical biochemical processes after the fdom peak passes the fdom trapped in the immobile phase sediments or particles is then slowly released i e remobilization for a long time as cl ions are much smaller than average fdom molecules and do not participate in biochemical reactions they can move in and out of the streambed more freely in other words the transport of cl in streams is less affected by benthic environments resulting in a lighter late time btc tail than that for fdom notably the part of fdom that is irreversibly retained or consumed cannot be detected downstream and does not contribute to the late time tailing behavior in addition for the three field experiments the observed fdom btcs exhibited different late time tailing behaviors suggesting the sensitive response of fdom to ambient environmental conditions under which the three experiments were performed e g temperature light particles and microbes in the stream 4 2 spiraling metrics analysis the standard methods for calculating the spiraling metrics e g the btc integrated approach assume that the concentration of nutrients decays exponentially with distance along the stream because a single first order degradation rate was assumed to remove nutrients from the water column boano et al 2014 however the assumption of a single uptake rate may no longer be valid for stream fdom considering the spatiotemporally heterogeneous hydro biochemical properties and the multi component fdom this discrepancy motivated the development of the tfadrm 2 which assumes a tempered stable density for the memory function describing the channel storage zone mass exchange resulting in the fdom concentration declining as a truncated power law function with distance in other words tfadrm considers multiple rates for mass exchange uptake of fdom in streams which can better capture the observed btc late time tail heavier than the exponential function and therefore provide a reasonable estimate of fdom spiraling metrics the validated applicability of tfadrm 2 implies that fdom uptake in streams is a transient process which cannot reach steady even after a long travel time for the simple tfadrm equation 2 with λ 0 i e without truncation in time and k r 0 i e without first order decay the solute s uptake length scales as γ 2 α 1 α β v m t α slower than linear in time where γ denotes the gamma function at the early time t β 1 α 1 while at the late time t β 1 α 1 the uptake length increases linearly in time as α γ α 2 1 α γ 2 α v m t the faster increasing rate of uptake length is due to the decreasing rate of mobile mass decline in time if the solute also experiences first order decay the above mentioned uptake length would be smaller therefore strictly speaking the uptake length scales non stationarily in time which cannot reach stability in natural streams 4 3 insights from tfadrm the light green area in fig 5 which represents the difference between the solutions of ade and tfadm indicates that solute retention can decrease the btc peak and enhance the late time tailing of the btc the blue shaded region between the results of tfadm and tfadrm shows that the first order biochemical reaction may consume the tracer and cause the decline of the btc peak although it does not significantly affect the btc s late time tail although we cannot quantify the relative importance of physical sorption versus biogeochemical photochemical degradation in the current study our model offers great potential to differentiate these processes with additional constraints on degradation and sorption parameters that can be easily determined in the laboratory we will test this hypothesis in the next study with systematic laboratory experiments and model parameter evaluation the simulation results of tfadrm were compared to those of the otis model to check the performance of tfadrm fig 3 combining the field and laboratory measurements with modeling results our results clearly showed the effects of stream bed retention and chemical degradation on transport and transformation of natural dom in the study reach this study demonstrated great potential of stochastic models in understanding processes and mechanisms regulating the fate of natural dom in fluvial ecosystems 5 conclusion this study explored a novel method model to quantify the dynamics of fdom in streams our study site is a coastal plain stream within a forested watershed which is a typical and prevalent fluvial feature in the southeastern region of the u s we conducted three reach scale field transport experiments under base flow conditions of different flow rates the tempered fractional advection dispersion reaction model tfadrm was then proposed to fit the observed btcs these field experiments and stochastic model analysis led to the following three major conclusions which shed light on the interpretation and quantification of hydrological and biogeochemical controls of natural fdom in streams first field experiments showed that fdom and cl exhibited different transport dynamics represented by the peak and late time tailing of the btc due to their different responses to physical and biochemical factors in the stream fdom had a lower peak and a heavier late time tail in the measured btc and a lower overall recovery rate than cl implying that the transport and removal of fdom were more sensitive to ambient environmental variability the preferential removal of humic fluorescence than protein fluorescence before the btc peak suggests that physical sorption was more important than biological degradation in early fdom removal in mayfield second compared with the fdom experimental data and numerical results of the otis model tfadrm is a promising model to describe the fdom transport process in streams at the reach scale therefore the tfadrm model can provide simulation results for better estimating the fdom spiraling metrics in this study when the btc integrate approach was used the otis data underestimated the fdom s uptake length sw because the otis model overestimates the late time mass decline while the tfadrm data led to a sw closer to that calculated from field experiments complex hydrodynamic processes in stream systems affect the fdom spiraling metrics and the model parameter method based on a single mass exchange rate between the open channel and the storage zones tends to underestimate these effects therefore the tfadrm model that can capture time and space dependent changes may provide a more advantageous approach in simulating the transient uptake dynamics and estimating the rapidly changing uptake metrices of stream fdom third model analysis revealed that solute retention and the first order reaction have different effects on the uptake and transport of fdom in the stream solute retention can lower the peak concentration and enhance the late time btc tail for fdom by comparison biochemical reactions tend to consume fdom and thus decrease the btc peak without significantly affecting the late time tailing behavior of the fdom btc credit authorship contribution

4143,urban green infrastructure gi such as biofiltration systems also known as bioretention biofilters rain gardens are being increasingly implemented in different parts of the world to enhance urban greening whilst controlling stormwater pollution treatment effectiveness has been shown to be reliant upon the surrounding climate including rainfall patterns e g length of wet and dry weather and temperature plant species play a key role in treatment yet the response of different plant species to pollutant removal under different climatic and environmental conditions is still not fully known this information is pertinent to ensure sustained biofilter performance under a range of conditions this study investigates the change in biofilter nutrient and e coli removal performance in the presence of four plant species canna indica carex appressa ginkgo biloba and miscanthus sinensis with distinct above and below ground characteristics when exposed to wet weather dry weather and cold weather conditions the extent of the decline in nutrient treatment performance following extended drying and under cold conditions was found to be species specific miscanthus sinensis was the best performer and was also found to be cold resistant with the exception of miscanthus sinensis all plant species were more impacted by the cold temperature decrease from 70 to 45 tn removal on average 1 to 30 decrease across species compared to 4 weeks drying decrease from 60 to 54 tn removal on average 1 16 decrease across species in systems equipped with a submerged zone in contrast the 4 weeks drying e coli decrease from 2 60 to 1 08 log removal on average had a more pronounced effect on e coli removal performance compared to the cold conditions e coli decrease from 1 70 to 1 38 log removal on average this study shows that plant species relative contribution to pollutant removal is pollutant specific and varies under different climatic conditions a mix of plant species may ensure higher level of system resilience under a variable climate the study also highlights the need to understand more about the microbial ecology of these plant systems to optimise both nutrient and pathogen removal for sustained long term performance keywords biofiltration cold climate dry weather e coli nature based solutions nitrogen 1 introduction green infrastructure gi technologies are being increasingly adopted in different parts of the world as strategies to manage stormwater pollution and to help mitigate the deleterious effects of climate change and urbanisation charlesworth 2010 li et al 2019 stormwater biofiltration systems also known as bioretention biofilters rain gardens comprise one example of a popular gi measure that has found application in a range of urban settings biofilters consist of a vegetated basin or trench filled with an engineered media and often equipped with an underlying saturated zone sz their numerous bio ecological benefits have been documented zhang and chui 2019 stormwater biofilters effectuate treatment through a range of bio physico chemical processes pollutant treatment effectiveness therefore varies depending on the surrounding climate for instance lower pollutant removal has been recorded in cold climates due to reduced biotic activity as a result of lower temperatures kratky et al 2017 while specific design considerations incl proper plant selection are required in semi arid climates to sustain plant health and treatment performance due to the negative impact of drying on treatment performance houdeshel et al 2015 while studies have looked into the performance of stormwater biofilters in different climatic regions e g blecken et al 2010 mahmoud et al 2019 roseen et al 2009 few have specifically looked into the effect of type of plant species e g houdeshel et al 2015 plants form a key design component of these systems not only in their role in enhancing biodiversity and the natural beauty of the urban landscape but also in their contribution to improved biofilter treatment performance payne et al 2015 plants help facilitate treatment both directly through biotic uptake and indirectly by influencing the soil porosity and microbial communities responsible for pollutant degradation payne et al 2014a for example the presence and or type of plant species employed in stormwater biofilters have been reported to benefit removal of nitrogen tn faecal indicator organisms e coli and to a lesser extent phosphorus tp muerdter et al 2018 tn removal efficiency of biofilters is highly variable ranging between 62 net removal and 312 net leaching collins et al 2010 similarly e coli removal efficiency declines by an order of 2 to 1 48 log removal across a number of field systems in different regions kim et al 2012 hathaway et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 chandrasena et al 2016 both rainfall patterns wetting drying cycles and temperature have been found to impact on system treatment performance zinger et al 2021 blecken et al 2010 søberg et al 2019 chandrasena et al 2017 in regards to nitrogen studies have shown that removal can be improved and this variation minimised through design including careful plant selection payne et al 2014a lucke and nichols 2015 different vegetation types are known to possess different levels of effectiveness due to differences in factors such as root structure growth and biomass zhang and chui 2019 studies investigating the effect of plant species on nitrogen removal are however limited and have a particular focus on australian native plant species e g read et al 2008 payne et al 2014c payne et al 2018 in fact one of these studies payne et al 2018 tested a broad range of plant species leading to the development of a tool for guiding plant selection for nitrogen removal however testing was conducted on limited operating environmental conditions including dry period of 2 weeks while longer duration dry periods 4 weeks as often experienced in semi arid regions have been shown to have a greater impact on performance zinger et al 2021 on the other hand the effect of different plant species under cold temperatures remains elusive kratky et al 2017 it is a similar case for phosphorus kratky et al 2017 skorobogatov et al 2020 in contrast to nitrogen it has been reported that pathogens e coli can be removed in biofilters at a high level by the media alone although vegetation can significantly influence pathogen removal by altering infiltration rates muerdter et al 2018 die off of captured microbes in stormwater biofilters has been found to be controlled by environmental factors including sunlight uv radiation desiccation predation temperature moisture content and nutrient availability hunt et al 2012 chandrasena et al 2017 within the biofilter environment most of these factors are dynamic and regulated to a certain extent by the presence and type of vegetation hence with different plants having different regulatory processes relevant to their survival skorobogatov et al 2020 it is imperative to test the interactive effect of plant species and operating conditions so as to better inform design for sustained and improved performance in a range of climates as well as inform system resilience for systems affected by climate extremes such as prolonged drought in the face of projected future climate variability this study aims to address this gap by investigating the response of four distinct biofilter plant species namely canna indica miscanthus sinensis carex appressa and ginkgo biloba in nutrient and faecal indicator organism e coli removal under wet weather dry weather and cold weather conditions the interactive relationships between plant root characteristics system infiltration capacity and pollutant removal are additionally explored to inform processes this paper ultimately offers practical recommendations for the selection of plant species for designing climate resilient stormwater green infrastructure 2 methods 2 1 experimental design and procedure this study examines the effect of four plant species namely canna indica ci miscanthus sinensis ms carex appressa ca and ginkgo biloba gb and a non vegetated control carex appressa is a australian native species that have been shown in previous studies for its effective performance payne et al 2014c fowdar et al 2017 while the other three canna indica miscanthus sinensis and ginkgo biloba are native to or common to jiangsu province china they are distinct in both their above ground and below ground traits this research forms part of a larger study investigating the treatment performance of 22 plant species native to or common to jiangsu province china across a broad range of plant types 25 columns were set up including five replicates of each species and five non vegetated controls in an open air greenhouse with a clear impermeable roof fig 1 a the columns were constructed from 240 mm diameter pvc pipe with a transparent perspex top section allowing for plant growth and ponding of water the insides of the columns were scarified to reduce preferential flow along the column edges columns were filled with different layers of media from top to bottom 630 mm of washed sand 100 mm of washed well graded sand and 100 mm of gravel aggregates a permanent saturated layer of 450 mm was created by raising the outlet pipe this comprised part of the filter media the gravel drainage and the transition layer fig 1b plants sourced from local nurseries were planted in march 2018 1 plant per column following an initial plant establishment phase columns were watered with 11 3 l of semi synthetic stormwater twice weekly from june 2018 table 1 shows the experimental design and the tested conditions in april 2019 the columns were subject to 20 days of drying this period represented systems under extreme drought conditions with the length of this dry period corresponding to the 99th percentile of dry days based on local rainfall data jiangsu province in may 2019 after approximately 12 months since establishment 15 columns 3 replicates of each treatment design set 1 were transferred to a cold room air temperature of 2 c for evaluating system performance under very cold climatic conditions grow lights were used in the cool room to allow the plants light the remaining 10 columns in the greenhouse set 2 featured as controls to assess effect of cold average air temperature in the cold room was 2 12 c while the corresponding temperature in the greenhouse was 11 86 c the frequency of stormwater application twice per week table s1 was designed to match the average occurrence of storm events based upon 6 min rainfall data from jiangsu province and the dose volume 11 3 l was determined using the same rainfall data and the music design curves developed for jiangsu barron et al 2016 this was based on an annual average effective rainfall of 1087 mm year and using a biofilter sized to 4 of its contributing catchment 2 2 water quality sampling infiltration rate measurements to assess the pollutant removal efficacy of the columns the inflow and outflow were sampled on 10 april run 1 2 may after 20 days of drying run 2 23 may before transfer of column subset into the cold room run 3 25 june 5 weeks after transfer into cold room run 4 and 9 july column subset in greenhouse run 5 gh and 16 july column subset in cold room run 5 cr fig 2 these were in order to assess performance under the different operational conditions composite outflow samples were collected for each event for two events a wet weather and a dry weather discrete outflow samples were collected every 4 l to analyse the change in concentrations across the outflow hydrograph each sample was analysed for total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 nitrate nox total dissolved nitrogen tdn total phosphorus tp filterable reactive phosphorus frp total dissolved phosphorus tdp total suspended sediment tss zinc zn cadmium cd nickel ni lead pb manganese mn chromium cr and copper cu in nata national association of testing authorities australia accredited laboratories with standard qc procedures samples were tested for e coli concentrations using the colilert method according to as 4276 21 2005 the water in the saturated zone was sampled by opening the bottom outlet tap fig 1 and withdrawing approximately 300 ml of stored water before sampling on 10 04 2019 one day and six days following sampling the water samples were analysed for e coli concentrations in order to characterise changes in stored water quality over time the media hydraulic conductivity influences the water retention time within the system this effect in turn can impact upon pollutant removal efficiency therefore measurements were taken either before or during each sampling event to determine the infiltration capacity of the columns under the different conditions following dosing the drop in ponding water level was measured at approximately every 5 min for at least one hour or until zero ponding the slope of the graph of water level against time was taken to represent the infiltration rate ir through the columns following on from le coustumer et al 2009 who demonstrated that hydraulic conductivity is governed by the system s surface layer the ir values obtained in this study can be used as a proxy for estimating the system s hydraulic performance 2 3 measurement of plant root characteristics three replicates of each plant in set 1 were harvested in randomised order at the conclusion of all water quality monitoring september november 2019 this was conducted in order to characterise the morphological traits of each plant species the filter media and plant root system were removed from the columns the plant was gently washed of sand and separated into roots stems leaves and reproductive parts the length of the longest shoot was measured and then leaves stems and reproductive parts were oven dried to constant mass at 60 c and then weighed to obtain their dry mass the roots were cut into lengths of approximately 2 4 cm mixed thoroughly and three sub samples separated for some plants root diameters varied greatly in size in these instances the different root diameter sizes were separated and three sub samples of each root group were analysed each sub sample was spread out across a perspex water filled tray and scanned the scanned image was analysed using winrhizo software v 2009c regent instruments canada inc to determine total root length surface area volume average diameter and root diameter profile the proportion of roots corresponding to different diameter classes the parameters were scaled up to the level of the whole plant from the ratio of root sample dry mass to total root dry mass 2 4 data analysis concentrations of all pollutants below the detection limit were taken as the detection limit for analysis removal efficiency of tn and tp was calculated as the percentage of the difference between inflow and outflow concentrations divided by the inflow concentration for e coli removal performance was assessed in terms of log removal that is the difference between logarithmic base 10 inflow concentration and the logarithmic base 10 outflow concentration analysis were performed on both removal efficiency and outflow concentrations in the case of nutrients and on log removal in the case of e coli univariate analysis of variance was used to test significant differences across designs where significant differences were noted these were followed by post hoc tests such as tamhane t2 where normality assumptions were not met the results were verified with non parametric tests such as the kruskal wallis test to assess the effect of dry weather on treatment performance data from run 1 and run 2 were compared while data from run 3 4 and 5 were compared to assess the effect of cold conditions on treatment performance data was tested using the non parametric friedman test and verified using the wilcoxon signed rank test between any two sampling runs additionally set 1 and set 2 column subsets were compared using independent t tests when normality assumptions were not met results were confirmed with the non parametric mann whitney test spearman correlation was used to explore the relationship between plant traits and effluent pollutant concentrations removal efficiency between infiltration rates ir and removal efficiency and between effluent volume and removal efficiency for all statistical tests significance was accepted at an α level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 plant root characteristics the root characteristics of carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis were more similar and were denser relative to canna indica and ginkgo biloba table s2 carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis had the largest root mass which was on average four fold higher than canna indica and ginkgo biloba the root system of both carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis had penetrated the full depth of the columns at the time of harvest they presented with the highest root length of 5658 m 3521 and 2374 m 1376 followed by canna indica 495 282 m and ginkgo biloba 237 108 m miscanthus sinensis had the finest root hairs with 70 of its root diameter being smaller than 0 25 mm on average compared to carex appressa 62 canna indica 35 and ginkgo biloba 13 3 2 infiltration rate the range of infiltration rates ir observed under the tested operational conditions fig s1 compare with those obtained for field systems le coustumer et al 2009 while significant differences were observed across plant species the high standard deviations reveal the high variability existing between replicates of the same species as well the general higher ir recorded following 20 days of drying is consistent with other biofiltration studies chandrasena et al 2014 fowdar et al 2017 drying causes media desiccation and cracking within the surface and filter media which create macro pores and hence promote preferential flow channels explaining the higher ir the effect of drying on ir was more pronounced in the presence of plants with a more extensive root system i e carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis table s1 likely as a result of higher loss of soil moisture from higher pore water consumption ir decreased significantly to below 120 mm h during cold conditions 2oc run 4 and 5 cr 3 add in figure s1 among the studied water quality parameters ir had the most effect on e coli removal in this study as discussed later 3 3 nutrient treatment performance 3 3 1 overall performance outflow tn and tp concentrations varied significantly across designs i e plant species and operational conditions i e wet dry cycles and cold temperature as illustrated in fig 3 this translated into poor to excellent tn and tp removal efficiencies of 15 to 90 and of 33 to 95 respectively on average over the five monitoring runs the negative tn removal performance was caused by leaching from the non vegetated control the outflow was enriched with dissolved nitrogen with nox accounting for 55 80 of effluent tn and nh4 10 similarly frp made up 55 75 of effluent tp measured outflow tn and tp levels were thus inversely related to the removal efficiencies of nox and frp the elevated levels of nox compared to nh4 point to efficient nitrification rates and or biological assimilation and less efficient denitrification rates currently occurring in these systems irrespective of external conditions planted systems generally outperformed non planted ones indicating the contribution of plant n uptake and other indirect plant processes including contribution to soil microbial activity in n removal payne et al 2014 found biotic assimilation to be the dominant removal pathway of n in their stormwater biofilter study accounting for 58 to 100 of no3 the type of plant species present in the treatment system was found to be a significant factor driving performance under all tested conditions p 0 001 3 3 2 performance under normal operating conditions wet weather during normal operating conditions gh 3 add miscanthus sinensis presented with the highest removal efficiencies of approximately 80 tn and 90 tp and ginkgo biloba the lowest of approximately 45 tn and 55 tp miscanthus sinensis performed better than the gold australian standard carex appressa also an effective performer canna indica was a mid range performer strong negative correlations were found between various plant root traits and tn and nox removal table s2 these results corroborate with payne et al 2018 and read et al 2009 demonstrating that treatments with high tn and nox removal are associated with plant species with a large root mass high percentage of fine roots and high specific root length this to a certain extent supports the important role played by plants through direct nitrogen uptake 3 3 3 effect of dry weather the 20 days of drying caused a decline in performance from an average tn of 60 54 set 1 planted non planted controls leached nitrogen negative removal during this period the level of tn performance decline was species specific while systems planted with canna indica and ginkgo biloba were not significantly impacted upon p 0 05 species associated with the highest removal during wet conditions 3 add were most severely affected following extended drying 20 add including miscanthus senensis p 0 001 and carex appressa yet they remained the best performing species with comparatively lower effluent tn levels fig 3 the reduction in removal efficiencies could be explained by a loss of moisture within the system following extended periods of drying this instigates cell dehydration and die off thereby causing a negative impact on plants and microbial communities activities payne et al 2014a both miscanthus senensis and carex appressa columns experienced slightly higher water loss due to evapotranspiration having a larger root network fig 4 consequently their effluent had higher levels of dissolved organic nitrogen likely released from dead microbial and plant cells throughout the dry period payne et al 2018 given that soil systems with a greater microbial biomass and abundance of fungi relative to bacteria have been found to cause greater nutrient leaching as a result of soil moisture stress gordon et al 2008 an understanding and comparison of the microbial assemblages microbial biomass and abundance of fungi surrounding the roots of each plant species can help provide further insights into the varying effect of wetting drying cycles across plant species in the case of tp a similar decline in performance was recorded following extended system drying from an average removal of 73 to 64 set 1 planted while the dry antecedent conditions 20 add had a significant effect on the species p 0 05 this could be due to leaching of plant detritus following extended drying similar to tn 3 3 4 effect of cold conditions low ambient temperature 2 c caused a general increase in outflow nutrient concentrations fig 3 the effects of low ambient temperature on treatment performance are additionally found to be species specific following transfer into the cold room tp removal efficiency decreased from 69 to 60 on average with the greatest decrease observed for carex appressa from 82 to 62 and ginkgo biloba from 70 to 49 tn removal efficiency decreased slightly from 56 to 45 on average with the greatest difference again observed for carex appressa from 70 to 45 and ginkgo biloba 59 to 24 and the least for miscanthus senensis negligible difference all treatments leached nox after transfer into the cold room with the exception of miscanthus senensis interestingly only miscanthus senensis and carex appressa treatments significantly outperformed the non planted control under the cold conditions p 0 01 the non planted control s performance was minimally impacted by the cold weather the lack of difference between the two temperature treatments for the non planted control could be due to the fact that denitrification rates were limited even at the higher temperature i e under normal greenhouse conditions for planted systems a reduction in tn removal efficiency under colder temperatures in similar environments has been attributed to reduced biotic reactions including plant activity e g many plants are known to enter senescence during winter huang et al 2013 grebenshchykova et al 2020 this is likely the case for ginkgo biloba here a deciduous tree the cold climate experiment coincided with winter in melbourne further plant nitrogen processing is known to occur through various plant microbe interactions for example the composition and quantity of microbes in the soil and rhizosphere can influence the ability of a plant to assimilate nutrients bais et al 2006 it has also been shown that different microbial community patterns are associated with different plant species philippot et al 2009 these could help explain the varying effect of temperature on tn removal among the plant species where temperature is known to negatively affect plant and microbial activity an interesting observation is that while both miscanthus senensis and carex appressa were both high performers miscanthus senensis was relatively unaffected compared to carex appressa which went from net removal before transfer into the cold room to net leaching after transfer both of these species recorded a high root biomass and similar root structure typical of high performing species table s2 this further indicates that plant nutrient acquisition strategies and their dependence on microbes possibly vary across plant species nh4 removal efficiency was most affected by the cold temperature in comparison to nox a statistically significant increase in outflow nh4 levels was observed under the colder temperature p 0 01 outflow levels were significantly higher compared to the control greenhouse treatments for both run 4 p 0 05 and run 5 p 0 01 something less apparent in the case of nox outflow levels decreased nitrification rates are likely responsible for this garcia et al 2010 though nh4 removal was still relatively high in the second sampling in the temperature controlled room given that the decrease in tn removal efficiency was statistically significant p 0 05 in the second sampling following transfer into the cold room run 5 cr 3 add eight weeks after transfer and not in the first round run 4 cr 3 add five weeks after transfer there was a corresponding non statistical significance in the greenhouse control treatments suggests a tendency towards an increasing negative effect on treatment performance with time in the cold room this is a short term experiment two phenomenon could happen if the systems were further exposed to the cold conditions 1 either plant species would have adapted to their new environment and maintain recover their removal efficiency or 2 plant growth would be stunted which would be accompanied by reduced pollutant removal 3 4 e coli treatment performance 3 4 1 overall performance e coli treatment efficiency was variable over the monitoring period ranging on average between 0 8 and 3 6 log removal the type of plant species had mostly minimal impacts on removal performance p 0 05 this is in contrast to chandrasena et al 2014 where the difference in removal efficiency across plant species was attributed to the different infiltration rates surrounding each species rather total outflow concentrations were found to be a stronger function of hydraulic retention time antecedent dry conditions and cold conditions in the present study fig s2 illustrates the variation of outflow e coli concentrations across the outflow hydrograph for an event with 3 add and 20 add the comparatively lower levels in the initial outflow in both cases demonstrate the beneficial effect of increased retention time of antecedent water in the submerged zone on bacterial die off consistent with findings of chandrasena et al 2019 and søberg et al 2019 given that the overall outflow is a mixture of this resident antecedent water retained in the sz of improved quality and new water from the current event this indicates that factors that affect the retention time of antecedent runoff can contribute to positively influence overall e coli removal moreover the high variability in outflow e coli concentrations and hence log reduction in certain instances fig 4 confirms the varying extent of bacterial attachment and retention mechanisms as well as transport behaviour observed in porous media lau et al 2017 3 4 2 effect of hydraulic retention time there was a significant negative correlation between e coli log reduction and infiltration rate ir in run 1 2 and 5 r 0 64 0 76 and 0 84 respectively p 0 05 indicating that the longer the water resides in the system during a storm event the higher is the e coli removal for these events this correlation was found to be stronger during wet conditions fig s3 attachment has been previously found to be the dominant retention mechanism in porous media incl sand studies wang et al 2011 longer contact time during passage of flow promotes better straining as well as enhanced opportunity for attachment of the microbes to filter media particles and plant roots chandrasena et al 2019 garcia et al 2010 at the same time the fact that the effect of ir was less apparent in the other sampling runs confirms that there are other factors which are governing e coli removal in these systems one such factor being processes occurring during inter event periods fig 5 shows the concentrations of e coli in the submerged zone pore water before an event water residence time of approx 2 days one and six days following an event the positive difference in levels between day one and day six indicates that significant die off natural or through predation by the microfauna occurs in the sz over time in between storm events highlighting the beneficial effect of increased retention time within the sz this is in agreement with chandrasena et al 2014 2019 a positive correlation between bacterial inactivation and hydraulic retention time has also been noted in wastewater wetlands garcia et al 2010 for example the sizing of the submerged zone is likely to be a key design parameter for microbial removal in stormwater biofilters with a larger sz speculated to provide a larger pool of antecedent water to lower overall outflow concentrations this water could additionally be directed to water recycling schemes via real time control operation shen et al 2020 persaud et al 2019 the slight difference in sz pore water e coli levels across planted designs fig 5 is an aspect that needs further investigation this could be influenced by the soil microbial communities inhabited in the presence of different plant species e g release of metabolites from root exudates for bacterial survival stottmeister et al 2003 or competition and predation by the indigenous communities chandrasena et al 2017 no significant relationship between root traits and e coli log reduction or ir was found in this study this supports the discussion that bacterial transport behaviour during a storm event may be governing e coli removal in this study 3 4 3 effect of dry weather while six days versus one or two days retention time may be advantageous for enhancing e coli decay and hence system microbial removal too long a dry period will also significantly change moisture levels and nutrient flux within the filter system e g higher water loss caused by plant transpiration and water use requirements this may reverse system performance mean e coli log reduction decreased significantly p 0 001 from a log reduction of 2 6 0 15 se to 1 08 0 18 se after 20 days of drying the systems received no inflow during this time fig 4 shows the comparison of e coli removal performance across the different plant species during run 1 wet conditions and run 2 dry conditions treatment performance of systems planted with carex appressa and miscanthus senensis were most affected given that a significant positive correlation was found between log e coli removal and effluent volume following 20 days drying r 0 600 p 0 004 the fact that these plants experienced higher water loss during this time thereby leading to lower percentages of antecedent clean sz water e g see fig 4b could help explain this difference across plant species however other factors may also be influencing performance during dry weather since the non vegetated controls had negligible water loss following the dry period and their performance was also similarly affected detachment of previously captured e coli from the filter media and associated biofilm during the dry period available for flushing in subsequent events could be contributing to the higher levels of outflow e coli compared to wet weather e g wang et al 2011 the shape of the outflow pollutograph was distinct for the 3 add event and 20 add event fig s2 the sharper increase in outflow e coli concentrations with volume in the 20 add event which was identical for all designs indicate that bacterial detachment could also be responsible for this biofilm detachment is a complex process typically initiated by stresses such as nutrient limitations changes in shear or changes in other environmental conditions when subjected to changes in nutrient flux cells become motile and detach wang et al 2011 another reason explaining the poorer performance during dry weather could be due to less competition of captured e coli with indigenous bacteria due to the latter s reduced metabolism zhang et al 2012 3 4 4 effect of cold conditions mean e coli log reduction decreased from 1 70 0 15 se to 1 38 0 15 following transfer into the cold room however this was not found to be statistically significant p 0 05 comparison between cool room and greenhouse control treatments fig 6 revealed a significant decrease in cool room set in the first sampling after transfer into the cool room run 4 p 0 019 however the performance of the treatments recovered in the second sampling after transfer into the cold room run 5 the higher log removal in run 5 after round 2 condition in fig 6 could be an artefact of the higher inflow concentration no difference was found between the cool room and greenhouse controls during this round zhang et al 2012 similarly found temperature to have no significant influence on e coli transport and capture in conventional bioretention media but their results showed captured bacteria to survive longer at lower temperatures likely due to reduced metabolism and growth of competing microbes for resources such as protozoa and heterotrophic bacteria the relationship between e coli reduction and ir was still significant under cold conditions yet ir was up to an order of magnitude lower in the cold room fig s3right the interactions between lower ir i e higher contact time and higher bacterial survival rates could have buffered against a more severe impact of e coli reduction performance 3 5 implications for plant selection the results of the present study point to the type of plant species being an important design factor governing nutrient and to a lesser extent e coli removal under different climatic conditions importantly plant selection criteria for systems having as objective nutrient management e g for ecosystem protection will be different from those implemented for faecal removal e g for stormwater harvesting in wet climates mature plant species with a fine root network which is able to scavenge or occupy a significant proportion of the soil will benefit nitrogen removal in stormwater biofilters however in drier climates the same plant species may start leaching significant amounts of nitrogen due to higher water loss i e resource use hence opting for a mix of species remains the most effective approach this means that species that are most resource intensive will likely be planted at a minimum density in regions experiencing long periods of dry weather spells in cold climates nutrient removal is expected to be comparatively poorer if the same level of stormwater pollution is generated in the catchment furthermore nutrient removal effectiveness under cold temperatures depended on the type of plant species proper plant selection may thus be even more critical for nutrient removal in regions experiencing cold winters it is expected that some plant species will go in a state of dormancy during this time including deciduous trees such as gingko biloba it is also possible that species other than those tested in the present study may thrive better under those conditions the results also indicate that a mix of plant species may ensure higher level of system resilience under climate variability species mixtures might also be preferred for aesthetic and ecological reasons i e for maintenance of biodiversity in the urban landscape read et al 2008 in the case of e coli removal though there were other critical factors that are dictating the variation in performance across the different operational conditions an effect of the type of plant species could also not be ignored for e g in drier climates plant species with higher water use such as miscanthus senensis and carex appressa will result in lower treatment performance compared to those with moderate to low water use additionally given that retention time with the sz can contribute to higher removal performance systems with long water residence times may benefit with plant species with anti microbial properties galbraith et al 2019 4 conclusion four distinct plant species were tested for their ability to reduce nutrients and e coli under a range of climatic conditions in stormwater biofiltration systems species varied significantly in their nitrogen removal efficiency ranging in the order of 45 to 80 the effect of operating conditions including 4 weeks of drying and cold temperatures on removal was species specific with the exception of miscanthus sinensis all plant species were more impacted by the cold temperature compared to 4 weeks drying the presence of a submerged zone might have helped maintain moisture levels which avoided a more severe impact on removal efficiency miscanthus sinensis was found to be a better performer than the australian gold standard carex appressa it was also cold resistant given this species specific observation and the fact that nitrogen removal is influenced by plant activity as well as the associated microbial community an understanding of the abundance and diversity of microbes surrounding the rhizosphere of each biofilter plant species can help guide future design to optimise treatment faecal indicator organisms e coli removal was variable and more heavily impacted upon by the 4 weeks of drying compared to the cold conditions the low infiltration rates in the cold may have helped maintain treatment by increasing the hydraulic residence time while plant type did not influence e coli removal efficiency in this study the different factors found to influence removal such as infiltration rate i e the hydraulic retention time during an event as well as the retention time within the sz allowing for inter event die off could be optimised through

4143,urban green infrastructure gi such as biofiltration systems also known as bioretention biofilters rain gardens are being increasingly implemented in different parts of the world to enhance urban greening whilst controlling stormwater pollution treatment effectiveness has been shown to be reliant upon the surrounding climate including rainfall patterns e g length of wet and dry weather and temperature plant species play a key role in treatment yet the response of different plant species to pollutant removal under different climatic and environmental conditions is still not fully known this information is pertinent to ensure sustained biofilter performance under a range of conditions this study investigates the change in biofilter nutrient and e coli removal performance in the presence of four plant species canna indica carex appressa ginkgo biloba and miscanthus sinensis with distinct above and below ground characteristics when exposed to wet weather dry weather and cold weather conditions the extent of the decline in nutrient treatment performance following extended drying and under cold conditions was found to be species specific miscanthus sinensis was the best performer and was also found to be cold resistant with the exception of miscanthus sinensis all plant species were more impacted by the cold temperature decrease from 70 to 45 tn removal on average 1 to 30 decrease across species compared to 4 weeks drying decrease from 60 to 54 tn removal on average 1 16 decrease across species in systems equipped with a submerged zone in contrast the 4 weeks drying e coli decrease from 2 60 to 1 08 log removal on average had a more pronounced effect on e coli removal performance compared to the cold conditions e coli decrease from 1 70 to 1 38 log removal on average this study shows that plant species relative contribution to pollutant removal is pollutant specific and varies under different climatic conditions a mix of plant species may ensure higher level of system resilience under a variable climate the study also highlights the need to understand more about the microbial ecology of these plant systems to optimise both nutrient and pathogen removal for sustained long term performance keywords biofiltration cold climate dry weather e coli nature based solutions nitrogen 1 introduction green infrastructure gi technologies are being increasingly adopted in different parts of the world as strategies to manage stormwater pollution and to help mitigate the deleterious effects of climate change and urbanisation charlesworth 2010 li et al 2019 stormwater biofiltration systems also known as bioretention biofilters rain gardens comprise one example of a popular gi measure that has found application in a range of urban settings biofilters consist of a vegetated basin or trench filled with an engineered media and often equipped with an underlying saturated zone sz their numerous bio ecological benefits have been documented zhang and chui 2019 stormwater biofilters effectuate treatment through a range of bio physico chemical processes pollutant treatment effectiveness therefore varies depending on the surrounding climate for instance lower pollutant removal has been recorded in cold climates due to reduced biotic activity as a result of lower temperatures kratky et al 2017 while specific design considerations incl proper plant selection are required in semi arid climates to sustain plant health and treatment performance due to the negative impact of drying on treatment performance houdeshel et al 2015 while studies have looked into the performance of stormwater biofilters in different climatic regions e g blecken et al 2010 mahmoud et al 2019 roseen et al 2009 few have specifically looked into the effect of type of plant species e g houdeshel et al 2015 plants form a key design component of these systems not only in their role in enhancing biodiversity and the natural beauty of the urban landscape but also in their contribution to improved biofilter treatment performance payne et al 2015 plants help facilitate treatment both directly through biotic uptake and indirectly by influencing the soil porosity and microbial communities responsible for pollutant degradation payne et al 2014a for example the presence and or type of plant species employed in stormwater biofilters have been reported to benefit removal of nitrogen tn faecal indicator organisms e coli and to a lesser extent phosphorus tp muerdter et al 2018 tn removal efficiency of biofilters is highly variable ranging between 62 net removal and 312 net leaching collins et al 2010 similarly e coli removal efficiency declines by an order of 2 to 1 48 log removal across a number of field systems in different regions kim et al 2012 hathaway et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 chandrasena et al 2016 both rainfall patterns wetting drying cycles and temperature have been found to impact on system treatment performance zinger et al 2021 blecken et al 2010 søberg et al 2019 chandrasena et al 2017 in regards to nitrogen studies have shown that removal can be improved and this variation minimised through design including careful plant selection payne et al 2014a lucke and nichols 2015 different vegetation types are known to possess different levels of effectiveness due to differences in factors such as root structure growth and biomass zhang and chui 2019 studies investigating the effect of plant species on nitrogen removal are however limited and have a particular focus on australian native plant species e g read et al 2008 payne et al 2014c payne et al 2018 in fact one of these studies payne et al 2018 tested a broad range of plant species leading to the development of a tool for guiding plant selection for nitrogen removal however testing was conducted on limited operating environmental conditions including dry period of 2 weeks while longer duration dry periods 4 weeks as often experienced in semi arid regions have been shown to have a greater impact on performance zinger et al 2021 on the other hand the effect of different plant species under cold temperatures remains elusive kratky et al 2017 it is a similar case for phosphorus kratky et al 2017 skorobogatov et al 2020 in contrast to nitrogen it has been reported that pathogens e coli can be removed in biofilters at a high level by the media alone although vegetation can significantly influence pathogen removal by altering infiltration rates muerdter et al 2018 die off of captured microbes in stormwater biofilters has been found to be controlled by environmental factors including sunlight uv radiation desiccation predation temperature moisture content and nutrient availability hunt et al 2012 chandrasena et al 2017 within the biofilter environment most of these factors are dynamic and regulated to a certain extent by the presence and type of vegetation hence with different plants having different regulatory processes relevant to their survival skorobogatov et al 2020 it is imperative to test the interactive effect of plant species and operating conditions so as to better inform design for sustained and improved performance in a range of climates as well as inform system resilience for systems affected by climate extremes such as prolonged drought in the face of projected future climate variability this study aims to address this gap by investigating the response of four distinct biofilter plant species namely canna indica miscanthus sinensis carex appressa and ginkgo biloba in nutrient and faecal indicator organism e coli removal under wet weather dry weather and cold weather conditions the interactive relationships between plant root characteristics system infiltration capacity and pollutant removal are additionally explored to inform processes this paper ultimately offers practical recommendations for the selection of plant species for designing climate resilient stormwater green infrastructure 2 methods 2 1 experimental design and procedure this study examines the effect of four plant species namely canna indica ci miscanthus sinensis ms carex appressa ca and ginkgo biloba gb and a non vegetated control carex appressa is a australian native species that have been shown in previous studies for its effective performance payne et al 2014c fowdar et al 2017 while the other three canna indica miscanthus sinensis and ginkgo biloba are native to or common to jiangsu province china they are distinct in both their above ground and below ground traits this research forms part of a larger study investigating the treatment performance of 22 plant species native to or common to jiangsu province china across a broad range of plant types 25 columns were set up including five replicates of each species and five non vegetated controls in an open air greenhouse with a clear impermeable roof fig 1 a the columns were constructed from 240 mm diameter pvc pipe with a transparent perspex top section allowing for plant growth and ponding of water the insides of the columns were scarified to reduce preferential flow along the column edges columns were filled with different layers of media from top to bottom 630 mm of washed sand 100 mm of washed well graded sand and 100 mm of gravel aggregates a permanent saturated layer of 450 mm was created by raising the outlet pipe this comprised part of the filter media the gravel drainage and the transition layer fig 1b plants sourced from local nurseries were planted in march 2018 1 plant per column following an initial plant establishment phase columns were watered with 11 3 l of semi synthetic stormwater twice weekly from june 2018 table 1 shows the experimental design and the tested conditions in april 2019 the columns were subject to 20 days of drying this period represented systems under extreme drought conditions with the length of this dry period corresponding to the 99th percentile of dry days based on local rainfall data jiangsu province in may 2019 after approximately 12 months since establishment 15 columns 3 replicates of each treatment design set 1 were transferred to a cold room air temperature of 2 c for evaluating system performance under very cold climatic conditions grow lights were used in the cool room to allow the plants light the remaining 10 columns in the greenhouse set 2 featured as controls to assess effect of cold average air temperature in the cold room was 2 12 c while the corresponding temperature in the greenhouse was 11 86 c the frequency of stormwater application twice per week table s1 was designed to match the average occurrence of storm events based upon 6 min rainfall data from jiangsu province and the dose volume 11 3 l was determined using the same rainfall data and the music design curves developed for jiangsu barron et al 2016 this was based on an annual average effective rainfall of 1087 mm year and using a biofilter sized to 4 of its contributing catchment 2 2 water quality sampling infiltration rate measurements to assess the pollutant removal efficacy of the columns the inflow and outflow were sampled on 10 april run 1 2 may after 20 days of drying run 2 23 may before transfer of column subset into the cold room run 3 25 june 5 weeks after transfer into cold room run 4 and 9 july column subset in greenhouse run 5 gh and 16 july column subset in cold room run 5 cr fig 2 these were in order to assess performance under the different operational conditions composite outflow samples were collected for each event for two events a wet weather and a dry weather discrete outflow samples were collected every 4 l to analyse the change in concentrations across the outflow hydrograph each sample was analysed for total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 nitrate nox total dissolved nitrogen tdn total phosphorus tp filterable reactive phosphorus frp total dissolved phosphorus tdp total suspended sediment tss zinc zn cadmium cd nickel ni lead pb manganese mn chromium cr and copper cu in nata national association of testing authorities australia accredited laboratories with standard qc procedures samples were tested for e coli concentrations using the colilert method according to as 4276 21 2005 the water in the saturated zone was sampled by opening the bottom outlet tap fig 1 and withdrawing approximately 300 ml of stored water before sampling on 10 04 2019 one day and six days following sampling the water samples were analysed for e coli concentrations in order to characterise changes in stored water quality over time the media hydraulic conductivity influences the water retention time within the system this effect in turn can impact upon pollutant removal efficiency therefore measurements were taken either before or during each sampling event to determine the infiltration capacity of the columns under the different conditions following dosing the drop in ponding water level was measured at approximately every 5 min for at least one hour or until zero ponding the slope of the graph of water level against time was taken to represent the infiltration rate ir through the columns following on from le coustumer et al 2009 who demonstrated that hydraulic conductivity is governed by the system s surface layer the ir values obtained in this study can be used as a proxy for estimating the system s hydraulic performance 2 3 measurement of plant root characteristics three replicates of each plant in set 1 were harvested in randomised order at the conclusion of all water quality monitoring september november 2019 this was conducted in order to characterise the morphological traits of each plant species the filter media and plant root system were removed from the columns the plant was gently washed of sand and separated into roots stems leaves and reproductive parts the length of the longest shoot was measured and then leaves stems and reproductive parts were oven dried to constant mass at 60 c and then weighed to obtain their dry mass the roots were cut into lengths of approximately 2 4 cm mixed thoroughly and three sub samples separated for some plants root diameters varied greatly in size in these instances the different root diameter sizes were separated and three sub samples of each root group were analysed each sub sample was spread out across a perspex water filled tray and scanned the scanned image was analysed using winrhizo software v 2009c regent instruments canada inc to determine total root length surface area volume average diameter and root diameter profile the proportion of roots corresponding to different diameter classes the parameters were scaled up to the level of the whole plant from the ratio of root sample dry mass to total root dry mass 2 4 data analysis concentrations of all pollutants below the detection limit were taken as the detection limit for analysis removal efficiency of tn and tp was calculated as the percentage of the difference between inflow and outflow concentrations divided by the inflow concentration for e coli removal performance was assessed in terms of log removal that is the difference between logarithmic base 10 inflow concentration and the logarithmic base 10 outflow concentration analysis were performed on both removal efficiency and outflow concentrations in the case of nutrients and on log removal in the case of e coli univariate analysis of variance was used to test significant differences across designs where significant differences were noted these were followed by post hoc tests such as tamhane t2 where normality assumptions were not met the results were verified with non parametric tests such as the kruskal wallis test to assess the effect of dry weather on treatment performance data from run 1 and run 2 were compared while data from run 3 4 and 5 were compared to assess the effect of cold conditions on treatment performance data was tested using the non parametric friedman test and verified using the wilcoxon signed rank test between any two sampling runs additionally set 1 and set 2 column subsets were compared using independent t tests when normality assumptions were not met results were confirmed with the non parametric mann whitney test spearman correlation was used to explore the relationship between plant traits and effluent pollutant concentrations removal efficiency between infiltration rates ir and removal efficiency and between effluent volume and removal efficiency for all statistical tests significance was accepted at an α level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 plant root characteristics the root characteristics of carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis were more similar and were denser relative to canna indica and ginkgo biloba table s2 carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis had the largest root mass which was on average four fold higher than canna indica and ginkgo biloba the root system of both carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis had penetrated the full depth of the columns at the time of harvest they presented with the highest root length of 5658 m 3521 and 2374 m 1376 followed by canna indica 495 282 m and ginkgo biloba 237 108 m miscanthus sinensis had the finest root hairs with 70 of its root diameter being smaller than 0 25 mm on average compared to carex appressa 62 canna indica 35 and ginkgo biloba 13 3 2 infiltration rate the range of infiltration rates ir observed under the tested operational conditions fig s1 compare with those obtained for field systems le coustumer et al 2009 while significant differences were observed across plant species the high standard deviations reveal the high variability existing between replicates of the same species as well the general higher ir recorded following 20 days of drying is consistent with other biofiltration studies chandrasena et al 2014 fowdar et al 2017 drying causes media desiccation and cracking within the surface and filter media which create macro pores and hence promote preferential flow channels explaining the higher ir the effect of drying on ir was more pronounced in the presence of plants with a more extensive root system i e carex appressa and miscanthus sinensis table s1 likely as a result of higher loss of soil moisture from higher pore water consumption ir decreased significantly to below 120 mm h during cold conditions 2oc run 4 and 5 cr 3 add in figure s1 among the studied water quality parameters ir had the most effect on e coli removal in this study as discussed later 3 3 nutrient treatment performance 3 3 1 overall performance outflow tn and tp concentrations varied significantly across designs i e plant species and operational conditions i e wet dry cycles and cold temperature as illustrated in fig 3 this translated into poor to excellent tn and tp removal efficiencies of 15 to 90 and of 33 to 95 respectively on average over the five monitoring runs the negative tn removal performance was caused by leaching from the non vegetated control the outflow was enriched with dissolved nitrogen with nox accounting for 55 80 of effluent tn and nh4 10 similarly frp made up 55 75 of effluent tp measured outflow tn and tp levels were thus inversely related to the removal efficiencies of nox and frp the elevated levels of nox compared to nh4 point to efficient nitrification rates and or biological assimilation and less efficient denitrification rates currently occurring in these systems irrespective of external conditions planted systems generally outperformed non planted ones indicating the contribution of plant n uptake and other indirect plant processes including contribution to soil microbial activity in n removal payne et al 2014 found biotic assimilation to be the dominant removal pathway of n in their stormwater biofilter study accounting for 58 to 100 of no3 the type of plant species present in the treatment system was found to be a significant factor driving performance under all tested conditions p 0 001 3 3 2 performance under normal operating conditions wet weather during normal operating conditions gh 3 add miscanthus sinensis presented with the highest removal efficiencies of approximately 80 tn and 90 tp and ginkgo biloba the lowest of approximately 45 tn and 55 tp miscanthus sinensis performed better than the gold australian standard carex appressa also an effective performer canna indica was a mid range performer strong negative correlations were found between various plant root traits and tn and nox removal table s2 these results corroborate with payne et al 2018 and read et al 2009 demonstrating that treatments with high tn and nox removal are associated with plant species with a large root mass high percentage of fine roots and high specific root length this to a certain extent supports the important role played by plants through direct nitrogen uptake 3 3 3 effect of dry weather the 20 days of drying caused a decline in performance from an average tn of 60 54 set 1 planted non planted controls leached nitrogen negative removal during this period the level of tn performance decline was species specific while systems planted with canna indica and ginkgo biloba were not significantly impacted upon p 0 05 species associated with the highest removal during wet conditions 3 add were most severely affected following extended drying 20 add including miscanthus senensis p 0 001 and carex appressa yet they remained the best performing species with comparatively lower effluent tn levels fig 3 the reduction in removal efficiencies could be explained by a loss of moisture within the system following extended periods of drying this instigates cell dehydration and die off thereby causing a negative impact on plants and microbial communities activities payne et al 2014a both miscanthus senensis and carex appressa columns experienced slightly higher water loss due to evapotranspiration having a larger root network fig 4 consequently their effluent had higher levels of dissolved organic nitrogen likely released from dead microbial and plant cells throughout the dry period payne et al 2018 given that soil systems with a greater microbial biomass and abundance of fungi relative to bacteria have been found to cause greater nutrient leaching as a result of soil moisture stress gordon et al 2008 an understanding and comparison of the microbial assemblages microbial biomass and abundance of fungi surrounding the roots of each plant species can help provide further insights into the varying effect of wetting drying cycles across plant species in the case of tp a similar decline in performance was recorded following extended system drying from an average removal of 73 to 64 set 1 planted while the dry antecedent conditions 20 add had a significant effect on the species p 0 05 this could be due to leaching of plant detritus following extended drying similar to tn 3 3 4 effect of cold conditions low ambient temperature 2 c caused a general increase in outflow nutrient concentrations fig 3 the effects of low ambient temperature on treatment performance are additionally found to be species specific following transfer into the cold room tp removal efficiency decreased from 69 to 60 on average with the greatest decrease observed for carex appressa from 82 to 62 and ginkgo biloba from 70 to 49 tn removal efficiency decreased slightly from 56 to 45 on average with the greatest difference again observed for carex appressa from 70 to 45 and ginkgo biloba 59 to 24 and the least for miscanthus senensis negligible difference all treatments leached nox after transfer into the cold room with the exception of miscanthus senensis interestingly only miscanthus senensis and carex appressa treatments significantly outperformed the non planted control under the cold conditions p 0 01 the non planted control s performance was minimally impacted by the cold weather the lack of difference between the two temperature treatments for the non planted control could be due to the fact that denitrification rates were limited even at the higher temperature i e under normal greenhouse conditions for planted systems a reduction in tn removal efficiency under colder temperatures in similar environments has been attributed to reduced biotic reactions including plant activity e g many plants are known to enter senescence during winter huang et al 2013 grebenshchykova et al 2020 this is likely the case for ginkgo biloba here a deciduous tree the cold climate experiment coincided with winter in melbourne further plant nitrogen processing is known to occur through various plant microbe interactions for example the composition and quantity of microbes in the soil and rhizosphere can influence the ability of a plant to assimilate nutrients bais et al 2006 it has also been shown that different microbial community patterns are associated with different plant species philippot et al 2009 these could help explain the varying effect of temperature on tn removal among the plant species where temperature is known to negatively affect plant and microbial activity an interesting observation is that while both miscanthus senensis and carex appressa were both high performers miscanthus senensis was relatively unaffected compared to carex appressa which went from net removal before transfer into the cold room to net leaching after transfer both of these species recorded a high root biomass and similar root structure typical of high performing species table s2 this further indicates that plant nutrient acquisition strategies and their dependence on microbes possibly vary across plant species nh4 removal efficiency was most affected by the cold temperature in comparison to nox a statistically significant increase in outflow nh4 levels was observed under the colder temperature p 0 01 outflow levels were significantly higher compared to the control greenhouse treatments for both run 4 p 0 05 and run 5 p 0 01 something less apparent in the case of nox outflow levels decreased nitrification rates are likely responsible for this garcia et al 2010 though nh4 removal was still relatively high in the second sampling in the temperature controlled room given that the decrease in tn removal efficiency was statistically significant p 0 05 in the second sampling following transfer into the cold room run 5 cr 3 add eight weeks after transfer and not in the first round run 4 cr 3 add five weeks after transfer there was a corresponding non statistical significance in the greenhouse control treatments suggests a tendency towards an increasing negative effect on treatment performance with time in the cold room this is a short term experiment two phenomenon could happen if the systems were further exposed to the cold conditions 1 either plant species would have adapted to their new environment and maintain recover their removal efficiency or 2 plant growth would be stunted which would be accompanied by reduced pollutant removal 3 4 e coli treatment performance 3 4 1 overall performance e coli treatment efficiency was variable over the monitoring period ranging on average between 0 8 and 3 6 log removal the type of plant species had mostly minimal impacts on removal performance p 0 05 this is in contrast to chandrasena et al 2014 where the difference in removal efficiency across plant species was attributed to the different infiltration rates surrounding each species rather total outflow concentrations were found to be a stronger function of hydraulic retention time antecedent dry conditions and cold conditions in the present study fig s2 illustrates the variation of outflow e coli concentrations across the outflow hydrograph for an event with 3 add and 20 add the comparatively lower levels in the initial outflow in both cases demonstrate the beneficial effect of increased retention time of antecedent water in the submerged zone on bacterial die off consistent with findings of chandrasena et al 2019 and søberg et al 2019 given that the overall outflow is a mixture of this resident antecedent water retained in the sz of improved quality and new water from the current event this indicates that factors that affect the retention time of antecedent runoff can contribute to positively influence overall e coli removal moreover the high variability in outflow e coli concentrations and hence log reduction in certain instances fig 4 confirms the varying extent of bacterial attachment and retention mechanisms as well as transport behaviour observed in porous media lau et al 2017 3 4 2 effect of hydraulic retention time there was a significant negative correlation between e coli log reduction and infiltration rate ir in run 1 2 and 5 r 0 64 0 76 and 0 84 respectively p 0 05 indicating that the longer the water resides in the system during a storm event the higher is the e coli removal for these events this correlation was found to be stronger during wet conditions fig s3 attachment has been previously found to be the dominant retention mechanism in porous media incl sand studies wang et al 2011 longer contact time during passage of flow promotes better straining as well as enhanced opportunity for attachment of the microbes to filter media particles and plant roots chandrasena et al 2019 garcia et al 2010 at the same time the fact that the effect of ir was less apparent in the other sampling runs confirms that there are other factors which are governing e coli removal in these systems one such factor being processes occurring during inter event periods fig 5 shows the concentrations of e coli in the submerged zone pore water before an event water residence time of approx 2 days one and six days following an event the positive difference in levels between day one and day six indicates that significant die off natural or through predation by the microfauna occurs in the sz over time in between storm events highlighting the beneficial effect of increased retention time within the sz this is in agreement with chandrasena et al 2014 2019 a positive correlation between bacterial inactivation and hydraulic retention time has also been noted in wastewater wetlands garcia et al 2010 for example the sizing of the submerged zone is likely to be a key design parameter for microbial removal in stormwater biofilters with a larger sz speculated to provide a larger pool of antecedent water to lower overall outflow concentrations this water could additionally be directed to water recycling schemes via real time control operation shen et al 2020 persaud et al 2019 the slight difference in sz pore water e coli levels across planted designs fig 5 is an aspect that needs further investigation this could be influenced by the soil microbial communities inhabited in the presence of different plant species e g release of metabolites from root exudates for bacterial survival stottmeister et al 2003 or competition and predation by the indigenous communities chandrasena et al 2017 no significant relationship between root traits and e coli log reduction or ir was found in this study this supports the discussion that bacterial transport behaviour during a storm event may be governing e coli removal in this study 3 4 3 effect of dry weather while six days versus one or two days retention time may be advantageous for enhancing e coli decay and hence system microbial removal too long a dry period will also significantly change moisture levels and nutrient flux within the filter system e g higher water loss caused by plant transpiration and water use requirements this may reverse system performance mean e coli log reduction decreased significantly p 0 001 from a log reduction of 2 6 0 15 se to 1 08 0 18 se after 20 days of drying the systems received no inflow during this time fig 4 shows the comparison of e coli removal performance across the different plant species during run 1 wet conditions and run 2 dry conditions treatment performance of systems planted with carex appressa and miscanthus senensis were most affected given that a significant positive correlation was found between log e coli removal and effluent volume following 20 days drying r 0 600 p 0 004 the fact that these plants experienced higher water loss during this time thereby leading to lower percentages of antecedent clean sz water e g see fig 4b could help explain this difference across plant species however other factors may also be influencing performance during dry weather since the non vegetated controls had negligible water loss following the dry period and their performance was also similarly affected detachment of previously captured e coli from the filter media and associated biofilm during the dry period available for flushing in subsequent events could be contributing to the higher levels of outflow e coli compared to wet weather e g wang et al 2011 the shape of the outflow pollutograph was distinct for the 3 add event and 20 add event fig s2 the sharper increase in outflow e coli concentrations with volume in the 20 add event which was identical for all designs indicate that bacterial detachment could also be responsible for this biofilm detachment is a complex process typically initiated by stresses such as nutrient limitations changes in shear or changes in other environmental conditions when subjected to changes in nutrient flux cells become motile and detach wang et al 2011 another reason explaining the poorer performance during dry weather could be due to less competition of captured e coli with indigenous bacteria due to the latter s reduced metabolism zhang et al 2012 3 4 4 effect of cold conditions mean e coli log reduction decreased from 1 70 0 15 se to 1 38 0 15 following transfer into the cold room however this was not found to be statistically significant p 0 05 comparison between cool room and greenhouse control treatments fig 6 revealed a significant decrease in cool room set in the first sampling after transfer into the cool room run 4 p 0 019 however the performance of the treatments recovered in the second sampling after transfer into the cold room run 5 the higher log removal in run 5 after round 2 condition in fig 6 could be an artefact of the higher inflow concentration no difference was found between the cool room and greenhouse controls during this round zhang et al 2012 similarly found temperature to have no significant influence on e coli transport and capture in conventional bioretention media but their results showed captured bacteria to survive longer at lower temperatures likely due to reduced metabolism and growth of competing microbes for resources such as protozoa and heterotrophic bacteria the relationship between e coli reduction and ir was still significant under cold conditions yet ir was up to an order of magnitude lower in the cold room fig s3right the interactions between lower ir i e higher contact time and higher bacterial survival rates could have buffered against a more severe impact of e coli reduction performance 3 5 implications for plant selection the results of the present study point to the type of plant species being an important design factor governing nutrient and to a lesser extent e coli removal under different climatic conditions importantly plant selection criteria for systems having as objective nutrient management e g for ecosystem protection will be different from those implemented for faecal removal e g for stormwater harvesting in wet climates mature plant species with a fine root network which is able to scavenge or occupy a significant proportion of the soil will benefit nitrogen removal in stormwater biofilters however in drier climates the same plant species may start leaching significant amounts of nitrogen due to higher water loss i e resource use hence opting for a mix of species remains the most effective approach this means that species that are most resource intensive will likely be planted at a minimum density in regions experiencing long periods of dry weather spells in cold climates nutrient removal is expected to be comparatively poorer if the same level of stormwater pollution is generated in the catchment furthermore nutrient removal effectiveness under cold temperatures depended on the type of plant species proper plant selection may thus be even more critical for nutrient removal in regions experiencing cold winters it is expected that some plant species will go in a state of dormancy during this time including deciduous trees such as gingko biloba it is also possible that species other than those tested in the present study may thrive better under those conditions the results also indicate that a mix of plant species may ensure higher level of system resilience under climate variability species mixtures might also be preferred for aesthetic and ecological reasons i e for maintenance of biodiversity in the urban landscape read et al 2008 in the case of e coli removal though there were other critical factors that are dictating the variation in performance across the different operational conditions an effect of the type of plant species could also not be ignored for e g in drier climates plant species with higher water use such as miscanthus senensis and carex appressa will result in lower treatment performance compared to those with moderate to low water use additionally given that retention time with the sz can contribute to higher removal performance systems with long water residence times may benefit with plant species with anti microbial properties galbraith et al 2019 4 conclusion four distinct plant species were tested for their ability to reduce nutrients and e coli under a range of climatic conditions in stormwater biofiltration systems species varied significantly in their nitrogen removal efficiency ranging in the order of 45 to 80 the effect of operating conditions including 4 weeks of drying and cold temperatures on removal was species specific with the exception of miscanthus sinensis all plant species were more impacted by the cold temperature compared to 4 weeks drying the presence of a submerged zone might have helped maintain moisture levels which avoided a more severe impact on removal efficiency miscanthus sinensis was found to be a better performer than the australian gold standard carex appressa it was also cold resistant given this species specific observation and the fact that nitrogen removal is influenced by plant activity as well as the associated microbial community an understanding of the abundance and diversity of microbes surrounding the rhizosphere of each biofilter plant species can help guide future design to optimise treatment faecal indicator organisms e coli removal was variable and more heavily impacted upon by the 4 weeks of drying compared to the cold conditions the low infiltration rates in the cold may have helped maintain treatment by increasing the hydraulic residence time while plant type did not influence e coli removal efficiency in this study the different factors found to influence removal such as infiltration rate i e the hydraulic retention time during an event as well as the retention time within the sz allowing for inter event die off could be optimised through

4144,this study investigates how deep learning can be configured to optimise the prediction of 2d maximum water depth maps in urban pluvial flood events a neural network model is trained to exploit patterns in hyetographs as well as in topographical data with the specific aim of enabling fast predictions of flood depths for observed rain events and spatial locations that have not been included in the training dataset a neural network architecture that is widely used for image segmentation u net is adapted for this purpose key novelties are a systematic investigation of which spatial inputs should be provided to the deep learning model which hyper parametrization optimizes predictive performance and a systematic evaluation of prediction performance for locations and rain events that were not considered in training we find that a spatial input dataset of only 5 variables that describe local terrain shape and imperviousness is optimal to generate predictions of water depth neural network architectures with between 97 000 and 260 000 000 parameters are tested and a model with 28 000 000 parameters is found optimal u flood is demonstrated to yield similar predictive performance as existing screening approaches even though the assessment is performed for natural rain events and in locations unknown to the network and flood predictions are generated within seconds improvements can likely be obtained by ensuring a balanced representation of temporal and spatial rainfall patterns in the training dataset further improved spatial input datasets and by linking u flood to dynamic sewer system models keywords urban pluvial flooding deep learning convolutional neural network hydrodynamic modelling emulation 1 introduction maps of pluvial urban flood hazard with high resolutions finer than 10 m are used for planning city layouts and water infrastructure as well as in flood warning systems that are used to direct emergency services for planning purposes it is increasingly recognized that a variety of flood adaptation options need to be evaluated in a variety of scenarios of for example climate change and city development to identify cost effective and robust solutions bach et al 2020 löwe et al 2017 webber et al 2019 participatory planning approaches voinov et al 2016 require fast and easy to use flood screening solutions that enable non experts such as architects to assess hazards for different city layouts in addition flood warning systems need to generate hazard maps from rainfall forecasts within a few minutes and possibly also quantify the effect of uncertain rainfall forecasts hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 li and willems 2020 meneses et al 2015 hydrodynamic models are the state of the art for the assessment of urban pluvial flood hazard and are available in a variety of commercial software packages deltares 2017 dhi 2016 innovyze 2020 these models dynamically simulate the movement of water on the terrain surface in space and time and are frequently linked to a dynamic simulation of water movement in the sewer network all of the applications named in the previous paragraph demand short simulation times that are difficult to achieve with these models a number of screening methods were therefore developed following the classification in jamali et al 2019 these can be divided into approaches that distribute surface water through a network of connected topographic depressions balstrøm and crawford 2018 jamali et al 2018 scalgo 2020 and approaches that apply cellular automata to distribute water on a raster surface guidolin et al 2016 jamali et al 2019 these approaches can achieve substantial speedup factors up to 1000 but they are challenged by not considering time dynamics thus they have difficulties in distinguishing for example the effects of rain events with the same rainfall depth but different hyetographs approaches that do consider time dynamics achieve lower speedup factors in the order of 2 to 8 guidolin et al 2016 a third group of screening approaches that address flood hazard from a data driven rather than a conceptual viewpoint has arisen in recent years roughly these can be grouped into approaches that predict flood hazard based on rainfall input only and approaches that consider physical catchment characteristics as input to the model the former group of models can only be applied for locations that were included in the training dataset recent examples for such approaches are berkhahn et al 2019 who successfully trained feed forward neural networks against urban pluvial flood maps generated by a hydrodynamic model bermúdez et al 2018 who used a combination of feed forward networks to detect flooding from the sewer system and simulate maximum flood volume which is then used to choose a discrete pre simulated flood map and kabir et al 2020 and lin et al 2020 who predicted fluvial urban flood maps using convolutional and feed forward neural networks respectively data driven approaches can also consider static catchment properties as input and in this way be used to generate predictions for areas that were not included in the training dataset kratzert et al 2019 were able to outperform established hydrological models in such a setting when simulating river flows using long short term memory neural networks urban pluvial flooding occurs scattered throughout a city and data driven prediction models therefore need to consider rather large amounts of data that characterize the urban layout deep learning in particular using convolutional neural networks can extract spatio temporal features from data and is therefore attractive for predicting pluvial flood hazards originally developed for computer vision e g he et al 2016 isola et al 2017 ronneberger et al 2015 these techniques were also successfully applied for a number of problems in earth sciences reichstein et al 2019 and related applications such as wind power prediction zhu et al 2020 examples from hydrology include pham et al 2020 who used deep belief networks which based on 15 discrete input variables that characterize the catchments classify the degree to which a location is susceptible to flooding and zhao et al 2020 who used convolutional neural networks with 9 continuous input variables for the same purpose considering the prediction of pluvial flood water depths in urban areas guo et al 2021 trained a convolutional autoencoder with 4 input variables describing topography against 2d flood depth maps that were simulated by a hydrodynamic model in a similar setting zahura et al 2020 trained random forest regression models that predict flood water depth on discrete street sections based on 3 variables that characterize topography extending the aforementioned work our study makes three main contributions 1 we use deep learning to predict flooding for locations and rain events that have not been included in the training dataset and we only consider historical hyetographs for training and validation while studies focussing on flood susceptibility validated their models on datasets that included new locations the studies focussing on pluvial urban flood depths tested their models for rain events that were not considered in the training datasets but not new locations an out of sample evaluation of prediction performance is therefore not available so far in addition many of the existing flood screening tools berkhahn et al 2019 jamali et al 2019 thrysøe et al 2021 were only tested on design storms which may lead to optimistic conclusions 2 we perform a comprehensive evaluation of which spatial input variables should be considered in the deep learning model when predicting 2d flood maps studies that considered comprehensive sets of input variable candidates focused on flood susceptibility in natural catchments avand et al 2020 pham et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 i e not water depth maps and a larger spatial scale than for the urban case studies focusing on water depth prediction in urban areas have not considered topographic input berkhahn et al 2019 or focussed on a very limited set of variables guo et al 2021 zahura et al 2020 only zahura et al 2020 evaluated the importance of different input features however in a context of predicting water depth on selected street segments instead of 2d flood maps 3 we systematically analyse the predictive performance of different deep learning configurations with varying complexity while the studies focussing on flood susceptibility did perform meta optimization or compared different network architectures avand et al 2020 pham et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 this assessment is missing for the prediction of pluvial urban flood maps the aim of our study was to develop a deep learning network that can be used to predict 2d maps of maximum flood depth based on readily available geodata and rainfall input if successful this approach enables the creation of fast and accurate flood screening tools that can be trained based on a limited number of simulations from detailed physical models and that avoid problems in distinguishing effects from rain events with similar rainfall depth but different hyetographs to facilitate further research based on our work we exclusively used openly available geodata for training the deep learning models that we made available along with our computer code 2 material and methods to create a deep learning approach for predicting pluvial flood hazards we proceeded in three steps 1 identify the spatial input variables that are likely to yield the best prediction of flood hazard from a set of potential variables 2 evaluate the required complexity of the neural network to achieve reliable flood predictions 3 validate the predictive performance of the network in a k fold cross validation procedure to obtain a reliable estimate of out of sample prediction capacity note that in steps 1 and 2 model performance was also evaluated on a validation dataset using a simple holdout procedure in the following subsections we first describe the considered case area and training data then we illustrate the applied deep learning setup and finally we describe which experiments were performed in each of the three steps outlined above and how model performance was assessed 2 1 materials 2 1 1 case area flood simulations and geodata we considered the city of odense in denmark as a case study the city has approximately 200 000 inhabitants and is located in a typical moraine landscape close to the sea we obtained terrain and landuse data from the danish geodata portal kortforsyningen agency for data supply and efficiency 2020 agency for data supply and efficiency and danish municipalities 2020 fig 1 shows the study area the entire area covered 3740 4273 pixels in a resolution of 5 m this resolution was deemed sufficient for flood screening purposes berkhahn et al 2019 löwe and arnbjerg nielsen 2020 and was applied for all datasets in the hydrodynamic simulation as well as the neural networks elevations in the terrain dataset were raised by 5 m in building locations only the urban areas highlighted red and blue in fig 1 were considered when training and validating the neural networks as the focus of the study was pluvial urban flood hazard further flooded areas related to natural streams and marine flooding were excluded from the analysis as these types of flooding are related to different physical processes and spatio temporal scales than pluvial flooding the area was subdivided into 119 squares to mark areas for model validation squares marked in red were used for validation in steps 1 and 2 of the model development procedure while random subsets of all 119 squares were used for validation in step 3 sections 2 1 3 and 2 2 4 we performed hydrodynamic flood simulations in 2d for the entire area shown in fig 1 using mike 21 dhi 2016 following the same approach as guo et al 2021 kaspersen et al 2017 and webber et al 2019 we considered rainfall on each pixel of the 2d surface and performed a runoff computation for each individual pixel as outlined in the following for each pixel the pervious and impervious area inside the pixel was computed assuming that buildings and roads are 100 impervious and that all other areas are pervious we assumed a wetting loss of 0 6 mm for each rain event a maximum sewer system capacity of 12 mm hr for precipitation on impervious areas webber 2019 and a constant infiltration capacity of 29 3 mm hr for precipitation on pervious areas kaspersen et al 2017 in each simulation time step 1 s separate effective precipitation rates were computed for pervious and impervious areas by subtracting the above losses from the observed rainfall in each pixel the two effective precipitation rates were multiplied by the impervious and pervious area inside the pixel and then summed up to obtain the total runoff from the pixel subsequently runoff was then routed over the terrain surface by the 2d hydrodynamic simulation this approach to runoff computation generates realistic flood maps that can be used to demonstrate the feasibility of our deep learning approach the sewer system however is represented in a simplified manner that does not necessarily reflect the effect of for example bottlenecks in the sewer pipes we have chosen this approach because it enables us to make all the data used in our study accessible this would not be the case when performing 1d 2d flood simulations where proprietary information on the sewer network is required hydrodynamic simulations were performed for each of the 53 rain events described in the following section fig 1 shows an example of the generated flood maps when training the deep learning models for the prediction of flood depths we set any flood depths below 0 05 m to 0 as these water depths are not relevant for neither economic damage assessments nor warning systems we have in addition removed puddles defined as flooded areas consisting of less than 5 connected pixels by applying a sieve filter gdal development team 2020 terrain data used for the simulations and flood maps are available from löwe 2021 2 1 2 rainfall data we considered rainfall observations in 1 min resolution from ten rain gauges distributed across denmark that have been in continuous operation for at least 40 years for each of the stations we identified rain events rain events were defined to start when a dry weather threshold for the rain intensity of 0 1 mm h was exceeded and to end when this threshold had not been exceeded for at least six hours from each station we extracted the five rain events with the highest average rainfall intensity over a 30 min period where events were observed at multiple stations on the same day we kept only the most intense event this process resulted in a dataset of 43 rain events that were assumed representative for the types of events that can lead to pluvial flooding in denmark a data driven model needs to not only predict flood depth in extreme events but also to distinguish events when flooding does or does not occur we have therefore extended the rainfall dataset with an additional 10 events with medium to small rain intensities these events had maximum rain intensities of 10 to 30 mm hr averaged over a 30 min period one such event was manually selected from each station resulting in a total of 53 events section s1 in the supporting information includes a table of key characteristics for each of the rain events a time series plot of rain intensities for each event as well as a histogram of the rain intensities in the dataset rain intensities were averaged to 10 min intervals to limit the required storage for the hydrodynamic simulations where rainfall input needed to be provided as a time series of 2d maps each with a spatial extent of 3740x4273 pixels 2 1 3 training and validation data our dataset consisted of 53 flood maps covering the entire study area shown in fig 1 one map per rain event for training and validation the network was presented with square snapshots of these maps that had a fixed spatial extent of 256x256 pixels 5 m resolution for pixels outside the simulation area neither red nor blue in fig 1 both input and output data were set to zero the procedures for generating training and validation datasets for steps 1 and 2 of the model development procedure are outlined below separate datasets were generated for cross validation in step 3 as detailed in section 2 2 4 2 1 3 1 training dataset the training dataset was created by randomly sampling combinations of rain events and spatial patches of 256x256 pixels other than the so called squares used for validation see below these patches were placed randomly throughout the simulation area we sampled 10 000 times by a randomly selecting one of the 48 rain events not used for validation with repetition i e irrespective of whether the event was selected in a previous iteration b sampling a patch 256x256 pixels at a random location anywhere in the study area we then checked if the patch contained if the patch contained areas outside the blue areas in fig 1 such areas were either not part of the simulation area or part of the validation data red in fig 1 and should not be used for training input data and flood depths were set to 0 in the corresponding pixels if the patch contained less than 20 valid pixels it was discarded and a new patch was sampled otherwise the patch was added to the training dataset the 10 000 patches corresponded to randomly located extracts of the 48 flood maps each patch covered a unique part of the study area but overlapped with other patches similar data augmentation procedures are commonly applied in image classification to reduce over fitting rawat and wang 2017 the supporting information s4 contains an illustration of how often different parts of the study area were sampled in the training dataset 2 1 3 2 validation dataset for steps 1 and 2 of the model development procedure we sub divided the study area into 119 squares of 256x256 pixels with fixed locations fig 1 all squares contained at least 20 pixels inside the simulation area blue and red in fig 1 subsequently we a randomly selected 29 of these squares 1 4 of the study area marked red in fig 1 b manually selected five rain events that reflected varying rain intensities and temporal rainfall patterns we have highlighted these events in table s1 in the supporting information flood maps within the 29 squares were never presented to the neural network in the training phase in any rain event similarly flood maps for the five rain events were never presented during training in any location model validation was thus performed on locations and rain events that were unknown to the network in total the validation dataset consisted of 29 5 145 flood maps 2 2 data driven model development 2 2 1 modelling setup fig 2 illustrates the deep learning setup applied in our study 2d arrays of spatial inputs with a fixed extent of 256 256 pixels are processed through an encoder decoder structure consisting of pairs of convolutional layers panel a rainfall input is pre processed and concatenated at the bottleneck of the spatial convolution panel b after the last decoding block the network generates a prediction of maximum water depth in each individual pixel of within the considered patch for a given rain event the overall structure resembles the framework proposed by guo et al 2021 but we have made a number of distinct changes 1 skip connections concatenate the output from an encoding block in the spatial convolution to the input of the corresponding decoding block thus bypassing encoding steps in the deeper parts of the network skip connections were demonstrated to support smooth objective function landscapes and thus better convergence of deep neural networks li et al 2018 with this modification the spatial convolution in our framework strongly resembles the u net architecture ronneberger et al 2015 which is widely applied for image segmentation 2 we converted the input rainfall series into a set of 9 rain event characteristics before feeding it into the neural network preliminary work showed that such characterizations in combination with simple feed forward networks böhm 2020 eriksen and dichmann 2019 achieve strong performance in predicting flood extents directly feeding the rainfall series into a dense layer guo et al 2021 leads to an excessive number of parameters when long rain events should be considered up to 34 h in our dataset and creates difficulties during training when the rainfall peak does not always occur at the same time point in the rain series 3 we applied average pooling amidi and amidi 2019 in the encoding part of our network as it yielded stronger performance in initial tests supporting information section s6 than the maximum pooling applied in other works guo et al 2021 ronneberger et al 2015 we considered three hyper parameters for our setup d depth of the network corresponds to the number of encoding decoding steps bf number of filters considered in the convolutional layers of the first encoding step in line with similar architectures ronneberger et al 2015 the number of filters is increased by a factor of 2 in each encoding step we have however considered a maximum number of 512 filters to limit the computational requirements and k edge length in pixels of the kernels applied in the convolution operations leaky relu activation functions maas et al 2013 were considered for all layers with an activation threshold of 0 2 like other works with similar architectures badrinarayanan et al 2017 chattopadhyay et al 2020 höhlein et al 2020 we applied dropout regularization to the convolutional layers with a dropout rate of 0 5 a patch size of 256x256 pixels 1280x1280m was considered for the spatial input data and the generated flood maps this size is frequently applied with convolutional networks because it is a power of 2 and repeated pooling operations that divide the size of the images by 2 can thus be performed without padding the pooling outputs patches with an edge length of above one kilometer should be sufficiently large to capture the most important effects leading to urban pluvial flooding that occurs on a very local scale löwe et al 2020 while at the same time being sufficiently small to not cause memory problems during model training a potential downside of working with fixed size images is that hydrological objects such as sinks will be cut off when located near the edge of a patch this problem is mitigated by considering training patches that are not placed regularly as in fig 1 but randomly throughout the study area 2 2 2 model development step 1 feature definition and selection 2 2 2 1 rainfall input urban pluvial flooding is linked to small spatial scales and short time scales the amount of runoff varies depending on the shape and intensity of the specific rain event e g davidsen et al 2017 müller et al 2017 these characteristics need to be provided to enable the neural network to distinguish the effects of different rain events urban hydrologists have a long tradition of characterizing natural rain events with standardized characteristics that can be used to test the design of sewer systems with representative design storms jean et al 2018 inspired by rainfall characterizations from german design guidelines wartalska et al 2020 used the following set of statistics to characterize the temporal distribution of rain depths during an event which we have considered as input to our model r p time index of the rainfall peak relative to the total duration of the event r cg time index of the median accumulated rainfall relative to the total duration of the event m 1 ratio of cumulative precipitation before vs after the rainfall peak m 2 ratio of maximum rain intensity 10 min interval vs total rainfall depth m 3 ratio of rainfall depth in the first third of an event vs total rainfall depth m 5 ratio of rainfall depth in the first half of an event vs total rainfall depth n i ratio of maximum rain intensity 10 min interval vs average rain intensity in addition to the above we included the accumulated rainfall depth p tot and its duration dur to characterize the magnitude and duration of an event the statistics computed for each rain event are available in section s1 of the supporting material 2 2 2 2 spatial input when training a neural network against maximum water depth maps the network does not learn the dynamics of water movement on terrain and spatial inputs that condense the hydrological characteristics of the catchment are likely to yield higher predictive power than elevation data alone based on expert reasoning and previous studies we defined a set of 11 spatial variables that we considered potentially relevant for the prediction of urban pluvial flooding in a data driven model table 1 summarizes these variables and the reasoning for their inclusion common for all input variables was that they must be possible to derive from geodata using standard raster processing operations to ensure that the deep learning model once fitted can be readily applied to new locations several spatial datasets were characterized by long tailed right skewed distributions where flood hazard does not change much whether the explanatory variable takes medium large or extreme values in line with standard mathematical modelling procedures brockhoff et al 2018 madsen 2008 we applied data transformations in these cases subsequently all variables were scaled to the intervals 1 1 if negative values were present and 0 1 otherwise visualizations of all variables are provided in the supporting information while the actual datasets can be obtained from löwe 2021 for the spatial inputs it is particularly relevant to consider only the datasets that actually improve prediction performance of the model too many model inputs will increase the computational demand in the training phase and the risk of overfitting based on the selection of input variables in table 1 we employed two approaches 1 spearman s ranked correlation dodge 2008 we computed the ranked correlation between simulated water depths and the input variables in table 1 the computation was done on a pixel by pixel basis for the entire area highlighted in fig 1 and a separate correlation coefficient was estimated for each of the considered rain events i e 53 correlation coefficients were obtained for each input variable this approach provided insight on whether an input variable would be directly related to simulated water depths in a monotonic manner however it could not provide information on whether a variable enhances the predictive capacity of another variable in addition the pixel by pixel comparisons imply that the method could not capture effects where the input variable for example needs to be aggregated in space before an impact on the water depths becomes clear 2 forward selection to address the above short comings we employed a procedure that was inspired by stepwise regression modelling procedures brockhoff et al 2018 pardoe et al 2020 we used the model illustrated in fig 2 with hyper parameters depth d 4 number of filters in the first encoding block bf 32 and kernel size k 3 this configuration was considered as a reasonable starting point as it performed well in initial tests and as it has a similar complexity as the setup employed by guo et al 2021 we trained 11 different neural networks with this configuration each of the them considering a single spatial input from table 1 we evaluated each networks predictive performance based on the scores described in section 2 3 and selected the one that performed best based on this network we created 10 new networks all of which considered the successful input from step 1 and one of the remaining 10 inputs the procedure was repeated until a subjective inspection of the results suggested that the inclusion of additional input variables no longer improves predictive performance on the validation dataset 2 2 3 model development step 2 network complexity to evaluate what is a parsimonious neural network for obtaining reliable predictions of flood water depth we performed a grid search on the hyper parameters listed in section 2 2 1 we varied the network depth d between 2 and 6 where a network with d 6 consists of 6 encoding blocks and six decoding blocks each consisting of two convolutional layers the number of filters bf in the first convolutional layer between 16 32 and 64 and the size k of the kernels applied in the convolution layers between 3 5 and 7 larger values for d and bf increase the number of parameters in the network that need to be estimated but increase its flexibility to reproduce patterns larger kernel sizes enable the convolutional layers to make use of spatial information from a larger area but strongly increase computational expense many recent popular network architectures employ k 3 chen et al 2018 he et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2015 the hyper parameter ranges outlined above led to neural networks that had from 97 000 up to 260 000 000 parameters that needed to be estimated 2 2 4 model development step 3 k fold cross validation to obtain a more robust estimate of predictive model performance we selected the best performing model architecture from step 2 and trained it in a k fold cross validation procedure with five folds for this purpose we created five non overlapping validation datasets each consisting of 10 rain events and 24 of the squares shown in fig 1 the squares were randomly assigned to the validation datasets a stratified sampling approach was applied for the rain events we sorted the rain events by their maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and then divided them into 10 groups each containing 5 events the three least intense events were not used for validation each of the 5 events in each group was then randomly assigned to a different validation set for each of the five folds a separate training dataset was sampled following the same procedure as outlined in section 2 1 3 we did again consider permutations of size n 10 000 2 2 5 objective function and optimization all networks were fitted by minimizing the mean squared error mse between the maximum depth flood maps predicted by the neural network and those generated in the hydrodynamic simulation in this process a square root transform was applied to the flood depths to reduce the skewedness of the distribution of simulated flood depths we applied the adam optimizer over 500 epochs as suggested by smith 2017 a triangular learning rate schedule was considered where the learning rate over a period of 10 epochs varied between an upper limit and a lower limit of 5 10 5 the upper limit exponentially decreased from a starting value of 10 3 as a function of 0 95 epochnumber the implementation of the learning rate scheduler is available in löwe 2021 the triangular learning rate could avoid divergence of the networks during initial tests where skip connections had not been implemented once a suitable architecture had been implemented it was not deemed essential 2 3 performance evaluation to assess the performance of the data driven models in the various steps of the model development procedure we compared maximum flood depth maps generated by the hydrodynamic simulation against flood maps predicted by the neural network and computed the score values shown in table 2 score values were computed considering only those pixels where either the hydrodynamic model hd or the neural network nn predicted flooding similar to jamali et al 2019 a depth threshold thr of 0 05 m was applied for all scores for the critical success index csi separate score values were computed for thresholds of 0 05 m and 0 3 m to distinguish prediction accuracy in areas with greater water depth 2 4 technical implementation neural networks were implemented in tensorflow version 2 3 1 abadi et al 2016 using the interface with python 3 8 2 model training was performed in a high performing computing environment using nvidia tesla v100 pcie gpu s with 16 and 32 gb memory 3 results 3 1 step 1 feature selection 3 1 1 spearman correlation fig 3 illustrates the ranked correlation coefficients between the candidate input datasets introduced in table 1 and the simulated water depths in the 53 considered rain events one correlation coefficient was computed per input dataset and per rain event not very surprisingly the figure suggests a clear correlation between the datasets characterising local deformations of the terrain and water depth pluvial flood water accumulates in local depressions and thus locations with elevations that are lower than the neighbourhood average dem l and locations inside sinks identified by positive values of sdepth as well as twi are good predictors of high water depths for the same reason we could identify a strong correlation between water depth and the curv dataset which distinguishes concave and convex regions of the terrain supporting information figure s12 in addition it was noticeable that dem l exhibits a substantially stronger correlation with water depth than dem slightly lower correlations were observed for the input variables that characterize the size of the upstream area contributing to the water flow at a given location flacc flimp flslo these variables should be useful to explain the amount of water and thus the frequency of flooding at a given location but the main flow paths form narrow lines in these datasets that are not linked to for example the extent of sinks in which water will spread out in a direct pixel to pixel comparison these variables therefore have lower predictive power in a similar manner slope can be used to identify flat regions where water is likely to accumulate and imp contains some information on the amount of runoff generated in an area but neither can be used to point out the exact extent and locations of the flood areas finally considering fig 3 the relationship between the asp variables and water depth would need to be assumed to be random the results in fig 3 have to be interpreted carefully with regards to choosing the inputs that should be included in the data driven model several of the input datasets are correlated e g sdepth dem l twi and are therefore less likely to supplement each other when combined in a predictive model further input data that do not exhibit correlation with the water depth maps in a pixel by pixel comparisons may increase the predictive power of other variables or gain predictive power due to spatial aggregation in the convolutional blocks of the neural network for example imp may be useful to distinguish the water depth in different sinks with similar sdepth values and the two asp datasets can only characterize the terrain when considered in combination 3 1 2 forward selection the aim of the forward selection procedure was to mitigate the limitations outlined in the previous section by assessing whether an input dataset actually increases the predictive power of a neural network fig 4 illustrates the score values computed in the different steps of this procedure in each panel the top row corresponds to the first step of the procedure network with only one input dataset and the colours in different columns illustrate the score value computed when considering the corresponding dataset as model input the second row then shows the results for the second step of the procedure where the best performing input from step 1 was included in the model and combined with each of the other inputs note that we considered the two asp datasets as a single combined entity as their individual inclusion as input variables has no physical justification thus whenever asp was included in the model two datasets cosine and sine were included fig 4 illustrates that considering a model with only one type of spatial input the asp data yielded the best score values on the validation dataset in addition the dem variable yielded similar predictive power as the dem l variable these results are in direct contradiction to the conclusions drawn based on fig 3 however the neural network can process information in a different way than the pixel by pixel comparisons performed when computing spearman correlation or similar measures such as information gain e g pham et al 2020 this underlines that it is important not to solely rely on such measures when choosing the inputs for deep learning algorithms the asp data are at an advantage over other variables as they are represented by two separate datasets and thus provide greater flexibility to represent different trends nevertheless these data consistently yielded an improvement in predictive power also in experiments where we added them to models with other inputs not documented and they were also selected as a key input for modelling water depths by guo et al 2021 as the selection process proceeded we obtained slight improvements in predictive power we were not able to achieve a further increase in predictive power once five datasets had been included in the model and stopped the process at this point the selected input datasets were in this order asp sdepth flslo imp and curv in the evaluation of predictive power we focused on panels a c in fig 4 while the ratio of total flooded areas was considered only for information reasons all neural networks consistently underestimated the total flooded area see section 3 4 networks that performed better in terms of total flooded area usually achieved this improvement at the cost of an increased number of false predictions and thus a reduced prediction skill fig 4 further highlights the correlation between the four datasets characterizing surface flow paths neither twi flimp or flacc yielded improved prediction skill once flslo had been included in the model for reference we considered a model where principal component analysis was used to reduce the number of spatial inputs from 11 to 7 orthogonal datasets this model yielded comparable performance as the one obtained by forward selection supporting information s6 3 2 step 2 optimization of hyper parameters and residual analysis 3 2 1 effect of hyper parameters on model performance fig 5 shows cs i 0 05 m values computed for different combinations of the hyper parameter values k bf and d considering a water depth threshold thr 0 05 m fig 6 illustrates the training time per epoch for the same combinations of hyper parameters a total of 45 hyper parameter combinations was considered with training times that for 500 epochs ranged from 6 5 h to 5 days the variation of rmse scores for different hyper parameter settings is consistent with cs i 0 05 m an overview of all score values for different hyper parameter combinations is enclosed in the supporting information section s5 from fig 5 and fig 6 it is clear that kernel edge lengths k 3 do not in general improve the predictive performance of the network while increasing the computational expense when considering small network depths d 2 and 3 a small increase of csi with increasing kernel sizes was apparent for some models the probable reason would be that larger kernel sizes increase the region over which the network can perform spatial aggregation which is otherwise quite limited for shallow networks the trend was however not very pronounced an increasing number of filters in the convolutional layers parameter bf generally improved the model results but the computational expense also increased roughly linearly with the number of filters we experienced memory issues when considering bf 64 and have therefore considered this as an upper limit increasing network depth generally led to higher csi values however this was generally only true until depths in d 4 or 5 deeper networks were over fitted and thus led to lower csi values for bf 16 we also tested greater network depths d 7 which however led to a further decline in performance compared to d 6 supporting information s5 the best performing model was identified to have parameters k 3 bf 64 and d 5 this model can perform spatial aggregation over a region of approximately 500x500m löwe and arnbjerg nielsen 2020 could obtain robust estimates of average imperviousness in an urban area from high resolution building data at a similar spatial scale 3 2 2 flood maps and residual analysis fig 7 compares predicted maximum water depths generated by mike 21 and the neural network with k 3 bf 64 and d 5 the displayed water depths were taken from the validation dataset for rain event no 10 for an area in the centre of odense areas where the neural network failed to predicted water depths 0 05 m are highlighted red while areas where the neural network falsely predicted water depths 0 05 m are highlighted yellow fig 8 shows pixel wise nse values computed for the validation rain events for the same area as in fig 7 and for a more rural area from the two figures several characteristics of the neural network predictions are evident 1 the neural network did not predict water depths that are entirely unreasonable we did also not identify any such issues in other locations or for other rain events this is important because the mathematical formulation of the neural network does not account for physical constraints such as mass balances 2 the neural network could identify hotspots of flooding where water accumulates and it did also generate accurate predictions of water levels in these locations 3 the network was not able to accurately represent shallow flooding along transport stretches i e outside sinks this behaviour is particularly evident from fig 8 where low nse values cluster along roads and flow paths leading through backyards and it explains the consistent underestimation of total flooded area by the neural network fig 4 the five input datasets considered in this model were thus not sufficient to identify these locations to characterize the behaviour of the model in different rain events we plotted the water volumes that the sinks or terrain depressions in our validation dataset contained based on the maximum water depths predicted by the neural network nn and the hydrodynamic model mike 21 hd fig 9 we plotted blue spot volumes for all five rain events in the validation dataset but only three of the events generated flooding in either of the models this implies that the neural network was able to determine that no flooding should occur in events no 44 and 47 this was the case even though these events had rather high maximum rain intensities of 34 and 16 mm hr averaged over a 30 min period however while the predictions of water volumes could be considered accurate for event no 9 and 10 we could also identify a clear underestimation of water volumes in event 39 this event had a maximum rain intensity of 42 mm hr averaged over a 30 min period several events with such intensities were included in the training dataset however event 39 was characterized by two pronounced rainfall peaks with similar intensity it was the only event with this characteristic in our dataset and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the network simply did not learn to distinguish this type of rain event 3 3 step 3 k fold cross validation table 3 shows the score values computed for the water depth predictions generated by the neural networks in the 5 fold cross validation approach and compares them against the score values obtained for the best performing model in step 2 of the model development procedure a clear increase in prediction error can be observed when comparing the score values obtained during model validation in the five folds against the best performing model from step 2 the same hyper parameters were considered in both steps and all models were trained on 10 000 patches however in step 3 these patches were sampled from a smaller number of rain events but a bigger part of the study area than in step 2 the increased error can thus be attributed to an insufficient representation of rainfall patterns in the training phase which underlines the need to present the network with a representative sample of rain events in the training phase 4 discussion 4 1 model configuration and performance our results show similar rmse scores 0 08 m for predicted flood water depths as existing screening approaches jamali et al 2019 with lower csi scores in the order of 0 5 it should be noted that our results were obtained for natural rain events and locations not considered in the training phase unlike other studies which focused on artificial design storms jamali et al 2019 jamali et al 2018 or known locations guo et al 2021 water depths in depressions were generally predicted well while the prediction of shallow flooding on surface flow paths outside depressions remains a challenge the forward selection procedure resulted in a model with five spatial input datasets this procedure can account for interactions between variables and exploit the neural networks ability to perform spatial aggregation it is therefore preferred over methods that perform one variable at a time comparisons between model inputs and the output variable such as ranked correlation or mutual information it was also clear that considering too many model inputs increased the prediction error of the neural network due to overfitting in the training phase note that the forward selection procedure is not exhaustive it adds variables one at a time and may therefore not discover all relevant combinations of variables in addition the selection of model inputs and hyper parameters is entangled because different models can exploit spatial information in different ways more extensive procedures for selecting input variables and hyper parameters will however pose computational challenges our model was able to accurately predict water depths for many rain events as well as to distinguish situations where no flooding should occur however the increased prediction error for the double peak event no 39 also illustrated a vulnerability in appropriately capturing the temporal dynamics of the rain events the number of rain events that could be considered in the training dataset is limited because time consuming hydrodynamic simulations need to be performed for each rain event and because the best performing network with d 5 k 3 and bf 64 required a training time of up to 35 h for 500 epochs using a high end gpu other studies applying data driven models with a similar complexity have similarly not considered this issue berkhahn et al 2019 guo et al 2021 zahura et al 2020 or focused on temporal resolutions of one day and above pham et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 different ways of specifying rainfall input to the neural network may also lead to higher prediction performance of the model based on previous experiences böhm 2020 eriksen and dichmann 2019 we experimented with neural networks that considered statistical rainfall characteristics based on average rain intensities for varying time intervals as well as with 1d convolutional layers that extract temporal patterns from the rainfall time series none of these so far yielded a better model performance than the setup outlined in fig 2 supporting information s6 4 2 technical modelling setup in line with the common approach for image segmentation and previous work of guo et al 2021 we have applied a modelling setup that generates predictions of water depth for a fixed size patch of 256x256 pixels this approach is counter intuitive from a hydrological perspective because hydrological features such as flow paths or sinks will be cut on the edge of the image it is important to note that the model input inside an image is calculated based on the entire catchment before it is provided to the network for example flow accumulation values will not be affected by the cutting operation because they are calculated on the entire terrain dataset not on the 256x256 patch in the prediction phase the prediction window can be flexibly positioned in the desired location in principle the convolutional network enables the consideration of images of varying sizes in the training and the prediction phase the image size could then be adjusted to the hydrological features in a specific location however challenges in setting up efficient input pipelines for the neural network may arise 4 3 limitations u flood was trained based on hydrodynamic simulation results generated for a city in a moraine coastal landscape the hydrodynamic simulations considered a uniform distribution of rainfall in space a simplified representation of the sewer system in the form of reducing the effective rainfall and a constant uniform infiltration rate for runoff computation on green areas in addition we excluded fluvial flooding from the training data these factors limit the transferability of u flood in its current configuration as outlined below 1 different landscape types e g alpine different soil conditions the consideration of varying infiltration rates requires an additional spatial input dataset that was not included in our work training the model for different infiltration rates would also enable the consideration of antecedent rainfall which reduces the infiltration capacity of the soil davidsen et al 2017a different landscape types might require revisiting the spatial input variables to the model for example terrain slope may well play a more prominent role in alpine regions than in our study 2 non uniform distribution of rainfall in space u flood uses simple rainfall statistics or alternatively 1d hyetographs as input to predict flood depth this approach cannot be used when spatial variations of rainfall are relevant instead setups that learn spatiotemporal rainfall dynamics would likely be required e g zhu et al 2020 and training efforts would increase substantially note that u flood was trained to predict pluvial flooding in catchments with extents in the order of 2 km at such scales spatially uniform rainfall is commonly assumed for flood screening in infrastructure design and weather models as input to flood warning systems hardly generate forecasts with resolutions finer than some km 3 non uniform sewer system capacity we assumed that the sewer system has a capacity of 12 mm h in all locations in the catchment this assumption will not be valid in many situations a more dynamic consideration of network capacity could be achieved by training u flood to consider surcharge volumes from a 1d sewer model as input similar to jamali et al 2019 jamali et al 2018 this could be implemented by considering a spatial input dataset where flow paths are weighted according to the surcharge volume encountered along the flow path similar to flslo and it would also allow for the consideration of spatial rainfall variation in the 1d sewer model 4 4 outlook as outlined in the previous section future research should focus on generating increased training datasets that make u flood applicable to a wider range of situations technical improvements to consider are in particular the development of spatial input data that yield information on shallow water depths on flow paths e g elevation above the nearest flow path or potential water depth based on rough manning calculations as demonstrated by thrysøe et al 2021 and the implementation of stratified sampling schemes that consider the temporal dynamics of rain events finer model resolutions than 5 m are relevant for many practical situations and could be achieved with multi scale neural networks nah et al 2017 that process different input datasets at different resolutions finally deep learning offers the possibility to consider multiple reference datasets when training we can therefore envision models that learn from both hydrodynamic simulations and sparse flood observations possibly enabling the calibration of flood models across catchments 5 conclusions we have presented a setup for predicting urban pluvial flood hazards in high resolution and on short time scales using convolutional neural networks that are inspired by the widely applied u net architecture based on our results we draw the following conclusions 1 neural networks that consider topographic inputs can be used for predicting pluvial flood hazards also in spatial locations and for rain events that were not included in the training dataset because they learn to associate terrain properties with the likelihood of flood occurrence 2 the spatial input data provided to the neural network need to be selected in a setting that is similar to the final model used for prediction this ensures that interactions between different input datasets and the ability of the neural network to perform spatial aggregation are considered when selecting input data 3 neural networks with topographic input data need to be designed in a parsimonious manner too many input datasets lead to overfitting and increased prediction error in our study a combination of five datasets describing terrain aspect and curvature the depth of terrain depressions imperviousness and flow accumulation yielded the best performing model 4 deeper networks improve prediction accuracy only up to a certain level in our study this level was reached with a model that had 28 million trainable parameters once trained this network generated predictions of maximum water depth for an area of 1280x1280 m in less than one second 5 the rain events presented to the neural network during training need to reflect the range of rain events for which the model should generate predictions this applies not only for event depth and intensities but also the temporal evolution of events the computational demands for training deep neural networks limit the number of rain events than can be considered thus creating a demand for stratified sampling schemes that consider the temporal evolution of events our study contributes to a so far limited literature where only two studies have applied similar approaches for predicting 2d urban flood maps in high resolution and on short time scales and no evaluations of a large set of potential model inputs and of predictive performance on historical rainfall data are available interesting opportunities arise for example by considering our setup to train neural networks for flood prediction based on a simultaneous consideration of simulation results and flood observations from different cities or by using u flood to minimize the number of

4144,this study investigates how deep learning can be configured to optimise the prediction of 2d maximum water depth maps in urban pluvial flood events a neural network model is trained to exploit patterns in hyetographs as well as in topographical data with the specific aim of enabling fast predictions of flood depths for observed rain events and spatial locations that have not been included in the training dataset a neural network architecture that is widely used for image segmentation u net is adapted for this purpose key novelties are a systematic investigation of which spatial inputs should be provided to the deep learning model which hyper parametrization optimizes predictive performance and a systematic evaluation of prediction performance for locations and rain events that were not considered in training we find that a spatial input dataset of only 5 variables that describe local terrain shape and imperviousness is optimal to generate predictions of water depth neural network architectures with between 97 000 and 260 000 000 parameters are tested and a model with 28 000 000 parameters is found optimal u flood is demonstrated to yield similar predictive performance as existing screening approaches even though the assessment is performed for natural rain events and in locations unknown to the network and flood predictions are generated within seconds improvements can likely be obtained by ensuring a balanced representation of temporal and spatial rainfall patterns in the training dataset further improved spatial input datasets and by linking u flood to dynamic sewer system models keywords urban pluvial flooding deep learning convolutional neural network hydrodynamic modelling emulation 1 introduction maps of pluvial urban flood hazard with high resolutions finer than 10 m are used for planning city layouts and water infrastructure as well as in flood warning systems that are used to direct emergency services for planning purposes it is increasingly recognized that a variety of flood adaptation options need to be evaluated in a variety of scenarios of for example climate change and city development to identify cost effective and robust solutions bach et al 2020 löwe et al 2017 webber et al 2019 participatory planning approaches voinov et al 2016 require fast and easy to use flood screening solutions that enable non experts such as architects to assess hazards for different city layouts in addition flood warning systems need to generate hazard maps from rainfall forecasts within a few minutes and possibly also quantify the effect of uncertain rainfall forecasts hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 li and willems 2020 meneses et al 2015 hydrodynamic models are the state of the art for the assessment of urban pluvial flood hazard and are available in a variety of commercial software packages deltares 2017 dhi 2016 innovyze 2020 these models dynamically simulate the movement of water on the terrain surface in space and time and are frequently linked to a dynamic simulation of water movement in the sewer network all of the applications named in the previous paragraph demand short simulation times that are difficult to achieve with these models a number of screening methods were therefore developed following the classification in jamali et al 2019 these can be divided into approaches that distribute surface water through a network of connected topographic depressions balstrøm and crawford 2018 jamali et al 2018 scalgo 2020 and approaches that apply cellular automata to distribute water on a raster surface guidolin et al 2016 jamali et al 2019 these approaches can achieve substantial speedup factors up to 1000 but they are challenged by not considering time dynamics thus they have difficulties in distinguishing for example the effects of rain events with the same rainfall depth but different hyetographs approaches that do consider time dynamics achieve lower speedup factors in the order of 2 to 8 guidolin et al 2016 a third group of screening approaches that address flood hazard from a data driven rather than a conceptual viewpoint has arisen in recent years roughly these can be grouped into approaches that predict flood hazard based on rainfall input only and approaches that consider physical catchment characteristics as input to the model the former group of models can only be applied for locations that were included in the training dataset recent examples for such approaches are berkhahn et al 2019 who successfully trained feed forward neural networks against urban pluvial flood maps generated by a hydrodynamic model bermúdez et al 2018 who used a combination of feed forward networks to detect flooding from the sewer system and simulate maximum flood volume which is then used to choose a discrete pre simulated flood map and kabir et al 2020 and lin et al 2020 who predicted fluvial urban flood maps using convolutional and feed forward neural networks respectively data driven approaches can also consider static catchment properties as input and in this way be used to generate predictions for areas that were not included in the training dataset kratzert et al 2019 were able to outperform established hydrological models in such a setting when simulating river flows using long short term memory neural networks urban pluvial flooding occurs scattered throughout a city and data driven prediction models therefore need to consider rather large amounts of data that characterize the urban layout deep learning in particular using convolutional neural networks can extract spatio temporal features from data and is therefore attractive for predicting pluvial flood hazards originally developed for computer vision e g he et al 2016 isola et al 2017 ronneberger et al 2015 these techniques were also successfully applied for a number of problems in earth sciences reichstein et al 2019 and related applications such as wind power prediction zhu et al 2020 examples from hydrology include pham et al 2020 who used deep belief networks which based on 15 discrete input variables that characterize the catchments classify the degree to which a location is susceptible to flooding and zhao et al 2020 who used convolutional neural networks with 9 continuous input variables for the same purpose considering the prediction of pluvial flood water depths in urban areas guo et al 2021 trained a convolutional autoencoder with 4 input variables describing topography against 2d flood depth maps that were simulated by a hydrodynamic model in a similar setting zahura et al 2020 trained random forest regression models that predict flood water depth on discrete street sections based on 3 variables that characterize topography extending the aforementioned work our study makes three main contributions 1 we use deep learning to predict flooding for locations and rain events that have not been included in the training dataset and we only consider historical hyetographs for training and validation while studies focussing on flood susceptibility validated their models on datasets that included new locations the studies focussing on pluvial urban flood depths tested their models for rain events that were not considered in the training datasets but not new locations an out of sample evaluation of prediction performance is therefore not available so far in addition many of the existing flood screening tools berkhahn et al 2019 jamali et al 2019 thrysøe et al 2021 were only tested on design storms which may lead to optimistic conclusions 2 we perform a comprehensive evaluation of which spatial input variables should be considered in the deep learning model when predicting 2d flood maps studies that considered comprehensive sets of input variable candidates focused on flood susceptibility in natural catchments avand et al 2020 pham et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 i e not water depth maps and a larger spatial scale than for the urban case studies focusing on water depth prediction in urban areas have not considered topographic input berkhahn et al 2019 or focussed on a very limited set of variables guo et al 2021 zahura et al 2020 only zahura et al 2020 evaluated the importance of different input features however in a context of predicting water depth on selected street segments instead of 2d flood maps 3 we systematically analyse the predictive performance of different deep learning configurations with varying complexity while the studies focussing on flood susceptibility did perform meta optimization or compared different network architectures avand et al 2020 pham et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 this assessment is missing for the prediction of pluvial urban flood maps the aim of our study was to develop a deep learning network that can be used to predict 2d maps of maximum flood depth based on readily available geodata and rainfall input if successful this approach enables the creation of fast and accurate flood screening tools that can be trained based on a limited number of simulations from detailed physical models and that avoid problems in distinguishing effects from rain events with similar rainfall depth but different hyetographs to facilitate further research based on our work we exclusively used openly available geodata for training the deep learning models that we made available along with our computer code 2 material and methods to create a deep learning approach for predicting pluvial flood hazards we proceeded in three steps 1 identify the spatial input variables that are likely to yield the best prediction of flood hazard from a set of potential variables 2 evaluate the required complexity of the neural network to achieve reliable flood predictions 3 validate the predictive performance of the network in a k fold cross validation procedure to obtain a reliable estimate of out of sample prediction capacity note that in steps 1 and 2 model performance was also evaluated on a validation dataset using a simple holdout procedure in the following subsections we first describe the considered case area and training data then we illustrate the applied deep learning setup and finally we describe which experiments were performed in each of the three steps outlined above and how model performance was assessed 2 1 materials 2 1 1 case area flood simulations and geodata we considered the city of odense in denmark as a case study the city has approximately 200 000 inhabitants and is located in a typical moraine landscape close to the sea we obtained terrain and landuse data from the danish geodata portal kortforsyningen agency for data supply and efficiency 2020 agency for data supply and efficiency and danish municipalities 2020 fig 1 shows the study area the entire area covered 3740 4273 pixels in a resolution of 5 m this resolution was deemed sufficient for flood screening purposes berkhahn et al 2019 löwe and arnbjerg nielsen 2020 and was applied for all datasets in the hydrodynamic simulation as well as the neural networks elevations in the terrain dataset were raised by 5 m in building locations only the urban areas highlighted red and blue in fig 1 were considered when training and validating the neural networks as the focus of the study was pluvial urban flood hazard further flooded areas related to natural streams and marine flooding were excluded from the analysis as these types of flooding are related to different physical processes and spatio temporal scales than pluvial flooding the area was subdivided into 119 squares to mark areas for model validation squares marked in red were used for validation in steps 1 and 2 of the model development procedure while random subsets of all 119 squares were used for validation in step 3 sections 2 1 3 and 2 2 4 we performed hydrodynamic flood simulations in 2d for the entire area shown in fig 1 using mike 21 dhi 2016 following the same approach as guo et al 2021 kaspersen et al 2017 and webber et al 2019 we considered rainfall on each pixel of the 2d surface and performed a runoff computation for each individual pixel as outlined in the following for each pixel the pervious and impervious area inside the pixel was computed assuming that buildings and roads are 100 impervious and that all other areas are pervious we assumed a wetting loss of 0 6 mm for each rain event a maximum sewer system capacity of 12 mm hr for precipitation on impervious areas webber 2019 and a constant infiltration capacity of 29 3 mm hr for precipitation on pervious areas kaspersen et al 2017 in each simulation time step 1 s separate effective precipitation rates were computed for pervious and impervious areas by subtracting the above losses from the observed rainfall in each pixel the two effective precipitation rates were multiplied by the impervious and pervious area inside the pixel and then summed up to obtain the total runoff from the pixel subsequently runoff was then routed over the terrain surface by the 2d hydrodynamic simulation this approach to runoff computation generates realistic flood maps that can be used to demonstrate the feasibility of our deep learning approach the sewer system however is represented in a simplified manner that does not necessarily reflect the effect of for example bottlenecks in the sewer pipes we have chosen this approach because it enables us to make all the data used in our study accessible this would not be the case when performing 1d 2d flood simulations where proprietary information on the sewer network is required hydrodynamic simulations were performed for each of the 53 rain events described in the following section fig 1 shows an example of the generated flood maps when training the deep learning models for the prediction of flood depths we set any flood depths below 0 05 m to 0 as these water depths are not relevant for neither economic damage assessments nor warning systems we have in addition removed puddles defined as flooded areas consisting of less than 5 connected pixels by applying a sieve filter gdal development team 2020 terrain data used for the simulations and flood maps are available from löwe 2021 2 1 2 rainfall data we considered rainfall observations in 1 min resolution from ten rain gauges distributed across denmark that have been in continuous operation for at least 40 years for each of the stations we identified rain events rain events were defined to start when a dry weather threshold for the rain intensity of 0 1 mm h was exceeded and to end when this threshold had not been exceeded for at least six hours from each station we extracted the five rain events with the highest average rainfall intensity over a 30 min period where events were observed at multiple stations on the same day we kept only the most intense event this process resulted in a dataset of 43 rain events that were assumed representative for the types of events that can lead to pluvial flooding in denmark a data driven model needs to not only predict flood depth in extreme events but also to distinguish events when flooding does or does not occur we have therefore extended the rainfall dataset with an additional 10 events with medium to small rain intensities these events had maximum rain intensities of 10 to 30 mm hr averaged over a 30 min period one such event was manually selected from each station resulting in a total of 53 events section s1 in the supporting information includes a table of key characteristics for each of the rain events a time series plot of rain intensities for each event as well as a histogram of the rain intensities in the dataset rain intensities were averaged to 10 min intervals to limit the required storage for the hydrodynamic simulations where rainfall input needed to be provided as a time series of 2d maps each with a spatial extent of 3740x4273 pixels 2 1 3 training and validation data our dataset consisted of 53 flood maps covering the entire study area shown in fig 1 one map per rain event for training and validation the network was presented with square snapshots of these maps that had a fixed spatial extent of 256x256 pixels 5 m resolution for pixels outside the simulation area neither red nor blue in fig 1 both input and output data were set to zero the procedures for generating training and validation datasets for steps 1 and 2 of the model development procedure are outlined below separate datasets were generated for cross validation in step 3 as detailed in section 2 2 4 2 1 3 1 training dataset the training dataset was created by randomly sampling combinations of rain events and spatial patches of 256x256 pixels other than the so called squares used for validation see below these patches were placed randomly throughout the simulation area we sampled 10 000 times by a randomly selecting one of the 48 rain events not used for validation with repetition i e irrespective of whether the event was selected in a previous iteration b sampling a patch 256x256 pixels at a random location anywhere in the study area we then checked if the patch contained if the patch contained areas outside the blue areas in fig 1 such areas were either not part of the simulation area or part of the validation data red in fig 1 and should not be used for training input data and flood depths were set to 0 in the corresponding pixels if the patch contained less than 20 valid pixels it was discarded and a new patch was sampled otherwise the patch was added to the training dataset the 10 000 patches corresponded to randomly located extracts of the 48 flood maps each patch covered a unique part of the study area but overlapped with other patches similar data augmentation procedures are commonly applied in image classification to reduce over fitting rawat and wang 2017 the supporting information s4 contains an illustration of how often different parts of the study area were sampled in the training dataset 2 1 3 2 validation dataset for steps 1 and 2 of the model development procedure we sub divided the study area into 119 squares of 256x256 pixels with fixed locations fig 1 all squares contained at least 20 pixels inside the simulation area blue and red in fig 1 subsequently we a randomly selected 29 of these squares 1 4 of the study area marked red in fig 1 b manually selected five rain events that reflected varying rain intensities and temporal rainfall patterns we have highlighted these events in table s1 in the supporting information flood maps within the 29 squares were never presented to the neural network in the training phase in any rain event similarly flood maps for the five rain events were never presented during training in any location model validation was thus performed on locations and rain events that were unknown to the network in total the validation dataset consisted of 29 5 145 flood maps 2 2 data driven model development 2 2 1 modelling setup fig 2 illustrates the deep learning setup applied in our study 2d arrays of spatial inputs with a fixed extent of 256 256 pixels are processed through an encoder decoder structure consisting of pairs of convolutional layers panel a rainfall input is pre processed and concatenated at the bottleneck of the spatial convolution panel b after the last decoding block the network generates a prediction of maximum water depth in each individual pixel of within the considered patch for a given rain event the overall structure resembles the framework proposed by guo et al 2021 but we have made a number of distinct changes 1 skip connections concatenate the output from an encoding block in the spatial convolution to the input of the corresponding decoding block thus bypassing encoding steps in the deeper parts of the network skip connections were demonstrated to support smooth objective function landscapes and thus better convergence of deep neural networks li et al 2018 with this modification the spatial convolution in our framework strongly resembles the u net architecture ronneberger et al 2015 which is widely applied for image segmentation 2 we converted the input rainfall series into a set of 9 rain event characteristics before feeding it into the neural network preliminary work showed that such characterizations in combination with simple feed forward networks böhm 2020 eriksen and dichmann 2019 achieve strong performance in predicting flood extents directly feeding the rainfall series into a dense layer guo et al 2021 leads to an excessive number of parameters when long rain events should be considered up to 34 h in our dataset and creates difficulties during training when the rainfall peak does not always occur at the same time point in the rain series 3 we applied average pooling amidi and amidi 2019 in the encoding part of our network as it yielded stronger performance in initial tests supporting information section s6 than the maximum pooling applied in other works guo et al 2021 ronneberger et al 2015 we considered three hyper parameters for our setup d depth of the network corresponds to the number of encoding decoding steps bf number of filters considered in the convolutional layers of the first encoding step in line with similar architectures ronneberger et al 2015 the number of filters is increased by a factor of 2 in each encoding step we have however considered a maximum number of 512 filters to limit the computational requirements and k edge length in pixels of the kernels applied in the convolution operations leaky relu activation functions maas et al 2013 were considered for all layers with an activation threshold of 0 2 like other works with similar architectures badrinarayanan et al 2017 chattopadhyay et al 2020 höhlein et al 2020 we applied dropout regularization to the convolutional layers with a dropout rate of 0 5 a patch size of 256x256 pixels 1280x1280m was considered for the spatial input data and the generated flood maps this size is frequently applied with convolutional networks because it is a power of 2 and repeated pooling operations that divide the size of the images by 2 can thus be performed without padding the pooling outputs patches with an edge length of above one kilometer should be sufficiently large to capture the most important effects leading to urban pluvial flooding that occurs on a very local scale löwe et al 2020 while at the same time being sufficiently small to not cause memory problems during model training a potential downside of working with fixed size images is that hydrological objects such as sinks will be cut off when located near the edge of a patch this problem is mitigated by considering training patches that are not placed regularly as in fig 1 but randomly throughout the study area 2 2 2 model development step 1 feature definition and selection 2 2 2 1 rainfall input urban pluvial flooding is linked to small spatial scales and short time scales the amount of runoff varies depending on the shape and intensity of the specific rain event e g davidsen et al 2017 müller et al 2017 these characteristics need to be provided to enable the neural network to distinguish the effects of different rain events urban hydrologists have a long tradition of characterizing natural rain events with standardized characteristics that can be used to test the design of sewer systems with representative design storms jean et al 2018 inspired by rainfall characterizations from german design guidelines wartalska et al 2020 used the following set of statistics to characterize the temporal distribution of rain depths during an event which we have considered as input to our model r p time index of the rainfall peak relative to the total duration of the event r cg time index of the median accumulated rainfall relative to the total duration of the event m 1 ratio of cumulative precipitation before vs after the rainfall peak m 2 ratio of maximum rain intensity 10 min interval vs total rainfall depth m 3 ratio of rainfall depth in the first third of an event vs total rainfall depth m 5 ratio of rainfall depth in the first half of an event vs total rainfall depth n i ratio of maximum rain intensity 10 min interval vs average rain intensity in addition to the above we included the accumulated rainfall depth p tot and its duration dur to characterize the magnitude and duration of an event the statistics computed for each rain event are available in section s1 of the supporting material 2 2 2 2 spatial input when training a neural network against maximum water depth maps the network does not learn the dynamics of water movement on terrain and spatial inputs that condense the hydrological characteristics of the catchment are likely to yield higher predictive power than elevation data alone based on expert reasoning and previous studies we defined a set of 11 spatial variables that we considered potentially relevant for the prediction of urban pluvial flooding in a data driven model table 1 summarizes these variables and the reasoning for their inclusion common for all input variables was that they must be possible to derive from geodata using standard raster processing operations to ensure that the deep learning model once fitted can be readily applied to new locations several spatial datasets were characterized by long tailed right skewed distributions where flood hazard does not change much whether the explanatory variable takes medium large or extreme values in line with standard mathematical modelling procedures brockhoff et al 2018 madsen 2008 we applied data transformations in these cases subsequently all variables were scaled to the intervals 1 1 if negative values were present and 0 1 otherwise visualizations of all variables are provided in the supporting information while the actual datasets can be obtained from löwe 2021 for the spatial inputs it is particularly relevant to consider only the datasets that actually improve prediction performance of the model too many model inputs will increase the computational demand in the training phase and the risk of overfitting based on the selection of input variables in table 1 we employed two approaches 1 spearman s ranked correlation dodge 2008 we computed the ranked correlation between simulated water depths and the input variables in table 1 the computation was done on a pixel by pixel basis for the entire area highlighted in fig 1 and a separate correlation coefficient was estimated for each of the considered rain events i e 53 correlation coefficients were obtained for each input variable this approach provided insight on whether an input variable would be directly related to simulated water depths in a monotonic manner however it could not provide information on whether a variable enhances the predictive capacity of another variable in addition the pixel by pixel comparisons imply that the method could not capture effects where the input variable for example needs to be aggregated in space before an impact on the water depths becomes clear 2 forward selection to address the above short comings we employed a procedure that was inspired by stepwise regression modelling procedures brockhoff et al 2018 pardoe et al 2020 we used the model illustrated in fig 2 with hyper parameters depth d 4 number of filters in the first encoding block bf 32 and kernel size k 3 this configuration was considered as a reasonable starting point as it performed well in initial tests and as it has a similar complexity as the setup employed by guo et al 2021 we trained 11 different neural networks with this configuration each of the them considering a single spatial input from table 1 we evaluated each networks predictive performance based on the scores described in section 2 3 and selected the one that performed best based on this network we created 10 new networks all of which considered the successful input from step 1 and one of the remaining 10 inputs the procedure was repeated until a subjective inspection of the results suggested that the inclusion of additional input variables no longer improves predictive performance on the validation dataset 2 2 3 model development step 2 network complexity to evaluate what is a parsimonious neural network for obtaining reliable predictions of flood water depth we performed a grid search on the hyper parameters listed in section 2 2 1 we varied the network depth d between 2 and 6 where a network with d 6 consists of 6 encoding blocks and six decoding blocks each consisting of two convolutional layers the number of filters bf in the first convolutional layer between 16 32 and 64 and the size k of the kernels applied in the convolution layers between 3 5 and 7 larger values for d and bf increase the number of parameters in the network that need to be estimated but increase its flexibility to reproduce patterns larger kernel sizes enable the convolutional layers to make use of spatial information from a larger area but strongly increase computational expense many recent popular network architectures employ k 3 chen et al 2018 he et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2015 the hyper parameter ranges outlined above led to neural networks that had from 97 000 up to 260 000 000 parameters that needed to be estimated 2 2 4 model development step 3 k fold cross validation to obtain a more robust estimate of predictive model performance we selected the best performing model architecture from step 2 and trained it in a k fold cross validation procedure with five folds for this purpose we created five non overlapping validation datasets each consisting of 10 rain events and 24 of the squares shown in fig 1 the squares were randomly assigned to the validation datasets a stratified sampling approach was applied for the rain events we sorted the rain events by their maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and then divided them into 10 groups each containing 5 events the three least intense events were not used for validation each of the 5 events in each group was then randomly assigned to a different validation set for each of the five folds a separate training dataset was sampled following the same procedure as outlined in section 2 1 3 we did again consider permutations of size n 10 000 2 2 5 objective function and optimization all networks were fitted by minimizing the mean squared error mse between the maximum depth flood maps predicted by the neural network and those generated in the hydrodynamic simulation in this process a square root transform was applied to the flood depths to reduce the skewedness of the distribution of simulated flood depths we applied the adam optimizer over 500 epochs as suggested by smith 2017 a triangular learning rate schedule was considered where the learning rate over a period of 10 epochs varied between an upper limit and a lower limit of 5 10 5 the upper limit exponentially decreased from a starting value of 10 3 as a function of 0 95 epochnumber the implementation of the learning rate scheduler is available in löwe 2021 the triangular learning rate could avoid divergence of the networks during initial tests where skip connections had not been implemented once a suitable architecture had been implemented it was not deemed essential 2 3 performance evaluation to assess the performance of the data driven models in the various steps of the model development procedure we compared maximum flood depth maps generated by the hydrodynamic simulation against flood maps predicted by the neural network and computed the score values shown in table 2 score values were computed considering only those pixels where either the hydrodynamic model hd or the neural network nn predicted flooding similar to jamali et al 2019 a depth threshold thr of 0 05 m was applied for all scores for the critical success index csi separate score values were computed for thresholds of 0 05 m and 0 3 m to distinguish prediction accuracy in areas with greater water depth 2 4 technical implementation neural networks were implemented in tensorflow version 2 3 1 abadi et al 2016 using the interface with python 3 8 2 model training was performed in a high performing computing environment using nvidia tesla v100 pcie gpu s with 16 and 32 gb memory 3 results 3 1 step 1 feature selection 3 1 1 spearman correlation fig 3 illustrates the ranked correlation coefficients between the candidate input datasets introduced in table 1 and the simulated water depths in the 53 considered rain events one correlation coefficient was computed per input dataset and per rain event not very surprisingly the figure suggests a clear correlation between the datasets characterising local deformations of the terrain and water depth pluvial flood water accumulates in local depressions and thus locations with elevations that are lower than the neighbourhood average dem l and locations inside sinks identified by positive values of sdepth as well as twi are good predictors of high water depths for the same reason we could identify a strong correlation between water depth and the curv dataset which distinguishes concave and convex regions of the terrain supporting information figure s12 in addition it was noticeable that dem l exhibits a substantially stronger correlation with water depth than dem slightly lower correlations were observed for the input variables that characterize the size of the upstream area contributing to the water flow at a given location flacc flimp flslo these variables should be useful to explain the amount of water and thus the frequency of flooding at a given location but the main flow paths form narrow lines in these datasets that are not linked to for example the extent of sinks in which water will spread out in a direct pixel to pixel comparison these variables therefore have lower predictive power in a similar manner slope can be used to identify flat regions where water is likely to accumulate and imp contains some information on the amount of runoff generated in an area but neither can be used to point out the exact extent and locations of the flood areas finally considering fig 3 the relationship between the asp variables and water depth would need to be assumed to be random the results in fig 3 have to be interpreted carefully with regards to choosing the inputs that should be included in the data driven model several of the input datasets are correlated e g sdepth dem l twi and are therefore less likely to supplement each other when combined in a predictive model further input data that do not exhibit correlation with the water depth maps in a pixel by pixel comparisons may increase the predictive power of other variables or gain predictive power due to spatial aggregation in the convolutional blocks of the neural network for example imp may be useful to distinguish the water depth in different sinks with similar sdepth values and the two asp datasets can only characterize the terrain when considered in combination 3 1 2 forward selection the aim of the forward selection procedure was to mitigate the limitations outlined in the previous section by assessing whether an input dataset actually increases the predictive power of a neural network fig 4 illustrates the score values computed in the different steps of this procedure in each panel the top row corresponds to the first step of the procedure network with only one input dataset and the colours in different columns illustrate the score value computed when considering the corresponding dataset as model input the second row then shows the results for the second step of the procedure where the best performing input from step 1 was included in the model and combined with each of the other inputs note that we considered the two asp datasets as a single combined entity as their individual inclusion as input variables has no physical justification thus whenever asp was included in the model two datasets cosine and sine were included fig 4 illustrates that considering a model with only one type of spatial input the asp data yielded the best score values on the validation dataset in addition the dem variable yielded similar predictive power as the dem l variable these results are in direct contradiction to the conclusions drawn based on fig 3 however the neural network can process information in a different way than the pixel by pixel comparisons performed when computing spearman correlation or similar measures such as information gain e g pham et al 2020 this underlines that it is important not to solely rely on such measures when choosing the inputs for deep learning algorithms the asp data are at an advantage over other variables as they are represented by two separate datasets and thus provide greater flexibility to represent different trends nevertheless these data consistently yielded an improvement in predictive power also in experiments where we added them to models with other inputs not documented and they were also selected as a key input for modelling water depths by guo et al 2021 as the selection process proceeded we obtained slight improvements in predictive power we were not able to achieve a further increase in predictive power once five datasets had been included in the model and stopped the process at this point the selected input datasets were in this order asp sdepth flslo imp and curv in the evaluation of predictive power we focused on panels a c in fig 4 while the ratio of total flooded areas was considered only for information reasons all neural networks consistently underestimated the total flooded area see section 3 4 networks that performed better in terms of total flooded area usually achieved this improvement at the cost of an increased number of false predictions and thus a reduced prediction skill fig 4 further highlights the correlation between the four datasets characterizing surface flow paths neither twi flimp or flacc yielded improved prediction skill once flslo had been included in the model for reference we considered a model where principal component analysis was used to reduce the number of spatial inputs from 11 to 7 orthogonal datasets this model yielded comparable performance as the one obtained by forward selection supporting information s6 3 2 step 2 optimization of hyper parameters and residual analysis 3 2 1 effect of hyper parameters on model performance fig 5 shows cs i 0 05 m values computed for different combinations of the hyper parameter values k bf and d considering a water depth threshold thr 0 05 m fig 6 illustrates the training time per epoch for the same combinations of hyper parameters a total of 45 hyper parameter combinations was considered with training times that for 500 epochs ranged from 6 5 h to 5 days the variation of rmse scores for different hyper parameter settings is consistent with cs i 0 05 m an overview of all score values for different hyper parameter combinations is enclosed in the supporting information section s5 from fig 5 and fig 6 it is clear that kernel edge lengths k 3 do not in general improve the predictive performance of the network while increasing the computational expense when considering small network depths d 2 and 3 a small increase of csi with increasing kernel sizes was apparent for some models the probable reason would be that larger kernel sizes increase the region over which the network can perform spatial aggregation which is otherwise quite limited for shallow networks the trend was however not very pronounced an increasing number of filters in the convolutional layers parameter bf generally improved the model results but the computational expense also increased roughly linearly with the number of filters we experienced memory issues when considering bf 64 and have therefore considered this as an upper limit increasing network depth generally led to higher csi values however this was generally only true until depths in d 4 or 5 deeper networks were over fitted and thus led to lower csi values for bf 16 we also tested greater network depths d 7 which however led to a further decline in performance compared to d 6 supporting information s5 the best performing model was identified to have parameters k 3 bf 64 and d 5 this model can perform spatial aggregation over a region of approximately 500x500m löwe and arnbjerg nielsen 2020 could obtain robust estimates of average imperviousness in an urban area from high resolution building data at a similar spatial scale 3 2 2 flood maps and residual analysis fig 7 compares predicted maximum water depths generated by mike 21 and the neural network with k 3 bf 64 and d 5 the displayed water depths were taken from the validation dataset for rain event no 10 for an area in the centre of odense areas where the neural network failed to predicted water depths 0 05 m are highlighted red while areas where the neural network falsely predicted water depths 0 05 m are highlighted yellow fig 8 shows pixel wise nse values computed for the validation rain events for the same area as in fig 7 and for a more rural area from the two figures several characteristics of the neural network predictions are evident 1 the neural network did not predict water depths that are entirely unreasonable we did also not identify any such issues in other locations or for other rain events this is important because the mathematical formulation of the neural network does not account for physical constraints such as mass balances 2 the neural network could identify hotspots of flooding where water accumulates and it did also generate accurate predictions of water levels in these locations 3 the network was not able to accurately represent shallow flooding along transport stretches i e outside sinks this behaviour is particularly evident from fig 8 where low nse values cluster along roads and flow paths leading through backyards and it explains the consistent underestimation of total flooded area by the neural network fig 4 the five input datasets considered in this model were thus not sufficient to identify these locations to characterize the behaviour of the model in different rain events we plotted the water volumes that the sinks or terrain depressions in our validation dataset contained based on the maximum water depths predicted by the neural network nn and the hydrodynamic model mike 21 hd fig 9 we plotted blue spot volumes for all five rain events in the validation dataset but only three of the events generated flooding in either of the models this implies that the neural network was able to determine that no flooding should occur in events no 44 and 47 this was the case even though these events had rather high maximum rain intensities of 34 and 16 mm hr averaged over a 30 min period however while the predictions of water volumes could be considered accurate for event no 9 and 10 we could also identify a clear underestimation of water volumes in event 39 this event had a maximum rain intensity of 42 mm hr averaged over a 30 min period several events with such intensities were included in the training dataset however event 39 was characterized by two pronounced rainfall peaks with similar intensity it was the only event with this characteristic in our dataset and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the network simply did not learn to distinguish this type of rain event 3 3 step 3 k fold cross validation table 3 shows the score values computed for the water depth predictions generated by the neural networks in the 5 fold cross validation approach and compares them against the score values obtained for the best performing model in step 2 of the model development procedure a clear increase in prediction error can be observed when comparing the score values obtained during model validation in the five folds against the best performing model from step 2 the same hyper parameters were considered in both steps and all models were trained on 10 000 patches however in step 3 these patches were sampled from a smaller number of rain events but a bigger part of the study area than in step 2 the increased error can thus be attributed to an insufficient representation of rainfall patterns in the training phase which underlines the need to present the network with a representative sample of rain events in the training phase 4 discussion 4 1 model configuration and performance our results show similar rmse scores 0 08 m for predicted flood water depths as existing screening approaches jamali et al 2019 with lower csi scores in the order of 0 5 it should be noted that our results were obtained for natural rain events and locations not considered in the training phase unlike other studies which focused on artificial design storms jamali et al 2019 jamali et al 2018 or known locations guo et al 2021 water depths in depressions were generally predicted well while the prediction of shallow flooding on surface flow paths outside depressions remains a challenge the forward selection procedure resulted in a model with five spatial input datasets this procedure can account for interactions between variables and exploit the neural networks ability to perform spatial aggregation it is therefore preferred over methods that perform one variable at a time comparisons between model inputs and the output variable such as ranked correlation or mutual information it was also clear that considering too many model inputs increased the prediction error of the neural network due to overfitting in the training phase note that the forward selection procedure is not exhaustive it adds variables one at a time and may therefore not discover all relevant combinations of variables in addition the selection of model inputs and hyper parameters is entangled because different models can exploit spatial information in different ways more extensive procedures for selecting input variables and hyper parameters will however pose computational challenges our model was able to accurately predict water depths for many rain events as well as to distinguish situations where no flooding should occur however the increased prediction error for the double peak event no 39 also illustrated a vulnerability in appropriately capturing the temporal dynamics of the rain events the number of rain events that could be considered in the training dataset is limited because time consuming hydrodynamic simulations need to be performed for each rain event and because the best performing network with d 5 k 3 and bf 64 required a training time of up to 35 h for 500 epochs using a high end gpu other studies applying data driven models with a similar complexity have similarly not considered this issue berkhahn et al 2019 guo et al 2021 zahura et al 2020 or focused on temporal resolutions of one day and above pham et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 different ways of specifying rainfall input to the neural network may also lead to higher prediction performance of the model based on previous experiences böhm 2020 eriksen and dichmann 2019 we experimented with neural networks that considered statistical rainfall characteristics based on average rain intensities for varying time intervals as well as with 1d convolutional layers that extract temporal patterns from the rainfall time series none of these so far yielded a better model performance than the setup outlined in fig 2 supporting information s6 4 2 technical modelling setup in line with the common approach for image segmentation and previous work of guo et al 2021 we have applied a modelling setup that generates predictions of water depth for a fixed size patch of 256x256 pixels this approach is counter intuitive from a hydrological perspective because hydrological features such as flow paths or sinks will be cut on the edge of the image it is important to note that the model input inside an image is calculated based on the entire catchment before it is provided to the network for example flow accumulation values will not be affected by the cutting operation because they are calculated on the entire terrain dataset not on the 256x256 patch in the prediction phase the prediction window can be flexibly positioned in the desired location in principle the convolutional network enables the consideration of images of varying sizes in the training and the prediction phase the image size could then be adjusted to the hydrological features in a specific location however challenges in setting up efficient input pipelines for the neural network may arise 4 3 limitations u flood was trained based on hydrodynamic simulation results generated for a city in a moraine coastal landscape the hydrodynamic simulations considered a uniform distribution of rainfall in space a simplified representation of the sewer system in the form of reducing the effective rainfall and a constant uniform infiltration rate for runoff computation on green areas in addition we excluded fluvial flooding from the training data these factors limit the transferability of u flood in its current configuration as outlined below 1 different landscape types e g alpine different soil conditions the consideration of varying infiltration rates requires an additional spatial input dataset that was not included in our work training the model for different infiltration rates would also enable the consideration of antecedent rainfall which reduces the infiltration capacity of the soil davidsen et al 2017a different landscape types might require revisiting the spatial input variables to the model for example terrain slope may well play a more prominent role in alpine regions than in our study 2 non uniform distribution of rainfall in space u flood uses simple rainfall statistics or alternatively 1d hyetographs as input to predict flood depth this approach cannot be used when spatial variations of rainfall are relevant instead setups that learn spatiotemporal rainfall dynamics would likely be required e g zhu et al 2020 and training efforts would increase substantially note that u flood was trained to predict pluvial flooding in catchments with extents in the order of 2 km at such scales spatially uniform rainfall is commonly assumed for flood screening in infrastructure design and weather models as input to flood warning systems hardly generate forecasts with resolutions finer than some km 3 non uniform sewer system capacity we assumed that the sewer system has a capacity of 12 mm h in all locations in the catchment this assumption will not be valid in many situations a more dynamic consideration of network capacity could be achieved by training u flood to consider surcharge volumes from a 1d sewer model as input similar to jamali et al 2019 jamali et al 2018 this could be implemented by considering a spatial input dataset where flow paths are weighted according to the surcharge volume encountered along the flow path similar to flslo and it would also allow for the consideration of spatial rainfall variation in the 1d sewer model 4 4 outlook as outlined in the previous section future research should focus on generating increased training datasets that make u flood applicable to a wider range of situations technical improvements to consider are in particular the development of spatial input data that yield information on shallow water depths on flow paths e g elevation above the nearest flow path or potential water depth based on rough manning calculations as demonstrated by thrysøe et al 2021 and the implementation of stratified sampling schemes that consider the temporal dynamics of rain events finer model resolutions than 5 m are relevant for many practical situations and could be achieved with multi scale neural networks nah et al 2017 that process different input datasets at different resolutions finally deep learning offers the possibility to consider multiple reference datasets when training we can therefore envision models that learn from both hydrodynamic simulations and sparse flood observations possibly enabling the calibration of flood models across catchments 5 conclusions we have presented a setup for predicting urban pluvial flood hazards in high resolution and on short time scales using convolutional neural networks that are inspired by the widely applied u net architecture based on our results we draw the following conclusions 1 neural networks that consider topographic inputs can be used for predicting pluvial flood hazards also in spatial locations and for rain events that were not included in the training dataset because they learn to associate terrain properties with the likelihood of flood occurrence 2 the spatial input data provided to the neural network need to be selected in a setting that is similar to the final model used for prediction this ensures that interactions between different input datasets and the ability of the neural network to perform spatial aggregation are considered when selecting input data 3 neural networks with topographic input data need to be designed in a parsimonious manner too many input datasets lead to overfitting and increased prediction error in our study a combination of five datasets describing terrain aspect and curvature the depth of terrain depressions imperviousness and flow accumulation yielded the best performing model 4 deeper networks improve prediction accuracy only up to a certain level in our study this level was reached with a model that had 28 million trainable parameters once trained this network generated predictions of maximum water depth for an area of 1280x1280 m in less than one second 5 the rain events presented to the neural network during training need to reflect the range of rain events for which the model should generate predictions this applies not only for event depth and intensities but also the temporal evolution of events the computational demands for training deep neural networks limit the number of rain events than can be considered thus creating a demand for stratified sampling schemes that consider the temporal evolution of events our study contributes to a so far limited literature where only two studies have applied similar approaches for predicting 2d urban flood maps in high resolution and on short time scales and no evaluations of a large set of potential model inputs and of predictive performance on historical rainfall data are available interesting opportunities arise for example by considering our setup to train neural networks for flood prediction based on a simultaneous consideration of simulation results and flood observations from different cities or by using u flood to minimize the number of hydrodynamic simulations required to assess expected flood damages credit authorship contribution statement roland löwe conceptualization data curation investigation methodology software writing
