14285,removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions as hazardous carcinogenic and toxic pollutants is considered among the most important environmental issues in recent years in this study polycaprolactone nanofibrous adsorbent was prepared by the electrospinning method and then was modified by clay mineral and zeolite nanoparticles and characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and finally the lead removal ability at an aqueous solution was evaluated the experiments were carried out intermittently under different process conditions then the impact of effective parameters on lead adsorption process including the initial concentration of the metal solution ph the adsorbent amount and temperature was studied also kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics of the adsorption process were determined the results demonstrated that the addition of clay mineral and zeolite nanoparticles to polycaprolactone have synergistic effect on lead adsorption capacity of nanofibers the results of adsorption processes showed that with increased ph up to 5 5 increased solution concentration up to 25 ppm decreased adsorbent up to 0 01 g and increased temperature up to 40 c the adsorbent value increased second order pseudo adsorption kinetics was observed and also lead adsorbent isotherm followed the freundlich model the thermodynamic results showed that lead adsorption process with synthetic adsorbent was a spontaneous process keywords polycaprolactone nanoclay nanozeolite 1 introduction removal of heavy metals from wastewater is a serious and important issue because these metals are highly toxic and pollution with these dangerous pollutants leads to unhealthy drinking water resources and in a long term period it causes dangers for humans and other living organisms 1 4 heavy metals are not decomposed and gradually accumulate in the body of organisms such as plants and animals the heavy metals deposit and accumulate in fatty tissues muscles bones and joints of human and contact with them can cause neural disorders and carcinogenicity 5 lead is a heavy metal that is highly toxic and naturally exists in the environment but in most cases it is the result of human activities such as fuel production 6 lead that almost enters the water through the wastewater of battery making and ammunitions companies after entering the body replaces bone calcium and causes disorders in enzyme production that is important in making blood hemoglobin also it causes disorders in the production of kidney enzymes followed by bone blood and kidney complications 7 there are many methods such as reverse osmosis ion exchange oxidation and reduction chemical decomposition filtration and adsorption to heavy metals removal from aqueous solutions each method has advantages and disadvantages based on simplicity flexibility effectiveness cost maintenance and technical problems finding an inexpensive and efficient method in recent years has been taken into consideration by researchers 8 9 in this regard the adsorption process is considered as a conventional method with low operational costs and high performance to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions most of the adsorbents that are used in the treatment of heavy metal wastewaters have limitations such as lack of active surface selectivity and high absorption rate the application of nanotechnology in adsorbent production has led to the increased specific surface of adsorbents and the creation of selective active groups on the adsorbent for purposeful removal of pollutants 10 meanwhile filters prepared from polymer nanofibers are known as one of the flexible options in the removal of different pollutants that are prepared based on different methods such as elasticity synthesis in the form phase separation self regulation and electrospinning electrospinning has been taken into consideration recently because this method can produce separate and continuous nanofibers with high production efficiency 11 according to this method fiber spinning is based on electrostatic force and in using this process fibers are produced from a polymer or molten solutions in the range of nanometer or micrometer 12 13 polycaprolactone pc was chosen as a polymer with high mechanical strength lack of toxicity and low cost for fabrication nanofibrous adsorbent 14 zeolites with the structure of mx n n alo2 x sio2 y x wh2o are the most important porous compounds with a regular crystalline structure selectivity specific surface thermal stability high surface area and net negative charge on their surface have high cation adsorption capacity such as heavy metals moreover the most functional type of zeolite called clinoptilolite kna2ca2 si29al7 o72 24h2o with major uses in various industries such as lightweight concrete refinement and chemical fertilizers can be a good option in making heavy metal adsorbents 15 clay mineral with unique properties such as the ability to adsorb cations and anions through ion exchange high adsorption capacity safety of its exchangeable ions for the environment high special surface chemical and physical stability and its availability and layer structure is a suitable option for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions 10 11 composite adsorbents consists of inorganic fillers dispersed in polymer matrix is of great interest to scientists due to its excellent various properties however achieving uniform dispersion and distribution of inorganic fillers in polymer matrix is often challenging as inorganic particles with identical nature tends to agglomerate and cause poor dispersion leading to uneven properties of the adsorbent furthermore it is often noticed that the resultant composite adsorbents showed either improvement in terms of adsorptivity synergistic effects are nonlinear cumulative effects of two active ingredients with similar or related outcomes of their different activities or active ingredients with sequential or supplemental activities nowadays researchers are trying to utilize more than one filler materials to explore the synergistic effect of fillers on the composites properties a number of researches have been reported to investigate the synergetic effects of different nanoparticles on polymers this research works focused on the synthesis characterization and processing of composites to improve the different performances of the synthesized composites 16 22 polycaprolactone pc was chosen as a polymer with high mechanical strength lack of toxicity and low cost for fabrication nanofibrous adsorbent 14 zeolites with the structure of mx n n

to the recovery method the adsorbent was extracted from the solution and poured into 25 ml of sodium chloride solution 0 01 m and exposed to the room temperature under ultrasonic bath for 10 min then the nanofibrous adsorbent was extracted from the solution and in order to activate the existing adsorption groups on the adsorption surface the recovered particles were exposed to an ultrasonic bath for 10 min with the exposure to the 0 01 m of soda solution finally after extracting the adsorbent from the solution and washing with distilled water for four times it was used in the lead solution of 25 ppm for reuse this cycle was carried out for four times and adsorbent reuse possibility was examined for adsorption processes to investigate the lead adsorption kinetic pseudo first order and pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion models were used table 1 adsorption kinetic is used to determine the control mechanisms of adsorption processes such as adsorption at the surface chemical reaction and diffusion mechanisms the pseudo ﬁrst order and the pseudo second order models mostly used to interpret the external ﬁlm diffusion intra particle diffusion and interaction step between adsorptive and the functional groups of the adsorbent during the adsorption process the elovich kinetic model contains the kinetic of chemisorption on highly heterogeneous adsorbents the intra particle diffusion is a transport process which describes the movement of species from the bulk of the solution to the solid phase 3 23 adsorption isotherms and equilibrium data describe the reaction of pollutants with adsorbent substances and have important roles in the optimization of adsorbent consumption the adsorptive distribution between the solution phase and adsorbent phase is a criterion for equilibrium position in the adsorption process and is generally expressed by the adsorption isotherm models there are isotherm models for the analysis of empirical data and description of equilibrium in the adsorption process such as freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich models table 2 these models are used to present a view about adsorption mechanism surface properties adsorption tendency and description of empirical data therefore the establishment of a suitable relationship between equilibrium diagrams to optimize conditions and design of adsorption systems is very important 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results 3 1 1 sem analysis the results of sem analysis fig 2 with the distribution of zeolite nanoparticles size indicate that almost a distribution of zeolite at an average size of 60 100 nm was obtained from ball milling it seems that due to the small size of particles and high surface to volume ratio aggregation of particles was occurred the high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles usually results in highly reactive and colloidal instability compared to their bulk counterparts high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles provides a very high surface energy to minimize its surface energy the nanoparticles create agglomeration 25 27 in this study four different nanofibers have been prepared to investigate the role of the high surface area of nanofibrous morphology and nanoparticles zeolite and clay on pc adsorbent the structure of electrospun nanocomposite nanofibers was investigated using fesem micrographs and fiber diameters distribution histogram was revealed in fig 3 the results reveal that all samples have uniform bead free nanofibrous structure and different mean fiber diameter was obtained by introducing nanoparticles to the polymeric structure as can be seen from images average fiber diameter has increased with the addition of nanoparticles because with the addition of nanoparticles viscosity and surface tension increase and these changes increase the fiber diameter 28 according to table 3 with the addition of clay mineral to polycaprolactone macromolecular structure average fiber diameter has increased 230 5 to 460 4 nm also with the addition of zeolite nanoparticles to polycaprolactone polymer increased average fiber diameter is observed from 230 5 to 457 4 nm 3 1 2 tem analysis in fig 4 the results of tem images for polycaprolactone nanofibrous adsorbent with zeolite and clay mineral show that almost a uniform distribution is obtained from nanoparticles inside the fibers however due to the small size of particles and their high surface to volume ratio the accumulation of particles was observed 3 1 3 edx analysis of pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent the elemental analysis of nanofibers is performed by edx investigation and can be observed in fig 5 the elements composition in the nanofiber structure was determined in the edx spectrum peaks emerged in 0 290 0 530 1 130 1 700 1 740 1 800 and 2 150 kev are related to c o na al si k and ca respectively the elemental composition of nanofibers determined by edx reveals the components na al si k and ca correspond to zeolite and clay structures that are encapsulated within fibers with mostly c and o elements 3 1 4 ftir analysis to determine the functional groups that exist in the nanofibrous adsorbent structure fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used fig 6 the spectrum in the emerged adsorption frequencies includes 2949 cm 1 symmetrical tension ch2 2868 cm 1 asymmetrical tension ch2 1732 cm 1 carbonyl tension 1294 cm 1 cc and c o bands tension 1239 cm 1 c o c symmetrical tension that indicate polycaprolactone constituent bonds si o si stretching vibration in adsorption frequency of 1108 cm 1 is zeolite main vibration the vibration peak of 3480 cm 1 indicated oh groups in al oh si with zeolite structure about clay the spectrum the adsorption frequency of 2949 cm 1 indicates stretching vibration of c h stretching vibration of al oh emerged in 773 cm 1 peaks emerged in 1369 and 1108 cm 1 are related to stretching vibration of c oh and flexural vibration of ch3 in all cases it can be observed that pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent components are bonded without a specific chemical reaction 3 2 the results of adsorption experiments by pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent 3 2 1 investigating the kinetics of lead adsorption one important factor to design an adsorption system is the prediction of adsorption speed adsorption kinetics is dependent on the chemical and physical properties of the adsorbent substance that influence the adsorption mechanism kinetics investigation of intermittent adsorption is one of the most important methods to predict adsorption mechanism and adsorption speed limiting phases such as mass transfer or chemical reaction adsorption kinetics describes the adsorbent factor and determines the equilibrium time of adsorbent solution reaction in this phase the adsorption process kinetics was investigated by pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent it is worth noting that the preparation of all solutions and experiments are according to the guidelines in fig 7 lead concentration changes in the solution due to lead adsorption by the adsorbent over time and also the adsorbed metal mass changes for the used pseudo mass in the process with time are shown values are related to 0 01 g of adsorbent in 25 ml of lead solution as can be seen from this figure the adsorbent in about 10 min adsorbed a large part of the lead in the solution that can be due to the presence of many adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface however over time and with the occupation of these active sites by lead lead adsorption speed decreases to the point where adsorption equilibrium is achieved therefore according to the subtle concentration changes after 2 h of starting the process this period was considered to reach adsorption equilibrium or equilibrium time at this moment lead concentration in the solution reaches a constant value that is called equilibrium concentration ce at equilibrium time adsorption value reaches its maximum level and is indicated with equilibrium adsorption capacity qe in the next step the empirical data resulted from common adsorption kinetics models such as the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model intra particle diffusion model and elovich model were adapted the results of matching data with the linear form of these models are presented in fig 7 and table 4 r2 has been used to compare and investigate the deviation of laboratory data empirical mode from the existing model the nearness of r2 to 1 indicates deviation less than the model of interest according to the resulted r2 values related to the models in use and also nearness of qe value obtained through the model to the qe value resulted from laboratory data that can be observed on the profile of adsorption value changes relative to time it is concluded that the information obtained from experiments are consistent with the pseudo second order model and an acceptable trend exists in laboratory data also in an intra particle diffusion model fig 7f ki 1 ki 2 ki 3 shows adsorption phases at the external surface an internal surface and equilibrium and in the first phase the adsorbent molecules should be transferred from mass phase to the adsorbent particle surface in this action the adsorbent molecules should pass through the soluble film that has surrounded the adsorbent particle this phase is known as film diffusion and in the second phase the adsorbed molecules should be transferred to the locations that are available inside the porosity this process is expressed as diffusion into porosity and in the final phase it should be bonded to the adsorbent surface that leads to equilibrium 29 3 2 2 investigation of the lead adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are diagrams that show the relationship between equilibrium adsorption qe and the equilibrium concentration of the substance remaining in the solution ce at a fixed temperature that can be described by some of the isotherm models the isotherm type can provide information about the nature of the adsorbent and adsorption also adsorption isotherms have been used to describe the adsorption capacity and are efficient for the analysis and design of adsorption systems equilibrium achievement time can be determined through adsorption kinetics experiment to carry out adsorption experiments it is attempted to have longer time period relative to the equilibrium time obtained from kinetics experiments adsorption process equilibrium is almost described by the compliance of experimental data with models that in this study freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich models were investigated and were used to express the quantitative relationships between a substance adsorbed on the adsorbent at three temperatures of 30 35 and 40 c to examine the adsorption isotherm models 0 01 g of the nanofibrous adsorbent with a lead solution concentration of 25 ppm with a ph of 5 5 was used in fig 8 the results of equilibrium data fitting with freundlich langmuir dubinin radushkevich and temkin models can be observed and in table 5 the coefficients of different isotherm models are reported for lead adsorption by the synthesized nanofibrous adsorbent the results show that the experimental data have acceptable consistency with the models but the freundlich model is more consistent compared with the other models in the freundlich model it is assumed that the energy between different adsorption locations is not equal and different functional groups keep ions with different energy levels 3 2 3 thermodynamics of lead adsorption lead thermodynamic parameters are effective to identify endothermic or exothermic processes and also to determine its spontaneity to investigate the thermodynamics the lead adsorption by the adsorbent change in parameters of gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs at different temperatures of 30 35 and 40 c were investigated thermodynamic variables such as δh and δs were calculated using the van t hoff equation and also the slope of a curve 1 t based on lnkd 3 l n k d δ h r t δ s r 4 kd co ce v m ce 5 δ g δ h t δ s 6 e α δ h r t in these relationships eα is the adsorption process energy activation 30 δh and δs are characterized by the slope and y intercept of lnkd diagram based on 1 t fig 9 the results of the thermodynamic investigations are presented in table 6 negative values of δg in all temperatures and concentrations show a spontaneity of the lead adsorption process also decreased δg value with increased temperature shows that higher temperatures are more suitable for this process on the other hand δg values at three temperatures for lower lead concentrations are higher than the values related to higher lead concentration and this shows that lead adsorption is better at lower lead concentrations positive δh values show that lead interaction with amine and hydroxide groups available on the adsorption surface is endothermic and therefore lead adsorption increases with increased temperature δg values are large enough that indicates a strong interaction between the metal and the adsorbent positive δs values are related to increased disorder in adsorbent solution interaction in the adsorption process 3 2 4 investigating the effect of different parameters on the lead adsorption 3 2 4 1 the effect of temperature according to the lead equilibrium data in different temperatures based on fig 10 lead adsorption capacity increases with increased temperature and this phenomenon can be due to the activation of adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface and increased lead reaction rate with these sites 31 ph as one of the important adsorption parameters influences chemical properties of the metal solution functional groups in the adsorbent and ionic competition 32 as can be seen from fig 11 with increased initial ph of the metal solution adsorption capacity increase surface sites of metal adsorption are involved in the effect of ph on the lead adsorption lead ions in aqueous solutions in low ph are as hydrated cations and in high ph are as insoluble hydroxides in low ph hydronium ions h3o bond to the adsorbent ligands and due to the created repulsive forces metal positive ions are not allowed to be close to the adsorbent in other words in low ph due to high proton concentrations and protonation of the adsorbent the negative load on these sites decreases and for this reason bonding of metal positive ions is prevented when ph increases most of the ligands are released and their negative load leads to metal adsorption on the adsorbent in very high ph due to the lead sedimentation in the form of lead hydroxide metal adsorption decreases and we witness this phenomenon on ph higher than 5 5 as can be observed from fig 12 with the increased adsorbent amount the adsorbed lead per adsorbent mass unit specific adsorption capacity decreases when adsorbent amount increases adsorption sites available for the lead increase and better adsorption occurs decreased specific adsorption capacity may be due to the insufficiency of metal ions in solution relative to adsorption sites available for the metal or due to the accumulation of the adsorbent particles in high adsorbent value and then interaction between adsorption sites also the accumulation can lead to a decreased total area of the adsorbent surface and increased the length of diffusion 3 2 4 2 the effect of the initial concentration the initial metal solution influences the adsorption capacity according to the results of investigations in fig 13 for higher concentrations of the lead solution adsorption increases that are related to the improved gradient of lead concentration as the driving force of mass transfer although this increase is observed in adsorption capacity metal adsorption percentage decreases fig 14 that can be due to the insufficient surface to adsorb more metal that is available in the solution with higher concentration 3 3 regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent are important in functional terms to reject the adsorbed lead from the adsorbent after the adsorption process the adsorbent was exposed to ultrasonic with sodium chloride then the adsorbent was separated from the solution and for the activation of adsorbent groups available on the adsorbent surface the recovered particles were exposed to sodium hydroxide and washed with distilled water for three times and then used for lead adsorption this cycle was carried out for four times and reusability of the adsorbent was investigated for adsorption processes fig 15 that show the adsorbent still has lead adsorption ability after four cycles 3 4 comparison of the lead adsorption by the adsorbent and its components table 7 presents a comparison of the lead adsorption capacity by the adsorbent and the other same adsorbents the synthesized nanofibrous adsorbent shows promise and feasibility as an effective adsorbent for lead removal also the results show that increased addition of modified zeolite nanoparticles to polycaprolactone and then its modification with clay leads to increased lead adsorption capacity and this capacity is significant compared with the components 4 conclusion in this study polycaprolactone nanofibrous adsorbent was prepared by electrospinning and then modified by zeolite and clay mineral and characterized by sem tem fesem ftir and edx analyses and then to remove lead the aqueous solution was used empirical data resulted by common adsorption kinetics models such as pseudo first order and pseudo second order models elovich model and intra particle diffusion model were investigated the results showed that in all above cases according to the comparisons laboratory data are consistent with the models in use but at the same time the results of experiments show acceptable correspondence with pseudo second order models adsorption equilibrium was investigated by laboratory data with freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich models the results showed that in all above cases according to the comparisons laboratory data show acceptable correspondence with the models in use but at the same time the freundlich model shows more correspondence compared with other models in thermodynamics estimations negative δg values in all temperatures and concentrations showed spontaneous lead adsorption also the results showed that the addition of clay mineral to zeolite and then their modification increase lead adsorption capacity according to these results this synthetic adsorbent in addition to a high score in terms of simple removal and the ability for recovery and reuse can be introduced as a useful adsorbent for lead and other heavy metals that have similar properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgment financial

the nanofibrous adsorbent was extracted from the solution and in order to activate the existing adsorption groups on the adsorption surface the recovered particles were exposed to an ultrasonic bath for 10 min with the exposure to the 0 01 m of soda solution finally after extracting the adsorbent from the solution and washing with distilled water for four times it was used in the lead solution of 25 ppm for reuse this cycle was carried out for four times and adsorbent reuse possibility was examined for adsorption processes to investigate the lead adsorption kinetic pseudo first order and pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion models were used table 1 adsorption kinetic is used to determine the control mechanisms of adsorption processes such as adsorption at the surface chemical reaction and diffusion mechanisms the pseudo ﬁrst order and the pseudo second order models mostly used to interpret the external ﬁlm diffusion intra particle diffusion and interaction step between adsorptive and the functional groups of the adsorbent during the adsorption process the elovich kinetic model contains the kinetic of chemisorption on highly heterogeneous adsorbents the intra particle diffusion is a transport process which describes the movement of species from the bulk of the solution to the solid phase 3 23 adsorption isotherms and equilibrium data describe the reaction of pollutants with adsorbent substances and have important roles in the optimization of adsorbent consumption the adsorptive distribution between the solution phase and adsorbent phase is a criterion for equilibrium position in the adsorption process and is generally expressed by the adsorption isotherm models there are isotherm models for the analysis of empirical data and description of equilibrium in the adsorption process such as freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich models table 2 these models are used to present a view about adsorption mechanism surface properties adsorption tendency and description of empirical data therefore the establishment of a suitable relationship between equilibrium diagrams to optimize conditions and design of adsorption systems is very important 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results 3 1 1 sem analysis the results of sem analysis fig 2 with the distribution of zeolite nanoparticles size indicate that almost a distribution of zeolite at an average size of 60 100 nm was obtained from ball milling it seems that due to the small size of particles and high surface to volume ratio aggregation of particles was occurred the high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles usually results in highly reactive and colloidal instability compared to their bulk counterparts high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles provides a very high surface energy to minimize its surface energy the nanoparticles create agglomeration 25 27 in this study four different nanofibers have been prepared to investigate the role of the high surface area of nanofibrous morphology and nanoparticles zeolite and clay on pc adsorbent the structure of electrospun nanocomposite nanofibers was investigated using fesem micrographs and fiber diameters distribution histogram was revealed in fig 3 the results reveal that all samples have uniform bead free nanofibrous structure and different mean fiber diameter was obtained by introducing nanoparticles to the polymeric structure as can be seen from images average fiber diameter has increased with the addition of nanoparticles because with the addition of nanoparticles viscosity and surface tension increase and these changes increase the fiber diameter 28 according to table 3 with the addition of clay mineral to polycaprolactone macromolecular structure average fiber diameter has increased 230 5 to 460 4 nm also with the addition of zeolite nanoparticles to polycaprolactone polymer increased average fiber diameter is observed from 230 5 to 457 4 nm 3 1 2 tem analysis in fig 4 the results of tem images for polycaprolactone nanofibrous adsorbent with zeolite and clay mineral show that almost a uniform distribution is obtained from nanoparticles inside the fibers however due to the small size of particles and their high surface to volume ratio the accumulation of particles was observed 3 1 3 edx analysis of pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent the elemental analysis of nanofibers is performed by edx investigation and can be observed in fig 5 the elements composition in the nanofiber structure was determined in the edx spectrum peaks emerged in 0 290 0 530 1 130 1 700 1 740 1 800 and 2 150 kev are related to c o na al si k and ca respectively the elemental composition of nanofibers determined by edx reveals the components na al si k and ca correspond to zeolite and clay structures that are encapsulated within fibers with mostly c and o elements 3 1 4 ftir analysis to determine the functional groups that exist in the nanofibrous adsorbent structure fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used fig 6 the spectrum in the emerged adsorption frequencies includes 2949 cm 1 symmetrical tension ch2 2868 cm 1 asymmetrical tension ch2 1732 cm 1 carbonyl tension 1294 cm 1 cc and c o bands tension 1239 cm 1 c o c symmetrical tension that indicate polycaprolactone constituent bonds si o si stretching vibration in adsorption frequency of 1108 cm 1 is zeolite main vibration the vibration peak of 3480 cm 1 indicated oh groups in al oh si with zeolite structure about clay the spectrum the adsorption frequency of 2949 cm 1 indicates stretching vibration of c h stretching vibration of al oh emerged in 773 cm 1 peaks emerged in 1369 and 1108 cm 1 are related to stretching vibration of c oh and flexural vibration of ch3 in all cases it can be observed that pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent components are bonded without a specific chemical reaction 3 2 the results of adsorption experiments by pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent 3 2 1 investigating the kinetics of lead adsorption one important factor to design an adsorption system is the prediction of adsorption speed adsorption kinetics is dependent on the chemical and physical properties of the adsorbent substance that influence the adsorption mechanism kinetics investigation of intermittent adsorption is one of the most important methods to predict adsorption mechanism and adsorption speed limiting phases such as mass transfer or chemical reaction adsorption kinetics describes the adsorbent factor and determines the equilibrium time of adsorbent solution reaction in this phase the adsorption process kinetics was investigated by pc cl ze nanofibrous adsorbent it is worth noting that the preparation of all solutions and experiments are according to the guidelines in fig 7 lead concentration changes in the solution due to lead adsorption by the adsorbent over time and also the adsorbed metal mass changes for the used pseudo mass in the process with time are shown values are related to 0 01 g of adsorbent in 25 ml of lead solution as can be seen from this figure the adsorbent in about 10 min adsorbed a large part of the lead in the solution that can be due to the presence of many adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface however over time and with the occupation of these active sites by lead lead adsorption speed decreases to the point where adsorption equilibrium is achieved therefore according to the subtle concentration changes after 2 h of starting the process this period was considered to reach adsorption equilibrium or equilibrium time at this moment lead concentration in the solution reaches a constant value that is called equilibrium concentration ce at equilibrium time adsorption value reaches its maximum level and is indicated with equilibrium adsorption capacity qe in the next step the empirical data resulted from common adsorption kinetics models such as the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model intra particle diffusion model and elovich model were adapted the results of matching data with the linear form of these models are presented in fig 7 and table 4 r2 has been used to compare and investigate the deviation of laboratory data empirical mode from the existing model the nearness of r2 to 1 indicates deviation less than the model of interest according to the resulted r2 values related to the models in use and also nearness of qe value obtained through the model to the qe value resulted from laboratory data that can be observed on the profile of adsorption value changes relative to time it is concluded that the information obtained from experiments are consistent with the pseudo second order model and an acceptable trend exists in laboratory data also in an intra particle diffusion model fig 7f ki 1 ki 2 ki 3 shows adsorption phases at the external surface an internal surface and equilibrium and in the first phase the adsorbent molecules should be transferred from mass phase to the adsorbent particle surface in this action the adsorbent molecules should pass through the soluble film that has surrounded the adsorbent particle this phase is known as film diffusion and in the second phase the adsorbed molecules should be transferred to the locations that are available inside the porosity this process is expressed as diffusion into porosity and in the final phase it should be bonded to the adsorbent surface that leads to equilibrium 29 3 2 2 investigation of the lead adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are diagrams that show the relationship between equilibrium adsorption qe and the equilibrium concentration of the substance remaining in the solution ce at a fixed temperature that can be described by some of the isotherm models the isotherm type can provide information about the nature of the adsorbent and adsorption also adsorption isotherms have been used to describe the adsorption capacity and are efficient for the analysis and design of adsorption systems equilibrium achievement time can be determined through adsorption kinetics experiment to carry out adsorption experiments it is attempted to have longer time period relative to the equilibrium time obtained from kinetics experiments adsorption process equilibrium is almost described by the compliance of experimental data with models that in this study freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich models were investigated and were used to express the quantitative relationships between a substance adsorbed on the adsorbent at three temperatures of 30 35 and 40 c to examine the adsorption isotherm models 0 01 g of the nanofibrous adsorbent with a lead solution concentration of 25 ppm with a ph of 5 5 was used in fig 8 the results of equilibrium data fitting with freundlich langmuir dubinin radushkevich and temkin models can be observed and in table 5 the coefficients of different isotherm models are reported for lead adsorption by the synthesized nanofibrous adsorbent the results show that the experimental data have acceptable consistency with the models but the freundlich model is more consistent compared with the other models in the freundlich model it is assumed that the energy between different adsorption locations is not equal and different functional groups keep ions with different energy levels 3 2 3 thermodynamics of lead adsorption lead thermodynamic parameters are effective to identify endothermic or exothermic processes and also to determine its spontaneity to investigate the thermodynamics the lead adsorption by the adsorbent change in parameters of gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs at different temperatures of 30 35 and 40 c were investigated thermodynamic variables such as δh and δs were calculated using the van t hoff equation and also the slope of a curve 1 t based on lnkd 3 l n k d δ h r t δ s r 4 kd co ce v m ce 5 δ g δ h t δ s 6 e α δ h r t in these relationships eα is the adsorption process energy activation 30 δh and δs are characterized by the slope and y intercept of lnkd diagram based on 1 t fig 9 the results of the thermodynamic investigations are presented in table 6 negative values of δg in all temperatures and concentrations show a spontaneity of the lead adsorption process also decreased δg value with increased temperature shows that higher temperatures are more suitable for this process on the other hand δg values at three temperatures for lower lead concentrations are higher than the values related to higher lead concentration and this shows that lead adsorption is better at lower lead concentrations positive δh values show that lead interaction with amine and hydroxide groups available on the adsorption surface is endothermic and therefore lead adsorption increases with increased temperature δg values are large enough that indicates a strong interaction between the metal and the adsorbent positive δs values are related to increased disorder in adsorbent solution interaction in the adsorption process 3 2 4 investigating the effect of different parameters on the lead adsorption 3 2 4 1 the effect of temperature according to the lead equilibrium data in different temperatures based on fig 10 lead adsorption capacity increases with increased temperature and this phenomenon can be due to the activation of adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface and increased lead reaction rate with these sites 31 ph as one of the important adsorption parameters influences chemical properties of the metal solution functional groups in the adsorbent and ionic competition 32 as can be seen from fig 11 with increased initial ph of the metal solution adsorption capacity increase surface sites of metal adsorption are involved in the effect of ph on the lead adsorption lead ions in aqueous solutions in low ph are as hydrated cations and in high ph are as insoluble hydroxides in low ph hydronium ions h3o bond to the adsorbent ligands and due to the created repulsive forces metal positive ions are not allowed to be close to the adsorbent in other words in low ph due to high proton concentrations and protonation of the adsorbent the negative load on these sites decreases and for this reason bonding of metal positive ions is prevented when ph increases most of the ligands are released and their negative load leads to metal adsorption on the adsorbent in very high ph due to the lead sedimentation in the form of lead hydroxide metal adsorption decreases and we witness this phenomenon on ph higher than 5 5 as can be observed from fig 12 with the increased adsorbent amount the adsorbed lead per adsorbent mass unit specific adsorption capacity decreases when adsorbent amount increases adsorption sites available for the lead increase and better adsorption occurs decreased specific adsorption capacity may be due to the insufficiency of metal ions in solution relative to adsorption sites available for the metal or due to the accumulation of the adsorbent particles in high adsorbent value and then interaction between adsorption sites also the accumulation can lead to a decreased total area of the adsorbent surface and increased the length of diffusion 3 2 4 2 the effect of the initial concentration the initial metal solution influences the adsorption capacity according to the results of investigations in fig 13 for higher concentrations of the lead solution adsorption increases that are related to the improved gradient of lead concentration as the driving force of mass transfer although this increase is observed in adsorption capacity metal adsorption percentage decreases fig 14 that can be due to the insufficient surface to adsorb more metal that is available in the solution with higher concentration 3 3 regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent are important in functional terms to reject the adsorbed lead from the adsorbent after the adsorption process the adsorbent was exposed to ultrasonic with sodium chloride then the adsorbent was separated from the solution and for the activation of adsorbent groups available on the adsorbent surface the recovered particles were exposed to sodium hydroxide and washed with distilled water for three times and then used for lead adsorption this cycle was carried out for four times and reusability of the adsorbent was investigated for adsorption processes fig 15 that show the adsorbent still has lead adsorption ability after four cycles 3 4 comparison of the lead adsorption by the adsorbent and its components table 7 presents a comparison of the lead adsorption capacity by the adsorbent and the other same adsorbents the synthesized nanofibrous adsorbent shows promise and feasibility as an effective adsorbent for lead removal also the results show that increased addition of modified zeolite nanoparticles to polycaprolactone and then its modification with clay leads to increased lead adsorption capacity and this capacity is significant compared with the components 4 conclusion in this study polycaprolactone nanofibrous adsorbent was prepared by electrospinning and then modified by zeolite and clay mineral and characterized by sem tem fesem ftir and edx analyses and then to remove lead the aqueous solution was used empirical data resulted by common adsorption kinetics models such as pseudo first order and pseudo second order models elovich model and intra particle diffusion model were investigated the results showed that in all above cases according to the comparisons laboratory data are consistent with the models in use but at the same time the results of experiments show acceptable correspondence with pseudo second order models adsorption equilibrium was investigated by laboratory data with freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich models the results showed that in all above cases according to the comparisons laboratory data show acceptable correspondence with the models in use but at the same time the freundlich model shows more correspondence compared with other models in thermodynamics estimations negative δg values in all temperatures and concentrations showed spontaneous lead adsorption also the results showed that the addition of clay mineral to zeolite and then their modification increase lead adsorption capacity according to these results this synthetic adsorbent in addition to a high score in terms of simple removal and the ability for recovery and reuse can be introduced as a useful adsorbent for lead and other heavy metals that have similar properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgment financial

diminished the degradation performance from 98 5 in the absence of scavengers to 70 in the presence of nitrate and t but together it clearly proved reductive so3 and eaq radicals and oxidative oh and o2 radicals agents plays a noticeable role in the pcb degradation keywords sulfite tio2 oxidation reduction processes degradation energy consumption kinetic 1 introduction the presence of pollutant compounds in the water solution is harmful to plants animals and humans even at low concentrations 1 6 polychlorinated biphenyls compounds pcbs with chemical formula c12h10 xclx are a group of organic chemicals synthesized in pure white and crystalline form and their industrial compounds are as colorless liquid 5 7 the apparent shape of the pcbs is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary data pcbs are soluble in water but have high solubility in oils and fats pcbs molecular weight is variable depending on the number of chlorine atoms attached to the biphenyl ring compounds in which chlorine atoms are in para and meta conditions are more toxic 8 the toxicity of pcbs varies with respect to the number and location of chlorine ion on the biphenyl ring 9 in general pcbs that are less chlorine and have two rings on one surface and do not have chlorine on the ortho position are more toxic than the rest 10 pcbs are widely used in high concentration 20 to 70 in transformer oil dielectric in capacitors hydraulic fluids in hydraulic tools and equipment heat exchange fluids turbine lubricants and pumps cutting oil for metals as well as in less use is made in plastics surface coatings adhesives pesticides paints inks fire retardants wood preservatives carbonless paper and wax paper when pcbs were entered in the bloodstream they are transported to the liver muscle and fat tissue and accumulate in them conclusive evidence from animal studies has shown that pcbs are carcinogenic researches also suggest that contact to high concentrations of these substances have various acute effects including skin lesions liver damage including hepatitis as well as other short term effects including weight loss impairment of immune function detectable damage clinically and the central nervous system causing headaches dizziness depression anxiety and fatigue other effects of pcbs on health are including damage to the thyroid gland stomach liver behavioral changes and reproductive disorders in this study a combination of pcbs called askarel was used askarel is a blend of several different types of pcb isomers that contain 70 pcbs and 30 trichlorobenzene and used as non flammable insulating materials in capacitors and transformers because pcbs are highly resistant to degradation they remain in soil and water for many years also because of the property of lipophilic they accumulate in biological cells and can enter the food chain therefore apply of the advanced successor techniques for effective elimination of pcbs and other complex compounds from the water solutions is very necessary 11 13 in recent years successful class of wastewater treatment methods based on generation of free radical which are known as advanced oxidation reduction processes aorps have been created 14 these methods have the potential of oxidation the some bonds e g c c 15 16 and reduction of some others e g c cl these methods are very important to the complete degradation of aromatic halogenated organic compounds hocs 17 18 such as pcbs and change of non degradable toxic compounds to simple hydrocarbons and consuming these materials by wide variety of microorganisms 19 the aorps are the processes that both reductive and oxidative agents must be simultaneously present in the reaction medium in these processes organic halogen compounds can be degraded by oxidative and reductive radicals the privileges of these procedures involve the non transferring of target pollutants to the other phase 20 non selectively generation of non toxic products and generation of products with high biodegradability 21 in this study titanium dioxide tio2 as a semiconductor 22 23 and oxidative agent and sodium sulfite na2so3 as a reductive agent in the presence of uvc were applied in order to the production of oxidative and reductive radicals when a semiconductor tio2 is stimulated with energy equal to or greater than the band gap 24 25 an electron is released from the valence band 26 generating a positive hole in the valence band and transferred to conduction band as eq 1 27 30 1 s e m i c o n d u c t o r h v e h photo generated positive holes h in the valence band of semi conductor react very fast with hydrogen bond in water or hydroxyl ions oh and resulted to generation of oh radicals as oxidative agents eqs 2 and 3 31 2 h h 2 o ho h 3 h o h h o also electrons can react with oxygen to produce superoxide radicals eq 4 4 e o 2 o 2 but it should be noted that only oxidizing agents are not sufficient to completely degradation of pollutants 32 33 in less time and with lower energy consumption and should be used reducing agents along with oxidizing agents because the oxidative and reductive agents together have the high potential for degradation of cc and ccl bands respectively therefore in this research the reductive agent of sodium sulfite was applied along with titanium dioxide as oxidative agent and were stimulated by uvc typically generation of reductive radicals require to addition of some reductive agents such as sulfite carboxylic ferrocyanide or iodide because of great potential of sulfite for reductive degradation of pollutants this reductive agent was chosen as the proper reductive agent to produce the high ability reductive species e g so3 h and eaq based on eqs 5 to 8 assuming high potential for reductive degradation 13 5 so3

of pcb was dissolved in some acetone and reached to the volume 1000 ml using deionized water solutions were prepared daily the special values of sodium sulfite and titanium dioxide were added as powder to the reaction vessel for each test a specific concentration of pcbs with a definite ph level was injected into the reactor then tio2 and sulfite with a specific molar ratio were added to the reactor the aorp initiated by switching on the power supply and irradiation of the uv lamp finally to investigate performance of ust in the degradation of pcb after a preset time a sample was taken from the solution and analyzed by gc also sample taken analyzed for investigation the mineralization also for comparison control experiments were done for uv alone us and ut under similar conditions the scavenging experimental were done in order to investigate of reaction mechanism and the involvement of each the specific reactive agent in the degradation of pcbs to this purpose scavengers of the oxidative agents ammonium oxalate p benzoquinone and tert butanol and the reductive agents nitrate nitrite and oxygen were added in the solution and results were compared with condition without scavenger also with attention to presence of various cations and anions in natural water that might intervene with the oxidative and reductive agents the effect of tap water on the removal performance of aorp was considered 2 3 analytical methods the initial and final concentrations were measured by gas chromatograph coupled with a 63ni electron capture detector gc ecd shimadzu 2010 to this purpose the samples were taken and centrifuged for 5 min in order to separation of photocatalyst after the centrifuge supernatant was taken and shaken with 2 ml of a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane 1 1 for 15 min the extracted samples were concentrated to 0 5 ml using a nitrogen evaporator after that a screw capped vials were applied to store the obtained product at 4 c before analysis arxixlb capillary column 30 mm 0 32 mm 0 5 μm was applied to analysis by gc ecd the injection port and detector temperature were held at 250 c and 320 c respectively flow rate of carrier gas was adjusted at 1

c at rate of 2 0 c min for 3 min the removal performance calculated as following 9 r a 0 a t a 0 100 where a0 and at are the peak areas of pcbs before i e at zero time and after irradiation at t time respectively in order to obtain a standard chromatograph an astm d4059 method was used to prepare samples of 29 polybrominated bisphenyl isomers pcb 8 pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 49 pcb 44 pcb 37 pcb 66 pcb 74

degradation but with attention to determination of the photogenerated reductive and oxidative species in the solution is almost impossible therefore a pseudo first order mode was applied as a proper

efficiency to elucidate the performance of the ust treatment the degradation rate of pcb from aqueous solutions by sulfite tio2 sulfite tio2 uv alone us ut and ust were investigated and results were presented in fig 2 a in these experiments the progress of the processes in the removal pcb 12 mg l 1 was checked within 60 min and the same condition as the presented results ust indicated the higher performance than the rest in the same condition as portrayed in fig 2 a the removal performances for sulfite tio2 sulfite tio2 uv alone us ut and ust were 20 34 36 60 81 8 92 and 98 5 within 60 min of reaction respectively it was observed us has the higher performance than ut until 45 min and after that the performance of us decreased than ut the reason is that the first step in degradation of pcb is the cleavage of c cl bonds 35 the cleavage of c cl bond requires about 525 kj mol energy while 346 358 and 411 kj mol are required to cleavage of the bond energy of cc co and ch respectively the reductive radicals eaq h and so3 due to high quantum yields e g 0 286 mol e 1 for eaq at 253 7 nm can break the c cl bonds of the pcb molecules after breaking c cl bonds the oxidative radicals oh and o2 attack 37 39 to cc co and ch and degrade them a little removal of the pcb by the sulfite tio2 sulfite tio2 can be due to the adsorption of pollutant by them 37 40 the little removal performance of uv can be because of low pcb inclination in uv absorption with wavelength 254 3 nm also the kinetic study was done to compare the performance of various processes the kinetic information for the degradation of pcb using different processes were tabulated in table 2 the kinetic information of presented in table 2 reconfirms the mentioned results in above and the higher performance of ust than the rest values of kobs and robs for ust were higher than those of rest as value of robs for ust was 27 33 16 4 9 84 8 2 2 23 and 1 44 times than that of the sulfite tio2 tio2 sulfite uv alone us and ut respectively investigation of the mineralization of pcb by measuring of cod as an index for conversion of this organic compound into highly stable inorganic compounds e g water carbon dioxide and salt was done and results was portrayed in fig 2 b according the obtained results rates of mineralization for sulfite tio2 sulfite tio2 uv alone us ut and ust were 5 18 21 43 2 66 24 58 89 and 70 92 within 60 min respectively the presented results in above indicate that among the tested techniques the ust treatment due to the simultaneous photogeneration of both the reductive eaq h and so3 41 and oxidative oh and o2 agents is the most appropriate method for removing pcb from aqueous solutions table 3 presents the comparison of pcb removal efficiency for different chemical technologies as shown in table 3 ust process indicated superiority than the other processes for degradation of pcb 3 2 role of ph in the degradation of pcb by the ust the batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of ph on the pcb 12 mg l 1 degradation by the ust in the over the range from 3 0 to 9 and results were portrayed in fig 3 a as portrayed in fig 3 a ph has a noticeable influence on the ust performance as seen in fig 3 a enhancement of removal percentage of pcb was observed when ph moved from 3 to 7 and increase of ph from 7 to 11 resulted to decrease by 12 in the degradation efficiency the maximum degradation rate pcb by ust was achieved in ph 7 0 98 5 after 60 min of reaction it reveals the both oxidation and reduction processes have the highest efficiency in ph 7 0 researchers have been declared ph affects the distribution of the sulfite in solution as bisulfite and sulfite are the major species under the acidic and alkaline conditions respectively 46 47 the different sulfite species in solution have a different uv absorbance it is because of absorption uv with different wavelengths by bisulfite bisulfate does not absorb uv in the range of 225 300 nm and sulfite sulfite absorbs considerable amount of uv with wavelength 254 nm in which this reaction in turn resulted to generation of the reductive agents eaq h and so3 47 this absorbance behavior suggests acidic ph has not propitiate condition to generate eaq and free radicals like sulfite also in acidic conditions electrons can be quenched by h ions therefore the only removal mechanism of pcbs in the lower phs is direct photolysis in contrast sulfite ph 7 to 9 has a high ability to produce reductive radicals on the other hand the high performance of the aop ut in the natural ph can be created with production of hydroxyl ions oh in tio2 irradiated with uv that in turn react with the generated positive holes h in order to form oh radicals eq 3 48 49 similarly with us reaction in the acidic ph uv absorbance with wavelength 253 7 nm by tio2 than the basic ph is very weak that this resulted to decrease of generation of the positive electron h hole and the electron e also reaction between h ions generated in acidic ph and the electrons e emitted from valence band of tio2 can be other reason for diminution of us performance all of these will result in an impressive drop in the production of superoxide o2 and oh radicals resulting decline of the removal performance 37 also the rate mineralization of pcb by ust fig 3 b in the different phs indicated the highest rate reduction in ph 7 0 that was higher than that of the rest 3 3 effect of the sulfite tio2 molar ratio on pcb degradation by the ust process to investigate the influence of the sulfite tio2 molar ratio on the performance of the ust process this ratio was altered and results were presented in fig 4 as portrayed in fig 4 the molar ratio of sulfite tio2 of 1 1 and 3 1 indicated the maximum and minimum performance of pcb removal within 60 min of reaction respectively these results reveal molar ratio of reductive agent to oxidative agent should be determined carefully because in the inappropriate molar ratio reductive agent to oxidative agent each reactive agent can act as scavenger of opposite radicals resulting diminution in the performance of the ust 19 3 4 effect of pcb concentration in the degradation of pcb by ust process an important issue in relation to a process is to evaluate the efficiency of the process in industrial applications to this purpose the ust performance was evaluated in different concentrations 1 12 mg l 1 within a range of reaction times 5 60 min fig 5 portraits the rate of the potential performance for ust process in the degradation of different concentrations pcb as shown in fig 5 with increasing time from 5 to 60 min the removal efficiency increased yielding 98 5 for a concentration of 12 mg l 1 after 60 min of the reaction for lower concentrations complete removal of the pollutant was achieved at lower times the reason for decreasing the process efficiency by increasing concentration especially at lower reaction times can be for three reasons i lack of reaction time between the uvc and the oxidizing or reducing agents ii not enough of the produced radicals iii adsorption of high proportion of light by pollutant which could be very effective in radicals production 46 50 51 3 5 effect of co existing water ions on pcb degradation there are various anions and cations in the natural environment that can affect the usp performance to this purpose tap water was used instead of distilled water to prepare the solution containing pcb thus a solution of 12 mg l 1 of pcb using tap water was prepared and was subjected to usp process tap water specifications are listed in table s1 in the supplementary data the comparison of results obtained from the degradation of pcb in the solution prepared with distilled water and tap water data not shown showed that there is a very slight difference in process performance which can be due to ability the of co existing water ions to absorb the uv light and neutralization of the photogenerated species or production of anionic radicals that are less reactive than the oh and eaq agents 41 47 52 3 6 electrical energy consumption and the total cost of the system the electric energy per mass removed eem in kwh kg is an important parameter to estimate the electrical energy cost of uv based wastewater treatments because performance of aorp is affected by the electric energy electrical energy per order eeo is defined as the amount of required electrical energy kw to diminish the content of a pollutant by 90 in 1 m3 of the contaminated solution this parameter can be calculated as the following formula 53 54 15 e e o 38 4 p v k o b s where p is electrical power applied kw for the system uv lamp and v is the volume of pcb in inside reactor l the values of eeo for the various processes were calculated and listed in table 4 the results indicated that ust process can be as an appropriate process for degradation of pcb in terms of energy saving rather than other processes because it reduces energy consumption and can be a good cost effective alternative also to calculate the total cost of the system tcs m 3 the following equation was applied 55 56 16 tcs 1 45 e e o k w h m 3 p o w e r cos t k w h o x i d a n t cos t g 1 r e d u c tan t cos t g 1 the summery of the total cost required to operate the each system was presented in table 4 as table 4 ust and us were indicated the less total cost than the other processes but according to lower electrical energy consumption and higher kobs was reported to be more efficient process in the degradation of pcb 3 7 effect of scavengers and possible degradation mechanism of ust system to approve involvement of free radical species on the decomposition of pcb various scavengers 0 1 mm including ammonium oxalate ao as scavenger for oh p benzoquinone bq as scavenger for hole and tert butanol t but as scavenger for o2 and oh radicals and nitrate nitrite and o2 as scavengers of eaq and so3 37 48 were added to the photoreactor and results were presented in fig 6 as portrayed in fig 6 the degradation performance reduces upon addition of the scavengers specifically addition of nitrate and t but together which are strong scavengers of eaq and o2 and oh radicals respectively significantly diminished the degradation performance from 98 5 in the absence of scavengers to 70 in the presence of nitrate and t but together it can be concluded that mechanism of pcb degradation is depended on the stimulation of tio2 and sulfite by uvc and both of reductive and oxidative radicals play a key role in the degradation of pcb 41 57 the reason for slightly decrease of ust performance with addition of scavengers can be due to the low amount of scavengers added in solution 0 1 mm as in the higher amounts of scavengers decrease of ust performance will be significant 58 3 8 the final products produced after degradation of pcb by usp the chromatograph associated with the initial sample the pcb input to in the usp photoreactor a and after 60 min of contact with the aorp method b the pcb output from the usp photoreactor is portrayed in fig 7 also the concentration of various pcb compounds in the initial sample and after 60 min of contact with the aorp method is presented in table 5 according to the obtained results the ust process has not enough ability for the complete mineralization of final compounds and the conversion of these compounds into water and carbon dioxide according to the gc mass analysis shorter peaks formation and the some aromatic compounds in the final compounds can be a sign of insufficient pcb mineralization regarding the graphs a number of pcbs with higher molecular weight and more chlorine have been completely eliminated but the final elimination of these compounds would probably require longer reactions and higher radiation intensity with stronger radiation in fact according to the results presented in table 5 this process can reduce the amount of primary pollutant toxicity reducing the amount of chlorine in the initial pcb structure and conversion it into a product with high biodegradability therefore it can be said that the advanced aorp process has the ability to break down the c cl and cc bands of pcbs and can make these compounds available to microorganisms in a biological purification process 4 conclusions in this work sulfite and tio2 are stimulated by uv irradiation with 253 7 nm wavelength to generate both oxidative and reductive agents and degrade pcb based on the findings of this research 1 ust process has the more performance than the us and ut processes in the degradation and mineralization of pcbs 2 the ph had a noticeable influence on the ust performance the maximum degradation rate for ust was achieved in ph 7 0 after 60 min of reaction 3 these results revealed molar ratio of reductive agent to oxidative agent should be determined carefully because in the inappropriate molar ratio reductive agent to oxidative agent each reactive agent can act as scavenger of opposite radicals 4 investigate of reaction mechanism revealed that pcb degradation is depended on the stimulation of tio2 and sulfite simultaneously by uvc 5 the gc mass analysis of the ust effluent indicated the produced final products have the low toxicity and the high mineralization ability acknowledgements this study is related to the project no ir

14286,this study relies on the uv irradiation of sulfite and tio2 i e uv sulfite tio2 ust as a novel method of advanced oxidation reduction processes aorps to generate both oxidative and reductive agents simultaneously for degradation and mineralization of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs the degradation performances of pcbs by uv alone uv sulfite us and uv tio2 ut were estimated 60 81 8 and 92 respectively under selected conditions pcb concentration 12 mg l 1 ph 7 ratio of sulfite tio2 1 1 reaction time 60 min the 98 5 degradation of pcbs was obtained when both oxidative and reductive agents ust were applied simultaneously also as the kinetic information value of robs for ust was 27 33 16 4 9 84 8 2 2 23 and 1 44 times than that of the sulfite tio2 tio2 sulfite uv alone us and ut respectively also values of energy consumption for uv alone us ut and ust were calculated 426 115 13 74 4 and 51 95 kw h m 3 respectively the maximum mineralization percentage for ust was obtained 70 92 under selected conditions the results indicated addition of nitrate and t but which are strong scavengers of eaq and so3 and o2 and oh radicals respectively simultaneously significantly was diminished the degradation performance from 98 5 in the absence of scavengers to 70 in the presence of nitrate and t but together it clearly proved reductive so3 and eaq radicals and oxidative oh and o2 radicals agents plays a noticeable role in the pcb degradation keywords sulfite tio2 oxidation reduction processes degradation energy consumption kinetic 1 introduction the presence of pollutant compounds in the water solution is harmful to plants animals and humans even at low concentrations 1 6 polychlorinated biphenyls compounds pcbs with chemical formula c12h10 xclx are a group of organic chemicals synthesized in pure white and crystalline form and their industrial compounds are as colorless liquid 5 7 the apparent shape of the pcbs is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary data pcbs are soluble in water but have high solubility in oils and fats pcbs molecular weight is variable depending on the number of chlorine atoms attached to the biphenyl ring compounds in which chlorine atoms are in para and meta conditions are more toxic 8 the toxicity of pcbs varies with respect to the number and location of chlorine ion on the biphenyl ring 9 in general pcbs that are less chlorine and have two rings on one surface and do not have chlorine on the ortho position are more toxic than the rest 10 pcbs are widely used in high concentration 20 to 70 in transformer oil dielectric in capacitors hydraulic fluids in hydraulic tools and equipment heat exchange fluids turbine lubricants and pumps cutting oil for metals as well as in less use is made in plastics surface coatings adhesives pesticides paints inks fire retardants wood preservatives carbonless paper and wax paper when pcbs were entered in the bloodstream they are transported to the liver muscle and fat tissue and accumulate in them conclusive evidence from animal studies has shown that pcbs are carcinogenic researches also suggest that contact to high concentrations of these substances have various acute effects including skin lesions liver damage including hepatitis as well as other short term effects including weight loss impairment of immune function detectable damage clinically and the central nervous system causing headaches dizziness depression anxiety and fatigue other effects of pcbs on health are including damage to the thyroid gland stomach liver behavioral changes and reproductive disorders in this study a combination of pcbs called askarel was used askarel is a blend of several different types of pcb isomers that contain 70 pcbs and 30 trichlorobenzene and used as non flammable insulating materials in capacitors and transformers because pcbs are highly resistant to degradation they remain in soil and water for many years also because of the property of lipophilic they accumulate in biological cells and can enter the food chain therefore apply of the advanced successor techniques for effective elimination of pcbs and other complex compounds from the water solutions is very necessary 11 13 in recent years successful class of wastewater treatment methods based on generation of free radical which are known as advanced oxidation reduction processes aorps have been created 14 these methods have the potential of oxidation the some bonds e g c c 15 16 and reduction of some others e g c cl these methods are very important to the complete degradation of aromatic halogenated organic compounds hocs 17 18 such as pcbs and change of non degradable toxic compounds to simple hydrocarbons and consuming these materials by wide variety of microorganisms 19 the aorps are the processes that both reductive and oxidative agents must be simultaneously present in the reaction medium in these processes organic halogen compounds can be degraded by oxidative and reductive radicals the privileges of these procedures involve the non transferring of target pollutants to the other phase 20 non selectively generation of non toxic products and generation of products with high biodegradability 21 in this study titanium dioxide tio2 as a semiconductor 22 23 and oxidative agent and sodium sulfite na2so3 as a reductive agent in the presence of uvc were applied in order to the production of oxidative and reductive radicals when a semiconductor tio2 is stimulated with energy equal to or greater than the band gap 24 25 an electron is released from the valence band 26 generating a positive hole in the valence band and transferred to conduction band as eq 1 27 30 1 s e m i c o n d u c t o r h v e h photo generated positive holes h in the valence band of semi conductor react very fast with hydrogen bond in water or hydroxyl ions oh and resulted to generation of oh radicals as oxidative agents eqs 2 and 3 31 2 h h 2 o ho h 3 h o h h o also electrons can react with oxygen to produce superoxide radicals eq 4 4 e o 2 o 2 but it should be noted that only oxidizing agents are not sufficient to completely degradation of pollutants 32 33 in less time and with lower energy consumption and should be used reducing agents along with oxidizing agents because the oxidative and reductive agents together have the high potential for degradation of cc and ccl bands respectively therefore in this research the reductive agent of sodium sulfite was applied along with titanium dioxide as oxidative agent and were stimulated by uvc typically generation of reductive radicals require to addition of some reductive agents such as sulfite carboxylic ferrocyanide or iodide because of great potential of sulfite for reductive degradation of pollutants this reductive agent was chosen as the proper reductive agent to produce the high ability reductive species e g so3 h and eaq based on eqs 5 to 8 assuming high potential for reductive degradation 13 5 so3

at 253 7 nm for degradation of pcbs and no has been previously studied in other research 2 materials and methods 2 1 uv photo reactor all the experiments were done inside a lab scale photoreactor in the batch mode the photoreactor applied in this research included a low pressure mercury lamp as the irradiation source with 6 w power and 254 nm wavelength with a quartz sleeve enclosure at 1 cm distance from the quartz sleeve that was placed at the center of the reactor the uvc 512 light meter professional equipment janesville wi usa was applied to measure the intensity of the uv light radiation water circulation through a waterjacket was applied to keep the temperature constant and prevention from the temperature influence on the process efficiency schematic view of the photoreactor portrayed in fig 1 2 2 photocatalytic degradation experiments all solutions were prepared with deionized water to prepare the pcb solution at a desired concentration the required amount of pcb was dissolved in some acetone and reached to the volume 1000 ml using deionized water solutions were prepared daily the special values of sodium sulfite and titanium dioxide were added as powder to the reaction vessel for each test a specific concentration of pcbs with a definite ph level was injected into the reactor then tio2 and sulfite with a specific molar ratio were added to the reactor the aorp initiated by switching on the power supply and irradiation of the uv lamp finally to investigate performance of ust in the degradation of pcb after a preset time a sample was taken from the solution and analyzed by gc also sample taken analyzed for investigation the mineralization also for comparison control experiments were done for uv alone us and ut under similar conditions the scavenging experimental were done in order to investigate of reaction mechanism and the involvement of each the specific reactive agent in the degradation of pcbs to this purpose scavengers of the oxidative agents ammonium oxalate p benzoquinone and tert butanol and the reductive agents nitrate nitrite and oxygen were added in the solution and results were compared with condition without scavenger also with attention to presence of various cations and anions in natural water that might intervene with the oxidative and reductive agents the effect of tap water on the removal performance of aorp was considered 2 3 analytical methods the initial and final concentrations were measured by gas chromatograph coupled with a 63ni electron capture detector gc ecd shimadzu 2010 to this purpose the samples were taken and centrifuged for 5 min in order to separation of photocatalyst after the centrifuge supernatant was taken and shaken with 2 ml of a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane 1 1 for 15 min the extracted samples were concentrated to 0 5 ml using a nitrogen evaporator after that a screw capped vials were applied to store the obtained product at 4 c before analysis arxixlb capillary column 30 mm 0 32 mm 0 5 μm was applied to analysis by gc ecd the injection port and detector temperature were held at 250 c and 320 c respectively flow rate of carrier gas was adjusted at 1 7 ml min the volume of injection was 2 0 μl the temperature of the oven was kept at 100 c for 1 min and then climbed up to 270 c at rate of 30 c min for 1 min 5 the temperature of oven was held at 300 c at rate of 2 0 c min for 3 min the removal performance calculated as following 9 r a 0 a t a 0 100 where a0 and at are the peak areas of pcbs before i e at zero time and after irradiation at t time respectively in order to obtain a standard chromatograph an astm d4059 method was used to prepare samples of 29 polybrominated bisphenyl isomers pcb 8 pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 49 pcb 44 pcb 37 pcb 66 pcb 74

combination samples were prepared at concentrations of 50 200 400 and 600 μg per liter and injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with ecd detector and the area under the curve was recorded in each case the chromatogram of the sample standard was presented in fig s2 askarel oil was used to make pcbs solutions the initial result of askarel oil analysis were presented in table1 also the chromatograph of initial askarel oil analysis was presented in fig s3 2 4 performance indices the degradation performance and mineralization of pcb by ust were determined according to eqs 10 and 11

degradation but with attention to determination of the photogenerated reductive and oxidative species in the solution is almost impossible therefore a pseudo first order mode was applied as a proper

following formula 53 54 15 e e o 38 4 p v k o b s where p is electrical power applied kw for the system uv lamp and v is the volume of pcb in inside reactor l the values of eeo for the various processes were calculated and listed in table 4 the results indicated that ust process can be as an appropriate process for degradation of pcb in terms of energy saving rather than other processes because it reduces energy consumption and can be a good cost effective alternative also to calculate the total cost of the system tcs m 3 the following equation was applied 55 56 16 tcs 1 45 e e o k w h m 3 p o w e r cos t k w h o x i d a n t cos t g 1 r e d u c tan t cos t g 1 the summery of the total cost required to operate the each system was presented in table 4 as table 4 ust and us were indicated the less total cost than the other processes but according to lower electrical energy consumption and higher kobs was reported to be more efficient process in the degradation of pcb 3 7 effect of scavengers and possible degradation mechanism of ust system to approve involvement of free radical species on the decomposition of pcb various scavengers 0 1 mm including ammonium oxalate ao as scavenger for oh p benzoquinone bq as scavenger for hole and tert butanol t but as scavenger for o2 and oh radicals and nitrate nitrite and o2 as scavengers of eaq and so3 37 48 were added to the photoreactor and results were presented in fig 6 as portrayed in fig 6 the degradation performance reduces upon addition of the scavengers specifically addition of nitrate and t but together which are strong scavengers of eaq and o2 and oh radicals respectively significantly diminished the degradation performance from 98 5 in the absence of scavengers to 70 in the presence of nitrate and t but together it can be concluded that mechanism of pcb degradation is depended on the stimulation of tio2 and sulfite by uvc and both of reductive and oxidative radicals play a key role in the degradation of pcb 41 57 the reason for slightly decrease of ust performance with addition of scavengers can be due to the low amount of scavengers added in solution 0 1 mm as in the higher amounts of scavengers decrease of ust performance will be significant 58 3 8 the final products produced after degradation of pcb by usp the chromatograph associated with the initial sample the pcb input to in the usp photoreactor a and after 60 min of contact with the aorp method b the pcb output from the usp photoreactor is portrayed in fig 7 also the concentration of various pcb compounds in the initial sample and after 60 min of contact with the aorp method is presented in table 5 according to the obtained results the ust process has not enough ability for the complete mineralization of final compounds and the conversion of these compounds into water and carbon dioxide according to the gc mass analysis shorter peaks formation and the some aromatic compounds in the final compounds can be a sign of insufficient pcb mineralization regarding the graphs a number of pcbs with higher molecular weight and more chlorine have been completely eliminated but the final elimination of these compounds would probably require longer reactions and higher radiation intensity with stronger radiation in fact according to the results presented in table 5 this process can reduce the amount of primary pollutant toxicity reducing the amount of chlorine in the initial pcb structure and conversion it into a product with high biodegradability therefore it can be said that the advanced aorp process has the ability to break down the c cl and cc bands of pcbs and can make these compounds available to microorganisms in a biological purification process 4 conclusions in this work sulfite and tio2 are stimulated by uv irradiation with 253 7 nm wavelength to generate both oxidative and reductive agents and degrade pcb based on the findings of this research 1 ust process has the more performance than the us and ut processes in the degradation and mineralization of pcbs 2 the ph had a noticeable influence on the ust performance the maximum degradation rate for ust was achieved in ph 7 0 after 60 min of reaction 3 these results revealed molar ratio of reductive agent to oxidative agent should be determined carefully because in the inappropriate molar ratio reductive agent to oxidative agent each reactive agent can act as scavenger of opposite radicals 4 investigate of reaction mechanism revealed that pcb degradation is depended on the stimulation of tio2 and sulfite simultaneously by uvc 5 the gc mass analysis of the ust effluent indicated the produced final products have the low toxicity and the high mineralization ability acknowledgements this study is related to the project no ir

14287,olive mill wastewater omw is the main olive processing residual product and its disposal represent a relevant environmental issue in mediterranean countries specialy in tunisia where olive oil production is largely received in a revised form and concentrated in a short lasting period omw is characterised not only by its high pollutant load salinity and phytotoxic levels of polyphenols but also by a high amount of organic compounds and plant mineral therefore the optimization process was analyzed using custom response surface methodology rsm and central composite design ccd in the

respectively indicating an excellent evaluation of experimental data by polynomial regression model uv vis spectroscopy analysis confirmed the biodegradability of omw by the developed bacterial consortium keywords biodegradation decolorization olive mill wastewater response surface methodology uv visible 1 introduction olive oil industry actually one of the main agricultural activities in the mediterranean basin countries generates two main waste water streams the ﬁrst one from the washing of the fruit olives per ton of processed olives washing wastewater oww and the second one from the extraction of the olive oil olive mill wastewater omw a mixture of the proper olive fruit humidity along with process added water 1 one of the biggest problems in olive oil production is the huge amount of solid and liquid waste produced by the process this liquid waste also known as olive oil mill water omw is a serious environmental pollutant in olive oil producing areas this is because the process has high chemical oxygen demand cod and releases phytotoxins in traditional olive oil mills working with the batch press method no longer in wide use 0 4 0 6 m3 of omw were produced per ton processed olives whereas nowadays an average sized modern olive oil factory leads to a daily amount of up to 10 15 m3 in sum to 1 m3 day of oww omw are stable emulsions composed of water olive pulp remains and residual oil 2 due to their high content on phenolic compounds pc directly disposed into the environment 3 4 cod and long chain fatty acids omw are toxic to microorganisms and plants 5 a common use of omw is as soil amendment but it can cause phytotoxic problems and change physicochemical characteristics of the soil 6 bioremediation is environmentally friendly and cost competitive in comparison to chemical decomposition 7 this treatment can reduce cod and phenolic content thus facilitating further man agement before its disposal 8 nevertheless when present at low concentrations phenols can act as inhibitors of many microorganisms and may reduce the performance of biological treatments therefore in many cases it is necessary to dilute omw in order to reduce its toxicity to microorganisms increasing water consumption 9 aerobic treatments for omw detoxiﬁcation can be performed by bacteria and fungi 10 11 three types of fungi are commonly used white rot fungi aspergillus sp and several different yeasts 12 among the aspergillus genera aspergillus niger and aspergillus terreus have been the mostly studied species to reduce pc cod and color of omw 13 aspergillus niger belongs to the so called black aspergilli group new species belonging to this group have been isolated from grape berries as aspergillus uvarum and aspergillus ibericus 14 production of enzymes in omw and their detoxiﬁcation by aspergillus ibericus have already been tested 15 but a uvarum has not been studied yet response surface methodology rsm is defined as a tool to analyse the effect of a selected response of independent variables and to model complex systems 16 rsm is a useful approach for analysing biological processes and has been used widely in food science and technology microbiology and enzyme applications 16 mixture methodology and rsm could be associated by studying the physical characteristics of the measured response surface such as the shape slope or the highest

boidinii bacillus sp sphingomonas paucimobilis staphylococcus xylosus and lactobacillussp using custom response surface methodology rsm however the selection of optimal conditions for the growth and the different proportions of the nine microorganisms using the response surface methodology can ameliorate the cell biodegradation performances for the olive mill wastewater the produced metabolites during the degradation were also predicted using uv vis spectroscopy analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 olive mill wastewaters origin and sampling the olive mill wastewaters used for this work comes from a continuous three phase extraction system olive oil extraction factory located in the region of ksarhellal in monastir tunisia a list of significant characteristics of the raw omw sample is given in table 1 these characteristics were determined according to standard methods total phenols were estimated calorimetrically using the folin ciocalteu method 17 all chemicals used were of the highest purity available and of analytical grade 2 2 isolation characterization and screening of microorganisms effluent samples were used to isolate the indigenous microorganisms bacteria were isolated on nutrient agar using serial dilution method and further purified by repeated culture total 9 strains were isolated from textile and olive mill wastewater which were named as s1 s2 s6 t1 t2 t3 f1 f2 and f3 all the strains were then characterized using bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology 18 the isolated strains were then screened on the basis of their decolorization potential each experiment was performed in three replicates to reduce the experimental errors 2 3 biodegradation experiments for the biodegradation experiments olive mill wastewater has been treated in a series of 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at static operating the consortium was grown at 30 c for 48 h in 50 ml of the medium autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min the medium contained per l of the above omw 3 0 g l yeast extract and 1 25 g l glucose and was inoculated with bacterial biomass cell density fixed at od600 1 with the addition of within 24 h at ph 7 150 rpm and 30 c 19 20 2 4 assays samples 10 ml were drawn every 24 h from the shake flasks centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants used for determination of decolorization and cod removal 21 the precipitant was used to calculate the bacteria mass absorbance of the supernatant withdrawn at different time intervals were measured at the maximum absorption wavelength for the effluent λmax 550 nm using a shimadzu double beam spectrophotometer uv 2401 pc shimadzu japan metabolites were extracted from supernatant by adding equal volume of ethyl acetate the samples were used for uv vis spectral analysis the determination of chemical oxygen demand was carried out with o dell and james 22 micro method on samples extracted from biodegradation tests of the effluent the initial absorbance of the effluent was used as a reference the color and cod removal were calculated according to ayed et al 23 2 5 experimental design and methods the d optional method in the experimental design provided by the software minitab ver 14 0 u s federal government common wealth of pennsylvania usa was used to optimize the formulation of the microbial consortium response surface methodology rsm is an empirical quadratic modeling technique that provides the relationship between the set of controllable experimental factors and the observed results this technique is employed to study the interactions among various factors and their corresponding responses it is also used to optimize all affecting parameters collectively by statistical experimental design 24 25 generally the mixture design was used to study the relationships between the proportion of different rate of bacteria table 2 and their responses color and cod removal table 3 since scheffe devised a single lattice and single core design in 1958 the mixture design has developed a variety of methods 26 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical analyses were performed by the use of multiple regressions and anova with the softwares minitab v 14 0 and essential regression v 2 2 the significance of each variable was determined by applying student s t test 27 the p value is the probability that the magnitude of a contrast coefficient is due to random process variability a low p value indicated a real or significant effect 2 7 uv vis spectral decolorization was monitored by uv vis spectroscopic analysis the decolorization of the dye was followed by monitoring changes in its absorption spectrum 200 800 nm using a hitachi uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2401 pc shimadzu japan the obtained results were compared to those of the respective controls the produced metabolites during the omw biodegradation after decolorization of effuent were centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 30 min after complete degradation of adsorbed dye to remove any remained bacterium metabolites were extracted from supernatant by adding equal volume of ethyl acetate the samples were used for uv vis spectral analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 model establishment the response data was obtained from the experiments and is depicted in table 3 the residual errors were calculated for each model to check the conveniance of the fit standard error of regression was used as a

quadratic and interaction coefficients of regression model were significant p 0 05 whereas the lack of fit was non significant p 0 05 thus validating the model the residual plot was plotted from the difference between the experimental and predicted values of dependent variable 3 2 interpretation of contour and surface plots and effect of formulation on the color and cod removal of omw in the mixture design the effect of the variable changes on the responses can be observed on the ternary contour map fig s9 s11 showed the effect of the interaction of aeromonas salmonicidae penicillium sp and cryptococcus humicolus aeromonas hydrophyla candidae boidinii and bacillussp sphingomonas paucimobilis staphylococcus xylosus and lactobacillus sp on the variation of color and cod removal contour plots are useful to establish desirable response values and mixture blends a contour plot provides a two dimensional view where all points having the same response are connected to produce contour lines of constant responses in order to confirm the obtained experimental results of 90 of decolorization and 86 of cod removal a mixture surface plot fig 1 a b were plotted by minitab 14 0 software programme in the regression model there are three independent variables one variable was kept fixed at the center level mi 33 33 mii 33 33 and miii 33 33 for each plot the mixture surface plots fig 2 a b which are a three dimensional graph are represented using decolorization and cod removal based on the simultaneous variation of a salmonicidae penicillium sp and cryptococcus humicolus b a hydrophyla candidae boidinii and bacillussp and c s paucimobilis staphylococcus xylosus and lactobacillus sp in the consortium composition ranging from 0 to 100 for each strain the mixture surface plot also described individual and cumulative effect of these three variables and their subsequent effect on the color 89 58 and cod removal 84 83 the statistical signiﬁcance of the mean square variation ratio due to regression and mean square residual error were tested using analysis of variance only the obtained results for color and cod removal were presented here in for clarity of purpose according to the anova test tab s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 and s7 s8 the adjusted sums of squares adj ss were 56 08 1237 05 for mi 14 92 and 2356 65 for mii 88 14 and 1231 99 for miii and 905 14 and 487 23 for miv allowing the calculation of the fisher ratios f value for assessing the statistical signiﬁcance the model f value were 10 47 8 47 for mi 4 16 32 93 for mii 3 65 7 27 for miii and 5 88 0 22 for miv impling that most of the variation in the response can be explained by the regression equation the associated p value is used to judge whether f ratio is large enough to indicate statistical signiﬁcance a p value below than 0 1 i e α 0 05 or 95 conﬁdence indicated that the model may be considered statistically signﬁcant and the quadratic model is statistically significant for the response and therefore it can be used for further analysis 28 the p value for the regression obtained for color and cod removal for the four design expert was below 0 1 and means consequently that at least one of the terms in the regression equation has signiﬁcant correlation with the response variable the anova test also shows a term for residual error which measures the amount of variation in the response data left unexplained by the model 29 the predicted values using the above equations were compared with experimental values table 3 the summary of the anova tests analysis of variance corresponding to the quadratic eq miv are shown in table 3 the contour plots of color and cod removal showed the behavior of the system 3 3 interpretation of cox response trace plot the perturbation plot was used to study the inﬂuence of the three factors simultaneously mi mii and miii on the cod and color removal fig 3a b the perturbation plot introduced biodegradation as each variable moves from the preferred reference to all zero level constant factors hence the perturbation plots show the factorial level deviation from the adjusted reference point of all the variables 23 the vertical axis is the ﬁtted response color and cod removal and the horizontal axis is the incremental change in each component the reference mixture is shown as the point 0 000 on the horizontal axis 23 this graph is readily interpreted it clearly shows that m i m ii and m iii really exhibits a positive effect 3 4 interpretation of interaction plot miv fig 4a b showed the interaction plot where the lines are not parallel this interaction effect indicates the relationship between m i m ii and m iii on the value of decolorization and cod removal however we used m i m ii m iii associated with the highest mean decolorization and cod removal the two way anova results indicate that the interaction between m i m ii and m iii is significant in order to confirm the experimental results 90 of color removal was obtained when 86 of cod was consumed a response surface optimization curve was plotted by the minitab 14 software program minimum and maximum values of color removal and cod consumption were fixed at 85 91 and 84 86 respectively and target values were fixed at maximum color removal and minimum cod consumption the obtained results as shown in fig 1 clearly indicated that the 89 58 of color removal and the 84 83 cod consumption y value given in fig 1 were predicted if the mi is 33 33 mii is 33 33 and miii is 33 33 3 5 interpretation of residual graph the residuals from a fitted model are the differences between the responses observed at each combination of the explanatory variable values and the corresponding prediction of the response computed using the regression function these residual plots can be used to assess the quality of the regression 30 32 therefore if the residuals appear to be random it suggests that the model fits the data well a normal probability plot of the residuals can be used to check whether the variance is normally distributed if the resulting plot is approximately linear we proceed assuming that the error terms are normally distributed the histogram of the residual can be used to check whether the variance is normally distributed 33 a symmetric bell shaped histogram which is evenly distributed around zero indicates that the normality assumption is likely to be true if the histogram indicates that random error is not normally distributed it suggests that the model s under lying assumptions may have been violated the normal probability plot fig 5a b showed that the distribution of residual value which is defined as the difference between the predicted model and observed experimental forming a straight line in addition residual value are normally distributed on the both sides of the line indicating that the experimental points are reasonably aligned with the predicted value for color and cod removal all points from this residual plot lie close to the straight line confirming the conjecture that effects other than those considered in the model may be readily explained by random noise 19 20 34 the plot between individual residual values and the fitted value showed that all the residuals are scattered randomly at about the zero and one or two points are outliers the histogram of the residuals presented in fig 5 showed the distribution of the residuals for all observations the one long tail in the plot indicated skewness in the data whereas one bar is far from the others these points were outlined the plot is useful when the order of the observations may influence the results which can occur when the data is collected in a line sequence this plot can be helpful to a designed experiment in which the runs are not randomized for residual activity data the residuals appear to be randomly scattered about zero no evidence exists that the regression terms are correlated to each other 35 39 3 6 uv vis analysis fig 6 showed a typical time dependent uv vis spectrum of omw solution during the biodegradation the decrease of absorbance peaks indicated that the dye was removed the omw spectrum in visible region exhibits a main peak with a maximum absorbance at 550 nm fig 6a the decrease of absorbance of effluent fig 6b c d showed a rapid degradation of the omw according to chen et al 40 the bio decolorization of omw can be due to the adsorption to the biomass or the biodegradation if the color removal is attributed only to the biodegradation either the major visible light absorbance peak will disappear or a new peak will appear as shown in fig 6 the main absorbance peak approximately disappeared within 4 days in addition extra absorbance peaks appeared in the decolorized solution probably resulting from the absorbance of metabolites or degraded fragments of the dye molecules 40 these results indicated that the decolorization by the consortium may be largely attributed to biodegradation by optimized consortium miv 3 7 model validation it was observed from the experimental data that the maximum values for decolorization and cod removal was found to be 90 059 and 87 208 for mixture m iv in order to validate the model experiments were conducted with the optimum compositions obtained the predicted optimum results were found to be 89 82 and 86 88 of decolorization and cod removal at composition of 59 a 28 28 b and 12 62 c table 4 the results obtained from the experiment were found to be comparable with the prediction the small variation in the results can be attributed to change in the composition of bacteria used for the validation of experiments 4 conclusions in the current work a nine level nine strians ccd combined with rsm experiments was used for the optimization of the biodegradation of the olive mill wastewater the developed consortium showed a better decolorization yields as compared to pure cultures proving a complementary interaction among various isolated bacteria the consortium achieved significantly an important reduction in color 90 and cod removal 86 in 4 days the biodegradation of the olive mill wastewater was achieved by the developed consortium using 59 aeromonas salmonicidae penicillium sp and cryptococcus humicolus 28 28 aeromonas hydrophyla candidae boidinii and bacillus sp and 12 62 sphingomonas paucimobilis staphylococcus xylosus and lactobacillus sp a very high regression coefficient between the variables and the responses color and cod removal were r2 84 78 and r2 80 44 respectively indicating an excellent evaluation of experimental data by polynomial regression model additionally the method was successfully applied in the biodegradation of the omw uv vis spectroscopy analysis confirmed the biodegradability of the omw by the developed bacterial consortium the results suggest the potential of the consortium for future application towards biodegradation of omw the ability of the bacterial

t3 f1 f2 and f3 all the strains were then characterized using bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology 18 the isolated strains were then screened on the basis of their decolorization potential each experiment was performed in three replicates to reduce the experimental errors 2 3 biodegradation experiments for the biodegradation experiments olive mill wastewater has been treated in a series of 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at static operating the consortium was grown at 30 c for 48 h in 50 ml of the medium autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min the medium contained per l of the above omw 3 0 g l yeast extract and 1 25 g l glucose and was inoculated with bacterial biomass cell density fixed at od600 1 with the addition of within 24 h at ph 7 150 rpm and 30 c 19 20 2 4 assays samples 10 ml were drawn every 24 h from the shake flasks centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants used for determination of decolorization and cod removal 21 the precipitant was used to calculate the bacteria mass absorbance of the supernatant withdrawn at different time intervals were measured at the maximum absorption wavelength for the effluent λmax 550 nm using a shimadzu double beam spectrophotometer uv 2401 pc shimadzu japan metabolites were extracted from supernatant by adding equal volume of ethyl acetate the samples were used for uv vis spectral analysis the determination of chemical oxygen demand was carried out with o dell and james 22 micro method on samples extracted from biodegradation tests of the effluent the initial absorbance of the effluent was used as a reference the color and cod removal were calculated according to ayed et al 23 2 5 experimental design and methods the d optional method in the experimental design provided by the software minitab ver 14 0 u s federal government common wealth of pennsylvania usa was used to optimize the formulation of the microbial consortium response surface methodology rsm is an empirical quadratic modeling technique that provides the relationship between the set of controllable experimental factors and the observed results this technique is employed to study the interactions among various factors and their corresponding responses it is also used to optimize all affecting parameters collectively by statistical experimental design 24 25 generally the mixture design was used to study the relationships between the proportion of different rate of bacteria table 2 and their responses color and cod removal table 3 since scheffe devised a single lattice and single core design in 1958 the mixture design has developed a variety of methods 26 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical analyses were performed by the use of multiple regressions and anova with the softwares minitab v 14 0 and essential regression v 2 2 the significance of each variable was determined by applying student s t test 27 the p value is the probability that the magnitude of a contrast coefficient is due to random process variability a low p value indicated a real or significant effect 2 7 uv vis spectral decolorization was monitored by uv vis spectroscopic analysis the decolorization of the dye was followed by monitoring changes in its absorption spectrum 200 800 nm using a hitachi uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2401 pc shimadzu japan the obtained results were compared to those of the respective controls the produced metabolites during the omw biodegradation after decolorization of effuent were centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 30 min after complete degradation of adsorbed dye to remove any remained bacterium metabolites were extracted from supernatant by adding equal volume of ethyl acetate the samples were used for uv vis spectral analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 model establishment the response data was obtained from the experiments and is depicted in table 3 the residual errors were calculated for each model to check the conveniance of the fit standard error of regression was used as a measure of model fit in regression and variance analysis anova 27 through linear regression fitting the regression models of two responses cod and color removal were established tab s1 s8 for four

decolorization and cod removal were 92 80 mi 89 94 mii 82 13 miii and 84 78 miv and 92 35 mi 97 63 mii 33 02 miii and 80 44 miv respectively the standard error p decolorization and cod removal were 0 021 mi 0 01 mii 0 062 miii and 0 079 miv and 0 016 mi 0 001 mii 0 004 miii and 0 081 miv respectively which indicates the adequacy of the proposed model statistical analysis showed that the linear quadratic and interaction coefficients of regression model were significant p 0 05 whereas the lack of fit was non significant p 0 05 thus validating the model the residual plot was plotted from the difference between the experimental and predicted values of dependent variable 3 2 interpretation of contour and surface plots and effect of formulation on the color and cod removal of omw in the mixture design the effect of the variable changes on the responses can be observed on the ternary contour map fig s9 s11 showed the effect of the interaction of aeromonas salmonicidae penicillium sp and cryptococcus humicolus aeromonas hydrophyla candidae boidinii and bacillussp sphingomonas paucimobilis staphylococcus xylosus and lactobacillus sp on the variation of color and cod removal contour plots are useful to establish desirable response values and mixture blends a contour plot provides a two dimensional view where all points having the same response are connected to produce contour lines of constant responses in order to confirm the obtained experimental results of 90 of decolorization and 86 of cod removal a mixture surface plot fig 1 a b were plotted by minitab 14 0 software programme in the regression model there are three independent variables one variable was kept fixed at the center level mi 33 33 mii 33 33 and miii 33 33 for each plot the mixture surface plots fig 2 a b which are a three dimensional graph are represented using decolorization and cod removal based on the simultaneous variation of a salmonicidae penicillium sp and cryptococcus humicolus b a hydrophyla candidae boidinii and bacillussp and c s paucimobilis staphylococcus xylosus and lactobacillus sp in the consortium composition ranging from 0 to 100 for each strain the mixture surface plot also described individual and cumulative effect of these three variables and their subsequent effect on the color 89 58 and cod removal 84 83 the statistical signiﬁcance of the mean square variation ratio due to regression and mean square residual error were tested using analysis of variance only the obtained results for color and cod removal were presented here in for clarity of purpose according to the anova test tab s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 and s7 s8 the adjusted sums of squares adj ss were 56 08 1237 05 for mi 14 92 and 2356 65 for mii 88 14 and 1231 99 for miii and 905 14 and 487 23 for miv allowing the calculation of the fisher ratios f value for assessing the statistical signiﬁcance the model f value were 10 47 8 47 for mi 4 16 32 93 for mii 3 65 7 27 for miii and 5 88 0 22 for miv impling that most of the variation in the response can be explained by the regression equation the associated p value is used to judge whether f ratio is large enough to indicate statistical signiﬁcance a p value below than 0 1 i e α 0 05 or 95 conﬁdence indicated that the model may be considered statistically signﬁcant and the quadratic model is statistically significant for the response and therefore it can be used for further analysis 28 the p value for the regression obtained for color and cod removal for the four design expert was below 0 1 and means consequently that at least one of the terms in the regression equation has signiﬁcant correlation with the response variable the anova test also shows a term for residual error which measures the amount of variation in the response data left unexplained by the model 29 the predicted values using the above equations were compared with experimental values table 3 the summary of the anova tests analysis of variance corresponding to the quadratic eq miv are shown in table 3 the contour plots of color and cod removal showed the behavior of the system 3 3 interpretation of cox response trace plot the perturbation plot was used to study the inﬂuence of the three factors simultaneously mi mii and miii on the cod and color removal fig 3a b the perturbation plot introduced biodegradation as each variable moves from the preferred reference to all zero level constant factors hence the perturbation plots show the factorial level deviation from the adjusted reference point of all the variables 23 the vertical axis is the ﬁtted response color and cod removal and the horizontal axis is the incremental change in each component the reference mixture is shown as the point 0 000 on the horizontal axis 23 this graph is readily interpreted it clearly shows that m i m ii and m iii really exhibits a positive effect 3 4 interpretation of interaction plot miv fig 4a b showed the interaction plot where the lines are not parallel this interaction effect indicates the relationship between m i m ii and m iii on the value of decolorization and cod removal however we used m i m ii m iii associated with the highest mean decolorization and cod removal the two way anova results indicate that the interaction between m i m ii and m iii is significant in order to confirm the experimental results 90 of color removal was obtained when 86 of cod was consumed a response surface optimization curve was plotted by the minitab 14 software program minimum and maximum values of color removal and cod consumption were fixed at 85 91 and 84 86 respectively and target values were fixed at maximum color removal and minimum cod consumption the obtained results as shown in fig 1 clearly indicated that the 89 58 of color removal and the 84 83 cod consumption y value given in fig 1 were predicted if the mi is 33 33 mii is 33 33 and miii is 33 33 3 5 interpretation of residual graph the residuals from a fitted model are the differences between the responses observed at each combination of the explanatory variable values and the corresponding prediction of the response computed using the regression function these residual plots can be used to assess the quality of the regression 30 32 therefore if the residuals appear to be random it suggests that the model fits the data well a normal probability plot of the residuals can be used to check whether the variance is normally distributed if the resulting plot is approximately linear we proceed assuming that the error terms are normally distributed the histogram of the residual can be used to check whether the variance is normally distributed 33 a symmetric bell shaped histogram which is evenly distributed around zero indicates that the normality assumption is likely to be true if the histogram indicates that random error is not normally distributed it suggests that the model s under lying assumptions may have been violated the normal probability plot fig 5a b showed that the distribution of residual value which is defined as the difference between the predicted model and observed experimental forming a straight line in addition residual value are normally distributed on the both sides of the line indicating that the experimental points are reasonably aligned with the predicted value for color and cod removal all points from this residual plot lie close to the straight line confirming the conjecture that effects other than those considered in the model may be readily explained by random noise 19 20 34 the plot between individual residual values and the fitted value showed that all the residuals are scattered randomly at about the zero and one or two points are outliers the histogram of the residuals presented in fig 5 showed the distribution of the residuals for all observations the one long tail in the plot indicated skewness in the data whereas one bar is far from the others these points were outlined the plot is useful when the order of the observations may influence the results which can occur when the data is collected in a line sequence this plot can be helpful to a designed experiment in which the runs are not randomized for residual activity data the residuals appear to be randomly scattered about zero no evidence exists that the regression terms are correlated to each other 35 39 3 6 uv vis analysis fig 6 showed a typical time dependent uv vis spectrum of omw solution during the biodegradation the decrease of absorbance peaks indicated that the dye was removed the omw spectrum in visible region exhibits a main peak with a maximum absorbance at 550 nm fig 6a the decrease of absorbance of effluent fig 6b c d showed a rapid degradation of the omw according to chen et al 40 the bio decolorization of omw can be due to the adsorption to the biomass or the biodegradation if the color removal is attributed only to the biodegradation either the major visible light absorbance peak will disappear or a new peak will appear as shown in fig 6 the main absorbance peak approximately disappeared within 4 days in addition extra absorbance peaks appeared in the decolorized solution probably resulting from the absorbance of metabolites or degraded fragments of the dye molecules 40 these results indicated that the decolorization by the consortium may be largely attributed to biodegradation by optimized consortium miv 3 7 model validation it was observed from the experimental data that the maximum values for decolorization and cod removal was found to be 90 059 and 87 208 for mixture m iv in order to validate the model experiments were conducted with the optimum compositions obtained the predicted optimum results were found to be 89 82 and 86 88 of decolorization and cod removal at composition of 59 a 28 28 b and 12 62 c table 4 the results obtained from the experiment were found to be comparable with the prediction the small variation in the results can be attributed to change in the composition of bacteria used for the validation of experiments 4 conclusions in the current work a nine level nine strians ccd combined with rsm experiments was used for the optimization of the biodegradation of the olive mill wastewater the developed consortium showed a better decolorization yields as compared to pure cultures proving a complementary interaction among various isolated bacteria the consortium achieved significantly an important reduction in color 90 and cod removal 86 in 4 days the biodegradation of the olive mill wastewater was achieved by the developed consortium using 59 aeromonas salmonicidae penicillium sp and cryptococcus humicolus 28 28 aeromonas hydrophyla candidae boidinii and bacillus sp and 12 62 sphingomonas paucimobilis staphylococcus xylosus and lactobacillus sp a very high regression coefficient between the variables and the responses color and cod removal were r2 84 78 and r2 80 44 respectively indicating an excellent evaluation of experimental data by polynomial regression model additionally the method was successfully applied in the biodegradation of the omw uv vis spectroscopy analysis confirmed the biodegradability of the omw by the developed bacterial consortium the results suggest the potential of the consortium for future application towards biodegradation of omw the ability of the bacterial consortium to degrade effluent indicated its potential application for decolorizing omw further pilot scale studies are necessary with these strains for real industrial applications declaration of

14288,the present study is an attempt to address issues of challenges to availability of potable water for moving towards sustainable development the study tested efficiency of natural coagulants in removing pollutants from surface water utilization of natural coagulants come with a drawback of lower shelf life which attributed to induced dissolved organic carbon due to higher concentrations of the coagulants used hence in the present study lower concentrations of the natural coagulants were tested further the efficiency of these coagulants is compared with standard coagulant alum the efficiency of coagulants on the surface water was dominant in turbidity removal with 78 72 by alum 69 15 by sago at ph 7 with coagulant dose 0 1 g l and 0 3 g l respectively and 67 73 by chitin at ph 6 with coagulant dose 0 3 g l ftir analysis of the coagulants showed amines hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups confirming the polymer forming capability of the coagulants sem images of the coagulants before and after treatment showed vibrant proof of interactions between coagulants and suspended solids understood from the changes in the surface morphology from the results it can be concluded that the natural coagulants tested are promising solutions for challenges of water quality keywords turbidity natural coagulants coagulation adsorption sem ftir sludge hardness 1 introduction turbidity in water is caused due to the presence of minute suspended particles evitable in all natural waters owing to their omnipresence along with physical and chemical properties of particles these form vital part in global geochemical biological and geological cycles of the aquatic environment particulate matter by convention can be defined as particles that retain on 0 4 to 0 5 μm pore size filter even smaller particles are found which are considered to be dissolved without any upper limit 1 particles with size larger than 0 1 mm generally settle very rapidly and can be removed by filtration the particulate matter which requires additional treatment to be removed fall in the range of 10 nm to 0 1 mm 2 4 1 1 sources of suspended particles nearly all suspended matter is sourced from either terrestrial erosion or through organic matter production biogenic opal and biogenic carbonate the insignificant amount supplied by volcanism can be temporally and regionally an important source the average organic content of suspended matter is around 4 5 which comes from primary and secondary production of rivers and lakes soil erosion discharge of human waste industrial effluents and run off from agricultural lands 1 result of anthropogenic activities along rivers and streams of the world is one of the reasons for the alteration of ecological status of receiving water bodies 5 8 sources of suspended solids are varied in origin being dynamic with reference to their transport pathways and deliverance to surface and ground waters according to 9 suspended solids can be grouped into three broad sources based on their compositional and hydrological characteristics discharges from point sources which are usually continuous and highly concentrated in relation to receiving waters non point sources which are usually much dilute suspended solids possessing transport depending on hydrological events third group hold the properties which are intermediate that include septic system overflow farmyard seepage and road runoff this categorization presents robust temporal and spatial variability in relation to the involvement of individual group sources making the number of suspended solids delivered to freshwaters 1 2 effects due to suspended matter in water in general streams naturally carry suspended solids 10 enhanced concentration of these suspended solids in water because of anthropogenic activities can lead to variations in physical chemical and biological properties of the water effects of suspended solids on aquatic life have been studied extensively around the world over the last 50 years from the studies it is understood that suspended solids are enormously chief cause of deterioration in water quality resulting in enhanced water treatment costs aesthetic issues waning of fisheries and ecological degradation of aquatic environments 11 physical changes brought about by suspended solids comprise of reduction in light penetration changes in temperature and channel reservoir infilling with solids deposition 12 further these reduce the longevity of reservoirs and dams and reduce the navigability of channels 13 14 chemical changes induced by suspended solids include addition of contaminants like pesticides and heavy metals 15 16 nutrients like phosphorus 17 further suspended solids having high organic content which can deplete dissolved oxygen 18 1 3 need for removal of suspended matter the fact that suspended solids adsorb different types of contaminants like bacteria nutrients toxic compounds and heavy metals leading to decrease in transparency and reduced dissolved oxygen calls for the need to remove these from waters further reduction in dissolved oxygen results in anaerobic conditions in the bottom water and increase organic matter 19 20 nutrient dissolution in water leads to eutrophication which is understood as a threat to water quality 21 removing suspended solids apart from improving water quality also eliminates nutrients adsorbed on solids 22 1 4 removal of suspended solids removal of suspended solids is carried out by coagulation and flocculation process which probably is the second method after chlorination in the treatment of public water supplies chemical coagulation is bought about by coagulants like aluminium sulphate or alum ferrous ferric sulphate polyaluminium chloride etc developing countries face problems in utilizing these coagulants owing to the importing costs which are very high hence savings with regard to cost of coagulant will be largely beneficial in saving foreign exchange 23 production of huge quantities of sludge together with residual aluminum in treated water elevated public health concern 24 many studies related aluminum to the cause of alzheimer disease in order to reduce the harmful effects of alum search for alternative polymers which can be used as coagulant aids or sole as coagulants have been focused in the recent years natural coagulants have been explored and understood to be viable alternatives for conventional chemical coagulants which offer an economical and viable eco friendly substitution 1 5 removal of suspended solids by natural coagulants natural coagulants for removal of suspended solids turbidity has been studied by researchers around the world these are used in coagulation and flocculation for removal of turbidity chief mechanisms that bring about the removal are adsorption followed by charge neutralization 25 these are particularly valuable in managing difficulties associated with slow settling of flocs enhancing settleability leading to producing tough flocs 2 4 further these are also supposed to treat wider range of waters efficacy of these is competent with conventional chemical coagulants in treating low to medium 50 500ntu turbidity range application of natural coagulants for water treatment signifies vital progress towards sustainable environmental technology in the stated scenario the present study intends to test the efficiency of natural coagulants at optimized parameters for turbidity removal at two different turbidities in synthetic water followed by treating surface water 2 methodology 2 1 collection of water samples water samples were collected from a naturally formed surface water body near pothinamallayyapalem which is situated at 5 km distance from the place of experimental analysis water from the waterbody meets the needs of the local residents serving as a source of domestic water it is said that water from the reservoir was drinking water source before 2 decades when population was less fig 1 in order to collect a sample representing the real world conditions care was taken by collecting samples in plastic bottles that are sterilized samples were brought to the laboratory for analysis to be performed within 24 h the efficiency of coagulants was tested with the least possible and optimized doses of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l at 6 7 and 8 ph conditions 2 2 procurement and preparation of coagulants analytical grade alum and chitin were procured from himedia chemicals which were used as procured without any further purification sago was oven dried then grounded to powder using the domestic blender the powdered coagulants were stored in zip lock bags for further use alum chitin powdered sago 2 3 coagulation experiments the procedure of operating jar test apparatus jar test apparatus was used to carry out the coagulation experiments cintex flocculator process of the experiment includes rapid mixing at 100 rpm for a duration of 2 10 min followed by slow mixing 20 30 rpm for about 20 30 min and then allowing it to settle for 30 min which is carried out in batch process sample preparation for the experimental run one litre of sample under test was taken in a 2litre beaker to which various coagulant doses were added and kept for experimental run using jar test apparatus ph adjustments whenever compulsory were carried out using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh solutions for obtaining desired ph values within 0 1 ph units optimizing coagulant dose individual coagulant chitin sago starch alum was introduced at a time coagulant dosage optimization was carried out as follows the motive of the current study is to evaluate possible lowest dose of coagulant which is effective for treating water hence initially the dosage of coagulants alum chitin sago starch was taken as to 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 g l 2 4 coagulants and floc characterization to understand the adsorption of colloids on to the coagulants and change in morphologies on the surface of dry sludge was analyzed using scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 3400 n japan furthermore existence of functional groups in test coagulants and produced flocs were evaluated using ftir spectrophotometer nicolet is 10 thermo scientific usa 2 5 analytical procedures the physico chemical parameters pre and post coagulation of water were analyzed as per the standard methods given by apha 2015 all the analysis were performed in triplets to avoid errors 56 table 1 3 results in order to understand the dissolved organic carbon induced by natural coagulants synthetic turbid waters with 70 and 150ntu were prepared using bentonite clay further the study was progressed towards the application of coagulants under study to treat surface water table 2 represents the comparison of turbidity reduction in 70 ntu and 150 ntu at 70 ntu all doses have shown maximum reduction 95 9 at ph 7 and for 6 and 8 ph reduction was dropped down for alum while in 150

the ph ranges with the highest turbidity reduction 98 52 at all four doses at 150 ntu sago was effective and stable in all four doses at all the three ph ranges in 150 ntu when compared with 70 ntu because the reduction was dropped down 82 95 in all ph ranges fig 2 table 3 represents the comparison of settled sludge in 70 ntu and 150 ntu at 70 ntu alum has obtained the lowest amount of settled sludge at ph 8 with coagulant dose 0 4 g l and the remaining doses have shown the maximum amount of settled sludge in all three ph ranges while in 150 ntu lowest amount of settled sludge was obtained at ph 7 with coagulant dose 0 1 g l chitin achieved minimum amount of settled sludge in all the four doses at all ph ranges in both 70 ntu and 150 ntu sago has shown best performance in all three ph ranges and at all four doses with lowest amount of settled sludge 4 94 g with coagulant dose 0 1 g l and 6 51 g with coagulant dose 0 2 g l in 70 ntu and 150 ntu respectively fig 3 table 4 represents the comparison of dry sludge observed in 70 ntu and 150 ntu alum observed the lowest amount of dry sludge 1 38 g at ph 8 with coagulant dose 0 1 g l and 1 44 g at ph 8 with coagulant dose 0 1 g l in 70 ntu and 150 ntu chitin got a minimum amount of settled sludge in all the four doses at all ph ranges in both 70 ntu and 150 ntu sago has shown the best performance in all three ph ranges and at all four doses with the lowest amount of dry sludge 1 43 g with coagulant dose 0 1 g l and 1 28 g with coagulant dose 0 1 g l in 70 ntu and 150 ntu respectively fig 4 table 5 illustrates the comparison of settled sludge with that of turbidity removal obtained at 70 ntu at ph 8 showing a decrease in settled sludge with a decrease in turbidity removal as the dose increased from 0 1 g l to 0 4 g l in alum fig 5 chitin exhibited stability in all coagulant doses with constant settled sludge with an increase in turbidity removal sago is shown the best performance with a decrease of settled sludge with increase in turbidity removal in all the four doses and in all ph ranges fig 6 table 6 illustrates the comparison of settled sludge with that of turbidity removal obtained at 70 ntu ph 7 shows decrease in settled sludge with a decrease in turbidity removal as the dose increased from 0 1 g l to 0 2 g l as dose increased turbidity reduction also enhanced with alum chitin exhibited stability in all doses with constant settled sludge and positive turbidity removal sago has shown the best performance with a decrease of settled sludge while an increase in turbidity removal was observed in all the four doses and in all ph ranges fig 6 table 7 illustrates the comparison of doc in relation with turbidity removal obtained from synthetic solutions of 70 ntu and 150 ntu analysis of total organic carbon was performed taking dose and ph range at which only highest removal of turbidity was obtained hence only few samples results are presented in comparison to natural coagulants alum was good in removing dissolved organic carbon from water at ph 6 42 11 with initial turbidity of 70ntu and 77 9 with initial turbidity of 150ntu and 7 18 22 with initial turbidity of 70ntu while at ph 8 both 70 and 150ntu initial turbidity alum induced doc with 6 6307 and 4 29 sago could achieve doc reduction with initial turbidity of 150ntu only at ph 6 while other ph ranges and initial turbidity has induced doc chitin achieved doc removal only at ph 6 while other ph ranges induced doc fig 7 table 8 presents the physico chemical properties of raw surface water it is seen that turbidity total solids and dissolved solids are beyond the limits table 9 illustrates the percentage removal of parameters of surface water after coagulation turbidity of the surface water is measured twice once with the supernatant and after filtration highest turbidity reduction 76 95 was observed at ph 7 with coagulant dose 0 1 g l in alum chitin was good in a reduction in all ranges of ph and at all four doses sago is shown better performance and was stable in reducing turbidity in all ph ranges with respect to all doses highest turbidity reduction 78 72 was observed at ph 7 with coagulant dose 0 3 g l in alum chitin was shown an increase in turbidity reduction in all ranges of ph and at all four doses when compared with the supernatant solution sago is shown better efficiency in reducing turbidity in all ph ranges with respect to all doses fig 8 a hardness remained unchanged with alum at ph 7 with all concentrations while the remaining coagulants have shown an increase in the hardness alum observed efficiency in removing hardness i e calcium hardness 26 32 total hardness 17 24 and magnesium hardness 10 with the coagulant dose 0 1 g l 0 3 g l and 0 4 g l respectively similarly chitin observed some positive result in removing hardness i e calcium hardness 21 05 total hardness 17 24 respectively sago is shown better performance in removing hardness fig 8 b d electrical conductivity results have increased with alum and sago negative with reference to reduction whereas chitin was successful in reducing electrical conductivity the greatest reduction in conductivity was observed to be 35 71 by chitin with 0 2 mg l at ph 7 and least being 4 08 at ph 6 fig 8 e alkalinity was found to be reduced to 82 50 by alum at all concentrations at ph 6 and least being 57 50 by sago at ph 7 with concentration 0 2 mg l fig 8 h chloride concentrations have shown a tremendous increase by all the coagulants fig 8 i removal of dissolved organic carbon by individual coagulants in the surface water is presented in fig 9 it is seen that all coagulants tested have induced dissolved organic carbon after treatment coagulants before and after treatment were characterization for changes in their surface morphology figs 10 12 all three coagulants tested have shown a clear demarcation in surface morphologies before and after coagulation further the presence of functional groups required for polymer formation nh oh and co were seen at various wavelengths in the ftir spectra figs 13 15 4 discussion 4 1 turbidity reduction efficiency of coagulants at varied turbidity 70 ntu and 150ntu from the results it is noted that all the coagulants under test performed best at higher initial turbidity of 150ntu this is explained as the higher probability of interaction of the polymer with colloid in samples containing high amount of suspended solids similar results were reported by other workers who worked with other natural coagulants like moringa oleifera cicer arietinum 26 dolichos lablab 27 further the coagulants have shown better turbidity reductions at lower doses 0 1 0 2 g l than at higher doses 0 3 0 4 g l according to 26 higher doses of natural coagulants did not result in significant enhancement in pollutant removal among the tested coagulants chitin was observed to be stable at all ph ranges followed by sago and alum a positive correlation existed between turbidity reduction and settled sludge i e with an increase in turbidity reduction the mass of settled sludge also increased further the dewaterability of settled sludge obtained with initial turbidity of 150ntu was much better than with 70 ntu natural coagulants are a viable option in producing tough flocs through enhancing settleability 2 4 chitosan possessing coiled structure in neutral solution will have the ability of producing flocs which are denser and larger in solutions towards higher ph ranges the polymer chain gets more extended more charged producing flocs which are smaller and looser 54 floc produced by chitin was bulky and settled easily which is attributed to cationic nature and molecular weight of chitin used for charge neutralization and particle entrapment 28 in case of sago starch charge neutralization is supposed to be the mechanism for coagulation 29 i e sago starch carrying negative charge attracts positively charged particles destabilizes them leading to agglomeration this is in line with the turbidity removal in the study results from the study state that sago starch though was efficient in removing turbidity has produced a good amount of settled solids in comparison to other coagulants in the study this can be owed to stability of the colloids possessing negative charge which repels due to brownian movement 30 4 2 efficiency of coagulants for surface water treatment and in removing various physico chemical parameters alum and chitin have shown better turbidity removal at lower ph 6 and 7 which can be due to the process of charge neutralization which might not be a chief mechanism in controlling floc formation in coagulation with chitosan 54 turbidity decrease at higher concentrations can be attributed to positive charges on the surface of the particle 31 whereas sago has shown turbidity reduction at high ph 8 which can be attributed to its high molecular weight along with predominant mechanisms of adsorption and bridging similar studies were reported with tapioca starch when applied to treat semiconductor wastewaters 32 corn starch 33 polymers of natural origin possess higher turbidity removal efficiencies in comparison to metal coagulants with lower coagulant doses 34 chitin presented a moderate reduction in alkalinity at 6 and 7 ph conditions but at 8 ph alkalinity has increased due to the application of chitin this nature of chitin is due to provision of cationic charges by amine groups at elevated ph leading to colloid destabilization and consequent floc growth promotion enabling rapid settlement 35 owing to its lengthy chain polymer structure possessing positive charges chitin can efficiently coagulate negatively charged natural colloidal and particulate matters by the processes of adsorption and charge neutralization and inter particle bridging at natural water ph 36 dissimilarities in alkalinity were moderate upon treatment with starch of sago according to 34 the competence of natural coagulants in removal of physico chemical characteristics of natural water depict less difference in ph conductivity alkalinity and amount of cations and anions further being natural in origin these can produce value added products all the tested coagulants were less effective in removing physico chemical parameters like hardness chlorides and dissolved solids similar results were obtained by 37 bivalent cations like ca 2 and mg 2 might have increased the ionic strength in solution and thus might have reduced destabilization further fibers of chitin have very selective absorption for calcium ions leading to formation of a chelate involvement of amide groups and hydroxyl groups has also been reported 38 the turbidity removal efficiency of tested natural coagulants has been proved previously in studies conducted by various authors 39 parameters like total settled sludge wet dry and organic content were ignored which are one of the governing factors in disposal of sludge and for further characterization and management but their efficiency in removing natural organic carbon in terms of total organic carbon was comparatively less explored area hence in this study we have focused on these issues and the results obtained were found to be consistent and adaptable in the present study removal of solids was less with the adopted coagulant dose which did not affect the turbidity removal both in supernatant and filtrate this can be attributed to the fact that the empirical relationship between turbidity and suspended solids can be determined only during some conditions while other conditions it may not infer this is due to the properties of a particle that cause turbidity which are size shape and surface characteristics which do not correlate to concentrations of suspended solids it is stated that smaller particles tend to impact turbidity than that of larger particles 40 4 3 dissolved organic carbon due to natural coagulants application of natural coagulants for treating water induce dissolved organic carbon that increases the toc of the treated water affecting the mechanism of coagulation in present study toc removal was observed to be nearly 30 in synthetic water but an increase in toc was observed when the coagulants were used to treat surface water this can be attributed to the fact that removal of total organic carbon diverges from source to source because of dissimilar chemical characteristics of aquatic humus in different water sources similar studies were reported by 41 who reported 4 mg l of toc after coagulation with chitosan results from the study indicate that dose 0 1 g and 0 2 g l and ph 6 and 7 are the most significant parameters impelling organic removal by the natural coagulants it is reported from the study that at ph and high doses there were induced toc rather than removal hence managing optimum conditions would help in removal of organics which is explained with the fact that and increase in toc would increase negative charge requiring more coagulant dose for destabilization earlier studies reported that the least removal of toc is recorded in water obtained from a source which had greater amount of low molecular weight organic matter with very high demand for coagulant dose alum when used to treat mississippi river water resulted in only 66 of toc removal 42 for ohio river water 60 toc reduction was reported by epa 4 4 ftir spectral analysis ftir spectra of the coagulants indicate several main peaks on the spectra corresponding to functional groups of nh oh groups and och3 groups these are the groups which are actively involved in the floc formation and subsequent turbidity removal 43 45 4 5 sem analysis though the efficiency of natural coagulants in removing turbidity is well established there is the paucity of research on the properties and characteristics of the flocs produced by them chief mechanism of coagulation and flocculation is destabilizing of colloidal particles leading to their agglomeration towards floc formation the formed floc removal is removed through sedimentation and filtration evaluating floc characteristics is crucial for determining their removal performance 39 understanding floc parameters like structure strength and compactness would be strategic in authenticating apparent coagulation theory 46 in the present study both the powdered coagulants and the flocs generated were scanned using scanning electron microscopy the changes in the surface morphology before and after coagulation depicts the adsorption of the suspended solids on to the coagulants 47 sago starch particles were discernible from their particle size and granule shape 48 they also showed smooth and solid surface with no pores which are reliable with literature 49 sago starch images from the study are in agreement with the report by falconer 50 the crystallinity associated with starches might not exert direct influence on efficiency of water clarification but the properties of pasting are related to crystallinity degree may exert a positive effect on the turbidity removal 51 55 5 conclusions the efficiency of the selected coagulants was tested on synthetic turbid waters and surface water all the coagulants under test proved to be effective in turbidity removal from synthetic waters having initial turbidity of 150ntu with alum obtaining 99 reduction at ph 6 and 7 chitin showing 98 at ph 8 and 96 at ph 6 and 7 sago showing 97 at ph 7 and 92 93 at ph 6 and 8 respectively while the coagulants produced high amounts of settled sludge with initial turbidity of 150ntu the reduction in weight of the dry sludge was up to 80 stating good dewaterability of the sludge the efficiency of coagulants on the surface water was dominant in turbidity removal with 78 72 by alum 69 15 by sago at ph 7 with coagulant dose 0 1 g l and 0 3 g l respectively and 67 73 by chitin at ph 6 with coagulant dose 0 3 g l removal of other physico chemical parameters was poor by all the coagulants which are attributed to the lowest coagulant dose applied ftir analysis of the coagulants showed amines hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups confirming the polymer forming capability of the coagulants sem images of the coagulants before and after treatment showed vibrant proof of interactions between coagulants and suspended solids understood from the changes in

14288,the present study is an attempt to address issues of challenges to availability of potable water for moving towards sustainable development the study tested efficiency of natural coagulants in removing pollutants from surface water utilization of natural coagulants come with a drawback of lower shelf life which attributed to induced dissolved organic carbon due to higher concentrations of the coagulants used hence in the present study lower concentrations of the natural coagulants were tested further the efficiency of these coagulants is compared with standard coagulant alum the efficiency of coagulants on the surface water was dominant in turbidity removal with 78 72 by alum 69 15 by sago at ph 7 with coagulant dose 0 1 g l and 0 3 g l respectively and 67 73 by chitin at ph

coagulants before and after treatment showed vibrant proof of interactions between coagulants and suspended solids understood from the changes in the surface morphology from the results it can be concluded that the natural coagulants tested are promising solutions for challenges of water quality keywords turbidity natural coagulants coagulation adsorption sem ftir sludge hardness 1 introduction turbidity in water is caused due to the presence of minute suspended particles evitable in all natural waters owing to their omnipresence along with physical and chemical properties of particles these form vital part in global geochemical biological and geological cycles of the aquatic environment particulate matter by convention can be defined as particles that retain on 0 4 to 0 5 μm pore size filter even smaller particles are found which are considered to be dissolved without any upper limit 1 particles with size larger than 0 1 mm generally settle very rapidly and can be removed by filtration the particulate matter which requires additional treatment to be removed fall in the range of 10 nm to 0 1 mm 2 4 1 1 sources of suspended particles nearly all suspended matter is sourced from either terrestrial erosion or through organic matter production biogenic opal and biogenic carbonate the insignificant amount supplied by volcanism can be temporally and regionally an important source the average organic content of suspended matter is around 4 5 which comes from primary and secondary production of rivers and lakes soil erosion discharge of human waste industrial effluents and run off from agricultural lands 1 result of anthropogenic activities along rivers and streams of the world is one of the reasons for the alteration of ecological status of receiving water bodies 5 8 sources of suspended solids are varied in origin being dynamic with reference to their transport pathways and deliverance to surface and ground waters according to 9 suspended solids can be grouped into three broad sources based on their compositional and hydrological characteristics discharges from point sources which are usually continuous and highly concentrated in relation to receiving waters non point sources which are usually much dilute suspended solids possessing transport depending on hydrological events third group hold the properties which are intermediate that include septic system overflow farmyard seepage and road runoff this categorization presents robust temporal and spatial variability in relation to the involvement of individual group sources making the number of suspended solids delivered to freshwaters 1 2 effects due to suspended matter in water in general streams naturally carry suspended solids 10 enhanced concentration of these suspended solids in water because of anthropogenic activities can lead to variations in physical chemical and biological properties of the water effects of suspended solids on aquatic life have been studied extensively around the world over the last 50 years from the studies it is understood that suspended solids are enormously chief cause of deterioration in water quality resulting in enhanced water treatment costs aesthetic issues waning of fisheries and ecological degradation of aquatic environments 11 physical changes brought about by suspended solids comprise of reduction in light penetration changes in temperature and channel reservoir infilling with solids deposition 12 further these reduce the longevity of reservoirs and dams and reduce the navigability of channels 13 14 chemical changes induced by suspended solids include addition of contaminants like pesticides and heavy metals 15 16 nutrients like phosphorus 17 further suspended solids having high organic content which can deplete dissolved oxygen 18 1 3 need for removal of suspended matter the fact that suspended solids adsorb different types of contaminants like bacteria nutrients toxic compounds and heavy metals leading to decrease in transparency and reduced dissolved oxygen calls for the need to remove these from waters further reduction in dissolved oxygen results in anaerobic conditions in the bottom water and increase organic matter 19 20 nutrient dissolution in water leads to eutrophication which is understood as a threat to water quality 21 removing suspended solids apart from improving water quality also eliminates nutrients adsorbed on solids 22 1 4 removal of suspended solids removal of suspended solids is carried out by coagulation and flocculation process which probably is the second method after chlorination in the treatment of public water supplies chemical coagulation is bought about by coagulants like aluminium sulphate or alum ferrous ferric sulphate polyaluminium chloride etc developing countries face problems in utilizing these coagulants owing to the importing costs which are very high hence savings with regard to cost of coagulant will be largely beneficial in saving foreign exchange 23 production of huge quantities of sludge together with residual aluminum in treated water elevated public health concern 24 many studies related aluminum to the cause of alzheimer disease in order to reduce the harmful effects of alum search for alternative polymers which can be used as coagulant aids or sole as coagulants have been focused in the recent years natural coagulants have been explored and understood to be viable alternatives for conventional chemical coagulants which offer an economical and viable eco friendly substitution 1 5 removal of suspended solids by natural coagulants natural coagulants for removal of suspended solids turbidity has been studied by researchers around the world these are used in coagulation and flocculation for removal of turbidity chief mechanisms that bring about the removal are adsorption followed by charge neutralization 25 these are particularly valuable in managing difficulties associated with slow settling of flocs enhancing settleability leading to producing tough flocs 2 4 further these are also supposed to treat wider range of waters efficacy of these is competent with conventional chemical coagulants in treating low to medium 50 500ntu turbidity range application of natural coagulants for water treatment signifies vital progress towards sustainable environmental technology in the stated scenario the present study intends to test the efficiency of natural coagulants at optimized parameters for turbidity removal at two different turbidities in synthetic water followed by treating surface water 2 methodology 2 1 collection of water samples water samples were collected from a naturally formed surface water body near pothinamallayyapalem which is situated at 5 km distance from the place of experimental analysis water from the waterbody meets the needs of the local residents serving as a source of domestic water it is said that water from the reservoir was drinking water source before 2 decades when population was less fig 1 in order to collect a sample representing the real world conditions care was taken by collecting samples in plastic bottles that are sterilized samples were brought to the laboratory for analysis to be performed within 24 h the efficiency of coagulants was tested with the least possible and optimized doses of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l at 6 7 and 8 ph

oven dried then grounded to powder using the domestic blender the powdered coagulants were stored in zip lock bags for further use alum chitin powdered sago 2 3 coagulation experiments the procedure of operating jar test apparatus jar test apparatus was used to carry out the coagulation experiments cintex flocculator process of the experiment includes rapid mixing at 100 rpm for a duration of 2 10 min followed by slow mixing 20 30 rpm for about 20 30 min and then allowing it to settle for 30 min which is carried out in batch process sample preparation for the experimental run one litre of sample under test was taken in a 2litre beaker to which various coagulant doses were added and kept for experimental run using jar test apparatus ph adjustments whenever compulsory were carried out using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh solutions for obtaining desired ph values within 0 1 ph units optimizing coagulant dose individual coagulant chitin sago starch alum was introduced at a time coagulant dosage optimization was carried out as follows the motive of the current study is to evaluate possible lowest dose of coagulant which is effective for treating water hence initially the dosage of coagulants alum chitin sago starch was taken as to 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 g l 2 4 coagulants and floc characterization to understand the adsorption of colloids on to the coagulants and change in morphologies on the surface of dry sludge was analyzed using scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 3400 n japan furthermore existence of functional groups in test coagulants and produced flocs were evaluated using ftir spectrophotometer nicolet is 10 thermo scientific usa 2 5 analytical procedures the physico chemical parameters pre and post coagulation of water were analyzed as per the standard methods given by apha 2015 all the analysis were performed in triplets to avoid errors 56 table 1 3 results in order to understand the dissolved organic carbon induced by natural coagulants synthetic turbid waters with 70 and 150ntu were prepared using bentonite clay further the study was progressed towards the application of coagulants under study to treat surface water table 2

organic carbon was performed taking dose and ph range at which only highest removal of turbidity was obtained hence only few samples results are presented in comparison to natural coagulants alum was good in removing dissolved organic carbon from water at ph 6 42 11 with initial turbidity of 70ntu and 77 9 with initial turbidity of 150ntu and 7 18 22 with initial turbidity of 70ntu while at ph 8 both 70 and 150ntu initial turbidity alum induced doc with 6 6307 and 4 29 sago could achieve doc reduction with initial turbidity of 150ntu only at ph 6 while other ph ranges and initial turbidity

14289,desalination using dense membranes where water transport is driven by soil water potential offers an important tool for water managers in agricultural systems however progress in this area has been limited by a lack of understanding between membrane characteristics and performance in these systems this investigation evaluated the performance of different commercially available membranes

savings through efficiency improvements in irrigation systems and for broadening its water portfolio through innovations in water treatment membrane processes are promising candidates for integration into agricultural water delivery systems 6 8 historically they have been unattractive options due to concerns associated with specific energy consumption however usage of non pressure driven desalination systems like forward osmosis fo 9 11 and pervaporation pv 12 to produce water suitable for irrigation applications are showing promise 7 8 13 previous works have demonstrated that soil water potential in can serve as an energy gradient to drive water transport across salt rejecting membranes 7 13 19 this process takes advantage of the lower energy state of water in unsaturated soils relative to that in bulk water serving as a feed solution the membrane serves as the subsurface irrigation tube where purified water is distributed into the surrounding soil within the root zone s of surrounding vegetation because the membrane rejects salts and other dissolved substances non freshwater sources may be used that would otherwise be unsuitable for irrigation therefore this process has the opportunity to expand water sources reduce water stress and provide drought tolerant watering methods previous works in this area has shown promise in delivering quantities of water needed to at minimum assist with water demands of commercially grown crops the average potential evapotranspiration rate eto in temperate semiarid regions like wyoming is upwards of 0 7 cm day or 0 3 liters water per m2 land area per hr lmh 20 for soil membrane systems to be a viable irrigation option the water demand of evapotranspiration must be met by the water flux provided by the membrane l water delivered per m2 membrane per hr lmh water flux into different soils have been reported to range from 0 1 lmh 13 14 17 18 to 3 0 lmh 7 where flux was a function of the membrane and soil characteristics sun et al found that water consumption by tomato plants was actually reduced measured as various water use efficiencies when using a continuous irrigation process based on a semi permeable membrane relative to that consumed when using a conventional intermittent irrigation process 21 these findings suggest that water requirements may be lower for the membrane based process resulting in reduced water consumption and lower demand values than those previously noted in soil water transport is driven from one location to another by gravitational matric and osmotic potentials and vapor pressure gradients 22 these potentials are functions of the soil water content as soil water content decreases the potential energy increases previous works have shown that water flux is inversely proportional to soil water content 13 14 16 peak water flux occurs when the wetted membrane is first contacted with the soil which has a high soil water potential and declines until an equilibrium condition is achieved equilibrium occurs when the soil water potential reaches a steady state value as determined by the rates of water entering and exiting the relevant soil volume water flux has also been shown to be a function of the feed solution ionic strength 13 15 because the process relies on the magnitude of the energy gradient across the membrane soil hydraulic properties that have the ability to maintain vapor pressure gradients across the membrane e g soil water retention and vapor adsorption capacity also influenced water flux 13 17 because of these findings water flux had been primarily been attributed to vapor pressure gradients 13 15 19 however our recent study using natural and modified soils determined that matric and osmotic potential were largely responsible for water transport across the membrane and vapor pressure played a less substantial role 7 as part of this earlier effort membrane orientation relative to the soil active layer facing feed solution or soil was also shown to influence water flux before this only the thickness of the salt separating or active layer had been considered for its role in determining the magnitude of the measured water flux 13 consequently our understanding of the role s played by membrane properties in determining their performance in soil membrane water systems is incomplete matric and osmotic potentials are generated from differences in water energy state e g water with higher salt concentrations and water in close proximity to soil particles have lower energy states 22 similar to fo the driving force i e chemical gradient for mass transport works on the draw side of the membrane pulling water across the membrane into the soil and therefore it is hypothesized that membrane properties important to fo are similarly important for soil membrane water systems one important fo consideration is concentration polarization decays osmotic potential gradient over time concentration polarization manifests as external concentration polarization ecp dilution on the draw side concentration of salts on the feed side and internal concentration polarization icp which is the accumulation of salts within the microporous membrane support mccutcheon et al quantified and developed a predictive model for water flux decline due to ecp and icp for asymmetric membranes 23 this model was subsequently expanded to account for physical transport phenomena like reverse salt flux and was shown to be highly dependent on the membrane structural parameter 9 23 27 the structural parameter is a function of the microporous membrane support properties like porosity tortuosity and thickness the ideal membrane for fo would have a low structural parameter that mitigates icp high porosity low thickness low tortuously and an active layer characterized by high water but low salt permeability for soil water potential driven processes instead of a reduction in driving force caused by icp due to salt transport it is hypothesized that a similar driving force reduction is present but is the result of polarization due to water energy state gradients primarily imparted by the soil this study focused on elucidating the role s played by the physical and surface chemical characteristics of salt rejecting membranes in determining water flux in soil membrane water systems membrane performance was described using modified performance expressions for membrane processes where mass transport occurs as a result of hydraulic pressure and chemical potential gradients across the membrane the new knowledge generated from this work serves as the basis for designing membranes uniquely tailored for subsurface desalination irrigation systems 2 theoretical water flux was theoretically assessed using models previously developed for fo in the absence of concentration polarization water flux j was estimated using eq 1 23 eq 1 was modified by replacing the draw solution osmotic pressure with a soil water potential term that includes cumulative effects of water potential within the soil matric and osmotic 1 j a ψ soil π f b δp where ψ s o i l is the soil water potential measured in units of pressure conventionally soil water potential is below atmospheric pressure in unsaturated soil and is assigned a negative value for the purposes of this study the term is referred to as soil water suction with a positive sign convention π f b is the feed osmotic pressure δ p is the applied hydraulic pressure gradient and a is the water permeance coefficient of the active layer detailed in si 28 icp effects on water flux were evaluated using eq 3 which assumes no reverse salt flux 23 this assumption was justified for the soil membrane water system because the salt content in the kaolin clay was 0 15 w w eq 3 was modified from previously developed expressions for describing water flux in fo applications to include soil water potential in place of the osmotic pressure of the draw solution 3 j sdi fo a ψ soil exp j s d i f o k d π f b exp j s d i f o 1 k f s d f δ p where j s d i f o is the water flux k d is a coefficient that describes the change in soil water suction from the bulk soil to the membrane surface k f is the mass transfer coefficient between the feed solution and the membrane surface s is the structural parameter of the membrane and d f is the diffusion coefficient of the salt in the feed solution in eq 3 the feed side parameters πf b kf df were calculated based on flow conditions and feed water chemistry composition the membrane structural parameter s was determined experimentally using water flux data collected by operating the membrane in an fo configuration of note in fo kd describes the decay in osmotic pressure from the bulk draw solution to the membrane surface which is a function of draw solution flowrate velocity and osmotic agent diffusion coefficient in a soil membrane water system there is no cross flow next to the membrane surface as a result the parameter must be determined experimentally furthermore since flux jsdi fo is on both sides of eq 3 the solution must be calculated through an iterative process to converge on a stable predictive flux value eq 4 was derived from eq 1 to account for the decay in the driving force for mass transport from the bulk feed solution to the bulk soil the reduction term ksdi was included to encompass any reductions in driving force energy due to icp ecp and other soil related effects 4 j s d i a ψ s o i l π f b k s d i δ p where j s d i is water flux in the soil membrane water system ksdi was solved for by rearranging eq 4 to form eq 5 5 k s d i j s d i a δ p ψ s o i l π f b 3 experimental 3 1 chemicals and reagents all solutions were made using ultrapure water milli q direct millipore sigma having a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm and an un buffered ph of 6 8 0 2 sodium chloride purity 99 9 fisher scientific pittsburgh pa and magnesium sulfate purity 99 acros organics morris plains nj were used as osmotic draw agents and to measure salt rejection for the different membranes all soil experiments were done using 99 kaolin clay powder sigma aldrich st louis mo according to the manufacturer the kaolin clay mixture contained trace amounts of chloride 250 mg kg sulfate 1000 mg kg and calcium 250 mg kg kaolin clay was selected for the soil tests because of low water swelling expansion factor and water retention properties i e high suction over a range of water contents 22 3 2 membranes five different membranes were evaluated in this study table 1 membranes were selected to represent a range of properties like physio chemical characteristics to elucidate their role s in determining water flux in soil membrane water systems except for the pee membrane all membrane samples were acquired from sterlitech corporation kent wa as dry flat sheet samples 3 3 characterization of membrane surface chemistry the hydrophilicity of the membrane active and backing layers were characterized by measuring the contact angle with water all contact angle measurements were done using a krüss easy drop goniometer krüss scientific hamburg germany at least three coupons from each membrane were sampled the membranes were soaked and stored in ultrapure water for at least 24 h prior to contact angle measurements the captive bubble method was used for measuring contact angle at least five different air bubbles were measured for each coupon to calculate averages and confidence intervals the time interval between bubble placement on the membrane surface and measurement of the contact angle was 10 s all measurements were done using ultrapure water at room temperature 22 c as the probe liquid and an air bubble volume of 5 μl 3 4 membrane structure and morphology membrane thickness total and active layer thickness was measured from cross sectional images acquired from a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem fei quanta feg 450 since membranes were stored in ultrapure water at 4 c a membrane coupon was cut from each wetted membrane and dried in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h the dried coupons were carbon coated using a vacuum evaporator ladd research industries williston vt fesem images were collected using a beam voltage of 5 20 kv images were acquired using a secondary electron detector images were analyzed using imagej image processing and analysis software average thickness values were calculated from a minimum of five different images and 10 measurements per image representative cross sectional images are given in figure s1 for each of the tested membranes 3 5 assessments of membrane performance the water permeance coefficient or specific water flux a of each membrane was determined using a dead end filtration system figure s2 membrane samples were soaked in ultrapure water for 24 h prior to each test samples were compacted prior to each flux measurement at a net feed pressure of 500 kpa sample compaction was done until constant flux rate was observed after compaction pressure was adjusted back to the start and computer logging software started water flux was measured over an applied pressure range of 0 to 2 mpa 0 to 20 bar at pressure steps of 0 2 mpa once a feed pressure of 2 0 mpa was reached the flux was measured at decreasing pressure steps to a net feed pressure of 0 mpa specific water flux was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of the water flux as a function of applied pressure at least three coupons from each membrane were tested and regression analysis performed to compute an average and confidence interval membrane selectivity or salt rejection was characterized using solutions of sodium chloride or magnesium sulfate magnesium sulfate was used to contrast valence hydrated radius and diffusion coefficient from sodium chloride salt rejection tests were performed using a cf042 cross flow cell from sterlitech corporation kent wa with active membrane area of 42 cm2 figure s3 a sample of both permeate and feed solutions were collected every 15 min and the conductivity of each was measured each test ran for a minimum of 3 h to collect 12 data points for rejection rejection was calculated with eq 6 by measuring both the feed and permeate solution conductivity 6 r 100 c f c p c f where r is the solute rejection efficiency c is the electrical conductivity of a given solution and the subscripts f and p designate the feed and permeate solutions respectively the structural parameter of the tested membranes was determined by measuring water flux in a fo configuration the test unit used for these measurements is illustrated in figure s4 two different draw solutions were used a 6 3 g l sodium chloride solution and a 25 g l magnesium sulfate solution each solution having an osmotic pressure of 0 5 mpa this osmotic pressure was selected because it had a comparable bulk driving force as the soil membrane tests the osmotic pressures were calculated using oli electrolyte modelling software oli systems inc cedar knolls nj water flux was quantified by measuring the mass in both the feed and draw solution reservoirs via computer interfaced mass balances according to fo theory salt transport within the support of the membrane plays a critical role to water flux decline because of net driving force loss salt transport within the membrane structure is negatively affected by the thickness and tortuosity and positively by the porosity collectively these properties combined are referred to as the membrane structural parameter s s was calculated for each membrane with the exception of the pee membrane according to eq 7 26 s was not calculated for the pee membrane as it was a symmetric membrane and did not have a support structure 7 s d d 1 k d 1 j w l n j w a b a π f b e x p j w k f b a π d b where dd is the bulk solution diffusion coefficient of dissolved ions on the draw side jw is the measured water flux in the fo configuration b and a are the solute and water permeance coefficients respectively and πf b and πd b are the bulk osmotic pressure values of the feed and the draw solutions respectively values for dd were taken from literature as a function of concentration for each salt 30 the intrinsic membrane property a is the specific flux calculated from stirred cell experiments and b is calculated based on the cross flow rejection experiments 9 24 26 27 the mass transfer coefficients kf and kd which determine the ecp are calculated using boundary layer film theory outlined in other studies 23 3 6 assessment of membrane performance in soil membrane water systems membrane performance in the soil membrane water system was evaluated using a custom built apparatus figure s5 the jacketed feed tank reactor was temperature controlled using an external heat exchanger water was pumped using a variable speed peristaltic pump masterflex l s cole parmer vernon hills il hydraulic pulsing was controlled using a pulsation dampener located on the effluent line from the pump feed pressure was controlled by backpressure needle valve located on the outlet line of the cell the membrane cell cf042 sterlitech corporation kent wa was modified to increase the channel depth depth 1 3 cm length 8 6 cm width 3 9 cm to accommodate the soil the soil was compacted in the channel so that it would not shift during tests by compressing the soil by hand while wearing nitrile gloves as to not contaminate the soil the compacted soil in the channel was then leveled with a flat edge to ensure that the soil surface was plumb with the face of the cell a fully hydrated membrane which was soaked in water for at least 24 h prior was placed on top of the soil with the active layer facing the soil a medium foulant mesh spacer 47 mil was placed in the top unmodified feed side channel top cell was mated together with the soil containing bottom with the membrane sandwiched between the two acrylic cells ultrapure water was circulated from a jacketed reactor through the membrane test cell at a flowrate of 760 ml min v 0 14 m s at 22 c room temperature water flux into the soil was measured by removing the test cell from the system and separately weighing it three different feed solutions were used in these tests ultrapure water a 2500 mg l sodium chloride solution ph 6 8 0 2 0 20 mpa and a 10 000 mg l magnesium sulfate solution ph 6 7 0 4 0 21 mpa these salt solutions were selected because the corresponding osmotic pressures were of the same magnitude as the measured post test soil water suction values in order for a positive net driving force to be provided across the membrane the soil water suction should be higher than the osmotic pressure on the feed side of the membrane post test soil water potentials were determined using a dewpoint potentiometer wp4c decagon devices pullman wa on soil samples collected from the membrane test cell the results of the dewpoint potentiometer are negative below atmospheric pressure measured soil water potentials were assigned a positive number and referred to as soil water suction in this study isolating the water flux due to soil water suction from that due to the applied hydraulic pressure in the soil membrane water systems was done using eq 8 8 j n o r m j s d i a δ p where jnorm is the normalized water flux application of eq 8 accounted for the water flux due to the hydraulic pressure gradient δp and differences in membrane specific water flux a when comparing water flux values normalizing the flux to the hydraulic pressure and a allowed for more reasonable comparisons between membranes which had highly variable orders of magnitude a values for tests with salt solution feeds osmotic pressure differences were not captured in the normalized flux calculation using eq 8 instead energy gradient contributions due to osmotic pressure in the feed was determined theoretically using eqs 3 and 4 3 7 statistical analysis procedures membrane samples were reused across multiple tests samples were no longer used when they had become fouled as indicated by a loss in pure water permeability or if they had suffered from a loss of integrity as indicated by an increase in permeability or decrease in salt rejection between uses all membrane samples were vigorously cleaned using ultrapure water inspected for obvious defects and then stored in ultrapure water at 4 c for at least 24 h before a subsequent test this method led to potentially non independent data from the subsequent tests therefore the associated results were tested for serial dependence by comparing the linear regression slopes of the water delivered over time with the replicate as a factor to determine if replication was significant α 0 05 if no significant differences existed then the data were assumed to be independent replicates that were found to be serially dependent were removed from associated data set and the analysis was performed on the remaining data all tests were done at a minimum in triplicate to compute average results for each data set 95 confidence intervals were calculated and placed as error bars or as plus minus values for comparisons made between tests with time dependence multiple data points over time data for the tests of interest were grouped together and linear regression performed on the accumulated data with the individual tests considered as statistical factors each factor was tested for significant influence on the accumulated data if the individual factor or test significantly influenced the accumulated data then it was considered statistically significant or different the factor was then tested for significance α 0 05 to determine correlation relationships between measured property results and experimentally obtained water fluxes linear regression was performed on the membrane property versus the water flux from the results of the regression pearson correlation coefficients r were calculated using originpro 2019 software originlab northampton ma the values of r range between 0 and 1 with 1 being a perfect linear relationship reported r values were interpreted to describe the strength of correlation using the guide developed by evans 31 4 results and discussion 4 1 water flux in soil membrane water systems and membrane structural parameter the cumulative amount of water delivered into the surrounding soil varied for each of the membranes in the soil membrane water system fig 1 cumulative water delivered and figure s6 water flux each membrane was characterized by a flux that decreased over time before reaching a quasi steady state value as indicated by the reduced slope of the cumulative water delivered as a function of time highlighted in fig 1a and 1b while the magnitude of the change in water flux varied between the membranes it occurred for all of them previously it has been reported that this change in water flux was due to a change or decline in the driving force for mass transfer which in this case was the water potential gradient across the membrane 7 as the soil was wetted the soil water suction decreased thereby reducing the energy gradient for water transport however if this were the sole reason for the decline in flux then is should follow a rather consistent decay pattern from fig 1a and b clear inflection points in the plots are seen for each of the membranes this suggests that something in addition to a decline in the soil water suction was influencing the water flux each of the inflections in the plots occurred at approximately 0 5 h of exposure to the soil the location of the inflection point was independent of the volume of water fluxed across the membrane and into the soil this indicates that outside of the change in soil water suction the mechanism affecting the change in flux is a function of exposure time to the soil as water was being transported from the membrane active layer into the soil the water concentration within the membrane decreased as the water concentration decreased the water energy state subsequently increased this change in energy state within the membrane is supported by flory huggins theory which states a polymer water sorption increases as water activity increases 29 32 34 this newly created water energy gradient was balanced by water being replenished in the active layer from the support structure this water was supplied from the water within the pores of the support structure replenishment of this pore water may be expected to be restricted due to the hydraulic pressure used in these tests 10 3 kpa this process may have resulted in dewetting of the local support material and ultimately portions of the active layer 35 this phenomenon as it relates to the membrane would be a function of the polymer hydrophilicity pore structure of the support and pressure applied as the dewetting process continues the flow pathways become more tortuous and the actual active membrane area in which fluxing occurs is reduced leading to a reduction in observed flux in general the pure water flux correlated with the specific flux measured for each membrane table 2 where higher fluxes were measured for those membranes having higher specific flux values exceptions to this observation were the pee and sb50 membranes both membranes were characterized by similar flux values for all feed water conditions despite the pee membrane having a specific flux that was two orders of magnitude smaller table 2 the specific water flux a is a function of the diffusive water permeability molar volume of water within the polymer and membrane thickness 28 active layer thickness is known to be a principle factor in determining water flux for salt rejecting membranes 36 the pee membrane which had an active layer thickness of 20 μm was characterized by the lowest pure water flux 0 125 lmh there was no statistical difference overlap in 95 ci interval in the pure water flux values for the xn45 and the acm5 membranes 2 13 vs 2 2 lmh despite the former being characterized as a looser membrane based on its specific flux and sodium chloride rejection table 2 therefore the physical structure outside of the free volume space of the active layer of the membranes played a role in determining water flux when ultrapure water was the feed solution compared to the ultrapure water results water flux when t 0 5 h decreased as salts were added to the feed solutions table 2 this decrease was significant no overlap in 95 ci for both the aquaporin and xn45 membranes when the feed was dosed with magnesium sulfate the acm5 membrane had lower though not significantly different average flux values for saline feed solutions compared to those when using ultrapure water reductions in flux between feed solution conditions were attributed to the increased osmotic pressure 0 2 mpa of both the saline feed solutions this chemical potential resulted in a reduction of the overall driving force for mass transport for example the post test soil water suction for the acm5 membrane and ultrapure water sodium chloride and magnesium chloride were 0 35 0 43 and 0 38 mpa respectively table 2 and the resulting overall net driving force feed osmotic pressure subtracted from post test soil water suction were 0 35 0 23 and 0 18 mpa respectively when the observed pure water flux results were normalized with eq 8 differences in water flux became more distinct and observable fig 2 gray bars for example the pee membrane had a normalized flux of over 100 compared with approximately 1 for sb50 this was attributed to the relatively low a value of the pee membrane relative to other membranes table 2 in other words measured water flux for the pee membrane greatly exceeded what was expected based on the hydraulic pressure gradient that was used in these tests however this normalized flux calculation did not consider any osmotic or matric effects from the feed or soil respectively therefore differences between the observed and expected hydraulic water fluxes was attributed to these factors conversely the sb50 membrane was characterized by the lowest normalized flux values of the tested membranes fig 2 at one or slightly above one for all feed conditions this indicates that the membrane performed accordingly with the hydraulic pressure and was not influenced by the soil water suction present the aquaporin and acm5 membranes had normalized flux values 2 for all the cases to upwards of 5 for aquaporin and ultrapure water feed these results provided evidence that the clay soil was positively influencing the water flux including when using a saline feed solution the primary physical difference between these membranes was the structure of the support structural parameter and the hydrophilicity of the membrane active polymer if the water activity within the membrane was changing due to water leaving the membrane and going into the soil it stands to reason that more hydrophobic membranes with higher structural parameters would perform worse than their counterparts membranes with high structural parameters are characterized by low porosity thick supports and or tortuous pore networks resulting in long flow paths low flux values as a result those membranes characterized by larger structural parameters may be more susceptible to dewetting and greater flux decline over time furthermore hydrophilicity of the active layer would also influence the water concentration within the polymer due to affinity for water the relationship between these membrane properties and pure water flux was supported through regression analysis figure s7 since the scale of normalized flux values in fig 2 were exponential the natural log of each normalized flux value was computed and placed as the x axis variable for the regression analysis the structural parameter and active layer contact angle versus natural log normalized ultrapure water flux had negative slopes and pearson correlation coefficients r of 0 77 and 0 98 respectively the absolute value of r for structural parameter was strongly correlated 0 66 r 0 79 and contact angle was very strongly 0 8 r 1 0 correlated to the natural log of the normalized flux the negative slope sign for both structural parameter and contact angle showed that the relationship was inversely correlated i e as both decrease water flux increases support structure dewetting coupled with the active layer s affinity for water may explain the performance differences observed between the membranes for ultrapure water feed solutions the membrane structural parameter eq 7 has been shown to influence water flux in fo operation by effecting the diffusion of salts into and out of the support structure of the membrane 9 11 23 25 it is a function of the support s thickness porosity and tortuosity with smaller structural parameters characterized as having thinner less tortuous and more porous supports leading to enhanced salt diffusion and improved fo performance additionally hydrophilicity and wetting ability of the support has also been shown to influence fo water flux 35 therefore the importance of these parameters will likely crossover to soil membrane systems since the water activity and concentration within the support of the membrane may have influenced water flux the primary difference between fo and soil membrane water systems was the driving force in fo a chemical potential gradient or osmotic pressure gradient drives mass transport across a semi permeable membrane and in the system studied here the gradient was primarily created by the matric potential of the surrounding soil with the goal of wholly describing the system with all of the driving forces accounted for and with membrane properties included e g hydrophilicity and structural parameter the water flux results for both the salt feeds bars were compared with the water flux calculated with eq 3 markers and are shown in fig 3 the calculated water flux values were less than the measured values below with no overlap of the 95 ci error bars for both feed conditions solutes for sb50 and acm5 membranes the opposite was true for the pee membrane with both feed solutes and aquaporin with the magnesium sulfate feed which each had a predicted fluxes within the 95 ci bars of the observed water fluxes the close measured and predicted flux values for the pee membrane was attributed to non supported structure and an s 0 therefore the icp contributing factor of eq 3 also equaled zero resulting in a simplified equation which included only ecp factors kf and kd the soil side factor kd was estimated using experimental results from the ultrapure water tests and the feed side kf is a function of known flow parameters therefore a prediction close to actual water flux made sense regardless this showed that a symmetric non supported membrane had a water flux that was predicted a simplified eq 3 under these operating conditions conversely with the other cases specifically with the sb50 and acm5 membranes the eq 3 predicted water fluxes were lower than actual observed fluxes these membranes had larger relative structural parameters calculated from fo tests meaning that the icp component in eq 3 was included and possibly influential there were several possible explanations why the theoretical water flux for the sb50 and acm5 membrane was lower than observed first the reduction of soil water suction by jsdi fo kd was overestimated either because the loss of driving force was not a function of the water flux into the soil jsdi fo or it was not appropriate to calculate kd independently from the pure water results secondly the terms for concentration polarization both ecp and icp j 1 kf s df were overestimated in other words the icp was not as severe as indicated with eq 3 estimating s based on independent fo tests where the draw was a salt solution and applying the same s in the soil membrane operation may not have be suitable since there were low salt concentrations in the clay this could have led to an overestimation of s and therefore icp the implications point towards water activity within the membrane which in this case was not influence by salt or accurately captured with eq 3 proving to be an important factor on influencing water flux in soil membrane systems the validity of eq 3 was further tested by calculating a theoretical s through back calculation using the observed water flux for jsdi fo in all cases except for the aquaporin membrane with magnesium sulfate feed back calculated s 733 μm the s result was either negative meaning there was no reduction due to icp or as in the case of pee membrane an undefined result e g ln x where x 0 indicating water flux should not have occurred the undefined and illogical back calculated s values indicated that using eq 3 was not suitable to describe water flux in these systems regardless evidence provided here showed that soil membrane water flux was different yet similar to fo water flux because of the reduction between the bulk driving forces and the importance of the membrane structure 4 2 model development and net driving force reduction according to eq 1 the predicted water flux values for the soil membrane water system were orders of magnitude larger than what was observed e g jpotential for sb50 60 lmh vs jobs 0 3 lmh figure s8 therefore eq 1 does not fully describe the relevant system as a result eq 4 was developed which utilized a general reduction term ksdi to account for possible phenomena that were occurring within the system including but not limited to 1 soil membrane contact inefficiencies 2 polarization of the water activity through the membrane i e dewetting 3 concentration polarization when salts are added ksdi 1 0 meant that there was no reduction in driving force from the bulk soil water suction to the bulk feed potential which was primarily influenced by osmotic pressure the calculated ksdi values for the various tests with the membranes x axis tested including the different feed solutions bars are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the pee membrane had ksdi 1 for the ultrapure water feed which was at least one order of magnitude larger when compared to the other membranes this difference with the ultrapure water between membranes was an indication that the reduction in driving force was not solely related to salt induced icp since there were no salts present during these feed conditions secondly an exponential difference between membranes showed that ksdi was also not completely due to soil membrane contact inefficiencies because the values would have been similar if that was the case therefore the calculated reduction in driving force must be related to membrane structure and the water energy potential within the pee membrane while having one of the lowest flux values performed well compared to its a value with ksdi equal to approximately 1 0 for each of the conditions meaning that there was little to no reduction in driving force between the bulk feed solution and bulk soil water suction the sb50 membrane on the other hand had a low reduction coefficient 0 001 and 1e 5 for mgso4 fig 4 meaning the reduction in driving force was large the principle physical difference between the two membranes were no support with the pee versus a very dense support high fo structural parameter for sb50 this reduction was hypothesized to be due to the water transport limitations through the support typically solution diffusion water flux models include several transport steps that must occur active layer facing the feed 1 water adsorption to the feed side of the membrane 2 diffusion through the polymeric active layer 3 de absorption from the active layer and 4 pore flow through the support for this system where the active layer faces soil the steps are reversed the feed water must flow through the support structure contact the active layer diffuse through and then de adsorb from the membrane surface and into the soil for the pee membrane the transport process was simplified and step 4 would not physically occur because there was no support structure therefore since the pee membrane had a ksdi 1 no reduction in driving force the inference would be that step 4 flow through the support is critical to those membranes with supports further evidence for the importance of water transport through the membrane support was provided by the results for the sb50 membrane with its dense asymmetric structure fig 5 when a microporous support is exposed to a saline water the salt concentration within the support is determined by advection and diffusion for a membrane like the sb50 membrane diffusion back to the bulk solution is limited because of the dense support structure resulting in an increase in salt concentration and loss of driving force this is primarily because the accumulation of salt within the membrane negatively effects the water energy state it was assumed that a similar mechanism occurred in the soil membrane tests but since there were low salt concentrations as was the case with ultrapure water feed the energy state within the membrane was primarily influenced by water concentration dewetting and polymer hydrophilicity lower concentrations of water within the membrane support specifically for the denser sb50 membrane led to negatively affected water energy states within the membrane and a subsequent decreased in water transport from the support to the separating layer of the membrane any interference to water transport within the membrane would result in a decrease driving force and water flux the water transport interference through the support may also apply to the aquaporin and acm5 membranes which had both ksdi values and structural parameters between the two extremes of the sb50 and pee membranes at approximately 0 1 fig 4 5 conclusions steady state water flux varied from 0 12 to 2 13 lmh for the studied salt rejecting membranes when treating pure water and saline feed solutions water flux was a function of membrane structure and the active layer hydrophilicity which also influenced the observed decline in water flux over time these membrane properties affected water energy state within the membrane structure affecting the magnitude of the reduction in net driving force from the bulk potentials of the feed and soil dewetting of the membrane structure resulting in flux decline and a direct function of membrane structural parameter was not captured by existing performance models instead a total driving force reduction term ksdi was required to capture membrane performance in the soil water membrane systems after accounting for water permeance differences the sb50 membrane s 20 000 μm suffered from the most severe reduction in driving force over time ksdi 0 001 while the symmetrical pee membrane no support structure experienced the least reduction ksdi 1 therefore the presence and characteristics of the active layer support are important in determining

14289,desalination using dense membranes where water transport is driven by soil water potential offers an important tool for water managers in agricultural systems however progress in this area has been limited by a lack of understanding between membrane characteristics and performance in these systems this investigation evaluated the performance of different commercially available membranes representing a range of physical and surface chemical characteristics and correlated these with performance using kaolin clay as a model soil membranes were tested in cross flow systems containing a soil membrane water system representative of a subsurface irrigation process steady state water flux varied from 0 12 to 2 20 lmh as a function of feed water composition ionic strength and membrane properties namely membrane structural parameter and active layer hydrophilicity as structural parameter increased so too did the reduction of net driving force and the corresponding flux decline over time flux decline after initial wetting of the soil was attributed to dewetting of the microporous membrane support resulting in more tortuous flow paths from the membrane and into the soil keywords soil water potential membrane properties food water energy nexus subsurface desalination irrigation water reuse 1 introduction new water sources are needed to address the burgeoning global water crisis 1 4 the agricultural industry accounts for roughly 70 of all freshwater withdraws excluding thermoelectric power uses 5 as such there exists important opportunities for realizing freshwater savings through efficiency improvements in irrigation systems and for broadening its water portfolio through innovations in water treatment membrane processes are promising candidates for integration into agricultural water delivery systems 6 8 historically they have been unattractive options due to concerns associated with specific energy consumption however usage of non pressure driven desalination systems like forward osmosis fo 9 11 and pervaporation pv 12 to produce water suitable for irrigation applications are showing promise 7 8 13 previous works have demonstrated that soil water potential in can serve as an energy gradient to drive water transport across salt rejecting membranes 7 13 19 this process takes advantage of the lower energy state of water in unsaturated soils relative to that in bulk water serving as a feed solution the membrane serves as the subsurface irrigation tube where purified water is distributed into the surrounding soil within the root zone s of surrounding vegetation because the membrane rejects salts and other dissolved substances non freshwater sources may be used that would otherwise be unsuitable for irrigation therefore this process has the opportunity to expand water sources reduce water stress and provide drought tolerant watering methods previous works in this area has shown promise in delivering quantities of water needed to at minimum assist with water demands of commercially grown crops the average potential evapotranspiration rate eto in temperate semiarid regions like wyoming is upwards of 0 7 cm day or 0 3 liters water per m2 land area per hr lmh 20 for soil membrane systems to be a viable irrigation option the water demand of evapotranspiration must be met by the water flux provided by the membrane l water delivered per m2 membrane per hr lmh water flux into different soils have been reported to range from 0 1 lmh 13 14 17 18 to 3 0 lmh 7 where flux was a function of the membrane and soil characteristics sun et al found that water consumption by tomato plants was actually reduced measured as various water use efficiencies when using a continuous irrigation process based on a semi permeable membrane relative to that consumed when using a conventional intermittent irrigation process 21 these findings suggest that water requirements may be lower for the membrane based process resulting in reduced water consumption and lower demand values than those previously noted in soil water transport is driven from one location to another by gravitational matric and osmotic potentials and vapor pressure gradients 22 these potentials are functions of the soil water content as soil water content decreases the potential energy increases previous works have shown that water flux is inversely proportional to soil water content 13 14 16 peak water flux occurs when the wetted membrane is first contacted with the soil which has a high soil water potential and declines until an equilibrium condition is achieved equilibrium occurs when the soil water potential reaches a steady state value as determined by the rates of water entering and exiting the relevant soil volume water flux has also been shown to be a function of the feed solution ionic strength 13 15 because the process relies on the magnitude of the energy gradient across the membrane soil hydraulic properties that have the ability to maintain vapor pressure gradients across the membrane e g soil water retention and vapor adsorption capacity also influenced water flux 13 17 because of these findings water flux had been primarily been attributed to vapor pressure gradients 13 15 19 however our recent study using natural and modified soils determined that matric and osmotic potential were largely responsible for water transport across the membrane and vapor pressure played a less substantial role 7 as part of this earlier effort membrane orientation relative to the soil active layer facing feed solution or soil was also shown to influence water flux before this only the thickness of the salt separating or active layer had been considered for its role in determining the magnitude of the measured water flux 13 consequently our understanding of the role s played by membrane properties in determining their performance in soil membrane water systems is incomplete matric and osmotic potentials are generated from differences in water energy state e g water with higher salt concentrations and water in close proximity to soil particles have lower energy states 22 similar to fo the driving force i e chemical gradient for mass transport works on the draw side of the membrane pulling water across the membrane into the soil and therefore it is hypothesized that membrane properties important to fo are similarly important for soil membrane water systems one important fo consideration is concentration polarization decays osmotic potential gradient over time concentration polarization manifests as external concentration polarization ecp dilution on the draw side concentration of salts on the feed side and internal concentration polarization icp which is the accumulation of salts within the microporous membrane support mccutcheon et al quantified and developed a predictive model for water flux decline due to ecp and icp for asymmetric membranes 23 this model was subsequently expanded to account for physical transport phenomena like reverse salt flux and was shown to be highly dependent on the membrane structural parameter 9 23 27 the structural parameter is a function of the microporous membrane support properties like porosity tortuosity and thickness the ideal membrane for fo would have a low structural parameter that mitigates icp high porosity low thickness low tortuously and an active layer characterized by high water but low salt permeability for soil water potential driven processes instead of a reduction in driving force caused by icp due to salt transport it is hypothesized that a similar driving force reduction is present but is the result of polarization due to water energy state gradients primarily imparted by the soil this study focused on elucidating the role s played by the physical and surface chemical characteristics of salt rejecting membranes in determining water flux in soil membrane water systems membrane performance was described using modified performance expressions for membrane processes where mass transport occurs as a result of hydraulic pressure and chemical potential gradients across the membrane the new knowledge generated from this work serves as the basis for designing membranes uniquely tailored for subsurface desalination irrigation systems 2 theoretical water flux was theoretically assessed using models previously developed for fo in the absence of concentration polarization water flux j was estimated using eq 1 23 eq 1 was modified by replacing the draw solution osmotic pressure with a soil water potential term that includes cumulative effects of water potential within the soil matric and osmotic 1 j a ψ soil π f b δp where ψ s o i l is the soil water potential measured in units of pressure conventionally soil water potential is below atmospheric pressure in unsaturated soil and is assigned a negative value for the purposes of this study the term is referred to as soil water suction with a positive sign convention π f b is the feed osmotic pressure δ p is the applied hydraulic pressure gradient and a is the water permeance coefficient of the active layer detailed in si 28 icp effects on water flux were evaluated using eq 3 which assumes no reverse salt flux 23 this assumption was justified for the soil membrane water system because the salt content in the kaolin clay was 0 15 w w eq 3 was modified from previously developed expressions for describing water flux in fo applications to include soil water potential in place of the osmotic pressure of the draw solution 3 j sdi fo a ψ soil exp j s d i f o k d π f b exp j s d i f o 1 k f s d f δ p where j s d i f o is the water flux k d is a coefficient that describes the change in soil water suction from the bulk soil to the membrane surface k f is the mass transfer coefficient between the feed solution and the membrane surface s is the structural parameter of the membrane and d f is the diffusion coefficient of the salt in the feed solution in eq 3 the feed side parameters πf b kf df were calculated based on flow conditions and feed water chemistry composition the membrane structural parameter s was determined experimentally using water flux data collected by operating the membrane in an fo configuration of note in fo kd describes the decay in osmotic pressure from the bulk draw solution to the membrane surface which is a function of draw solution flowrate velocity and osmotic agent diffusion coefficient in a soil membrane water system there is no cross flow next to the membrane surface as a result the parameter must be determined experimentally furthermore since flux jsdi fo is on both sides of eq 3 the solution must be calculated through an iterative process to converge on a stable predictive flux value eq 4 was derived from eq 1 to account for the decay in the driving force for mass transport from the bulk feed solution to the bulk soil the reduction term ksdi was included to encompass any reductions in driving force energy due to icp ecp and other soil related effects 4 j s d i a ψ s o i l π f b k s d i δ p where j s d i is water

sulfate purity 99 acros organics morris plains nj were used as osmotic draw agents and to measure salt rejection for the different membranes all soil experiments were done using 99 kaolin clay powder sigma aldrich st louis mo according to the manufacturer the kaolin clay mixture contained trace amounts of chloride 250 mg kg sulfate 1000 mg kg and calcium 250 mg kg kaolin clay was selected for the soil tests because of low water swelling expansion factor and water retention properties i e high suction over a range of water contents 22 3 2 membranes five different membranes were evaluated in this study table 1 membranes were selected to represent a range of properties like physio chemical characteristics to elucidate their role s in determining water flux in soil membrane water systems except for the pee membrane all membrane samples were acquired from sterlitech corporation kent wa as dry flat sheet samples 3 3 characterization of membrane surface chemistry the hydrophilicity of the membrane active and backing layers were characterized by measuring the contact angle with water all contact angle measurements were done using a krüss easy drop goniometer krüss scientific hamburg germany at least three coupons from each membrane were sampled the membranes were soaked and stored in ultrapure water for at least 24 h prior to contact angle measurements the captive bubble method was used for measuring contact angle at least five different air bubbles were measured for each coupon to calculate averages and confidence intervals the time interval between bubble placement on the membrane surface and measurement of the contact angle was 10 s all measurements were done using ultrapure water at room temperature 22 c as the probe liquid and an air bubble volume of 5 μl 3 4 membrane structure and morphology membrane thickness total and active layer thickness was measured from cross sectional images acquired from a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem fei quanta feg 450 since membranes were stored in ultrapure water at 4 c a membrane coupon was cut from each wetted membrane and dried in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h the dried coupons were carbon coated using a vacuum evaporator ladd research industries williston vt fesem images were collected using a beam voltage of 5 20 kv images were acquired using a secondary electron detector images were analyzed using imagej image processing and analysis software average thickness values were calculated from a minimum of five different images and 10 measurements per image representative cross sectional images are given in figure s1 for each of the tested membranes 3 5 assessments of membrane performance the water permeance coefficient or specific water flux a of each membrane was determined using a dead end filtration system figure s2 membrane samples were soaked in ultrapure water for 24 h prior to each test samples were compacted prior to each flux measurement at a net feed pressure of 500 kpa sample compaction was done until constant flux rate was observed after compaction pressure was adjusted back to the start and computer logging software started water flux was measured over an applied pressure range of 0 to 2 mpa 0 to 20 bar at pressure steps of 0 2 mpa once a feed pressure of 2 0 mpa was reached the flux was measured at decreasing pressure steps to a net feed pressure of 0 mpa specific water flux was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of the water flux as a function of applied pressure at least three coupons from each membrane were tested and regression analysis performed to compute an average and confidence interval membrane selectivity or salt rejection was characterized using solutions of sodium chloride or magnesium sulfate magnesium sulfate was used to contrast valence hydrated radius and diffusion coefficient from sodium chloride salt rejection tests were performed using a cf042 cross flow cell from sterlitech corporation kent wa with active membrane area of 42 cm2 figure s3 a sample of both permeate and feed solutions were collected every 15 min and the conductivity of each was measured each test ran for a minimum of 3 h to collect 12 data points for rejection rejection was calculated with eq 6 by measuring both the feed and permeate solution conductivity 6 r 100 c f c p c f where r is the solute rejection efficiency c is the electrical conductivity of a given solution and the subscripts f and p designate the feed and permeate solutions respectively the structural parameter of the tested membranes was determined by measuring water flux in a fo configuration the test unit used for these measurements is illustrated in figure s4 two different draw solutions were used a 6 3 g l sodium chloride solution and a 25 g l magnesium sulfate solution each solution having an osmotic pressure of 0 5 mpa this osmotic pressure was selected because it had a comparable bulk driving force as the soil membrane tests the osmotic pressures were calculated using oli electrolyte modelling software oli systems inc cedar knolls nj water flux was quantified by measuring the mass in both the feed and draw solution reservoirs via computer interfaced mass balances according to fo theory salt transport within the support of the membrane plays a critical role to water flux decline because of net driving force loss salt transport within the membrane structure is negatively affected by the thickness and tortuosity and positively by the porosity collectively these properties combined are referred to as the membrane structural parameter s s was calculated for each membrane with the exception of the pee membrane according to eq 7 26 s was not calculated for the pee membrane as it was a symmetric membrane and did not have a support structure 7 s d d 1 k d 1 j w l n j w a b a π f b e x p j w k f b a π d b where dd is the bulk solution diffusion coefficient of dissolved ions on the draw side jw is the measured water flux in the fo configuration b and a are the solute and water permeance coefficients respectively and πf b and πd b are the bulk osmotic pressure values of the feed and the draw solutions respectively values for dd were taken from literature as a function of concentration for each salt 30 the intrinsic membrane property a is the specific flux calculated from stirred cell experiments and b is calculated based on the cross flow rejection experiments 9 24 26 27 the mass transfer coefficients kf and kd which determine the ecp are calculated using boundary layer film theory outlined in other studies 23 3 6 assessment of membrane performance in soil membrane water systems membrane performance in the soil membrane water system was evaluated using a custom built apparatus figure s5 the jacketed feed tank reactor was temperature controlled using an external heat exchanger water was pumped using a variable speed peristaltic pump masterflex l s cole parmer vernon hills il hydraulic pulsing was controlled using a pulsation dampener located on the effluent line from the pump feed pressure was controlled by backpressure needle valve located on the outlet line of the cell the membrane cell cf042 sterlitech corporation kent wa was modified to increase the channel depth depth 1 3 cm length 8 6 cm width 3 9 cm to accommodate the soil the soil was compacted in the channel so that it would not shift during tests by compressing the soil by hand while wearing nitrile gloves as to not contaminate the soil the compacted soil in the channel was then leveled with a flat edge to ensure that the soil surface was plumb with the face of the cell a fully hydrated membrane which was soaked in water for at least 24 h prior was placed on top of the soil with the active layer facing the soil a medium foulant mesh spacer 47 mil was placed in the top unmodified feed side channel top cell was mated together with the soil containing bottom with the membrane sandwiched between the two acrylic cells ultrapure water was circulated from a jacketed reactor through the membrane test cell at a flowrate of 760 ml min v 0 14 m s at 22 c room temperature water flux into the soil was measured by removing the test cell from the system and separately weighing it three different feed solutions were used in these tests ultrapure water a 2500 mg l sodium chloride solution ph 6 8 0 2 0 20 mpa and a 10 000 mg l magnesium sulfate solution ph 6 7 0 4 0 21 mpa these salt solutions were selected because the corresponding osmotic pressures were of the same magnitude as the measured post test soil water suction values in order for a positive net driving force to be provided across the membrane the soil water suction should be higher than the osmotic pressure on the feed side of the membrane post test soil water potentials were determined using a dewpoint potentiometer wp4c decagon devices pullman wa on soil samples collected from the membrane test cell the results of the dewpoint potentiometer are negative below atmospheric pressure measured soil water potentials were assigned a positive number and referred to as soil water suction in this study isolating the water flux due to soil water suction from that due to the applied hydraulic pressure in the soil membrane water systems was done using eq 8 8 j n o r m j s d i a δ p where jnorm is the normalized water flux application of eq 8 accounted for the water flux due to the hydraulic pressure gradient δp and differences in membrane specific water flux a when comparing water flux values normalizing the flux to the hydraulic pressure and a allowed for more reasonable comparisons between membranes which had highly variable orders of magnitude a values for tests with salt solution feeds osmotic pressure differences were not captured in the normalized flux calculation using eq 8 instead energy gradient contributions due to osmotic pressure in the feed was determined theoretically using eqs 3 and 4 3 7 statistical analysis procedures membrane samples were reused across multiple tests samples were no longer used when they had become fouled as indicated by a loss in pure water permeability or if they had suffered from a loss of integrity as indicated by an increase in permeability or decrease in salt rejection between uses all membrane samples were vigorously cleaned using ultrapure water inspected for obvious defects and then stored in ultrapure water at 4 c for at least 24 h before a subsequent test this method led to potentially non independent data from the subsequent tests therefore the associated results were tested for serial dependence by comparing the linear regression slopes of the water delivered over time with the replicate as a factor to determine if replication was significant α 0 05 if no significant differences existed then the data were assumed to be independent replicates that were found to be serially dependent were removed from associated data set and the analysis was performed on the remaining data all tests were done at a minimum in triplicate to compute average results for each data set 95 confidence intervals were calculated and placed as error bars or as plus minus values for comparisons made between tests with time dependence multiple data points over time data for the tests of interest were grouped together and linear regression performed on the accumulated data with the individual tests considered as statistical factors each factor was tested for significant influence on the accumulated data if the individual factor or test significantly influenced the accumulated data then it was considered statistically significant or different the factor was then tested for significance α 0 05 to determine correlation relationships between measured property results and experimentally obtained water fluxes linear regression was performed on the membrane property versus the water flux from the results of the regression pearson correlation coefficients r were calculated using originpro 2019 software originlab northampton ma the values of r range between 0 and 1 with 1 being a perfect linear relationship reported r values were interpreted to describe the strength of correlation using the guide developed by evans 31 4 results and discussion 4 1 water flux in soil membrane water systems and membrane structural parameter the cumulative amount of water delivered into the surrounding soil varied for each of the membranes in the soil membrane water system fig 1 cumulative water delivered and figure s6 water flux each membrane was characterized by a flux that decreased over time before reaching a quasi steady state value as indicated by the reduced slope of the cumulative water delivered as a function of time highlighted in fig 1a and 1b while the magnitude of the change in water flux varied between the membranes it occurred for all of them previously it has been reported that this change in water flux was due to a change or decline in the driving force for mass transfer which in this case was the water potential gradient across the membrane 7 as the soil was wetted the soil water suction decreased thereby reducing the energy gradient for water transport however if this were the sole reason for the decline in flux then is should follow a rather consistent decay pattern from fig 1a and b clear inflection points in the plots are seen for each of the membranes this suggests that something in addition to a decline in the soil water suction was influencing the water flux each of the inflections in the plots occurred at approximately 0 5 h of exposure to the soil the location of the inflection point was independent of the volume of water fluxed across the membrane and into the soil this indicates that outside of the change in soil water suction the mechanism affecting the change in flux is a function of exposure time to the soil as water was being transported from the membrane active layer into the soil the water concentration within the membrane decreased as the water concentration decreased the water energy state subsequently increased this change in energy state within the membrane is supported by flory huggins theory which states a polymer water sorption increases as water activity increases 29 32 34 this newly created water energy gradient was balanced by water being replenished in the active layer from the support structure this water was supplied from the water within the pores of the support structure replenishment of this pore water may be expected to be restricted due to the hydraulic pressure used in these tests 10 3 kpa this process may have resulted in dewetting of the local support material and ultimately portions of the active layer 35 this phenomenon as it relates to the membrane would be a function of the polymer hydrophilicity pore structure of the support and pressure applied as the dewetting process continues the flow pathways become more tortuous and the actual active membrane area in which fluxing occurs is reduced leading to a reduction in observed flux in general the pure water flux correlated with the specific flux measured for each membrane table 2 where higher fluxes were measured for those membranes having higher specific flux values exceptions to this observation were the pee and sb50 membranes both membranes were characterized by similar flux values for all feed water conditions despite the pee membrane having a specific flux that was two orders of magnitude smaller table 2 the specific water flux a is a function of the diffusive water permeability molar volume of water within the polymer and membrane thickness 28 active layer thickness is known to be a principle factor in determining water flux for salt rejecting membranes 36 the pee membrane which had an active layer thickness of 20 μm was characterized by the lowest pure water flux 0 125 lmh there was no statistical difference overlap in 95 ci interval in the pure water flux values for the xn45 and the acm5 membranes 2 13 vs 2 2 lmh despite the former being characterized as a looser membrane based on its specific flux and sodium chloride rejection table 2 therefore the physical structure outside of the free volume space of the active layer of the membranes played a role in determining water flux when ultrapure water was the feed solution compared to the ultrapure water results water flux when t 0 5 h decreased as salts were added to the feed solutions table 2 this decrease was significant no overlap in 95 ci for both the aquaporin and xn45 membranes when the feed was dosed with magnesium sulfate the acm5 membrane had lower though not significantly different average flux values for saline feed solutions compared to those when using ultrapure water reductions in flux between feed solution conditions were attributed to the increased osmotic pressure 0 2 mpa of both the saline feed solutions this chemical potential resulted in a reduction of the overall driving force for mass transport for example the post test soil water suction for the acm5 membrane and ultrapure water sodium chloride and magnesium chloride were 0 35 0 43 and 0 38 mpa respectively table 2 and the resulting overall net driving force feed osmotic pressure subtracted from post test soil water suction were 0 35 0 23 and 0 18 mpa respectively when the observed pure water flux results were normalized with eq 8 differences in water flux became more distinct and observable fig 2 gray bars for example the pee membrane had a normalized flux of over 100 compared with approximately 1 for sb50 this was attributed to the relatively low a value of the pee membrane relative to other membranes table 2 in other words measured water flux for the pee membrane greatly exceeded what was expected based on the hydraulic pressure gradient that was used in these tests however this normalized flux calculation did not consider any osmotic or matric effects from the feed or soil respectively therefore differences between the observed and expected hydraulic water fluxes was attributed to these factors conversely the sb50 membrane was characterized by the lowest normalized flux values of the tested membranes fig 2 at one or slightly above one for all feed conditions this indicates that the membrane performed accordingly with the hydraulic pressure and was not influenced by the soil water suction present the aquaporin and acm5 membranes had normalized flux values 2 for all the cases to upwards of 5 for aquaporin and ultrapure water feed these results provided evidence that the clay soil was positively influencing the water flux including when using a saline feed solution the primary physical difference between these membranes was the structure of the support structural parameter and the hydrophilicity of the membrane active polymer if the water activity within the membrane was changing due to water leaving the membrane and going into the soil it stands to reason that more hydrophobic membranes with higher structural parameters would perform worse than their counterparts membranes with high structural parameters are characterized by low porosity thick supports and or tortuous pore networks resulting in long flow paths low flux values as a result those membranes characterized by larger structural parameters may be more susceptible to dewetting and greater flux decline over time furthermore hydrophilicity of the active layer would also influence the water concentration within the polymer due to affinity for water the relationship between these membrane properties and pure water flux was supported through regression analysis figure s7 since the scale of normalized flux values in fig 2 were exponential the natural log of each normalized flux value was computed and placed as the x axis variable for the regression analysis the structural parameter and active layer contact angle versus natural log normalized ultrapure water flux had negative slopes and pearson correlation coefficients r of 0 77 and 0 98 respectively the absolute value of r for structural parameter was strongly correlated 0 66 r 0 79 and contact angle was very strongly 0 8 r 1 0 correlated to the natural log of the normalized flux the negative slope sign for both structural parameter and contact angle showed that the relationship was inversely correlated i e as both decrease water flux increases support structure dewetting coupled with the active layer s affinity for water may explain the performance differences observed between the membranes for ultrapure water feed solutions the membrane structural parameter eq 7 has been shown to influence water flux in fo operation by effecting the diffusion of salts into and out of the support structure of the membrane 9 11 23 25 it is a function of the support s thickness porosity and tortuosity with smaller structural parameters characterized as having thinner less tortuous and more porous supports leading to enhanced salt diffusion and improved fo performance additionally hydrophilicity and wetting ability of the support has also been shown to influence fo water flux 35 therefore the importance of these parameters will likely crossover to soil membrane systems since the water activity and concentration within the support of the membrane may have influenced water flux the primary difference between fo and soil membrane water systems was the driving force in fo a chemical potential gradient or osmotic pressure gradient drives mass transport across a semi permeable membrane and in the system studied here the gradient was primarily created by the matric potential of the surrounding soil with the goal of wholly describing the system with all of the driving forces accounted for and with membrane properties included e g hydrophilicity and structural parameter the water flux results for both the salt feeds bars were compared with the water flux calculated with eq 3 markers and are shown in fig 3 the calculated water flux values were less than the measured values below with no overlap of the 95 ci error bars for both feed conditions solutes for sb50 and acm5 membranes the opposite was true for the pee membrane with both feed solutes and aquaporin with the magnesium sulfate feed which each had a predicted fluxes within the 95 ci bars of the observed water fluxes the close measured and predicted flux values for the pee membrane was attributed to non supported structure and an s 0 therefore the icp contributing factor of eq 3 also equaled zero resulting in a simplified equation which included only ecp factors kf and kd the soil side factor kd was estimated using experimental results from the ultrapure water tests and the feed side kf is a function of known flow parameters therefore a prediction close to actual water flux made sense regardless this showed that a symmetric non supported membrane had a water flux that was predicted a simplified eq 3 under these operating conditions conversely with the other cases specifically with the sb50 and acm5 membranes the eq 3 predicted water fluxes were lower than actual observed fluxes these membranes had larger relative structural parameters calculated from fo tests meaning that the icp component in eq 3 was included and possibly influential there were several possible explanations why the theoretical water flux for the sb50 and acm5 membrane was lower than observed first the reduction of soil water suction by jsdi fo kd was overestimated either because the loss of driving force was not a function of the water flux into the soil jsdi fo or it was not appropriate to calculate kd independently from the pure water results secondly the terms for concentration polarization both ecp and icp j 1 kf s df were overestimated in other words the icp was not as severe as indicated with eq 3 estimating s based on independent fo tests where the draw was a salt solution and applying the same s in the soil membrane operation may not have be suitable since there were low salt concentrations in the clay this could have led to an overestimation of s and therefore icp the implications point towards water activity within the membrane which in this case was not influence by salt or accurately captured with eq 3 proving to be an important factor on influencing water flux in soil membrane systems the validity of eq 3 was further tested by calculating a theoretical s through back calculation using the observed water flux for jsdi fo in all cases except for the aquaporin membrane with magnesium sulfate feed back calculated s 733 μm the s result was either negative meaning there was no reduction due to icp or as in the case of pee membrane an undefined result e g ln x where x 0 indicating water flux should not have occurred the undefined and illogical back calculated s values indicated that using eq 3 was not suitable to describe water flux in these systems regardless evidence provided here showed that soil membrane water flux was different yet similar to fo water flux because of the reduction between the bulk driving forces and the importance of the membrane structure 4 2 model development and net driving force reduction according to eq 1 the predicted water flux values for the soil membrane water system were orders of magnitude larger than what was observed e g jpotential for sb50 60 lmh vs jobs 0 3 lmh figure s8 therefore eq 1 does not fully describe the relevant system as a result eq 4 was developed which utilized a general reduction term ksdi to account for possible phenomena that were occurring within the system including but not limited to 1 soil membrane contact inefficiencies 2 polarization of the water activity through the membrane i e dewetting 3 concentration polarization when salts are added ksdi 1 0 meant that there was no reduction in driving force from the bulk soil water suction to the bulk feed potential which was primarily influenced by osmotic pressure the calculated ksdi values for the various tests with the membranes x axis tested including the different feed solutions bars are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the pee membrane had ksdi 1 for the ultrapure water feed which was at least one order of magnitude larger when compared to the other membranes this difference with the ultrapure water between membranes was an indication that the reduction in driving force was not solely related to salt induced icp since there were no salts present during these feed conditions secondly an exponential difference between membranes showed that ksdi was also not completely due to soil membrane contact inefficiencies because the values would have been similar if that was the case therefore the calculated reduction in driving force must be related to membrane structure and the water energy potential within the pee membrane while having one of the lowest flux values performed well compared to its a value with ksdi equal to approximately 1 0 for each of the conditions meaning that there was little to no reduction in driving force between the bulk feed solution and bulk soil water suction the sb50 membrane on the other hand had a low reduction coefficient 0 001 and 1e 5 for mgso4 fig 4 meaning the reduction in driving force was large the principle physical difference between the two membranes were no support with the pee versus a very dense support high fo structural parameter for sb50 this reduction was hypothesized to be due to the water transport limitations through the support typically solution diffusion water flux models include several transport steps that must occur active layer facing the feed 1 water adsorption to the feed side of the membrane 2 diffusion through the polymeric active layer 3 de absorption from the active layer and 4 pore flow through the support for this system where the active layer faces soil the steps are reversed the feed water must flow through the support structure contact the active layer diffuse through and then de adsorb from the membrane surface and into the soil for the pee membrane the transport process was simplified and step 4 would not physically occur because there was no support structure therefore since the pee membrane had a ksdi 1 no reduction in driving force the inference would be that step 4 flow through the support is critical to those membranes with supports further evidence for the importance of water transport through the membrane support was provided by the results for the sb50 membrane with its dense asymmetric structure fig 5 when a microporous support is exposed to a saline water the salt concentration within the support is determined by advection and diffusion for a membrane like the sb50 membrane diffusion back to the bulk solution is limited because of the dense support structure resulting in an increase in salt concentration and loss of driving force this is primarily because the accumulation of salt within the membrane negatively effects the water energy state it was assumed that a similar mechanism occurred in the soil membrane tests but since there were low salt concentrations as was the case with ultrapure water feed the energy state within the membrane was primarily influenced by water concentration dewetting and polymer hydrophilicity lower concentrations of water within the membrane support specifically for the denser sb50 membrane led to negatively affected water energy states within the membrane and a subsequent decreased in water transport from the support to the separating layer of the membrane any interference to water transport within the membrane would result in a decrease driving force and water flux the water transport interference through the support may also apply to the aquaporin and acm5 membranes which had both ksdi values and structural parameters between the two extremes of the sb50 and pee membranes at approximately 0 1 fig 4 5 conclusions steady state water flux varied from 0 12 to 2 13 lmh for the studied salt rejecting membranes when treating pure water and saline feed solutions water flux was a function of membrane structure and the active layer hydrophilicity which also influenced the observed decline in water flux over time these membrane properties affected water energy state within the membrane structure affecting the magnitude of the reduction in net driving force from the bulk potentials of the feed and soil dewetting of the membrane structure resulting in flux decline and a direct function of membrane structural parameter was not captured by existing performance models instead a total driving force reduction term ksdi was required to capture membrane performance in the soil water membrane systems after accounting for water permeance differences the sb50 membrane s 20 000 μm suffered from the most severe reduction in driving force over time ksdi 0 001 while the symmetrical pee membrane no support structure experienced the least reduction ksdi 1 therefore the presence and characteristics of the active layer support are important in determining the steady state water flux which is established under constant energy gradient conditions across the membrane in the soil membrane water system declaration of competing interest the authors attest
