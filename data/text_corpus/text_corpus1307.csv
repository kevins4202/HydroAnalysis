6535,as a typical wet island in arid central asia the ili valley located in northwestern china provides water resources for the oasis in the lower reaches however it is not clear whether its unique climatic characteristics will lead to different isotopes of precipitation and what is the major factor controlling the variation of precipitation isotopes in this region based on three sites spread over the ili valley 297 precipitation samples were collected from may 2015 to april 2016 the δ18o and δd values range from 37 8 to 3 2 and 261 5 to 34 5 with a weighted mean 9 4 and 65 2 respectively a clear correlation exists between mean monthly δ18o values and mean monthly temperature with r2 0 68 for the mean monthly values increase of 0 91 per degree celsius a positive gradient of 0 32 100 m was obtained from the ili valley when an annual weighted average of δ18o values was used considering the temporal and spatial variation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and d excess value of precipitation combined with the results from the hysplit4 0 air mass trajectory model we found that moisture source in the study area is considered mainly replenished by the westerlies and the moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water around yining cannot be ignored although the data covers a year it can still provide a good database for studying hydrological cycle in

conditions klein et al 2016 lavergne et al 2016 xu et al 2017 to investigate the basic spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation isotopes an in situ and continuous observation is valuable and significant in the past decades the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo http isohis iaea org have conducted global scale observations of and research on δ18o and δd due to their significance in precipitation since 1961 iaea wmo 2018 at present there are more than 1100 stations set up across the globe to measure the values of these isotopes as part of the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip dansgaard 1964 jouzel et al 1997 the isotopic data in the gnip database especially in the stations operated for several years serve as an indispensable resource in many scientific disciplines on global and regional scale kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016a 2017a b information on variations in δd and δ18o content in present day precipitation events is crucial for the study of hydrologic cycles especially in relation to groundwater recharge sources han et al 2014 wang et al 2016a 2015 in addition knowing the levels of δd and δ18o in precipitation can also help to describe the circulation of air masses in the atmosphere and the recycling of continental moisture this is particularly important for studying the hydrological cycle especially in arid areas where water resources are scarce located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and far away from the ocean with the mountains all around xinjiang is featured by a temperate continental climate with low precipitation it has a semi arid and arid climate and the long term average annual precipitation ranges from 17 3 mm to 505 9 mm generally precipitation is higher in mountains and lower in desert so the distribution of precipitation in xinjiang is extremely heterogeneous previous studies indicated that significant differences in topography and landforms will cause a distinct difference in the isotopes of precipitation wang et al 2016a 2017a b zhao et al 2011 the ili valley is located in the middle tianshan mountains also known as tien shan and western of xinjiang and called wet island in central asia because of the large precipitation 350 mm year as an important natural water resource in an arid and semiarid climate precipitation and vapor sources around the tianshan mountains have attracted great attention in hydrological and climate studies wang et al 2016b 2017c during the past decades monthly daily or event based sampling for precipitation isotopes was discontinuously undertaken at the urumqi and hotan by gnip zhang and wang 2016 based on these isotopic data individual local meteoric water lines of the two cities have been established and moisture source is considered mainly replenished by the westerlies rather than the indian or eastern asian monsoons chen et al 2008 liu et al 2015 the precipitation of the urumqi and hotan are 300 9 mm and 44 5 mm in 2013 respectively meanwhile urumqi is located in the north of tianshan mountains and hotan is located in the north of kunlun mountains and their altitude is 918 and 1375 m respectively in view of the above geographical characteristics they can not represent the isotopic characteristics of precipitation in the middle tianshan mountain area wang et al 2016a b which receives more abundant rainfall especially in western ili valley 350 mm year most current studies based on results from gnip are concentrated around urumqi and these have conducted preliminarily analyses of the water vapor sources and atmospheric circulation patterns in the region feng et al 2013b kong et al 2013 liu et al 2015 however there have been no comprehensive studies of the spatial and temporal variations in the isotopes from precipitation in the ili valley and it may contain more information about water vapor cycle and moisture source it is clear that the previous precipitation isotopes sampling sites were located in lower precipitation area and therefore cannot well describe the varying characteristics of the ili valley more importantly due to the absence of an intensive observation network detailed isotopic information about moisture transport has not been available in the ili valley where rainfall is abundant therefore the key purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics of precipitation isotopes in wet island located in arid central asia on the other hand the objectives of this study is to a establish a dataset of the composition of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in the ili valley based on 296 rainfall samples collected from may 2015 to april 2016 at sites throughout the region and b to investigate the meteorological and geographical controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in the ili valley region and c to analyze and compare characteristics of water vapor sources in different parts of tianshan mountains the results of this comprehensive investigation will provide a good dataset to study the hydrological processes in tianshan mountains which is also helpful for other areas with an arid and semiarid climate 2 material and methods 2 1 overview of the study region the ili valley is located in the western tianshan mountains fig 1 and is thus effectively part of central asia it lies between 80 85 e and 42 45 n and covers an area of approximately 65 000 km2 in the northwestern xinjiang uygur autonomous region the largest and most northwestern province in china the valley is 350 km long from east to west and is high in the former and low in the latter with altitudes ranging from 2500 to 500 m above sea level given its location in the chinese hinterland about 3600 km from the ocean fig 1 the valley is characterized by a temperate semi arid continental climate with temperature and precipitation levels that vary greatly although westerly winds dominate throughout the year the winter climate is controlled mainly by the intensity and position of the siberian high pressure cell and is also influenced by the northern branch of the westerlies the summer climate is affected in part by the indian low pressure cell when the southern branch of the westerlies shifts northwards zhang et al 2012 the ili valley is one of the wettest regions in xinjiang because it is open on the west to humid airflow the mean annual temperature varies from 2 6 c to 9 2 c depending on the terrain the mean annual precipitation ranges between 200 mm and 500 mm on the plains but can reach 800 mm in the mountains dong et al 2016 since the valley is surrounded by high mountain ranges summer ice melt and in some cases groundwater flow can be expected to control the hydrology of water courses and lakes on the valley floor 2 2 collection of precipitation samples samples of precipitation were collected at yining zhaosu and xinyuan in the ili valley fig 1c from may 2015 april 2016 the altitude rainfall levels and annual air temperature are not consistent at the three sites and more information is listed in table 1 water samples were collected in plastic funnel bottle sets immediately after rainfall events to minimize the effects of evaporation funnels mounted near the ground conveyed water into the bottles through plastic tubing that was looped to form a water trap and prevent evaporation winter precipitation usually fell as snow and these samples were collected into pre cleaned plastic bags and taken indoors to melt after melting completely at room temperature 25 c the samples were transferred into the sampling bottles one 50 ml bottle was used to collect the sample from which the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were measured to avoid evaporation and other influences of direct sunlight all sample bottles were sealed with a layer of paraffin and transferred to the laboratory in a dark and cold container no chemicals were added to the water the quantity temperature and humidity of the precipitation samples were recorded as they were collected 2 3 laboratory analysis the ratios of the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes measured in water are usually expressed in delta values defined as the per mil deviation from the standard vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as follows δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the sample and the standard respectively hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were analyzed at the key laboratory of water cycle and related land surface processes institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of science the isotopic compositions of the samples were determined using a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research inc usa and every isotopic standard and sample was injected sequentially six times using a microliter syring and the arithmetic average of last four injections was accepted as the final result isotopic ratios are expressed as the standardized permillage deviation from the vsmow and the measurement precision is 0 6 for δd and 0 2 for δ18o 2 4 data analysis and collection in the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip statistical analysis of monthly data including temperature rainfall humidity δd and δ18o values from the three sampling sites are shown in table 2 data on δd and δ18o in precipitation in urumqi and hotan were collected from the gnip database http isohis iaea org there are 131 samples from urmuqi station for the period january 1986 december 2003 and 47 samples from hotan station for january 1988 december 1992 data on the precipitation levels and air temperature were also found in the database the influence of moisture recycling on the isotopic compositions of precipitation was evidenced by the excess deuterium d excess parameter defined by dansgaard 1964 as d δd 8δ18o it has been well established that d excess values for continental precipitation events issuing from oceanic moisture are close to 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 the composition of stable isotopes in precipitation tends to reflect seasonal variations in tropospheric temperature dinçer and davis 1984 in some cases this can be approximated using a sine wave function dewalle et al 1997 małoszewski et al 1983 as follows δ β 0 a cos c t φ where δ is the predicted isotopic composition β 0 is the estimated mean annual δ18o a is the annual amplitude of δ φ is the phase lag of δ in radians c is the angular frequency constant 2 π 365 in radians day and t is the

characteristics observed during the study period at yining the annual precipitation level was 395 1 mm with the highest monthly measurement taken in november 105 9 mm and the lowest taken in february 9 0 mm the highest and lowest monthly temperatures were 24 0 c in july and 5 2 c in february respectively at zhaosu the annual precipitation was 558 3 mm with the highest observation 97 1 mm made in may and the lowest 8 3 mm made in december the highest and lowest monthly temperatures were 16 5 c in july and 10 1 c in february respectively at xinyuan the annual precipitation level was 522 0 mm with most of the precipitation falling in june 117 7 mm and the least in february 9 5 mm the highest and lowest monthly temperatures were 20 1 c in july and 8 3 c in february respectively 3 2 spatiotemporal variations in stable isotope values the δ18o and δd values recorded for all precipitation events were very similar at each of the study sites fig 2 with their values ranging from 37 8 to 3 2 and 261 52 to 34 51 respectively table 2 there is a significant seasonal variation in the δ18o and δd values at each sampling site they tend to be positive in the warm season june august and negative in the cold season december february and the δ18o values varies with time as shown in fig 3 the monthly arithmetic averages of δ18o and δd levels ranged from 28 1 to 0 4 and from 199 10 to 14 11 respectively in yining their weighted average monthly values ranged from 28 2 to 1 38 and from 200 52 to 12 09 respectively the monthly arithmetic average values of δ18o and δd ranged from 29 4 to 0 1 and from 222 46 to 5 49 respectively in zhaosu and their weighted average monthly values ranged from 29 8 to 1 1 and from 222 73 to 13 01 respectively the monthly arithmetic averages of δ18o and δd levels ranged from 28 8 to 0 3 and 198 60 to 1 04 respectively in xinyuan their precipitation weighted monthly average values ranged from 28 58 to 0 94 and 201 65 to 9 94 respectively 3 3 simulation of temporal δ18o variations a clear sine wave seasonal variation in δ18o was seen at every sampling site fig 3 as shown in table 3 the estimated mean annual δ18o β0 based on cosine function are 12 35 12 73 and 12 10 for yining zhaosu ansd xinyuan respectively it was lower in zhaosu than at the other two sites the absolute values of annual amplitude are 13 26 13 79 and 11 45 for yining zhaosu ansd xinyuan respectively similarly the absolute value of zhaosu is also the largest given that the vapor source in the valley was consentaneous the differences in temperature that led to different condensation mechanisms may key to the differences observed for the isotopes 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of spatiotemporal variations in δ18o 4 1 1 temporal variations in δ18o with temperature as the condensation of water vapor is controlled by temperature the relationship between δ18o in precipitation and air temperature has often been used to trace sources of water vapor and the water cycling process fricke and o neil 1999 tian et al 2007 yu et al 2016 the relationship between the δ18o value in samples from precipitation events and the temperature at the three sites are shown in fig 4 the values of δ18o show a strong dependence on temperature in all three sites and a positive correlation between them was found p 0 01 indicating that lower δ18o values appear in the cold season and higher δ18o values in the warm season in other words the δ18o is more depleted in the cold season than in the warm season generally during the cold season air masses are relatively cold and dry and precipitation amount is low this leads to low values occurring in the cold season there have been other similar findings in northwestern china feng et al 2013a tian et al 2007 wang et al 2016d wu et al 2010 yao et al 2013 and this has been attributed to the water vapor cycle under the control of the westerly circulation the correlation coefficient of the linear regression line ranges from 0 66 to 0 70 in the ili valley fig 4 indicating that the effects of temperature control δ18o levels in precipitation the δ18o value of precipitation increased from 0 89 to 0 91 per c at the three sites the regression equation is δ18o 0 40 t 15 59 r2 0 98 n 12 in urumqi and δ18o 0 72 t 15 91 r2 0 93 n 12 in hotan based on iaea wmo 2018 data for the period 1986 2003 the gradient between δ18o and temperture of global mid and high latitudes is about 0 55 per c rozanski et al 2013 and is 0 36 per c in china iaea wmo 2018 in addition the good correlation between δ18o and temperature has previously also been reported many times for tianshan mountains and the gradient values ranges from 0 46 per c to 0 87 per c feng et al 2013b tandong et al 1999 the gradient between δ18o and temperature of ili valley is slightly higher than that of in other parts of the tianshan mountains area however in comparison it was clear that the slopes of equations describing the conditions in urumqi and hotan were lower than those of the regression equations describing yining zhaosu and xinyuan this indicates that the isotopic composition of precipitation may be more sensitive to the temperature at these three sites than at urumqi and hotan in other words when the air temperature fluctuates the δ18o value in the ili valley will change more significantly than it will in urumqi and hotan 4 1 2 temporal variations in δ18o with precipitation the effect that the amount of precipitation has on its isotopic value describes the empirical finding that the stable isotope ratios of precipitation decrease as the precipitation level increases dansgaard 1964 no clear effect was found between the weighted mean monthly δ18o with the monthly rainfall amount in the ili valley the coefficients of correlation between δ18o and the amount of precipitation are 0 01 0 59 and 0 22 at the at the yining zhaousu and xinyuan sites respectively by contrast this coefficient is 0 70 in urumqi indicating that the relationship between δ18o and precipitation amount is significant at this location this may be due to differences in the sources of water vapor but it is uncertain and it will be further discussed in detail in later text 4 1 3 altitude effect of δ18o the effect of altitude on stable isotopes in precipitation is a well known phenomenon usually precipitation is more depleted in heavy isotopes at higher altitudes so there is a strong negative correlation between isotopic value and altitude that exists in most places globally usually ranges from 0 1 to 0 5 per 100 m bowen and wilkinson 2002 gonfiantini et al 2001 however a positive gradient of 0 32 100 m was obtained from the yining zhaosu and xinyuan sites when an annual weighted average of δ18o values was used fig 5 interestingly similar results were also found around urumqi feng et al 2013b kong and pang 2016 kong et al 2013 where the positive gradient is about 0 12 100 m reasons for the positive gradient are identifed as the local processes of sub cloud evaporation and moisture recycling clark and fritz 1997 considering four sites yining zhaosu xinyuan and urumqi both located in the tianshan mountains the δ18o value in zhaosu may slightly lower according to the regression line fitted by the remaining three sites it is noted that a similar situation also occurred in the houxia site with a relative higher altitude fig 5 which is located in the tianshan mountains 70 km southwest of urumqi kong et al 2013 this indicates that at high altitudes such as zhaosu and houxia sub cloud evaporation is weak because of lower air temperature therefore the δ18o value of precipitation is more negative 4 2 the local meteoric water lines and deuterium excess 4 2 1 the relationship between δd and δ18o a significant linear relationship between δd and δ18o has been broadly observed in natural meteoric waters from rivers lakes and precipitations around the world in the mid 20th century friedman 1953 based on the stable isotopic characteristics of meteoric water samples δd 8δ18o 10 was named by craig 1961 as the global meteoric line gmwl to describe the relationship between them the equation relating δd and δ18o of meteoric water in a local region is called the local meteoric line lmwl due to differences in geographical and meteorological factors in different regions the slopes and intercepts of lmwls will vary depending on the region generally comparing the differences of the slopes and intercepts between lmwl and gmwl may trace the source of moisture and indicate the degree of sub cloud evaporation or the contribution of re evaporated moisture to precipitation at the region based on all the event based precipitation samples collected at three sites across the ili valley a local meteoric water line lmwl is established as δd 7 32 0 06 δ18o 3 62 0 92 r2 0 98 n 296 p 0 01 fig 6 both the slope and intercept of lmwl are lower than that of gmwl of 8 and 10 the low lmwl slope is usually associated with non equilibrium conditions affecting falling raindrops during dry conditions liu et al 2014 wang et al 2017c leading to the potential for significant subcloud evaporation for individual site the lmwls based on the event based samples for yining zhaosu and xinyuan respectively are δd 7 13 0 10 δ18o 3 79 1 63 r2 0 99 n 74 p 0 05 δd 7 75 0 11 δ18o 4 62 1 47 r2 0 98 n 122 p 0 01 and δd 7 07 0 09 δ18o 2 81 1 25 r2 0 99 n 100 p 0 05 fig 6 moreover the slopes and intercepts of lmwls based on the monthly weighted value respectively are 7 22 0 19 and 4 75 3 14 for yining 7 86 0 24 and 4 89 4 23 for zhaosu 7 14 0 12 and 4 26 1 92 for xinyuan both slope and intercept based on the monthly weighted regression analysis are larger than that based on event based this phenomenon exists in all three sites the reason is that in event based regression analysis any precipitation amount great or small is treated equally therefore the contribution of small amount of precipitation becomes relatively obvious especially in winter as mentioned earlier because of clod and dry subcloud evaporation significantly affects the isotopic characteristics of precipitation liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 similar findings have also been reported in areas with similar meteorological conditions tian et al 2007 wang et al 2016d wu et al 2010 comparing the different sites the results of regression analysis based on the above two methods show that there is an increasing trend in slope and intercept from xinyuan yining and zhaosu based on precipitation weighted results the slopes for the lmwls in yining 7 22 and xinyuan 7 14 are quite similar and very close to that of urumqi 7 16 iaea wmo 2018 however the slope of the lmwl of zhaosu 7 86 were higher than those of yining xinyuan and urumqi but lower than that of hotan 8 55 iaea wmo 2018 urumuqi yining xinyuan and zhaosu are located in thetianshan mountains while hotan is located in the kunlun mountains so their moisture may have different sources for the first four sites the zhaosu has a low annual average temperature and a high altitude which significantly affects the isotopic fractionation process of precipitation firstly the low temperature significantly reduces the degree of evaporation secondly the higher altitude shortens the time that it takes for raindrop to fall from the clouds to the ground and this also reduces the degree of evaporation although it may be minimal as a result the slope of lmwl in zhaosu is the largest of the four sites 4 2 2 variations in deuterium excess d excess in precipitation the value of deuterium excess d excess was defined by dansgaard 1964 as d δd 8 δ18o and is a second order isotopic variable the d excess can provide additional insight into the formation of rainwater because it is highly sensitive to the physical processes that generate strong kinetic effect such as condensation at supersaturation and evaporation wang et al 2016c so the d excess can be use to infer moisture sources and subcloud process guan et al 2013 the global average d excess in precipitation of 10 was given by craig in 1961 craig 1961 and it is derived from evaporation from an average ocean surface with a temperature of 25 c and relative humidity of 80 generally the d excess of precipitation depends on the subcloud evaporation and moisture diffusive exchange so deviations from 10 often occur because of the humidity differences at the vapour source or source of evaporation in this study the calculated d excess value for each rain event ranged from 59 23 to 55 71 of the 297 d excess data points available 143 were greater than 10 of which 56 were greater than 20 the average value and standard deviation of d excess in yining are 14 86 and 12 37 and they are 7 17 and 11 23 in zhaosu and 13 49 and 11 50 in xinyuan the average value of d excess increases from zhaosu xinyuan to yining and only the value in zhaosu is 10 the distribution of the d excess values from each sampling site is shown in fig 7 comparing the variety of d excess during the year it tends to be lower in summer and higher in winter and this may be caused by differences in moisture sources of the 296 precipitation events 50 occurred during the cold season december march and made up about 17 of the total fig 7 shows clearly that most of the d excess values were greater than 10 in the cold season especially in yining and xinyuan for the 80 samples collected in the warm season most of the d excess values were less than 10 this obvious difference in d excess between the seasons might have resulted from different mechanisms in the hydrologic cycle the difference of d excess in precipitation also exists between different sites in ili valley low d excess was measured in samples collected from zhaosu and the average value calculated from event based is 7 16 and less 10 usually low d excess results from subcloud secondary evaporation which also leads to enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation this seems to be confirmed by the monthly weighted average value of δ18o in zhaosu the monthly weighted average value of δ18o gradually increases from yining xinyuan to zhaosu fig 2 suggesting enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation however this contradicts the conclusion obtained from the slope of lmwls which indicates that less evaporation occurs in zhaosu previous studies in adjacent areas wang et al 2016d have shown that the low d excess values are always related to the low precipitation amount and high evaporation in fact zhaosu has the largest amount of precipitation and the lowest temperature among the three sites which is totally inconsistent with the explanation that more evaporation occurs here considering the effect of moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water from the ground froehlich et al 2008 it will increase the d excess value more significantly than other factors there are large number of farmland around yining site and they rely mainly on ili river water for irrigation as a result the amount of water involved in recycling has increased this is a good explanation for the high d excess values that appears in yining the same phenomenon also appeared in urumqi station wang et al 2016d therefore the d excess value is the highest at the yining stie due to impact of local moisture recycling in ili valley this value is low in warm seasons and high in cold season and the cause of this phenomenon may be the difference in source of moisture during year but is needs to be further confirmed by backward trajectory analysis for moisture sources 4 3 moisture trajectory analysis to determine the origin of the moisture more precisely three dimensional isentropic back trajectories of air masses delivering precipitation to the study sites were derived using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model version 4 0 hysplit4 0 from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa air resources laboratory this model which has been used to examine air parcel trajectories in other studies of the isotopic composition of rainfall chen et al 2015 feng et al 2013b provided insights into the history of air masses for the precipitation events sampled in this study the hysplit4 0 model relies on gridded meteorological datasets and uses a predictor corrector method to calculate particle trajectories air mass isentropic back trajectory models have been employed to analyze 297 precipitation events in order to determine the source and histories of the air masses above the ili valley in order to better understand the source of near surface moisture all back trajectories were started at 100 m 500 m and 1 000 m above ground level and were traced back 120 h 5 d before their arrival using archived reanalysis data on the 2 5 latitude longitude grid from a global noaa national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar meteorological dataset feng et al 2013b also employed hysplit model to determine the moisture source in the urumqi river basin during 2006 where is located on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains about 350 km northeast of the study area their results indicate that dominant westerly air masses in summer and the integrated westerly and polar air masses in winter are the main source of moisture for precipitation in the urumqi river basin this conclusion also applies to the ili valley because the tianshan mountain region has the same meteorological conditions liu et al 2015 the hysplit modeling results from yining zhaosu and xinyuan from may 2015 to april 2016 are also consistent with the above mentioned in the warm seasons the moisture originating from the warm and humid atlantic ocean or from relatively warm water bodies like black caspian and aral seas forms meteoric water with enriched heavy isotopes in the study area under the westerly circulation in contrast during the cold season the moisture mixing in the water vapor from the arctic ocean forms meteoric water that depletes heavy isotopes therefore the difference in moisture sources in different seasons determines the seasonal variation of the isotopes of meteoric water the hysplit modeling results from four examples representing moisture origin conditions in june september december and march are reported in fig 8 the results show that the moisture source mainly came from the west but they are not exactly the same in different months for example moisture mainly originates from the vicinity of the ili valley in june and next march fig 8a and d these time also happens to have a large amount of farmland being irrigated surface water and soil water are actively involved in the water cycle which results in a high d excess values for precipitation 4 4 the isotopic effect in the wet island previous studies have revealed the the water vapor over the central asia is mainly replenished by the westerlies rather than the idian or eastern asian monsoons liu et al 2015 tian et al 2007 yao et al 2013 as a typical wet island in the central asia the source of water vapor in ili valley is the same as that of the large scale area based on moisture trajectory analysis nevertheless there are still some differences in isotopic characteristics of precipitation between observation stations and it can be explained by differences of geographical elements e g temperature rainfall amount underlying surface etc the western part of the ili valley is relatively low in altitude and large in width while the eastern part of the valley is high in altitude and small in width fig 1 such a terrain is a great contribution to condensation of water vapor sourcing from westerlies and this is the reason that there is more rain in the valley than that in urumqi and hotan meanwhile the vegetation coverage in the ili valley is about 0 7 and it is higher than that in other parts of central asia yimit et al 2011 zou and zhai 2004 such a series of factors lead to strong local vapor recycling so it has a significant influence on the composition of precipitation isotopes as a results the variation of δ18o is more sensitive to temperature change and altitude elevation in the ili valley and the slope and intercept of lmwl in the ili valley were slightly higher than that in urumqi and hotan 5 summary and conclusion as an typical wet island in arid central asia the ili valley is a important cistern and provides water resources for the oasis in the lower reaches it is not clear whether its unique climatic characteristics will lead to different isotopes of precipitation and what is the major factor controlling the variation of precipitation isotopes in this region using stable δ18o and δd isotopes levels measured in precipitation of 297 samples during one year and hysplit4 back trajectory analyses from sites in yining zhaosu and xinyuan this study identify the characteristics of precipitation isotopes in the ili valley northwestern china the measured δ18o and δd values and meteorological data were used to determine the spatial and temporal variations of δ18o and δd in event based precipitation in the ili valley observations at the three sampling sites showed that δ18o and δd values variation is seasonal and it can be described by a cosine function the δ18o and δd values are high in the warm season june august maximum 3 2 for δ18o and 34 51 for δd and low in the cold season december february minumum 37 8 for δ18o and 261 52 for δd moreover there is a significant linear relationship between δ18o in precipitation and temperature and the slope of the regression line is about 0 91 the gradient between δ18o and temperature 0 91 per c in the study area is lightly higher than that of in other parts of the tianshan mountains area however the effect of the amount of rainfall is negligible like the results from research of urumqi river basin a positive correlation is found between δ18o and altitude and it is 0 32 100 m in our study area in addition the slope and intercept of the lmwls at the three sites are lower than the gmwl but higher than those from urumqi and hotan indicating that due to the climatic conditions of the drought subcloud evaporation plays an important role for the isotopic characteristics of precipitation in the study area on the other hand comparing the d excess values of three sites high d excess is found in the yining site it indicates that moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water around yining cannot be ignored this situation was also confirmed by the hysplit4 model results however these results derived in this paper are based only on a single year of precipitation isotopes which need to be reconfirmed through a long term observation because of the inter annual variation of precipitation isotopes in general the source of water vapor in an large scale area is almost the same for example the water vapor in central asia mainly originates from the westerlies however isotopic characteristics of precipitation vary in different small scale areas due to differences in geographic factors such as air temperature humidity altitude precipitation and so on therefore when using the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes method to research hydrological cycle special attention must be paid to the influence of local geographical characteristics on the isotopic composition of precipitation moreover local water vapor recycling is also an important component of precipitation in arid area especially in central asia in summary it is necessary to carry out a intensive and long term precipitation isotopes study before conducting a hydrological cycle study in a

6535,as a typical wet island in arid central asia the ili valley located in northwestern china provides water resources for the oasis in the lower reaches however it is not clear whether its unique climatic characteristics will lead to different isotopes of precipitation and what is the major factor controlling the variation of precipitation isotopes in this region based on three sites spread over the ili valley 297 precipitation samples were collected from may 2015 to april 2016 the δ18o and δd values range from 37 8 to 3 2 and 261 5 to 34 5 with a weighted mean 9 4 and 65 2 respectively a clear correlation exists between mean monthly δ18o values and mean monthly temperature with r2 0 68 for the mean monthly values increase of 0 91 per degree celsius a positive gradient of 0 32 100 m was obtained from the ili valley when an annual weighted average of δ18o values was used considering the temporal and spatial variation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and d excess value of precipitation combined with the results from the hysplit4 0 air mass trajectory model we found that moisture source in the study area is considered mainly replenished by the westerlies and the moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water around yining cannot be ignored although the data covers a year it can still provide a good database for studying hydrological cycle in

significant in the past decades the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo http isohis iaea org have conducted global scale observations of and research on δ18o and δd due to their significance in precipitation since 1961 iaea wmo 2018 at present there are more than 1100 stations set up across the globe to measure the values of these isotopes as part of the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip dansgaard 1964 jouzel et al 1997 the isotopic data in the gnip database especially in the stations operated for several years serve as an indispensable resource in many scientific disciplines on global and regional scale kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016a 2017a b information on variations in δd and δ18o content in present day precipitation events is crucial for the study of hydrologic cycles especially in relation to groundwater recharge sources han et al 2014 wang et al 2016a 2015 in addition knowing the levels of δd and δ18o in precipitation can also help to describe the circulation of air masses in the atmosphere and the recycling of continental moisture this is particularly important for studying the hydrological cycle especially in arid areas where water resources are scarce located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and far away from the ocean with the mountains all around xinjiang is featured by a temperate continental climate with low precipitation it has a semi arid and arid climate and the long term average annual precipitation ranges from 17 3 mm to 505 9 mm generally precipitation is higher in mountains and lower in desert so the distribution of precipitation in xinjiang is extremely heterogeneous previous studies indicated that significant differences in topography and landforms will cause a distinct difference in the isotopes of precipitation wang et al 2016a 2017a b zhao et al 2011 the ili valley is located in the middle tianshan mountains also known as tien shan and western of xinjiang and called wet island in central asia because of the large precipitation 350 mm year as an important natural water resource in an arid and semiarid climate precipitation and vapor sources around the tianshan mountains have attracted great attention in hydrological and climate studies wang et al 2016b 2017c during the past decades monthly daily or event based sampling for precipitation isotopes was discontinuously undertaken at the urumqi and hotan by gnip zhang and wang 2016 based on these isotopic data individual local meteoric water lines of the two cities have been established and moisture source is considered mainly replenished by the westerlies rather than the indian or eastern asian monsoons chen et al 2008 liu et al 2015 the precipitation of the urumqi and hotan are 300 9 mm and 44 5 mm in 2013 respectively meanwhile urumqi is located in the north of tianshan mountains and hotan is located in the north of kunlun mountains and their altitude is 918 and 1375 m respectively in view of the above geographical characteristics they can not represent the isotopic characteristics of precipitation in the middle tianshan mountain area wang et al 2016a b which receives more abundant rainfall especially in western ili valley 350 mm year most current studies based on results from gnip are concentrated around urumqi and these have conducted preliminarily analyses of the water vapor sources and atmospheric circulation patterns in the region feng et al 2013b kong et al 2013 liu et al 2015 however there have been no comprehensive studies of the spatial and temporal variations in the isotopes from precipitation in the ili valley and it may contain more information about water vapor cycle and moisture source it is clear that the previous precipitation isotopes sampling sites were located in lower precipitation area and therefore cannot well describe the varying characteristics of the ili valley more importantly due to the absence of an intensive observation network detailed isotopic information about moisture transport has not been available in the ili valley where rainfall is abundant therefore the key purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics of precipitation isotopes in wet island located in arid central asia on the other hand the objectives of this study is to a establish a dataset of the composition of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in the ili valley based on 296 rainfall samples collected from may 2015 to april 2016 at sites throughout the region and b to investigate the meteorological and geographical controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in the ili valley region and c to analyze and compare characteristics of water vapor sources in different parts of tianshan mountains the results of this comprehensive investigation will provide a good dataset to study the hydrological processes in tianshan mountains which is also helpful for other areas with an arid and semiarid climate 2 material and methods 2 1 overview of the study region the ili valley is located in the western tianshan mountains fig 1 and is thus effectively part of central asia it lies between 80 85 e and 42 45 n and covers an area of approximately 65 000 km2 in the northwestern xinjiang uygur autonomous region the largest and most northwestern province in china the valley is 350 km long from east to west and is high in the former and low in the latter with altitudes ranging from 2500 to 500 m above sea level given its location in the chinese hinterland about 3600 km from the ocean fig 1 the valley is characterized by a temperate semi arid continental climate with temperature and precipitation levels that vary greatly although westerly winds dominate throughout the year the winter climate is controlled mainly by the intensity and position of the siberian high pressure cell and is also influenced by the northern branch of the westerlies the summer climate is affected in part by the indian low pressure cell when the southern branch of the westerlies shifts northwards zhang et al 2012 the ili valley is one of the wettest regions in xinjiang because it is open on the west to humid airflow the mean annual temperature varies from 2 6 c to 9 2 c depending on the terrain the mean annual precipitation ranges between 200 mm and 500 mm on the plains but can reach 800 mm in the mountains dong et al 2016 since the valley is surrounded by high mountain ranges summer ice melt and in some cases groundwater flow can be expected to control the hydrology of water courses and lakes on the valley floor 2 2 collection of precipitation samples samples of precipitation were collected at yining zhaosu and xinyuan in the ili valley fig 1c from may 2015 april 2016 the altitude rainfall levels and annual air temperature are not consistent at the three sites and more information is listed in table 1 water samples were collected in plastic funnel bottle sets immediately after rainfall events to minimize the effects of evaporation funnels mounted near the ground conveyed water into the bottles through plastic tubing that was looped to form a water trap and prevent evaporation winter precipitation usually fell as snow and these samples were collected into pre cleaned plastic bags and taken indoors to melt after melting completely at room temperature 25 c the samples were transferred into the sampling bottles one 50 ml bottle was used to collect the sample from which the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were measured to avoid evaporation and other influences of direct sunlight all sample bottles were sealed with a layer of paraffin and transferred to the laboratory in a dark and cold container no chemicals were added to the water the quantity temperature and humidity of the precipitation samples were recorded as they were collected 2 3 laboratory analysis the ratios of the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes measured in water are usually expressed in delta values defined as the per mil deviation from the standard vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as follows δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the sample and the standard respectively hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were analyzed at the key laboratory of water cycle and related land surface processes institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of science the isotopic compositions of the samples were determined using a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research inc usa and every isotopic standard and sample was injected sequentially six times using a microliter syring and the arithmetic average of last four injections was accepted as the final result isotopic ratios are expressed as the standardized permillage deviation from the vsmow and the measurement precision is 0 6 for δd and 0 2 for δ18o 2 4 data analysis and collection in the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip statistical analysis of monthly data including temperature rainfall humidity δd and δ18o values from the three sampling sites are shown in table 2 data on δd and δ18o in precipitation in urumqi and hotan were collected from the gnip database http isohis iaea org there are 131 samples from urmuqi station for the period january 1986 december 2003 and 47 samples from hotan station for january 1988 december 1992 data on the precipitation levels and air temperature were also found in the database the influence of moisture recycling on the isotopic compositions of precipitation was evidenced by the excess deuterium d excess parameter defined by dansgaard 1964 as d δd 8δ18o it has been well established that d excess values for continental precipitation events issuing from oceanic moisture are close to 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 the composition of stable isotopes in precipitation tends to reflect seasonal variations in tropospheric temperature dinçer and davis 1984 in some cases this can be approximated using a sine wave function dewalle et al 1997 małoszewski et al 1983 as follows δ β 0 a cos c t φ where δ is the predicted

characteristics observed during the study period at yining the annual precipitation level was 395 1 mm with the highest monthly measurement taken in november 105 9 mm and the lowest taken in february 9 0 mm the highest and lowest monthly temperatures were 24 0 c in july and 5 2 c in february respectively at zhaosu the annual precipitation was 558 3 mm with the highest observation 97 1 mm made in may and the lowest 8 3 mm made in december the highest and lowest monthly temperatures were 16 5 c in july and 10 1 c in february respectively at xinyuan the annual precipitation level was 522 0 mm with most of the precipitation falling in june 117 7 mm and the least in february 9 5 mm the highest and lowest monthly temperatures were 20 1 c in july and 8 3 c in february respectively 3 2 spatiotemporal variations in stable isotope values the δ18o and δd values recorded for all precipitation events were very similar at each of the study sites fig 2 with their values ranging from 37 8 to 3 2 and 261 52 to 34 51 respectively table 2 there is a significant seasonal variation in the δ18o and δd values at each sampling site they tend to be positive in the warm season june august and negative in the cold season december february and the δ18o values varies with time as shown in fig 3 the monthly arithmetic averages of δ18o and δd levels ranged from 28 1 to 0 4 and from 199 10 to 14 11 respectively in yining their weighted average monthly values ranged from 28 2 to 1 38 and from 200 52 to 12 09 respectively the monthly arithmetic average values of δ18o and δd ranged from 29 4 to 0 1 and from 222 46 to 5 49 respectively in zhaosu and their weighted average monthly values ranged from 29 8 to 1 1 and from 222 73 to 13 01 respectively the monthly arithmetic averages of δ18o and δd levels ranged from 28 8 to 0 3 and 198 60 to 1 04 respectively in xinyuan their precipitation weighted monthly average values ranged from 28 58 to 0 94 and 201 65 to 9 94 respectively 3 3 simulation of temporal δ18o variations a clear sine wave seasonal variation in δ18o was seen at every sampling site fig 3 as shown in table 3 the estimated mean annual δ18o β0 based on cosine function are 12 35 12 73 and 12 10 for yining zhaosu ansd xinyuan respectively it was lower in zhaosu than at the other two sites the absolute values of annual amplitude are 13 26 13 79 and 11 45 for yining zhaosu ansd xinyuan respectively similarly the absolute value of zhaosu is also the largest given that the vapor source in the valley was consentaneous the differences in temperature that led to different condensation mechanisms may key to the differences observed for the isotopes 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of spatiotemporal variations in δ18o 4 1 1 temporal variations in δ18o with temperature as the condensation of water vapor is controlled by temperature the relationship between δ18o in precipitation and air temperature has often been used to trace sources of water vapor and the water cycling process fricke and o neil 1999 tian et al 2007 yu et al 2016 the relationship between the δ18o value in samples from precipitation events and the temperature at the three sites are shown in fig 4 the values of δ18o show a strong dependence on temperature in all three sites and a positive correlation between them was found p 0 01 indicating that lower δ18o values appear in the cold season and higher δ18o values in the warm season in other words the δ18o is more depleted in the cold season than in the warm season generally during the cold season air masses are relatively cold and dry and precipitation amount is low this leads to low values occurring in the cold season there have been other similar findings in northwestern china feng et al 2013a tian et al 2007 wang et al 2016d wu et al 2010 yao et al 2013 and this has been attributed to the water vapor cycle under the control of the westerly circulation the correlation coefficient of the linear regression line ranges from 0 66 to 0 70 in the ili valley fig 4 indicating that the effects of temperature control δ18o levels in precipitation the δ18o value of precipitation increased from 0 89 to 0 91 per c at the three sites the regression equation is δ18o 0 40 t 15 59 r2 0 98 n 12 in urumqi and δ18o 0 72 t 15 91 r2 0 93 n 12 in hotan based on iaea wmo 2018 data for the period 1986 2003 the gradient between δ18o and temperture of global mid and high latitudes is about 0 55 per c rozanski et al 2013 and is 0 36 per c in china iaea wmo 2018 in addition the good correlation between δ18o and temperature has previously also been reported many times for tianshan mountains and the gradient values ranges from 0 46 per c to 0 87 per c feng et al 2013b tandong et al 1999 the gradient between δ18o and temperature of ili valley is slightly higher than that of in other parts of the tianshan mountains area however in comparison it was clear that the slopes of equations describing the conditions in urumqi and hotan were lower than those of the regression equations describing yining zhaosu and xinyuan this indicates that the isotopic composition of precipitation may be more sensitive to the temperature at these three sites than at urumqi and hotan in other words when the air temperature fluctuates the δ18o value in the ili valley will change more significantly than it will in urumqi and hotan 4 1 2 temporal variations in δ18o with precipitation the effect that the amount of precipitation has on its isotopic value describes the empirical finding that the stable isotope ratios of precipitation decrease as the precipitation level increases dansgaard 1964 no clear effect was found between the weighted mean monthly δ18o with the monthly rainfall amount in the ili valley the coefficients of correlation between δ18o and the amount of precipitation are 0 01 0 59 and 0 22 at the at the yining zhaousu and xinyuan sites respectively by contrast this coefficient is 0 70 in urumqi indicating that the relationship between δ18o and precipitation amount is significant at this location this may be due to differences in the sources of water vapor but it is uncertain and it will be further discussed in detail in later text 4 1 3 altitude effect of δ18o the effect of altitude on stable isotopes in precipitation is a well known phenomenon usually precipitation is more depleted in heavy isotopes at higher altitudes so there is a strong negative correlation between isotopic value and altitude that exists in most places globally usually ranges from 0 1 to 0 5 per 100 m bowen and wilkinson 2002 gonfiantini et al 2001 however a positive gradient of 0 32 100 m was obtained from the yining zhaosu and xinyuan sites when an annual weighted average of δ18o values was used fig 5 interestingly similar results were also found around urumqi feng et al 2013b kong and pang 2016 kong et al 2013 where the positive gradient is about 0 12 100 m reasons for the positive gradient are identifed as the local processes of sub cloud evaporation and moisture recycling clark and fritz 1997 considering four sites yining zhaosu xinyuan and urumqi both located in the tianshan mountains the δ18o value in zhaosu may slightly lower according to the regression line fitted by the remaining three sites it is noted that a similar situation also occurred in the houxia site with a relative higher altitude fig 5 which is located in the tianshan mountains 70 km southwest of urumqi kong et al 2013 this indicates that at high altitudes such as zhaosu and houxia sub cloud evaporation is weak because of lower air temperature therefore the δ18o value of precipitation is more negative 4 2 the local meteoric water lines and deuterium excess 4 2 1 the relationship between δd and δ18o a significant linear relationship between δd and δ18o has been broadly observed in natural meteoric waters from rivers lakes and precipitations around the world in the mid 20th century friedman 1953 based on the stable isotopic characteristics of meteoric water samples δd 8δ18o 10 was named by craig 1961 as the global meteoric line gmwl to describe the relationship between them the equation relating δd and δ18o of meteoric water in a local region is called the local meteoric line lmwl due to differences in geographical and meteorological factors in different regions the slopes and intercepts of lmwls will vary depending on the region generally comparing the differences of the slopes and intercepts between lmwl and gmwl may trace the source of moisture and indicate the degree of sub cloud evaporation or the contribution of re evaporated moisture to precipitation at the region based on all the event based precipitation samples collected at three sites across the ili valley a local meteoric water line lmwl is established as δd 7 32 0 06 δ18o 3 62 0 92 r2 0 98 n 296 p 0 01 fig 6 both the slope and intercept of lmwl are lower than that of gmwl of 8 and 10 the low lmwl slope is usually associated with non equilibrium conditions affecting falling raindrops during dry conditions liu et al 2014 wang et al 2017c leading to the potential for significant subcloud evaporation for individual site the lmwls based on the event based samples for yining zhaosu and xinyuan respectively are δd 7 13 0 10 δ18o 3 79 1 63 r2 0 99 n 74 p 0 05 δd 7 75 0 11 δ18o 4 62 1 47 r2 0 98 n 122 p 0 01 and δd 7 07 0 09 δ18o 2 81 1 25 r2 0 99 n 100 p 0 05 fig 6 moreover the slopes and intercepts of lmwls based on the monthly weighted value respectively are 7 22 0 19 and 4 75 3 14 for yining 7 86 0 24 and 4 89 4 23 for zhaosu 7 14 0 12 and 4 26 1 92 for xinyuan both slope and intercept based on the monthly weighted regression analysis are larger than that based on event based this phenomenon exists in all three sites the reason is that in event based regression analysis any precipitation amount great or small is treated equally therefore the contribution of small amount of precipitation becomes relatively obvious especially in winter as mentioned earlier because of clod and dry subcloud evaporation significantly affects the isotopic characteristics of precipitation liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 similar findings have also been reported in areas with similar meteorological conditions tian et al 2007 wang et al 2016d wu et al 2010 comparing the different sites the results of regression analysis based on the above two methods show that there is an increasing trend in slope and intercept from xinyuan yining and zhaosu based on precipitation weighted results the slopes for the lmwls in yining 7 22 and xinyuan 7 14 are quite similar and very close to that of urumqi 7 16 iaea wmo 2018 however the slope of the lmwl of zhaosu 7 86 were higher than those of yining xinyuan and urumqi but lower than that of hotan 8 55 iaea wmo 2018 urumuqi yining xinyuan and zhaosu are located in thetianshan mountains while hotan is located in the kunlun mountains so their moisture may have different sources for the first four sites the zhaosu has a low annual average temperature and a high altitude which significantly affects the isotopic fractionation process of precipitation firstly the low temperature significantly reduces the degree of evaporation secondly the higher altitude shortens the time that it takes for raindrop to fall from the clouds to the ground and this also reduces the degree of evaporation although it may be minimal as a result the slope of lmwl in zhaosu is the largest of the four sites 4 2 2 variations in deuterium excess d excess in precipitation the value of deuterium excess d excess was defined by dansgaard 1964 as d δd 8 δ18o and is a second order isotopic variable the d excess can provide additional insight into the formation of rainwater because it is highly sensitive to the physical processes that generate strong kinetic effect such as condensation at supersaturation and evaporation wang et al 2016c so the d excess can be use to infer moisture sources and subcloud process guan et al 2013 the global average d excess in precipitation of 10 was given by craig in 1961 craig 1961 and it is derived from evaporation from an average ocean surface with a temperature of 25 c and relative humidity of 80 generally the d excess of precipitation depends on the subcloud evaporation and moisture diffusive exchange so deviations from 10 often occur because of the humidity differences at the vapour source or source of evaporation in this study the calculated d excess value for each rain event ranged from 59 23 to 55 71 of the 297 d excess data points available 143 were greater than 10 of which 56 were greater than 20 the average value and standard deviation of d excess in yining are 14 86 and 12 37 and they are 7 17 and 11 23 in zhaosu and 13 49 and 11 50 in xinyuan the average value of d excess increases from zhaosu xinyuan to yining and only the value in zhaosu is 10 the distribution of the d excess values from each sampling site is shown in fig 7 comparing the variety of d excess during the year it tends to be lower in summer and higher in winter and this may be caused by differences in moisture sources of the 296 precipitation events 50 occurred during the cold season december march and made up about 17 of the total fig 7 shows clearly that most of the d excess values were greater than 10 in the cold season especially in yining and xinyuan for the 80 samples collected in the warm season most of the d excess values were less than 10 this obvious difference in d excess between the seasons might have resulted from different mechanisms in the hydrologic cycle the difference of d excess in precipitation also exists between different sites in ili valley low d excess was measured in samples collected from zhaosu and the average value calculated from event based is 7 16 and less 10 usually low d excess results from subcloud secondary evaporation which also leads to enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation this seems to be confirmed by the monthly weighted average value of δ18o in zhaosu the monthly weighted average value of δ18o gradually increases from yining xinyuan to zhaosu fig 2 suggesting enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation however this contradicts the conclusion obtained from the slope of lmwls which indicates that less evaporation occurs in zhaosu previous studies in adjacent areas wang et al 2016d have shown that the low d excess values are always related to the low precipitation amount and high evaporation in fact zhaosu has the largest amount of precipitation and the lowest temperature among the three sites which is totally inconsistent with the explanation that more evaporation occurs here considering the effect of moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water from the ground froehlich et al 2008 it will increase the d excess value more significantly than other factors there are large number of farmland around yining site and they rely mainly on ili river water for irrigation as a result the amount of water involved in recycling has increased this is a good explanation for the high d excess values that appears in yining the same phenomenon also appeared in urumqi station wang et al 2016d therefore the d excess value is the highest at the yining stie due to impact of local moisture recycling in ili valley this value is low in warm seasons and high in cold season and the cause of this phenomenon may be the difference in source of moisture during year but is needs to be further confirmed by backward trajectory analysis for moisture sources 4 3 moisture trajectory analysis to determine the origin of the moisture more precisely three dimensional isentropic back trajectories of air masses delivering precipitation to the study sites were derived using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model version 4 0 hysplit4 0 from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa air resources laboratory this model which has been used to examine air parcel trajectories in other studies of the isotopic composition of rainfall chen et al 2015 feng et al 2013b provided insights into the history of air masses for the precipitation events sampled in this study the hysplit4 0 model relies on gridded meteorological datasets and uses a predictor corrector method to calculate particle trajectories air mass isentropic back trajectory models have been employed to analyze 297 precipitation events in order to determine the source and histories of the air masses above the ili valley in order to better understand the source of near surface moisture all back trajectories were started at 100 m 500 m and 1 000 m above ground level and were traced back 120 h 5 d before their arrival using archived reanalysis data on the 2 5 latitude longitude grid from a global noaa national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar meteorological dataset feng et al 2013b also employed hysplit model to determine the moisture source in the urumqi river basin during 2006 where is located on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains about 350 km northeast of the study area their results indicate that dominant westerly air masses in summer and the integrated westerly and polar air masses in winter are the main source of moisture for precipitation in the urumqi river basin this conclusion also applies to the ili valley because the tianshan mountain region has the same meteorological conditions liu et al 2015 the hysplit modeling results from yining zhaosu and xinyuan from may 2015 to april 2016 are also consistent with the above mentioned in the warm seasons the moisture originating from the warm and humid atlantic ocean or from relatively warm water bodies like black caspian and aral seas forms meteoric water with enriched heavy isotopes in the study area under the westerly circulation in contrast during the cold season the moisture mixing in the water vapor from the arctic ocean forms meteoric water that depletes heavy isotopes therefore the difference in moisture sources in different seasons determines the seasonal variation of the isotopes of meteoric water the hysplit modeling results from four examples representing moisture origin conditions in june september december and march are reported in fig 8 the results show that the moisture source mainly came from the west but they are not exactly the same in different months for example moisture mainly originates from the vicinity of the ili valley in june and next march fig 8a and d these time also happens to have a large amount of farmland being irrigated surface water and soil water are actively involved in the water cycle which results in a high d excess values for precipitation 4 4 the isotopic effect in the wet island previous studies have revealed the the water vapor over the central asia is mainly replenished by the westerlies rather than the idian or eastern asian monsoons liu et al 2015 tian et al 2007 yao et al 2013 as a typical wet island in the central asia the source of water vapor in ili valley is the same as that of the large scale area based on moisture trajectory analysis nevertheless there are still some differences in isotopic characteristics of precipitation between observation stations and it can be explained by differences of geographical elements e g temperature rainfall amount underlying surface etc the western part of the ili valley is relatively low in altitude and large in width while the eastern part of the valley is high in altitude and small in width fig 1 such a terrain is a great contribution to condensation of water vapor sourcing from westerlies and this is the reason that there is more rain in the valley than that in urumqi and hotan meanwhile the vegetation coverage in the ili valley is about 0 7 and it is higher than that in other parts of central asia yimit et al 2011 zou and zhai 2004 such a series of factors lead to strong local vapor recycling so it has a significant influence on the composition of precipitation isotopes as a results the variation of δ18o is more sensitive to temperature change and altitude elevation in the ili valley and the slope and intercept of lmwl in the ili valley were slightly higher than that in urumqi and hotan 5 summary and conclusion as an typical wet island in arid central asia the ili valley is a important cistern and provides water resources for the oasis in the lower reaches it is not clear whether its unique climatic characteristics will lead to different isotopes of precipitation and what is the major factor controlling the variation of precipitation isotopes in this region using stable δ18o and δd isotopes levels measured in precipitation of 297 samples during one year and hysplit4 back trajectory analyses from sites in yining zhaosu and xinyuan this study identify the characteristics of precipitation isotopes in the ili valley northwestern china the measured δ18o and δd values and meteorological data were used to determine the spatial and temporal variations of δ18o and δd in event based precipitation in the ili valley observations at the three sampling sites showed that δ18o and δd values variation is seasonal and it can be described by a cosine function the δ18o and δd values are high in the warm season june august maximum 3 2 for δ18o and 34 51 for δd and low in the cold season december february minumum 37 8 for δ18o and 261 52 for δd moreover there is a significant linear relationship between δ18o in precipitation and temperature and the slope of the regression line is about 0 91 the gradient between δ18o and temperature 0 91 per c in the study area is lightly higher than that of in other parts of the tianshan mountains area however the effect of the amount of rainfall is negligible like the results from research of urumqi river basin a positive correlation is found between δ18o and altitude and it is 0 32 100 m in our study area in addition the slope and intercept of the lmwls at the three sites are lower than the gmwl but higher than those from urumqi and hotan indicating that due to the climatic conditions of the drought subcloud evaporation plays an important role for the isotopic characteristics of precipitation in the study area on the other hand comparing the d excess values of three sites high d excess is found in the yining site it indicates that moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water around yining cannot be ignored this situation was also confirmed by the hysplit4 model results however these results derived in this paper are based only on a single year of precipitation isotopes which need to be reconfirmed through a long term observation because of the inter annual variation of precipitation isotopes in general the source of water vapor in an large scale area is almost the same for example the water vapor in central asia mainly originates from the westerlies however isotopic characteristics of precipitation vary in different small scale areas due to differences in geographic factors such as air temperature humidity altitude precipitation and so on therefore when using the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes method to research hydrological cycle special attention must be paid to the influence of local geographical characteristics on the isotopic composition of precipitation moreover local water vapor recycling is also an important component of precipitation in arid area especially in central asia in summary it is necessary to carry out a intensive and long term precipitation isotopes study before conducting a hydrological cycle study in a

6536,this paper proposes a new finite volume multiscale finite element model nfvmsfem for groundwater flow and velocity simulation in porous media the main goal of this method is to simultaneously obtain the heads and continuous x y direction darcian velocities thereby simplifying the simulation process and improving the efficiency this goal is accomplished by introducing a novel velocity matrix in the control volume boundary flux estimation of the finite volume multiscale finite element method fvmsfem framework the velocity matrix allows for the nfvmsfem to directly represent continuous fine scale velocities by coarse scale heads thus merging the two kinds of unknowns into one through a modified yeh s galerkin model the velocity matrix is constructed in each local coarse element before the head computation thus the computational cost is very little furthermore the nfvmsfem inherits the advantageous features of the fvmsfem which ensures the local conservation of heads and further improves the efficiency the results of the comparison between the nfvmsfem and certain classical methods for head and velocity computation demonstrate its effectiveness and high efficiency keywords multiscale numerical method velocity matrix continuous velocity computational efficiency 1 introduction the accurate and efficient computation of both the flow field and continuous velocity field are crucial for studying groundwater flow and solute transport problems in heterogeneous porous media however the heterogeneity of natural groundwater systems usually leads to certain issues in the simulation of the head and velocity first the computational cost is too high for classical methods to resolve fine scale features especially in large spatial scale or temporal scale problems ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 massoudieh 2013 chaudhuri and ale 2014 luo et al 2016 second media heterogeneity makes it difficult for many classical methods to ensure the continuity of the darcian velocity which has a great influence on the accuracy of the velocity field zhang et al 1994 zhou et al 2001 et al 2012 xie et al 2017a meanwhile the velocity computation suffers the same high computational cost issues as the head computation third most numerical methods compute the head and velocity field separately or compute them together by iteration which leads to complex computation processes and high computational costs here we propose a new finite volume multiscale finite element method model nfvmsfem to resolve these issues by combining the multiscale finite element method msfem finite volume method fvm and yeh s galerkin finite element model the msfem is developed to resolve the high computational cost of the finite element method the main idea is to construct multiscale base functions by solving the reduced elliptical equation in each coarse element to capture the fine scale behavior of the equations in the coarse scale system hou and wu 1997 ye et al 2004 many multiscale finite element methods have been developed such as the mixed msfem mmsfem chen and hou 2003 aarnes 2004 chung et al 2015 the multiscale finite volume method msfvm jenny et al 2003 dehkordi and manzari 2013 the finite volume multiscale finite element method fvmsfem he and ren 2005 the generalized msfem efendiev et al 2013 chung et al 2014 chung et al 2016 chung et al 2016 and the efficient triple grid multiscale finite element method xie et al 2016 2017a among them only the mmsfem and msfvm can obtain conservative fine scale velocity fields the mmsfem combines the msfem and raviart thomas mixed element method and computes the head and velocity together by iteration chen and hou 2003 the msfvm employs locally computed basis functions to construct the coarse scale system and then considers additional local neumann problems to obtain the velocity field jenny et al 2003 wang et al 2014 the iterative msfvm extends the range to highly heterogeneous anisotropic elliptic problems by introducing correction functions to reduce the msfvm localization errors systematically and can reconstruct the velocity field after any iteration hajibeygi et al 2008 based on the msfvm a series of multiscale solvers are developed to extend the application range to more complex conditions such as incompressible heterogeneous flow wang et al 2014 and fractured porous media hajibeygi et al 2011 shah et al 2016 ţene et al 2016 the fvmsfem introduced by he and ren 2005 is a different fvm msfem based scheme that is more simple and straightforward the fvmsfem employs cell centered fvm at a coarse scale and estimates the control volume boundary fluxes by msfem base functions to capture the local fine scale information in addition the fvmsfem can ensure the local conservation of the head field and hence outperform the msfem in terms of accuracy however the fvmsfem itself lacks an effective continuous velocity scheme which limits its application the galerkin model developed by yeh 1981 can obtain a continuous velocity field after the flow field is derived by the finite element method unlike the mixed finite element methods this model does not need iteration and its equation system can be ensured to be positive definite zhou et al 2001 zhang et al 1994 moreover yeh s model can ensure the mass balance of the velocity and is more accurate and applicable than other head solved first methods yeh 1981 zhang et al 1994 xie et al 2017b many studies have shown that yeh s model can obtain a globally continuous velocity field in heterogeneous porous media boufadel et al 1999 jang and aral 2007 park and aral 2007 recently researchers introduced effective modifications of yeh s model to make it satisfy the refraction law along material interfaces zhou et al 2001 xie et al 2017b limited by the finite element framework the computational cost of yeh s model is significant high in heterogeneous porous media the nfvmsfem in the current study is able to simultaneously compute groundwater flow and velocity fields with high efficiency and accuracy different from other fvm msfem based methods the nfvmsfem aims to develop a more convenient and efficient way to accurately compute the head and velocity simultaneously that is capable of simplifying the groundwater simulation and saving computational efforts through a modified yeh s model novel velocity matrixes are constructed in coarse elements to represent the x y direction velocities by using the coarse scale head solution and multiscale base functions since each coarse element only contains very few nodes the cost of the construction of the velocity matrix is relative low then the nfvmsfem employs the velocity matrixes to replace the original finite difference scheme of the fvmsfem control volume boundary flux framework before the head computation therefore the nfvmsfem can merge the head and x y direction velocity computations which is convenient additionally yeh s principle can ensure the continuity of the velocity which leads to a more accurate control volume boundary fluxes meanwhile the nfvmsfem inherits advantageous features of the fvmsfem making it much more efficient than the finite element method and mass conservation of the heads is ensured to demonstrate its performance the nfvmsfem is compared with certain classical methods in three different situations for head computation the nfvmsfem solutions are comparable with those of the fine grid finite element method and fvmsfem and better than that of the coarse grid finite element method meanwhile the nfvmsfem can obtain the x y direction coarse scale and fine scale velocity fields without additional cost even when only one direction velocity computation is considered the computation efficiency and accuracy of the nfvmsfem coarse scale velocity are higher than those of the coarse grid yeh s model in particular the nfvmsfem can use less than 1 of the cpu time of the fine grid yeh s model to obtain the same number of fine scale velocities 2 governing equations the two dimensional transient groundwater flow equation can be written as 1 s h t k x y h w x y ω where h is the hydraulic head w is the source sink term s is the specific storage coefficient ω is the study region and k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor the local darcy s equations of each coarse element ijkl fig 1 are 2 v ξ f k ξ h ξ ξ x y where k ξ is the hydraulic conductivity in direction ξ ξ x y h is fine scale form of hydraulic head h and v ξ f is the fine scale velocity of ijkl in direction ξ ξ x y the nfvmsfem is designed to simultaneously compute the solutions for the groundwater flow eq 1 and all the coarse element local eq 2 with high efficiency and accuracy at the coarse scale the nfvmsfem employs the fvm to eq 1 to obtain the mass conservation equation system of head to obtain the fine scale form of this equation system the nfvmsfem applies a modified yeh s galerkin finite element model to eq 2 in every coarse element ijkl to construct the novel velocity matrixes the velocity matrixes allow for the nfvmsfem to represent continuous control volume boundary flux items directly by coarse scale heads and multiscale base functions thus to embed eq 2 into this head equation system therefore the nfvmsfem can obtain the head and velocity fields in one computation the detailed process of the nfvmsfem is introduced for a two dimensional transient groundwater flow problem in the following sections 3 grid subdivision process 1 the principle governing process 1 is the same as that of the msfem subdivision first the nfvmsfem employs axis parallel lines thick dashed lines to divide ω into rectangular coarse scale elements then the nfvmsfem divides each coarse element into triangular fine elements thin dashed lines in fig 1 a sample coarse element ijkl red dashed lines is divided into 32 fine triangular elements it is assumed that the coarse elements presented in this paper are squares with edge length l process 2 the process 2 is a fvm subdivision we assume that the total number of unknown nodes of the study region is nu d i is the control volume corresponding to i i 1 2 nu the nfvmsfem generates control volumes by connecting the center nodes of the coarse elements corresponding to an unknown coarse grid node thin solid lines for example we assume that node i is an interior node of the process 1 coarse scale grid a sample control volume d i x i l 2 x i l 2 y i l 2 y i l 2 with the edge length l is presented in fig 1 abcd in fig 2 the relationship between d i and its corresponding coarse elements can be seen clearly moreover if node i is an unknown boundary node of the process 1 coarse scale grid the area of the control volume is half of that generated from the interior node i e d i x i l 2 x i l 2 y i l 2 y i fig 3 4 nfvmsfem coarse scale scheme the nfvmsfem employs the fvm to obtain the coarse scale equation system of eq 1 according to the work of he and ren 2005 the coarse scale state variables corresponding to hydraulic head h are denoted as φ x y t in each control volume d i i 1 2 nu we have 3 φ i 1 d i d i hdxdy where d i is the area of control volume d i as in the work of he and ren 2005 φ i φ x i y i t is also called as the coarse solution of head at node i φ i satisfies the following equation 4 d φ i dt 1 d i d i h t dxdy integrating both sides of eq 1 over each control volume d i we have 5 s d i d i h t dxdy d i k x y hdxdy d i wdxdy where s d i is the specific storage coefficient of d i which is a constant the value of s d i is the average value of s at the vertexes of d i substituting eq 4 into eq 5 we have 6 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i d i k x y hdxdy d i wdxdy applying the divergence theorem to eq 6 we obtain 7 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i d i n k x y hd γ d i wdxdy where n is the out normal vector of d i for simplicity we assume that k k x 0 0 k y in the interior node control volume d i fig 2 combining eq 2 the right hand item of eq 7 can be presented by the fine scale velocities 8 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i d i k x h x dy k y h y dx d i wdxdy 1 s d i d i b c k x h x dy a d k x h x dy d c k y h y dx a b k y h y dx d i wdxdy 1 s d i d i b c v x f dy a d v x f dy d c v y f dx a b v y f dx d i wdxdy where v x f and v y f are fine scale velocities that can be represented by φ and multiscale base functions by velocity matrixes the construction of the velocity matrixes is presented in the next section the control volume d i is contained in the four corresponding coarse elements of i the fluxes across d i can be discretized into the flux items of coarse elements i ii iii iv fig 2 therefore eq 8 can be written as 9 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i flux t i flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv d i wdxdy where flux t i flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv are the control volume boundary flux items contributed by the corresponding coarse elements i ii iii iv respectively the fine scale details of these control volume boundary flux items are presented in the next section the euler method or other methods can be used to discretize eq 9 as in the fvmsfem he and ren 2005 this paper employs the crank nicolson method to discretize eq 9 by assuming that the time step is δ t and t k k δ t we obtain the equation for control volume d i 10 φ i k 1 φ i k δ t 2 g i t k g i t k 1 where φ i k 1 and φ i k are the numerical approximations of φ i t k 1 and φ i t k respectively and g i t k and g i t k 1 are the right hand sides of 9 at times t k and t k 1 respectively the scheme for the top boundary node control volumes fig 3 or the other boundary node control volumes is similar to the above interior coarse grid node scheme by combining eq 10 of all the control volumes d i i 1 2 nu the coarse scale form of the equation system of φ can be obtained by solving this equation system the coarse scale head solution φ can be derived 5 nfvmsfem fine scale scheme before the coarse scale equations are discretized to fine scale the multiscale base functions and velocity matrixes of each coarse element must be constructed through the velocity matrixes the nfvmsfem can obtain the relationship between the fine scale velocity unknowns and φ unknowns merging the two kinds unknowns into one then the nfvmsfem can discretize the coarse scale equations to fine scale schemes by using the velocity matrixes thus the darcy eq 2 can be embedded in the equation system of flow eq 1 therefore the nfvmsfem can obtain φ v x f and v y f simultaneously 5 1 construction of multiscale base functions according to the work of hou and wu 1997 the multiscale base function ψ θ θ i j k l satisfies the reduced elliptical problem of each coarse element ijkl fig 1 red dashed lines 11 k ψ θ 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor and the boundary conditions of ψ θ can be obtained by linear or oscillatory boundary conditions hou and wu 1997 ye et al 2004 he and ren 2005 ψ θ can be represented by linear base functions in each fine element abc of ijkl hou and wu 1997 12 ψ θ x y ψ θ a n a x y ψ θ b n b x y ψ θ c n c x y where ψ θ a ψ θ b ψ θ c are the values of ψ θ at abc vertexes a b c respectively we apply the galerkin approach to eq 11 and combine eq 12 obtaining the equation system of ψ θ by solving this equation system the unknown values of ψ θ at the interior nodes can be obtained 5 2 construction of velocity matrixes in each coarse element ijkl fig 1 red dashed lines the velocity satisfies the local darcy s eq 2 multiplying both sides of eq 2 by linear base function n i and integrating over ijkl the weak formulation of darcy s law can be obtained 13 ijkl v ξ f n i dxdy ijkl k ξ h ξ n i dxdy i 1 2 n n ξ x y where n n is the total number of nodes in the grid of ijkl according to the work of yeh in 1981 the velocity can be represented by linear base functions in each triangular fine element abc of ijkl 14 v ξ f x y v ξ f a n a x y v ξ f b n b x y v ξ f c n c x y ξ x y where v ξ f a v ξ f b v ξ f c ξ x y are the velocities at abc vertexes a b c respectively substituting 14 in the left side of 13 we have 15 ijkl v h f n i dxdy abc v h f n i dxdy i 1 2 n n ξ x y abc v ξ f a n a v ξ f b n b v ξ f c n c n i dxdy abc n i n a dxdyv ξ f a abc n i n b dxdyv ξ f b a b c n i n c d x d y v ξ f c unlike yeh s model the nfvmsfem presents the hydraulic head by multiscale base functions and coarse scale solutions φ according to studies of hou and wu 1997 and he and ren 2005 the fine scale head satisfies the following equation in ijkl 16 h x y φ i ψ i x y φ j ψ j x y φ k ψ k x y φ l ψ l x y where ψ i ψ j ψ k ψ l are multiscale base functions associated with vertexes i j k l respectively and φ i φ j φ k φ l are the coarse scale solutions of h at ijkl vertexes i j k l respectively eq 3 substituting eq 12 and 16 into the right side of 13 the right side item can be written as 17 ijkl k ξ h ξ n i dxdy abc k ξ h ξ n i dxdy i 1 2 n n ξ x y abc k ξ abc φ i ψ i ξ φ j ψ j ξ φ k ψ k ξ φ l ψ l ξ n i dxdy abc θ i j k l abc k ξ abc n i ψ θ a n a ξ ψ θ b n b ξ ψ θ c n c ξ dxdy φ θ where k ξ abc is the hydraulic conductivity in direction ξ for each fine element abc by combining eq 15 and eq 17 the matrix form of eq 13 can be obtained 18 a ξ v ξ f b ξ φ with a ij ξ abc abc n i n j dxdy b i θ ξ abc abc k ξ abc n i ψ θ a n a ξ ψ θ b n b ξ ψ θ c n c ξ dxdy ξ x y where a ξ is the coefficient matrix of the velocity v ξ f is the unknown v ξ f vector b ξ is the coefficient matrix of the head φ is the coarse scale head vector because the number of unknown velocities is n n a ξ is a n n n n matrix ijkl has four vertexes i j k l so that the b ξ is a n n 4 matrix since a ξ is a symmetric and positive definite matrix it is invertible therefore the nfvmsfem can use the coarse head φ and the multiscale base functions to represent the velocity 19 v ξ f a ξ 1 b ξ φ α ξ ijkl φ ξ x y where α ξ ijkl a ξ 1 b ξ are the nfvmsfem velocity matrixes of ijkl since very few fine scale nodes are in each coarse element the cost of the construction of the velocity matrix is very little 5 3 nfvmsfem fine scale form equations we assume that the top bottom left and right boundaries of d i are t bt l and r respectively according to fig 2 the control volume items of eq 9 can be written as flux t i l 1 v x f dy bt 1 v y f dx flux t ii r 1 v x f dy bt 2 v y f dx flux t iii r 2 v x f dy t 2 v y f dx flux t iv l 2 v x f dy t 1 v y f dx where the subscript 1 of boundaries t bt l and r represents the lower or left part of a boundary and the subscript 2 represents the upper or right part of a boundary as mentioned above the d i boundaries are also the fine scale grids lines of the corresponding coarse elements i ii iii iv the flux t i flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv are composed of the fine scale velocities and thus can be represented by the coarse scale heads for illustration according to the velocity matrixes each nodal velocity of coarse element i can be directly represented by the values of φ at i vertexes i e φ τ 1 φ τ 2 φ τ 5 φ τ 4 referring to fig 4 the flux t i can be discretized to the fine scale 20 flux t i l 1 v x f dy bt 1 v y f dx l 11 l 12 a c v x f dy bt 11 bt 12 a b v y f dx l 11 l 12 a c v x f a n a v x f b n b v x f c n c dy bt 11 bt 12 a b v y f a n a v y f b n b v y f c n c dx l 11 l 12 v x f a v x f c δ y 2 bt 11 bt 12 v y f a v y f b δ x 2 l 11 l 12 θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 α a θ x i α c θ x i δ y 2 φ θ bt 11 bt 12 θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 α a θ y i α b θ y i δ x 2 φ θ θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 l 11 l 12 α a θ x i α c θ x i δ y 2 bt 11 bt 12 α a θ y i α b θ y i δ x 2 φ θ θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 β i θ i φ θ where bt 11 bt 12 are the left and right parts of bt 1 respectively l 11 l 12 are the lower and upper parts of boundary l 1 respectively δ x δ y are the horizontal and vertical boundary lengths of abc respectively α a θ x i α c θ x i are the coefficients of φ θ for the v x f a v x f c of the fine elements abc along l 1 which are from velocity matrix α x i α a θ y i α b θ y i are the coefficients of φ θ for the v y f a v y f b of the fine elements abc along bt 1 which are from velocity matrix α y i and β i θ i θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 are the coefficients of φ θ contributed by flux t i similarly the flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv can be represented by φ therefore the fine scale detail of eq 9 is 21 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i θ 1 9 β i θ φ θ w d i where β i θ β i θ i β i θ ii β i θ iii β i θ iv θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 τ 9 are the coefficients contributed by φ θ θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 τ 9 of d i w d i d i wdxdy the scheme of the top boundary node control volumes fig 3 or other boundary node control volumes is similar to the above interior coarse grid node scheme by substituting eq 21 in 10 and combining the eq 10 of all the control volumes the fine scale form of the coarse scale equation system of φ can be obtained 6 nfvmsfem coarse grid line velocity explicit expressions when the head field is obtained the nfvmsfem can immediately obtain continuous fine scale v x f and v y f fields by using the explicit expressions obtained from velocity matrixes similarly the coarse grid line fig 1 thick dashed lines velocities are also obtained by explicit expressions each interior coarse grid node fig 1 thick dashed line intersections is also a coarse element vertex that is contained in four corresponding coarse elements therefore each interior coarse grid nodal fine scale velocity is solved by four different velocity matrixes of four corresponding coarse elements the four values obtained are different from each other and contain the information of four corresponding coarse elements the nfvmsfem averages these values to obtain a unique coarse scale velocity at each interior coarse grid node the obtained coarse scale velocity contains the information of the four corresponding coarse elements for illustration node i is an interior coarse grid node that is also a vertex of coarse elements i ii iii and iv fig 2 denote the values of v x f i obtained by the velocity matrix of i ii iii and iv as v x f i i v x f ii i v x f iii i and v x f iv i respectively since i ii iii and iv are located in different directions of node i the v x f i i v x f ii i v x f iii i and v x f iv i are the limit values approached from the direction of the corresponding coarse element denoting the top and right directions as and the bottom and left directions as we have v x f i i v x f i v x f ii i v x f i v x f iii i v x f i and v x f iv i v x f i therefore we can obtain the expression of coarse grid node i 22 v x i v x f i v x f i v x f i v x f i 4 v x f i i v x f ii i v x f iii i v x f iv i 4 in addition coarse element boundary fine scale nodes are contained by two coarse elements fig 1 vertical intersections of thick and thin dashed lines that are solved twice similarly the nfvmsfem can obtain velocities at coarse element boundary fine scale nodes by averaging the values obtained from the two corresponding velocity matrixes for example the expressions of coarse boundary fine scale nodes a and b of fig 2 are 23 v x f a v x f a v x f a 2 v x f iii a v x f ii a 2 v x f b v x f b v x f b 2 v x f iii b v x f iv b 2 where represents the top and right directions and represents the bottom and left directions similarly the unique velocities of the coarse grid nodes of the study region boundary can also be derived by eq 23 6 1 remark it needs to be remarked that the fine scale velocities and coarse grid velocities are all immediately obtained by explicit expressions eq 19 thus no additional computational process is required and the cost is negligibly little therefore to make the velocities and heads from unknown items to known items only the head equation system needs to be solved thus we claim the nfvmsfem can simultaneously obtain the heads and continuous x y direction darcian velocities 7 numerical verification in this section the nfvmsfem heads are compared with those of the finite volume multiscale finite element method he and ren 2005 and classical linear finite element method the nfvmsfem velocity fields are compared with those of yeh s galerkin model yeh 1981 the effects of different base function boundary conditions in the nfvmsfem are also tested three different examples are proposed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the nfvmsfem including a two dimensional steady flow problem with continuous hydraulic conductivities a two dimensional transient flow problem with gradually changing hydraulic conductivities and a pumping well and a two dimensional steady flow problem with random lognormal hydraulic conductivity fields certain parameters and abbreviations are used hydraulic head h coarse scale nodal darcian velocity in the ξ ξ x y direction v ξ fine scale nodal darcian velocity in the ξ

oscillatory base function boundary condition fvmsfem o fvmsfem with linear base function boundary condition fvmsfem l fvmsfem l computes the head first and then finite difference method computes the fine scale velocity by fvmsfem l heads fvmsfem l plus fdm yeh s finite element model method yeh and method yeh with fine grid mesh method yeh f all the programs used in this section are compiled by c and run under the same conditions the hydraulic conductivity of an element is obtained by averaging the element vertex conductivities in this section the nfvmsfem coarse elements are squares the fine elements of the nfvmsfem lfem and lfem f are isosceles right triangles the horizontal edge lengths of the lfem lfem f elements are the same as that of the nfvmsfem coarse fine elements therefore the lfem element number is double the nfvmsfem coarse element number and the number of lfem f elements is the same as that of the nfvmsfem fine elements yeh s galerkin model employs the finite element method to compute the global head of the study region before the velocity computation therefore the method yeh and method yeh f directly inherit the heads and grids of the lfem and lfem f respectively as a measure of the error we take the relative euclidean norm 24 e 2 1 n i 1 n ξ simulation ξ standard ξ standard 2 1 2 where ξ simulation is the solution obtained by the numerical method ξ standard is the analytical solution or standard solution and n is the number of nodes being considered for the computation of e 2 and the relative error nodes with ξ standard 0 are not considered 7 1 two dimensional steady flow problem with continuous conductivity we consider the 2d steady flow equation 25 k x y h w x y ω where the study region is ω 0 1 0 1 with 0 0 as the lower left corner node to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the nfvmsfem with those of the fvmsfem lfem and method yeh three different continuous hydraulic conductivities are considered k 1 1 represents homogeneous media the k 2 1 x 1 y field decreases from the center to the border and is based on practical basin porous media k 3 1 2 1 99 π sin 3 x y 2 represents heterogeneous porous media and the maximum of k 3 is 399 times the minimum of k 3 dirichlet boundary conditions and source sink term w are specified by the analytical solution h xy xy 2 x 2 y x 2 y 2 the hydraulic heads of this example are solved by the nfvmsfem l fvmsfem l and lfem whose base function boundary conditions are all linear these methods divide each edge of ω into 40 equal parts therefore the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l divide ω into 1600 40 40 square coarse elements and divide each coarse element into 32 4 4 2 triangular fine elements the lfem divides ω into 3200 40 40 2 triangular elements the relative errors of the heads solved by the above methods with k 1 k 2 and k 3 along the section y 0 6 are displayed in fig 5 the accuracies of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are much higher than that of the lfem the results of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are similar and the nfvmsfem l result is slightly better for homogeneous porous media k 1 or basin like porous media k 2 the relative errors of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are all less than 0 1 in heterogeneous porous media k 3 the errors of three methods are higher than those of k 1 and k 2 but the accuracies of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are still much higher than that of the lfem furthermore the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l can obtain 25281 fine scale hydraulic heads by eq 16 which is much more than that of the lfem 1521 the cpu times of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are the same 16 s which is slightly higher than that of the lfem 1 s this result shows the high efficiencies of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l in head computation and the nfvmsfem l velocity matrix construction cost is negligibly little different from fvmsfem and lfem the nfvmsfem can also obtain the x y direction velocity fields 1681 2 coarse scale velocities 25921 2 fine scale velocities simultaneously with heads the nfvmsfem l coarse scale velocities v x and v y are obtained directly by eq 22 and are averages of the corresponding fine scale velocities v x f and v y f obtained through the velocity matrixes eq 19 the nfvmsfem l coarse scale v x and v y of this example are compared with those of the method yeh the method yeh requires the solution for the head prior to the velocity computation and the above lfem head computation is the first part of the method yeh therefore the method yeh inherits the grid and head field of the lfem the absolute errors of the coarse scale v x and v y with k 1 k 2 and k 3 of the nfvmsfem l and method yeh along section y 0 6 are displayed in fig 6 in each subfigure the curve of the nfvmsfem l is below that of the method yeh showing that the nfvmsfem l is more accurate from k 1 to k 3 the distance between the nfvmsfem l and method yeh curves increases with increasing media heterogeneity moreover the curves of the nfvmsfem l are less affected by the hydraulic conductivities than those of the method yeh since the nfvmsfem l does not require additional effort to obtain velocities the cpu time is still 16 s additionally the method yeh requires 1 s for the head 2 s for v x and 2 s for v y totaling 5 s this result shows that the nfvmsfem l is more accurate than the method yeh and can obtain much more number fine scale unknowns while the computational cost is not much higher to investigate the efficiency and numerical convergence of the presented method the nfvmsfem l and method yeh divide each edge of ω into n 1 and n 2 equal parts respectively where n 1 40 50 60 and 70 and n 2 40 50 60 70 and 80 therefore the nfvmsfem l divides ω into n 1 n 1 square coarse elements and the method yeh divides ω into 2 n 2 n 2 triangular elements the nfvmsfem l coarse element is still divided into 4 4 2 triangular elements the cpu time e 2 v x curves of the nfvmsfem l and method yeh with k 1 k 2 and k 3 are displayed in fig 7 where the nodes with analytical v x 0 are not considered in the e 2 v x the cpu time of the nfvmsfem l shown in this figure includes the time for the heads and x y direction velocities at both the coarse scale and fine scale meanwhile the cpu time of the method yeh is only for the coarse scale heads and x direction velocities the curves of the nfvmsfem l are all below those of the method yeh showing that the efficiency of the nfvmsfem l is higher when n 1 n 2 the e 2 v x of the method yeh are several times those of the nfvmsfem l when n 1 n 2 20 the e 2 v x of the nfvmsfem l and method yeh are similar to each other while the nfvmsfem l cpu time is lower when n 2 90 the e 2 v x of the method yeh with k 1 k 2 and k 3 are 2 2265e 3 2 2281e 3 and 7 280e 03 respectively which are still higher than those of the nfvmsfem l n 1 70 these results show that the nfvmsfem l can achieve better accuracy than the method yeh with similar cpu time furthermore the e 2 v x of the nfvmsfem l decreases when n 1 increases showing that the nfvmsfem l is numerically convergent the curves of both the nfvmsfem l and method yeh decrease quickly at the beginning and then gradually change and the slope of nfvmsfem curve is lower than that of method yeh when n 1 n 2 this result shows that the accuracy of the nfvmsfem l is less affected as the grid becomes finer the fine scale velocities with k 2 obtained by the nfvmsfem l are compared with those of the method yeh f and fvmsfem l plus fdm the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l employ the grid in the head computation i e 40 40 coarse elements and 4 4 2 fine elements for each coarse element the finite difference method fdm uses the grid of fvmsfem l the method yeh f divides ω into 51200 160 160 2 triangular elements since the nfvmsfem l and method yeh f divide the study region into the same number of fine elements the numbers of fine scale velocities are the same the velocities obtained by the method yeh f nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm in a coarse element ke are presented in table 1 and table 2 where ke is a 0 025 0 025 square with node 0 8 0 675 as the left lower vertex table 1 lists the v x f at the ke interior nodes the relative errors of the nfvmsfem l v x f are all lower than 2 3 but are slightly higher than those of the method yeh f this difference occurs because the velocities of the method yeh f are calculated in the global grid 160 160 2 while the nfvmsfem l computes v x f by the velocity matrix constructed in the local coarse element grid 4 4 2 since the heterogeneity of k 2 is not high the v x f of nfvmsfem l is only slightly better than fvmsfem l plus fdm their average relative errors of ke interior nodes table 1 are 1 45 and 1 54 meanwhile if the permeability is k 3 the average relative errors of ke interior nodes of nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm increases to 3 67 and 4 55 it can be seen that the gap and ratio between nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm relative errors increases with the permeability becomes more heterogeneous table 2 lists the ke coarse grid line nodal velocities calculated by the nfvmsfem l method yeh f and fvmsfem l plus fdm with k 2 the upper part is the ke boundary nodal v x f and the lower part is the ke vertex nodal v x coarse scale velocity in this table the nfvmsfem l velocities are similar to those of the method yeh f and are more accurate than those of the nfvmsfem l ke interior nodal v x f in table 1 meanwhile the average relative errors of ke coarse grid line nodes table 2 of nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm are 0 57 and 3 15 respectively it can be seen that the gap and ratio between nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm relative errors is much larger than those of table 1 these differences occur because the velocities at the nfvmsfem coarse grid line nodes contain more information than those at the coarse element interior nodes the upper part velocities contain the information of two coarse elements and the lower part velocities contain the information of four coarse elements see section 6 furthermore the method yeh f costs 4927 s for the heads and 5437 s for x direction velocities i e 10364 s the cpu time of the nfvmsfem l for head and x y direction velocities is only 16 s and the cpu time of the fvmsfem l plus fdm for head and x direction velocity is 16s this result shows that the nfvmsfem l can obtain the same number x direction velocities as the method yeh f with a much lower computation cost 7 2 two dimensional transient flow problem with gradually changing conductivity and pumping well in this example the simulation of transient flow with gradually changing hydraulic conductivity is considered this example describes the practical alluvial plains situation which is based on the example of the work of ye et al 2004 the problem equation is eq 1 and the study region is ω 0 10000 m 0 10000 m the hydraulic conductivity changes gradually i e k 1 x 20 m day the specific storage is s 10 6 m and the thickness of the aquifer is 1 m there is a pumping well at point 6000 m 6000 m with a constant flow rate of 100 m day the total pumping time is 6 days and the time step is 1 day the top and bottom boundaries are impermeable the heads on the left boundary are 10 m and those at the right boundary are 0 m the hydraulic head field is solved by the lfem f nfvmsfem o nfvmsfem l fvmsfem o fvmsfem l and lfem the nfvmsfem fvmsfem and lfem divide the boundary of the study region into 40 equal parts therefore the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem divide the study region into 1600 40 40 square coarse elements and each coarse element is divided into 32 triangular fine elements the lfem divides the study region into 3200 40 40 2 triangular elements the lfem f divides the study region into 51 200 160 160 2 triangular fine elements to obtain the same number of fine elements as the nfvmsfem since this example does not have an analytical solution the lfem f with 204 800 320 320 2 triangular fine elements is denoted as standard solution the hydraulic heads along the section y 6000 m are represented in fig 8 the curves of the lfem f nfvmsfem o and fvmsfem o are almost coincident and the accuracies of these methods are higher than those of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l the accuracy of the lfem is the worst this result shows that oscillatory base function boundary conditions can improve the accuracy of the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem in the well area the lfem f nfvmsfem o and fvmsfem o achieve similar results though the lfem f is slightly better meanwhile the cpu times of the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem are the same 98 s showing that the construction of the nfvmsfem velocity matrixes costs very little moreover the cpu times of the lfem f and lfem are 30 815 s and 9 s respectively the results show that the nfvmsfem o can obtain the same number 25 599 of heads as the lfem f with slightly lower accuracy while only using approximately 0 3 of the cpu time the nfvmsfem o is more accurate than the lfem obtaining 24000 more head unknowns with only 89 s more time the nfvmsfem can also compute the x y direction velocities 1681 2 for the coarse scale and 25921 2 for the fine scale simultaneously with the head this result shows the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem the nfvmsfem can simultaneously obtain the velocities with head in above head computation process the nfvmsfem o v x are compared with those of the method yeh and method yeh f and the nfvmsfem o v x f are compared with those of the method yeh f the method yeh employs the grid of the lfem i e a 40 40 2 grid the method yeh f employs the grids of the lfem f i e a 160 160 2 grid and a 320 320 2 grid for the standard solution fig 9 presents the v x of the standard solution method yeh f nfvmsfem o and method yeh along the section y 6000 m the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o is very similar to that of the method yeh f and is higher than that of the method yeh in the vicinity of the well area the nfvmsfem o is slightly less accurate than the method yeh f but still much more accurate than the method yeh the fine scale v x f in the vicinity of the well area along the section y 6125 m of the nfvmsfem o and method yeh f are shown in fig 10 as shown the nfvmsfem o and method yeh f achieve similar and highly accurate results and the accuracy of the method yeh f is only slightly higher meanwhile the nfvmsfem costs much less than the method yeh f the method yeh f costs 30 815 s for the heads and 5399 s for v x while the nfvmsfem o only costs 98 s to obtain the heads and the x y direction velocities at both the coarse scale and fine scale the v x is only computed once on the 6th day thus the time spent by the method yeh f for the velocity is much lower than that for the head compared with the result of example 1 the cpu time gap between the nfvmsfem and method yeh f is larger this result shows the nfvmsfem can save more computation cost when simulating the transient flow problem 7 3 two dimensional steady flow problem with random lognormal conductivity fields the problem considered in this example is defined by eq 25 the study region is ω 0 1000 0 1000 and the source sink term w is 0 the top and bottom boundaries are impermeable the heads at the left boundary are 16 and those at the right boundary are 11 the hydraulic conductivity k fields are generated on a uniform 400 400 grid by the sequential gaussian simulation function geostatistical software library by deutsch and journel 1998 six different variances σ 2 of lnk are considered where σ 2 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 4 the media becomes more heterogeneous when σ 2 increases σ 2 0 5 represents weak heterogeneous porous media and σ 2 1 represents moderate heterogeneous media similar to the work of bellin et al 1992 this example considers the correlation length i y 200 to be the reference for the lengths we denote the ratio of the element horizontal edge length l to the correlation length i y as δ l i y the δ of the nfvmsfem coarse elements and fine elements are expressed as δ c and δ f respectively in this example the nfvmsfem o employs three different grids grid 1 δ c 0 2 σ 2 0 5 or 0 05 σ 2 1 δ f δ c 4 grid 2 δ c 0 2 σ 2 0 5 or 0 05 σ 2 1 δ f δ c 2 grid 3 δ c 0 5 σ 2 0 5 or 0 2 σ 2 1 δ f δ c 2 grids 1 and 2 have the same study region divisions same δ c and grids 2 and 3 have the same coarse element subdivisions δ f δ c 2 from grid 1 to grid 3 the mesh becomes coarser the fvmsfem o has the same grid as grid 1 of the nfvmsfem o thus the nfvmsfem o and fvmsfem o corresponding to grid 1 are denoted group 1 based on grids 2 and 3 the grids of the lfem f and lfem are generated the horizontal edge length of the lfem lfem f element is the same as that of the nfvmsfem coarse fine element i e the lfem δ δ c and the lfem f δ δ f therefore the lfem element number is double the nfvmsfem coarse element number and the number of lfem f elements is the same as that of the nfvmsfem fine elements for convenience the nfvmsfem o lfem f and lfem corresponding to grid 2 are denoted group 2 and those corresponding to grid 3 are denoted group 3 this example does not have an analytical solution so the lfem f with 320 000 400 400 2 triangular fine elements is denoted the standard solution the hydraulic heads are solved by the nfvmsfem o fvmsfem o lfem f and lfem the relative errors of the heads along the section y 600 of these methods are presented in fig 11 fig 11 a shows the weak heterogeneous situation where the grids of each method are coarser than those in fig 11 b f in fig 11 a the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 05 group 1 achieves the best result which is better than those of the fvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 05 group 1 and lfem f δ 0 1 group 2 in group 2 the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 1 is slightly lower than that of the lfem f δ 0 1 but is much better than that of the lfem δ 0 2 as for the group 3 methods the accuracy from high to low is nfvmsfem o δ c 0 5 δ f 0 25 lfem f δ 0 25 and lfem δ 0 5 in the same group the results show that the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o is similar to that of the lfem f δ δ f and better than that of the lfem δ δ c comparing the results of the nfvmsfem o of groups 1 2 and 3 both the study region and coarse element refinement can help the nfvmsfem o to improve the accuracy fig 11 b f present moderate heterogeneous situations where the coordinate axes are the same the errors of all the methods become higher when σ 2 increases and finer grids can reduce the oscillations of the curves similar to fig 11 a the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 achieves the best result in groups 2 and 3 the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o is still very similar to that of the lfem f δ δ f and better than that of the lfem δ δ c in addition the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 1 appears in all the subfigures and its relative errors are all lower than 0 7 this result indicates that the nfvmsfem o can deal with random lognormal conductivity fields well meanwhile the nfvmsfem o group 1 achieves the best results and most unknowns for the head computation and achieves the high efficiency for illustration when σ 2 2 the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 achieves the best head accuracy in fig 11 d with 1120 s it not only solves 9999 99 101 coarse scale heads and 159999 fine scale heads 399 401 but also solves the x y direction coarse scale velocities 10201 2 and fine scale velocities 160 801 2 simultaneously with the heads however the fvmsfem o lfem f and lfem can only obtain the head fields the fvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 costs the same 1120 s to obtain 9999 coarse scale heads and 159999 fine scale heads the lfem f δ 0 025 group 2 costs 19564 s for 39999 199 201 heads and the lfem δ 0 05 group 2 costs 308 s for 9999 99 101 heads these results show the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem in solving lognormal conductivity field groundwater flow problems the v x obtained by the nfvmsfem o is then compared with those of the method yeh and method yeh f the method yeh and method yeh f inherit the grids and heads of the lfem and lfem f of group 2 which are also denoted group 2 methods therefore the horizontal edge length of the method yeh element is the same as that of the nfvmsfem o grid 2 coarse element δ δ c and the horizontal edge length of the method yeh f is the same as that of the nfvmsfem o grid 2 fine elements δ δ f the v x of the nfvmsfem o method yeh f and method yeh along the section y 600 are presented in fig 12 the half up solid triangle symbol hollow triangle symbol and half down solid triangle symbol stand for the nfvmsfem group 1 nfvmsfem group 2 and nfvmsfem group 3 respectively in fig 12 the nfvmsfem o group 1 nfvmsfem o group 2 and method yeh f group 2 achieve similar accuracies and their accuracies from high to low are the method yeh f group 2 nfvmsfem o group 1 and nfvmsfem o group 2 these results occur because the method yeh f group 2 computes the velocity field in the 200 200 global grid and the velocity matrixes of the nfvmsfem o group 1 and nfvmsfem o group 2 are generated in the 4 4 and 2 2 local coarse element grids respectively meanwhile the nfvmsfem o group 2 is more accurate and less oscillatory than the method yeh group 2 though the grid of the nfvmsfem o group 3 is much coarser than those of the other methods in fig 12 the nfvmsfem o group 3 can still describe the similar variation tendencies of the standard solution furthermore the results of the nfvmsfem o for groups 1 2 and 3 suggest that refinements of both the coarse grid and fine grid can decrease numerical errors and thus the nfvmsfem is numerically convergent in addition all the methods only need a coarse grid for the weak heterogeneous situation σ 2 0 5 when σ 2 1 the nfvmsfem o method yeh f and method yeh require grid refinement to describe the media well in fig 12 b to f the increase in σ 2 leads to larger oscillations and errors for all these methods but the nfvmsfem o group 1 nfvmsfem o group 2 and method yeh f group 2 are less affected this result demonstrates the effectiveness of the nfvmsfem o for moderate heterogeneous situations furthermore the nfvmsfem o velocities are simultaneously obtained with heads for illustration when σ 2 2 the cpu time of the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 is still 1120 s while its v x accuracy is only slightly lower than that of the method yeh f and is much higher than that of the method yeh as mentioned above the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 achieves 9999 coarse scale heads 159999 fine scale heads 10201 2 coarse scale velocities and 160801 2 fine scale velocities in this example meanwhile the method yeh f δ 0 025 group 2 costs 19564 s for 39999 heads and 19771 s for 40401 velocities in only the x direction the method yeh δ 0 05 group 2 costs 308 s for 9999 heads and 337 s for 10201 velocities in only the x direction this result demonstrates the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem o 8 conclusion this paper proposes a new finite volume multiscale finite element model nfvmsfem for simultaneously solving groundwater flow and velocity fields in porous media the main idea of this method is to introduce novel local velocity matrixes in the control volume boundary flux computation of the fvmsfem framework and thus present the x y direction velocities directly by coarse scale heads and multiscale base functions the velocity matrixes are constructed through a modified yeh s galerkin model such that the continuity and mass balance of the velocity can be ensured the nfvmsfem inherits the advantages of the fvmsfem and thus the heads obtained satisfy mass conservation therefore the nfvmsfem can compute the head and the x y direction velocities with high accuracy and efficiency which simplifies groundwater simulation and saves much computational costs in the numerical verification the nfvmsfem flow fields are compared with those of the fvmsfem lfem and lfem f the nfvmsfem velocity fields are compared with those of the method yeh and method yeh f the scale of the lfem lfem f is the same as the coarse fine scale of the nfvmsfem the method yeh and method yeh f inherit the grid and heads of the lfem and lfem f respectively three different situations i e a steady flow problem with continuous conductivity a transient flow problem with gradually changing conductivity and a pumping well alluvial plain and a steady flow problem with random lognormal conductivity fields are tested the results show that the nfvmsfem can deal with the above situations well while achieving high accuracy and efficiency the nfvmsfem is more accurate than the lfem for the head computation even with only the employment of linear base function boundary conditions similar to the fvmsfem and msfem the nfvmsfem is very sensitive to the base function boundary conditions and the oscillatory base function conditions lead to much better results the nfvmsfem o achieves an accuracy similar to that of the lfem f which is slightly better than that of the fvmsfem meanwhile the nfvmsfem can obtain the same number of fine scale heads as the lfem f while saving more than 99 in cpu time the cpu time values of the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem are the same showing that the construction of velocity matrixes costs very little furthermore the nfvmsfem can compute the x y direction coarse and fine scale velocities simultaneously with the hydraulic heads without any additional cost since the method yeh and method yeh f require lfem to obtain the head field prior and can only solve one direction velocity at a one time the nfvmsfem is more convenient the results show that the nfvmsfem is numerically convergent and its coarse scale velocities are more accurate than those of the method yeh the results also show that the efficiency of the nfvmsfem is much higher than that of the method yeh even though the method yeh considers the computation time of the velocity in only one direction in addition the nfvmsfem can obtain the x y direction fine scale velocities and the number of each direction fine scale velocities is the same as that of the method yeh f the nfvmsfem o fine scale velocity accuracy is only slightly lower than that of the method yeh f in the three examples showing that the nfvmsfem can deal with groundwater media well the cpu time gap between the nfvmsfem and method yeh f is much larger than that between the nfvmsfem and lfem f even though the method yeh f considers the computation time for the velocity in only one direction this result indicates the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem in summary the nfvmsfem can compute groundwater flow and velocity fields with high efficiency in different porous media while achieving high accuracy our study is limited to two dimensional groundwater simulation in porous media additionally the features of the fvmsfem framework and yeh s model make the nfvmsfem inapplicable to flow problems in highly heterogeneous media such as discontinuous media and channelized systems future studies will be conducted to extend the nfvmsfem to three dimensional problems and to explore the application of the algorithm to highly heterogeneous conductivities

6536,this paper proposes a new finite volume multiscale finite element model nfvmsfem for groundwater flow and velocity simulation in porous media the main goal of this method is to simultaneously obtain the heads and continuous x y direction darcian velocities thereby simplifying the simulation process and improving the efficiency this goal is accomplished by introducing a novel velocity matrix in the control volume boundary flux estimation of the finite volume multiscale finite element method fvmsfem framework the velocity matrix allows for the nfvmsfem to directly represent continuous fine scale velocities by coarse scale heads thus merging the two kinds of unknowns into one through a modified yeh s galerkin model the velocity matrix is constructed in each local coarse element before the head computation thus the computational cost is very little furthermore the nfvmsfem inherits the advantageous features of the fvmsfem which ensures the local conservation of heads and further improves the efficiency the results of the comparison between the nfvmsfem and certain classical methods for head and velocity computation demonstrate its effectiveness and high efficiency keywords multiscale numerical method velocity matrix continuous velocity computational efficiency 1 introduction the accurate and efficient computation of both the flow field and continuous velocity field are crucial for studying groundwater flow and solute transport problems in heterogeneous porous media however the heterogeneity of natural groundwater systems usually leads to certain issues in the simulation of the head and velocity first the computational cost is too high for classical methods to resolve fine scale features especially in large spatial scale or temporal scale problems ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 massoudieh 2013 chaudhuri and ale 2014 luo et al 2016 second media heterogeneity makes it difficult for many classical methods to ensure the continuity of the darcian velocity which has a great influence on the accuracy of the velocity field zhang et al 1994 zhou et al 2001 et al 2012 xie et al 2017a meanwhile the velocity computation suffers the same high computational cost issues as the head computation third most numerical methods compute the head and velocity field separately or compute them together by iteration which leads to complex computation processes and high computational costs here we propose a new finite volume multiscale finite element method model nfvmsfem to resolve these issues by combining the multiscale finite element method msfem finite volume method fvm and yeh s galerkin finite element model the msfem is developed to resolve the high computational cost of the finite element method the main idea is to construct multiscale base functions by solving the reduced elliptical equation in each coarse element to capture the fine scale behavior of the equations in the coarse scale system hou and wu 1997 ye et al 2004 many multiscale finite element methods have been developed such as the mixed msfem mmsfem chen and hou 2003 aarnes 2004 chung et al 2015 the multiscale finite volume method msfvm jenny et al 2003 dehkordi and manzari 2013 the finite volume multiscale finite element method fvmsfem he and ren 2005 the generalized msfem efendiev et al 2013 chung et al 2014 chung et al 2016 chung et al 2016 and the efficient triple grid multiscale finite element method xie et al 2016 2017a among them only the mmsfem and msfvm can obtain conservative fine scale velocity fields the mmsfem combines the msfem and raviart thomas mixed element method and computes the head and velocity together by iteration chen and hou 2003 the msfvm employs locally computed basis functions to construct the coarse scale system and then considers additional local neumann problems to obtain the velocity field jenny et al 2003 wang et al 2014 the iterative msfvm extends the range to highly heterogeneous anisotropic elliptic problems by introducing correction functions to reduce the msfvm localization errors systematically and can reconstruct the velocity field after any iteration hajibeygi et al 2008 based on the msfvm a series of multiscale solvers are developed to extend the application range to more complex conditions such as incompressible heterogeneous flow wang et al 2014 and fractured porous media hajibeygi et al 2011 shah et al 2016 ţene et al 2016 the fvmsfem introduced by he and ren 2005 is a different fvm msfem based scheme that is more simple and straightforward the fvmsfem employs cell centered fvm at a coarse scale and estimates the control volume boundary fluxes by msfem base functions to capture the local fine scale information in addition the fvmsfem can ensure the local conservation of the head field and hence outperform the msfem in terms of accuracy however the fvmsfem itself lacks an effective continuous velocity scheme which limits its application the galerkin model developed by yeh 1981 can obtain a continuous velocity field after the flow field is derived by the finite element method unlike the mixed finite element methods this model does not need iteration and its equation system can be ensured to be positive definite zhou et al 2001 zhang et al 1994 moreover yeh s model can ensure the mass balance of the velocity and is more accurate and applicable than other head solved first methods yeh 1981 zhang et al 1994 xie et al 2017b many studies have shown that yeh s model can obtain a globally continuous velocity field in heterogeneous porous media boufadel et al 1999 jang and aral 2007 park and aral 2007 recently researchers introduced effective modifications of yeh s model to make it satisfy the refraction law along material interfaces zhou et al 2001 xie et al 2017b limited by the finite element framework the computational cost of yeh s model is significant high in heterogeneous porous media the nfvmsfem in the current study is able to simultaneously compute groundwater flow and velocity fields with high efficiency and accuracy different from other fvm msfem based methods the nfvmsfem aims to develop a more convenient and efficient way to accurately compute the head and velocity simultaneously that is capable of simplifying the groundwater simulation and saving computational efforts through a modified yeh s model novel velocity matrixes are constructed in coarse elements to represent the x y direction velocities by using the coarse scale head solution and multiscale base functions since each coarse element only contains very few nodes the cost of the construction of the velocity matrix is relative low then the nfvmsfem employs the velocity matrixes to replace the original finite difference scheme of the fvmsfem control volume boundary flux framework before the head computation therefore the nfvmsfem can merge the head and x y direction velocity computations which is convenient additionally yeh s principle can ensure the continuity of the velocity which leads to a more accurate control volume boundary fluxes meanwhile the nfvmsfem inherits advantageous features of the fvmsfem making it much more efficient than the finite element method and mass conservation of the heads is ensured to demonstrate its performance the nfvmsfem is compared with certain classical methods in three different situations for head computation the nfvmsfem solutions are comparable with those of the fine grid finite element method and fvmsfem and better than that of the coarse grid finite element method meanwhile the nfvmsfem can obtain the x y direction coarse scale and fine scale velocity fields without additional cost even when only one direction velocity computation is considered the computation efficiency and accuracy of the nfvmsfem coarse scale velocity are higher than those of the coarse grid yeh s model in particular the nfvmsfem can use less than 1 of the cpu time of the fine grid yeh s model to obtain the same number of fine scale velocities 2 governing equations the two dimensional transient groundwater flow equation can be written as 1 s h t k x y h w x y ω where h is the hydraulic head w is the source sink term s is the specific storage coefficient ω is the study region and k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor the local darcy s equations of each coarse element ijkl fig 1 are 2 v ξ f k ξ h ξ ξ x y where k ξ is the hydraulic conductivity in direction ξ ξ x y h is fine scale form of hydraulic head h and v ξ f is the fine scale velocity of ijkl in direction ξ ξ x y the nfvmsfem is designed to simultaneously compute the solutions for the groundwater flow eq 1 and all the coarse element local eq 2 with high efficiency and accuracy at the coarse scale the nfvmsfem employs the fvm to eq 1 to obtain the mass conservation equation system of head to obtain the fine scale form of this equation system the nfvmsfem applies a modified yeh s galerkin finite element model to eq 2 in every coarse element ijkl to construct the novel velocity matrixes the velocity matrixes allow for the nfvmsfem to represent continuous control volume boundary flux items directly by coarse scale heads and multiscale base functions thus to embed eq 2 into this head equation system therefore the nfvmsfem can obtain the head and velocity fields in one computation the detailed process of the nfvmsfem is introduced for a two dimensional transient groundwater flow problem in the following sections 3 grid subdivision process 1 the principle governing process 1 is the same as that of the msfem subdivision first the nfvmsfem employs axis parallel lines thick dashed lines to divide ω into rectangular coarse scale elements then the nfvmsfem divides each coarse element into triangular fine elements thin dashed lines in fig 1 a sample coarse element ijkl red dashed lines is divided into 32 fine triangular elements it is assumed that the coarse elements presented in this paper are squares with edge length l process 2 the process 2 is a fvm subdivision we assume that the total number of unknown nodes of the study region is nu d i is the control volume corresponding to i i 1 2 nu the nfvmsfem generates control volumes by connecting the center nodes of the coarse elements corresponding to an unknown coarse grid node thin solid lines for example we assume that node i is an interior node of the process 1 coarse scale grid a sample control volume d i x i l 2 x i l 2 y i l 2 y i l 2 with the edge length l is presented in fig 1 abcd in fig 2 the relationship between d i and its corresponding coarse elements can be seen clearly moreover if node i is an unknown boundary node of the process 1 coarse scale grid the area of the control volume is half of that generated from the interior node i e d i x i l 2 x i l 2 y i l 2 y i fig 3 4 nfvmsfem coarse scale scheme the nfvmsfem employs the fvm to obtain the coarse scale equation system of eq 1 according to the work of he and ren 2005 the coarse scale state variables corresponding to hydraulic head h are denoted as φ x y t in each control volume d i i 1 2 nu we have 3 φ i 1 d i d i hdxdy where d i is the area of control volume d i as in the work of he and ren 2005 φ i φ x i y i t is also called as the coarse solution of head at node i φ i satisfies the following equation 4 d φ i dt 1 d i d i h t dxdy integrating both sides of eq 1 over each control volume d i we have 5 s d i d i h t dxdy d i k x y hdxdy d i wdxdy where s d i is the specific storage coefficient of d i which is a constant the value of s d i is the average value of s at the vertexes of d i substituting eq 4 into eq 5 we have 6 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i d i k x y hdxdy d i wdxdy applying the divergence theorem to eq 6 we obtain 7 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i d i n k x y hd γ d i wdxdy where n is the out normal vector of d i for simplicity we assume that k k x 0 0 k y in the interior node control volume d i fig 2 combining eq 2 the right hand item of eq 7 can be presented by the fine scale velocities 8 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i d i k x h x dy k y h y dx d i wdxdy 1 s d i d i b c k x h x dy a d k x h x dy d c k y h y dx a b k y h y dx d i wdxdy 1 s d i d i b c v x f dy a d v x f dy d c v y f dx a b v y f dx d i wdxdy where v x f and v y f are fine scale velocities that can be represented by φ and multiscale base functions by velocity matrixes the construction of the velocity matrixes is presented in the next section the control volume d i is contained in the four corresponding coarse elements of i the fluxes across d i can be discretized into the flux items of coarse elements i ii iii iv fig 2 therefore eq 8 can be written as 9 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i flux t i flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv d i wdxdy where flux t i flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv are the control volume boundary flux items contributed by the corresponding coarse elements i ii iii iv respectively the fine scale details of these control volume boundary flux items are presented in the next section the euler method or other methods can be used to discretize eq 9 as in the fvmsfem he and ren 2005 this paper employs the crank nicolson method to discretize eq 9 by assuming that the time step is δ t and t k k δ t we obtain the equation for control volume d i 10 φ i k 1 φ i k δ t 2 g i t k g i t k 1 where φ i k 1 and φ i k are the numerical approximations of φ i t k 1 and φ i t k respectively and g i t k and g i t k 1 are the right hand sides of 9 at times t k and t k 1 respectively the scheme for the top boundary node control volumes fig 3 or the other boundary node control volumes is similar to the above interior coarse grid node scheme by combining eq 10 of all the control volumes d i i 1 2 nu the coarse scale form of the equation system of φ can be obtained by solving this equation system the coarse scale head solution φ can be derived 5 nfvmsfem fine scale scheme before the coarse scale equations are discretized to fine scale the multiscale base functions and velocity matrixes of each coarse element must be constructed through the velocity matrixes the nfvmsfem can obtain the relationship between the fine scale velocity unknowns and φ unknowns merging the two kinds unknowns into one then the nfvmsfem can discretize the coarse scale equations to fine scale schemes by using the velocity matrixes thus the darcy eq 2 can be embedded in the equation system of flow eq 1 therefore the nfvmsfem can obtain φ v x f and v y f simultaneously 5 1 construction of multiscale base functions according to the work of hou and wu 1997 the multiscale base function ψ θ θ i j k l satisfies the reduced elliptical problem of each coarse element ijkl fig 1 red dashed lines 11 k ψ θ 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor and the boundary conditions of ψ θ can be obtained by linear or oscillatory boundary conditions hou and wu 1997 ye et al 2004 he and ren 2005 ψ θ can be represented by linear base functions in each fine element abc of ijkl hou and wu 1997 12 ψ θ x y ψ θ a n a x y ψ θ b n b x y ψ θ c n c x y where ψ θ a ψ θ b ψ θ c are the values of ψ θ at abc vertexes a b c respectively we apply the galerkin approach to eq 11 and combine eq 12 obtaining the equation system of ψ θ by solving this equation system the unknown values of ψ θ at the interior nodes can be obtained 5 2 construction of velocity matrixes in each coarse element ijkl fig 1 red dashed lines the velocity satisfies the local darcy s eq 2 multiplying both sides of eq 2 by linear base function n i and integrating over ijkl the weak formulation of darcy s law can be obtained 13 ijkl v ξ f n i dxdy ijkl k ξ h ξ n i dxdy i 1 2 n n ξ x y where n n is the total number of nodes in the grid of ijkl according to the work of yeh in 1981 the velocity can be represented by linear base functions in each triangular fine element abc of ijkl 14 v ξ f x y v ξ f a n a x y v ξ f b n b x y v ξ f c n c x y ξ x y where v ξ f a v ξ f b v ξ f c ξ x y are the velocities at abc vertexes a b c respectively substituting 14 in the left side of 13 we have 15 ijkl v h f n i dxdy abc v h f n i dxdy i 1 2 n n ξ x y abc v ξ f a n a v ξ f b n b v ξ f c n c n i dxdy abc n i n a dxdyv ξ f a abc n i n b dxdyv ξ f b a b c n i n c d x d y v ξ f c unlike yeh s model the nfvmsfem presents the hydraulic head by multiscale base functions and coarse scale solutions φ according to studies of hou and wu 1997 and he and ren 2005 the fine scale head satisfies the following equation in ijkl 16 h x y φ i ψ i x y φ j ψ j x y φ k ψ k x y φ l ψ l x y where ψ i ψ j ψ k ψ l are multiscale base functions associated with vertexes i j k l respectively and φ i φ j φ k φ l are the coarse scale solutions of h at ijkl vertexes i j k l respectively eq 3 substituting eq 12 and 16 into the right side of 13 the right side item can be written as 17 ijkl k ξ h ξ n i dxdy abc k ξ h ξ n i dxdy i 1 2 n n ξ x y abc k ξ abc φ i ψ i ξ φ j ψ j ξ φ k ψ k ξ φ l ψ l ξ n i dxdy abc θ i j k l abc k ξ abc n i ψ θ a n a ξ ψ θ b n b ξ ψ θ c n c ξ dxdy φ θ where k ξ abc is the hydraulic conductivity in direction ξ for each fine element abc by combining eq 15 and eq 17 the matrix form of eq 13 can be obtained 18 a ξ v ξ f b ξ φ with a ij ξ abc abc n i n j dxdy b i θ ξ abc abc k ξ abc n i ψ θ a n a ξ ψ θ b n b ξ ψ θ c n c ξ dxdy ξ x y where a ξ is the coefficient matrix of the velocity v ξ f is the unknown v ξ f vector b ξ is the coefficient matrix of the head φ is the coarse scale head vector because the number of unknown velocities is n n a ξ is a n n n n matrix ijkl has four vertexes i j k l so that the b ξ is a n n 4 matrix since a ξ is a symmetric and positive definite matrix it is invertible therefore the nfvmsfem can use the coarse head φ and the multiscale base functions to represent the velocity 19 v ξ f a ξ 1 b ξ φ α ξ ijkl φ ξ x y where α ξ ijkl a ξ 1 b ξ are the nfvmsfem velocity matrixes of ijkl since very few fine scale nodes are in each coarse element the cost of the construction of the velocity matrix is very little 5 3 nfvmsfem fine scale form equations we assume that the top bottom left and right boundaries of d i are t bt l and r respectively according to fig 2 the control volume items of eq 9 can be written as flux t i l 1 v x f dy bt 1 v y f dx flux t ii r 1 v x f dy bt 2 v y f dx flux t iii r 2 v x f dy t 2 v y f dx flux t iv l 2 v x f dy t 1 v y f dx where the subscript 1 of boundaries t bt l and r represents the lower or left part of a boundary and the subscript 2 represents the upper or right part of a boundary as mentioned above the d i boundaries are also the fine scale grids lines of the corresponding coarse elements i ii iii iv the flux t i flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv are composed of the fine scale velocities and thus can be represented by the coarse scale heads for illustration according to the velocity matrixes each nodal velocity of coarse element i can be directly represented by the values of φ at i vertexes i e φ τ 1 φ τ 2 φ τ 5 φ τ 4 referring to fig 4 the flux t i can be discretized to the fine scale 20 flux t i l 1 v x f dy bt 1 v y f dx l 11 l 12 a c v x f dy bt 11 bt 12 a b v y f dx l 11 l 12 a c v x f a n a v x f b n b v x f c n c dy bt 11 bt 12 a b v y f a n a v y f b n b v y f c n c dx l 11 l 12 v x f a v x f c δ y 2 bt 11 bt 12 v y f a v y f b δ x 2 l 11 l 12 θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 α a θ x i α c θ x i δ y 2 φ θ bt 11 bt 12 θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 α a θ y i α b θ y i δ x 2 φ θ θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 l 11 l 12 α a θ x i α c θ x i δ y 2 bt 11 bt 12 α a θ y i α b θ y i δ x 2 φ θ θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 β i θ i φ θ where bt 11 bt 12 are the left and right parts of bt 1 respectively l 11 l 12 are the lower and upper parts of boundary l 1 respectively δ x δ y are the horizontal and vertical boundary lengths of abc respectively α a θ x i α c θ x i are the coefficients of φ θ for the v x f a v x f c of the fine elements abc along l 1 which are from velocity matrix α x i α a θ y i α b θ y i are the coefficients of φ θ for the v y f a v y f b of the fine elements abc along bt 1 which are from velocity matrix α y i and β i θ i θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 5 τ 4 are the coefficients of φ θ contributed by flux t i similarly the flux t ii flux t iii flux t iv can be represented by φ therefore the fine scale detail of eq 9 is 21 d φ i dt 1 s d i d i θ 1 9 β i θ φ θ w d i where β i θ β i θ i β i θ ii β i θ iii β i θ iv θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 τ 9 are the coefficients contributed by φ θ θ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 τ 9 of d i w d i d i wdxdy the scheme of the top boundary node control volumes fig 3 or other boundary node control volumes is similar to the above interior coarse grid node scheme by substituting eq 21 in 10 and combining the eq 10 of all the control volumes the fine scale form of the coarse scale equation system of φ can be obtained 6 nfvmsfem coarse grid line velocity explicit expressions when the head field is obtained the nfvmsfem can immediately obtain continuous fine scale v x f and v y f fields by using the explicit expressions obtained from velocity matrixes similarly the coarse grid line fig 1 thick dashed lines velocities are also obtained by explicit expressions each interior coarse grid node fig 1 thick dashed line intersections is also a coarse element vertex that is contained in four corresponding coarse elements therefore each interior coarse grid nodal fine scale velocity is solved by four different velocity matrixes of four corresponding coarse elements the four values obtained are different from each other and contain the information of four corresponding coarse elements the nfvmsfem averages these values to obtain a unique coarse scale velocity at each interior coarse grid node the obtained coarse scale velocity contains the information of the four corresponding coarse elements for illustration node i is an interior coarse grid node that is also a vertex of coarse elements i ii iii and iv fig 2 denote the values of v x f i obtained by the velocity matrix of i ii iii and iv as v x f i i v x f ii i v x f iii i and v x f iv i respectively since i ii iii and iv are located in different directions of node i the v x f i i v x f ii i v x f iii i and v x f iv i are the limit values approached from the direction of the corresponding coarse element denoting the top and right directions as and the bottom and left directions as we have v x f i i v x f i v x f ii i v x f i v x f iii i v x f i and v x f iv i v x f i therefore we can obtain the expression of coarse grid node i 22 v x i v x f i v x f i v x f i v x f i 4 v x f i i v x f ii i v x f iii i v x f iv i 4 in addition coarse element boundary fine scale nodes are contained by two coarse elements fig 1 vertical intersections of thick and thin dashed lines that are solved twice similarly the nfvmsfem can obtain velocities at coarse element boundary fine scale nodes by averaging the values obtained from the two corresponding velocity matrixes for example the expressions of coarse boundary fine scale nodes a and b of fig 2 are 23 v x f a v x f a v x f a 2 v x f iii a v x f ii a 2 v x f b v x f b v x f b 2 v x f iii b v x f iv b 2 where represents the top and right directions and represents the bottom and left directions similarly the unique velocities of the coarse grid nodes of the study region boundary can also be derived by eq 23 6 1 remark it needs to be remarked that the fine scale velocities and coarse grid velocities are all immediately obtained by explicit expressions eq 19 thus no additional computational process is required and the cost is negligibly little therefore to make the velocities and heads from unknown items to known items only the head equation system needs to be solved thus we claim the nfvmsfem can simultaneously obtain the heads and continuous x y direction darcian velocities 7 numerical verification in this section the nfvmsfem heads are compared with those of the finite volume multiscale finite element method he and ren 2005 and classical linear finite element method the nfvmsfem velocity fields are compared with those of yeh s galerkin model yeh 1981 the effects of different base function boundary conditions in the nfvmsfem are also tested three different examples are proposed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the nfvmsfem including a two dimensional steady flow problem with continuous hydraulic conductivities a two dimensional transient flow problem with gradually changing hydraulic conductivities and a pumping well and a two dimensional steady flow problem with random lognormal hydraulic conductivity fields certain parameters and abbreviations are used hydraulic head h coarse scale nodal darcian velocity in the ξ ξ x y direction v ξ fine scale nodal darcian velocity in the ξ ξ x y direction v ξ f conventional galerkin finite element method with linear base functions lfem lfem with a fine grid mesh lfem f new finite volume multiscale finite element model nfvmsfem nfvmsfem with oscillatory base function boundary condition nfvmsfem o nfvmsfem with linear base function boundary condition nfvmsfem l finite volume multiscale finite element method fvmsfem fvmsfem with oscillatory base function boundary condition fvmsfem o fvmsfem with linear base function boundary condition fvmsfem l fvmsfem l computes the head first and then finite difference method computes the fine scale velocity by fvmsfem l heads fvmsfem l plus fdm yeh s finite element model method yeh and method yeh with fine grid mesh method yeh f all the programs used in this section are compiled by c and run under the same conditions the hydraulic conductivity of an element is obtained by averaging the element vertex conductivities in this section the nfvmsfem coarse elements are squares the fine elements of the nfvmsfem lfem and lfem f are isosceles right triangles the horizontal edge lengths of the lfem lfem f elements are the same as that of the nfvmsfem coarse fine elements therefore the lfem element number is double the nfvmsfem coarse element number and the number of lfem f elements is the same as that of the nfvmsfem fine elements yeh s galerkin model employs the finite element method to compute the global head of the study region before the velocity computation therefore the method yeh and method yeh f directly inherit the heads and grids of the lfem and lfem f respectively as a measure of the error we take the relative euclidean norm 24 e 2 1 n i 1 n ξ simulation ξ standard ξ standard 2 1 2 where ξ simulation is the solution obtained by the numerical method ξ standard is the analytical solution or standard solution and n is the number of nodes being considered for the computation of e 2 and the relative error nodes with ξ standard 0 are not considered 7 1 two dimensional steady flow problem with continuous conductivity we consider the 2d steady flow equation 25 k x y h w x y ω where the study region is ω 0 1 0 1 with 0 0 as the lower left corner node to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the nfvmsfem with those of the fvmsfem lfem and method yeh three different continuous hydraulic conductivities are considered k 1 1 represents homogeneous media the k 2 1 x 1 y field decreases from the center to the border and is based on practical basin porous media k 3 1 2 1 99 π sin 3 x y 2 represents heterogeneous porous media and the maximum of k 3 is 399 times the minimum of k 3 dirichlet boundary conditions and source sink term w are specified by the analytical solution h xy xy 2 x 2 y x 2 y 2 the hydraulic heads of this example are solved by the nfvmsfem l fvmsfem l and lfem whose base function boundary conditions are all linear these methods divide each edge of ω into 40 equal parts therefore the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l divide ω into 1600 40 40 square coarse elements and divide each coarse element into 32 4 4 2 triangular fine elements the lfem divides ω into 3200 40 40 2 triangular elements the relative errors of the heads solved by the above methods with k 1 k 2 and k 3 along the section y 0 6 are displayed in fig 5 the accuracies of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are much higher than that of the lfem the results of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are similar and the nfvmsfem l result is slightly better for homogeneous porous media k 1 or basin like porous media k 2 the relative errors of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are all less than 0 1 in heterogeneous porous media k 3 the errors of three methods are higher than those of k 1 and k 2 but the accuracies of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are still much higher than that of the lfem furthermore the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l can obtain 25281 fine scale hydraulic heads by eq 16 which is much more than that of the lfem 1521 the cpu times of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l are the same 16 s which is slightly higher than that of the lfem 1 s this result shows the high efficiencies of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l in head computation and the nfvmsfem l velocity matrix construction cost is negligibly little different from fvmsfem and lfem the nfvmsfem can also obtain the x y direction velocity fields 1681 2 coarse scale velocities 25921 2 fine scale velocities simultaneously with heads the nfvmsfem l coarse scale velocities v x and v y are obtained directly by eq 22 and are averages of the corresponding fine scale velocities v x f and v y f obtained through the velocity matrixes eq 19 the nfvmsfem l coarse scale v x and v y of this example are compared with those of the method yeh the method yeh requires the solution for the head prior to the velocity computation and the above lfem head computation is the first part of the method yeh therefore the method yeh inherits the grid and head field of the lfem the absolute errors of the coarse scale v x and v y with k 1 k 2 and k 3 of the nfvmsfem l and method yeh along section y 0 6 are displayed in fig 6 in each subfigure the curve of the nfvmsfem l is below that of the method yeh showing that the nfvmsfem l is more accurate from k 1 to k 3 the distance between the nfvmsfem l and method yeh curves increases with increasing media heterogeneity moreover the curves of the nfvmsfem l are less affected by the hydraulic conductivities than those of the method yeh since the nfvmsfem l does not require additional effort to obtain velocities the cpu time is still 16 s additionally the method yeh requires 1 s for the head 2 s for v x and 2 s for v y totaling 5 s this result shows that the nfvmsfem l is more accurate than the method yeh and can obtain much more number fine scale unknowns while the computational cost is not much higher to investigate the efficiency and numerical convergence of the presented method the nfvmsfem l and method yeh divide each edge of ω into n 1 and n 2 equal parts respectively where n 1 40 50 60 and 70 and n 2 40 50 60 70 and 80 therefore the nfvmsfem l divides ω into n 1 n 1 square coarse elements and the method yeh divides ω into 2 n 2 n 2 triangular elements the nfvmsfem l coarse element is still divided into 4 4 2 triangular elements the cpu time e 2 v x curves of the nfvmsfem l and method yeh with k 1 k 2 and k 3 are displayed in fig 7 where the nodes with analytical v x 0 are not considered in the e 2 v x the cpu time of the nfvmsfem l shown in this figure includes the time for the heads and x y direction velocities at both the coarse scale and fine scale meanwhile the cpu time of the method yeh is only for the coarse scale heads and x direction velocities the curves of the nfvmsfem l are all below those of the method yeh showing that the efficiency of the nfvmsfem l is higher when n 1 n 2 the e 2 v x of the method yeh are several times those of the nfvmsfem l when n 1 n 2 20 the e 2 v x of the nfvmsfem l and method yeh are similar to each other while the nfvmsfem l cpu time is lower when n 2 90 the e 2 v x of the method yeh with k 1 k 2 and k 3 are 2 2265e 3 2 2281e 3 and 7 280e 03 respectively which are still higher than those of the nfvmsfem l n 1 70 these results show that the nfvmsfem l can achieve better accuracy than the method yeh with similar cpu time furthermore the e 2 v x of the nfvmsfem l decreases when n 1 increases showing that the nfvmsfem l is numerically convergent the curves of both the nfvmsfem l and method yeh decrease quickly at the beginning and then gradually change and the slope of nfvmsfem curve is lower than that of method yeh when n 1 n 2 this result shows that the accuracy of the nfvmsfem l is less affected as the grid becomes finer the fine scale velocities with k 2 obtained by the nfvmsfem l are compared with those of the method yeh f and fvmsfem l plus fdm the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l employ the grid in the head computation i e 40 40 coarse elements and 4 4 2 fine elements for each coarse element the finite difference method fdm uses the grid of fvmsfem l the method yeh f divides ω into 51200 160 160 2 triangular elements since the nfvmsfem l and method yeh f divide the study region into the same number of fine elements the numbers of fine scale velocities are the same the velocities obtained by the method yeh f nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm in a coarse element ke are presented in table 1 and table 2 where ke is a 0 025 0 025 square with node 0 8 0 675 as the left lower vertex table 1 lists the v x f at the ke interior nodes the relative errors of the nfvmsfem l v x f are all lower than 2 3 but are slightly higher than those of the method yeh f this difference occurs because the velocities of the method yeh f are calculated in the global grid 160 160 2 while the nfvmsfem l computes v x f by the velocity matrix constructed in the local coarse element grid 4 4 2 since the heterogeneity of k 2 is not high the v x f of nfvmsfem l is only slightly better than fvmsfem l plus fdm their average relative errors of ke interior nodes table 1 are 1 45 and 1 54 meanwhile if the permeability is k 3 the average relative errors of ke interior nodes of nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm increases to 3 67 and 4 55 it can be seen that the gap and ratio between nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm relative errors increases with the permeability becomes more heterogeneous table 2 lists the ke coarse grid line nodal velocities calculated by the nfvmsfem l method yeh f and fvmsfem l plus fdm with k 2 the upper part is the ke boundary nodal v x f and the lower part is the ke vertex nodal v x coarse scale velocity in this table the nfvmsfem l velocities are similar to those of the method yeh f and are more accurate than those of the nfvmsfem l ke interior nodal v x f in table 1 meanwhile the average relative errors of ke coarse grid line nodes table 2 of nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm are 0 57 and 3 15 respectively it can be seen that the gap and ratio between nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l plus fdm relative errors is much larger than those of table 1 these differences occur because the velocities at the nfvmsfem coarse grid line nodes contain more information than those at the coarse element interior nodes the upper part velocities contain the information of two coarse elements and the lower part velocities contain the information of four coarse elements see section 6 furthermore the method yeh f costs 4927 s for the heads and 5437 s for x direction velocities i e 10364 s the cpu time of the nfvmsfem l for head and x y direction velocities is only 16 s and the cpu time of the fvmsfem l plus fdm for head and x direction velocity is 16s this result shows that the nfvmsfem l can obtain the same number x direction velocities as the method yeh f with a much lower computation cost 7 2 two dimensional transient flow problem with gradually changing conductivity and pumping well in this example the simulation of transient flow with gradually changing hydraulic conductivity is considered this example describes the practical alluvial plains situation which is based on the example of the work of ye et al 2004 the problem equation is eq 1 and the study region is ω 0 10000 m 0 10000 m the hydraulic conductivity changes gradually i e k 1 x 20 m day the specific storage is s 10 6 m and the thickness of the aquifer is 1 m there is a pumping well at point 6000 m 6000 m with a constant flow rate of 100 m day the total pumping time is 6 days and the time step is 1 day the top and bottom boundaries are impermeable the heads on the left boundary are 10 m and those at the right boundary are 0 m the hydraulic head field is solved by the lfem f nfvmsfem o nfvmsfem l fvmsfem o fvmsfem l and lfem the nfvmsfem fvmsfem and lfem divide the boundary of the study region into 40 equal parts therefore the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem divide the study region into 1600 40 40 square coarse elements and each coarse element is divided into 32 triangular fine elements the lfem divides the study region into 3200 40 40 2 triangular elements the lfem f divides the study region into 51 200 160 160 2 triangular fine elements to obtain the same number of fine elements as the nfvmsfem since this example does not have an analytical solution the lfem f with 204 800 320 320 2 triangular fine elements is denoted as standard solution the hydraulic heads along the section y 6000 m are represented in fig 8 the curves of the lfem f nfvmsfem o and fvmsfem o are almost coincident and the accuracies of these methods are higher than those of the nfvmsfem l and fvmsfem l the accuracy of the lfem is the worst this result shows that oscillatory base function boundary conditions can improve the accuracy of the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem in the well area the lfem f nfvmsfem o and fvmsfem o achieve similar results though the lfem f is slightly better meanwhile the cpu times of the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem are the same 98 s showing that the construction of the nfvmsfem velocity matrixes costs very little moreover the cpu times of the lfem f and lfem are 30 815 s and 9 s respectively the results show that the nfvmsfem o can obtain the same number 25 599 of heads as the lfem f with slightly lower accuracy while only using approximately 0 3 of the cpu time the nfvmsfem o is more accurate than the lfem obtaining 24000 more head unknowns with only 89 s more time the nfvmsfem can also compute the x y direction velocities 1681 2 for the coarse scale and 25921 2 for the fine scale simultaneously with the head this result shows the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem the nfvmsfem can simultaneously obtain the velocities with head in above head computation process the nfvmsfem o v x are compared with those of the method yeh and method yeh f and the nfvmsfem o v x f are compared with those of the method yeh f the method yeh employs the grid of the lfem i e a 40 40 2 grid the method yeh f employs the grids of the lfem f i e a 160 160 2 grid and a 320 320 2 grid for the standard solution fig 9 presents the v x of the standard solution method yeh f nfvmsfem o and method yeh along the section y 6000 m the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o is very similar to that of the method yeh f and is higher than that of the method yeh in the vicinity of the well area the nfvmsfem o is slightly less accurate than the method yeh f but still much more accurate than the method yeh the fine scale v x f in the vicinity of the well area along the section y 6125 m of the nfvmsfem o and method yeh f are shown in fig 10 as shown the nfvmsfem o and method yeh f achieve similar and highly accurate results and the accuracy of the method yeh f is only slightly higher meanwhile the nfvmsfem costs much less than the method yeh f the method yeh f costs 30 815 s for the heads and 5399 s for v x while the nfvmsfem o only costs 98 s to obtain the heads and the x y direction velocities at both the coarse scale and fine scale the v x is only computed once on the 6th day thus the time spent by the method yeh f for the velocity is much lower than that for the head compared with the result of example 1 the cpu time gap between the nfvmsfem and method yeh f is larger this result shows the nfvmsfem can save more computation cost when simulating the transient flow problem 7 3 two dimensional steady flow problem with random lognormal conductivity fields the problem considered in this example is defined by eq 25 the study region is ω 0 1000 0 1000 and the source sink term w is 0 the top and bottom boundaries are impermeable the heads at the left boundary are 16 and those at the right boundary are 11 the hydraulic conductivity k fields are generated on a uniform 400 400 grid by the sequential gaussian simulation function geostatistical software library by deutsch and journel 1998 six different variances σ 2 of lnk are considered where σ 2 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 4 the media becomes more heterogeneous when σ 2 increases σ 2 0 5 represents weak heterogeneous porous media and σ 2 1 represents moderate heterogeneous media similar to the work of bellin et al 1992 this example considers the correlation length i y 200 to be the reference for the lengths we denote the ratio of the element horizontal edge length l to the correlation length i y as δ l i y the δ of the nfvmsfem coarse elements and fine elements are expressed as δ c and δ f respectively in this example the nfvmsfem o employs three different grids grid 1 δ c 0 2 σ 2 0 5 or 0 05 σ 2 1 δ f δ c 4 grid 2 δ c 0 2 σ 2 0 5 or 0 05 σ 2 1 δ f δ c 2 grid 3 δ c 0 5 σ 2 0 5 or 0 2 σ 2 1 δ f δ c 2 grids 1 and 2 have the same study region divisions same δ c and grids 2 and 3 have the same coarse element subdivisions δ f δ c 2 from grid 1 to grid 3 the mesh becomes coarser the fvmsfem o has the same grid as grid 1 of the nfvmsfem o thus the nfvmsfem o and fvmsfem o corresponding to grid 1 are denoted group 1 based on grids 2 and 3 the grids of the lfem f and lfem are generated the horizontal edge length of the lfem lfem f element is the same as that of the nfvmsfem coarse fine element i e the lfem δ δ c and the lfem f δ δ f therefore the lfem element number is double the nfvmsfem coarse element number and the number of lfem f elements is the same as that of the nfvmsfem fine elements for convenience the nfvmsfem o lfem f and lfem corresponding to grid 2 are denoted group 2 and those corresponding to grid 3 are denoted group 3 this example does not have an analytical solution so the lfem f with 320 000 400 400 2 triangular fine elements is denoted the standard solution the hydraulic heads are solved by the nfvmsfem o fvmsfem o lfem f and lfem the relative errors of the heads along the section y 600 of these methods are presented in fig 11 fig 11 a shows the weak heterogeneous situation where the grids of each method are coarser than those in fig 11 b f in fig 11 a the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 05 group 1 achieves the best result which is better than those of the fvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 05 group 1 and lfem f δ 0 1 group 2 in group 2 the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 1 is slightly lower than that of the lfem f δ 0 1 but is much better than that of the lfem δ 0 2 as for the group 3 methods the accuracy from high to low is nfvmsfem o δ c 0 5 δ f 0 25 lfem f δ 0 25 and lfem δ 0 5 in the same group the results show that the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o is similar to that of the lfem f δ δ f and better than that of the lfem δ δ c comparing the results of the nfvmsfem o of groups 1 2 and 3 both the study region and coarse element refinement can help the nfvmsfem o to improve the accuracy fig 11 b f present moderate heterogeneous situations where the coordinate axes are the same the errors of all the methods become higher when σ 2 increases and finer grids can reduce the oscillations of the curves similar to fig 11 a the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 achieves the best result in groups 2 and 3 the accuracy of the nfvmsfem o is still very similar to that of the lfem f δ δ f and better than that of the lfem δ δ c in addition the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 2 δ f 0 1 appears in all the subfigures and its relative errors are all lower than 0 7 this result indicates that the nfvmsfem o can deal with random lognormal conductivity fields well meanwhile the nfvmsfem o group 1 achieves the best results and most unknowns for the head computation and achieves the high efficiency for illustration when σ 2 2 the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 achieves the best head accuracy in fig 11 d with 1120 s it not only solves 9999 99 101 coarse scale heads and 159999 fine scale heads 399 401 but also solves the x y direction coarse scale velocities 10201 2 and fine scale velocities 160 801 2 simultaneously with the heads however the fvmsfem o lfem f and lfem can only obtain the head fields the fvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 costs the same 1120 s to obtain 9999 coarse scale heads and 159999 fine scale heads the lfem f δ 0 025 group 2 costs 19564 s for 39999 199 201 heads and the lfem δ 0 05 group 2 costs 308 s for 9999 99 101 heads these results show the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem in solving lognormal conductivity field groundwater flow problems the v x obtained by the nfvmsfem o is then compared with those of the method yeh and method yeh f the method yeh and method yeh f inherit the grids and heads of the lfem and lfem f of group 2 which are also denoted group 2 methods therefore the horizontal edge length of the method yeh element is the same as that of the nfvmsfem o grid 2 coarse element δ δ c and the horizontal edge length of the method yeh f is the same as that of the nfvmsfem o grid 2 fine elements δ δ f the v x of the nfvmsfem o method yeh f and method yeh along the section y 600 are presented in fig 12 the half up solid triangle symbol hollow triangle symbol and half down solid triangle symbol stand for the nfvmsfem group 1 nfvmsfem group 2 and nfvmsfem group 3 respectively in fig 12 the nfvmsfem o group 1 nfvmsfem o group 2 and method yeh f group 2 achieve similar accuracies and their accuracies from high to low are the method yeh f group 2 nfvmsfem o group 1 and nfvmsfem o group 2 these results occur because the method yeh f group 2 computes the velocity field in the 200 200 global grid and the velocity matrixes of the nfvmsfem o group 1 and nfvmsfem o group 2 are generated in the 4 4 and 2 2 local coarse element grids respectively meanwhile the nfvmsfem o group 2 is more accurate and less oscillatory than the method yeh group 2 though the grid of the nfvmsfem o group 3 is much coarser than those of the other methods in fig 12 the nfvmsfem o group 3 can still describe the similar variation tendencies of the standard solution furthermore the results of the nfvmsfem o for groups 1 2 and 3 suggest that refinements of both the coarse grid and fine grid can decrease numerical errors and thus the nfvmsfem is numerically convergent in addition all the methods only need a coarse grid for the weak heterogeneous situation σ 2 0 5 when σ 2 1 the nfvmsfem o method yeh f and method yeh require grid refinement to describe the media well in fig 12 b to f the increase in σ 2 leads to larger oscillations and errors for all these methods but the nfvmsfem o group 1 nfvmsfem o group 2 and method yeh f group 2 are less affected this result demonstrates the effectiveness of the nfvmsfem o for moderate heterogeneous situations furthermore the nfvmsfem o velocities are simultaneously obtained with heads for illustration when σ 2 2 the cpu time of the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 is still 1120 s while its v x accuracy is only slightly lower than that of the method yeh f and is much higher than that of the method yeh as mentioned above the nfvmsfem o δ c 0 05 δ f 0 0125 group 1 achieves 9999 coarse scale heads 159999 fine scale heads 10201 2 coarse scale velocities and 160801 2 fine scale velocities in this example meanwhile the method yeh f δ 0 025 group 2 costs 19564 s for 39999 heads and 19771 s for 40401 velocities in only the x direction the method yeh δ 0 05 group 2 costs 308 s for 9999 heads and 337 s for 10201 velocities in only the x direction this result demonstrates the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem o 8 conclusion this paper proposes a new finite volume multiscale finite element model nfvmsfem for simultaneously solving groundwater flow and velocity fields in porous media the main idea of this method is to introduce novel local velocity matrixes in the control volume boundary flux computation of the fvmsfem framework and thus present the x y direction velocities directly by coarse scale heads and multiscale base functions the velocity matrixes are constructed through a modified yeh s galerkin model such that the continuity and mass balance of the velocity can be ensured the nfvmsfem inherits the advantages of the fvmsfem and thus the heads obtained satisfy mass conservation therefore the nfvmsfem can compute the head and the x y direction velocities with high accuracy and efficiency which simplifies groundwater simulation and saves much computational costs in the numerical verification the nfvmsfem flow fields are compared with those of the fvmsfem lfem and lfem f the nfvmsfem velocity fields are compared with those of the method yeh and method yeh f the scale of the lfem lfem f is the same as the coarse fine scale of the nfvmsfem the method yeh and method yeh f inherit the grid and heads of the lfem and lfem f respectively three different situations i e a steady flow problem with continuous conductivity a transient flow problem with gradually changing conductivity and a pumping well alluvial plain and a steady flow problem with random lognormal conductivity fields are tested the results show that the nfvmsfem can deal with the above situations well while achieving high accuracy and efficiency the nfvmsfem is more accurate than the lfem for the head computation even with only the employment of linear base function boundary conditions similar to the fvmsfem and msfem the nfvmsfem is very sensitive to the base function boundary conditions and the oscillatory base function conditions lead to much better results the nfvmsfem o achieves an accuracy similar to that of the lfem f which is slightly better than that of the fvmsfem meanwhile the nfvmsfem can obtain the same number of fine scale heads as the lfem f while saving more than 99 in cpu time the cpu time values of the nfvmsfem and fvmsfem are the same showing that the construction of velocity matrixes costs very little furthermore the nfvmsfem can compute the x y direction coarse and fine scale velocities simultaneously with the hydraulic heads without any additional cost since the method yeh and method yeh f require lfem to obtain the head field prior and can only solve one direction velocity at a one time the nfvmsfem is more convenient the results show that the nfvmsfem is numerically convergent and its coarse scale velocities are more accurate than those of the method yeh the results also show that the efficiency of the nfvmsfem is much higher than that of the method yeh even though the method yeh considers the computation time of the velocity in only one direction in addition the nfvmsfem can obtain the x y direction fine scale velocities and the number of each direction fine scale velocities is the same as that of the method yeh f the nfvmsfem o fine scale velocity accuracy is only slightly lower than that of the method yeh f in the three examples showing that the nfvmsfem can deal with groundwater media well the cpu time gap between the nfvmsfem and method yeh f is much larger than that between the nfvmsfem and lfem f even though the method yeh f considers the computation time for the velocity in only one direction this result indicates the high efficiency of the nfvmsfem in summary the nfvmsfem can compute groundwater flow and velocity fields with high efficiency in different porous media while achieving high accuracy our study is limited to two dimensional groundwater simulation in porous media additionally the features of the fvmsfem framework and yeh s model make the nfvmsfem inapplicable to flow problems in highly heterogeneous media such as discontinuous media and channelized systems future studies will be conducted to extend the nfvmsfem to three dimensional problems and to explore the application of the algorithm to highly heterogeneous conductivities

6537,climate change in mean state or variability could lead to more less frequency of extreme drought in this study we developed a new framework for decomposing the contributing factors of changes in future extreme drought frequency in china in accordance to the palmer drought severity index pdsi we performed a series of numerical experiments to ensure that the sensitivity of trend and variability in individual climatic variables can be distinguished in addition an extreme drought rate with warming edrw unit k 1 is defined to quantify the relative change in extreme drought frequency per kelvin overall the edrw will increase dramatically by an average of 27 71 k 1 the ascended edrw are attributed to increases in temperature 56 90 k 1 net radiation 14 80 k 1 and precipitation variability 8 23 k 1 a decrease in relative humidity 4 61 k 1 but is partly offset by an increase in precipitation i e wetting 60 12 k 1 a smaller increase in the frequency of extreme droughts is found in high latitude regions due to their enhanced sensitivity to wetting keywords extreme drought global warming numerical experiments attribution china 1 introduction drought is a major natural hazard that occurs intermittently in many climates mishra and singh 2010 measured by the level of water availability below normal conditions over a given period monthly scale up to multiannual scale drought severity of a region can be quantitatively assessed using drought indices i e the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 according to drought classifications extreme or severe droughts can be identified when an indicator value falls below a given threshold e g 4 or 3 for pdsi palmer 1965 kauffman and vonck 2011 because of their serious social economic consequences e g widespread crop failure or water shortages liu et al 2018a extreme droughts have gained widespread attentions and discussions such as the recent california drought aghakouchak et al 2015 diffenbaugh et al 2015 the millennium drought in southeast australia van dijk et al 2013 kiem et al 2016 and the once in a century droughts in the southwest china qiu 2010 zou et al 2005 in a climate system that is not subject to adverse impacts of climate change the frequency of extreme drought could be expected to maintain a relatively stable low probability fig 1 a however the frequency of extreme droughts are expected to increase as a consequence of the climate change dai and zhao 2016 and the increase in frequency of extreme drought due to global warming in recent decades was confirmed in many regions including china zhang et al 2018 theoretically the conditions of sustained drying due to decreasing long term precipitation and or increasing evaporation could increase the risk of extreme droughts dai and zhao 2016 herrera estrada et al 2017 conceptual model 1 in fig 1b nonetheless there is no evidence of an increase in mean state of drought over china in recent decades sheffield et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 the contrasting changes in the mean state of drought and its extremes can be identified using the increasing volatility of drought with global warming zhao and dai 2016 swain et al 2018 he and li 2018 previous studies highlighted that increased climate variability i e precipitation could cause more extreme droughts floods despite the change in mean state is small wetherald 2009 seager et al 2012 chen and sun 2015 he and li 2018 conceptual model 2 in fig 1c hence the projected increase in extreme drought frequency in a warmer world prudhomme et al 2014 cook et al 2015 lehner et al 2017 liu et al 2018b should be due to the change in mean state and variability of drought however a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of future extreme droughts in response to the changes in the mean and variability of various climate variables in a warming climate is not available he and li 2018 to this end we propose a new framework involving a series of numerical experiments for attributing changes in future extreme droughts across china in accordance to the pdsi in section 2 we describe the data and design a series of numerical experiments to attribute changes in extreme droughts in section 3 we report the assessment and attribution results of projected changes in future extreme drought frequency across china we present our conclusions and summary in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 data monthly meteorological variables from the outputs of seven general circulation models gcms under the concentration pathway scenario rcp8 5 8 5 w m2 see table 1 for details are used in this study they were archived by the program on climate model

interpolation to re grid all gcm climate fields to a common resolution 2 2 longitude by latitude grid 2 2 estimating the frequency of extreme drought the pdsi is used in this study to quantify the frequency of extreme drought it was improved using a simple two layer water balance model palmer 1965 which considered water supply i e precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand the precipitation used in pdsi estimation need to be estimated under climatically appropriate conditions zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2018b to calculate the pdsi series we follow allen et al 1998 and apply the penman fao56 equation denoted as pet pm 1 p e t p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s 1 r h 100 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation can be calculated using surface downwelling upwelling shortwave longwave radiation δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve g is the soil heat flux u2 is the wind speed ws at 2 m above ground level γ is the psychometric constant es is the saturation vapor pressure at a given air temperature and rh is the relative humidity in this study long term pdsi series over the period 1850 2099 were calculated using the tool provided by the palmer drought severity index jacobi et al 2013 according to pdsi classification the severely dry conditions considered as extreme drought in this study are identified using a pdsi value less than 3 the threshold 3 in a given month for each decade the frequency of extreme drought denoted as fed and its relative change denoted as rcfed can be further quantified the change in rcfed with warming can be obtained from the statistical value of the linear trend at the grid box level note that we set the baseline period as 2090 2099 instead of 1980 2000 in the decreasing rcfed cases in this way the rcfed values for increasing or decreasing extreme drought cases can be compared with one another the absolute value for rcfed in both increasing and decreasing extreme drought frequency can exceed 100 refer to brief description in fig 2 2 3 design of numerical experiments to quantify the sensitivity of extreme drought step 1 eliminating the trend signals to disentangle different responses of extreme droughts pdsi 3 to individual meteorological forcing from gcms in a trend component as in zhang et al 2018 a detrended approach was applied the detrended forcing series can be considered as a scenario without the trend signals of climate change in this study the detrended approach for a given grid box 2000 2099 is expressed as follows 2 f m d e t r e n d i f m s i m i α i order 2000 where fm sim i is the monthly temperature t meteorological forcings in year i fm detrend i is the detrended monthly forcings in the same year α is the annual trend for a grid box the time series iorder is from 2000 to 2099 for other meteorological forcings the detrended approach for a given grid box is expressed as follows 3 f y d e t r e n d i f y s i m i α i order 2000 where fy sim i is the annual precipitation p wind speed ws relative humidity rh and net radiation rn meteorological forcings in year i respectively fy detrend i is the detrended annual meteorological forcings in the same year respectively α is the annual trend for a grid box the time series iorder is from 1980 to 2099 from above the monthly detrended forcing p ws rh and sd can be generated using 4 f m det r e n d i f m s i m i f y det r e n d i f y s i m i where fm sim i is the projected monthly forcings p ws rh and sd in year i and fm detrend i is the detrended monthly meteorological forcings p ws rh and sd in the same year step 2 eliminating the variability signals to further quantify the different responses of extreme droughts to a single meteorological forcing as a result of a change in variability a new method for eliminating individual meteorological forcing variability is applied termed as the equal variance approach based on the variance of t he baseline period 1980 1999 at the grid box level a new series of long term forcing can be reconstructed using constant variance for each decadal period i e 1850 1859 1860 1869 2090 2099 meanwhile the decadal mean state of the pdsi is not modified thus the new series only contains the signals of the trend components a detailed proof in appendix a for a given grid box the variability heteroscedasticity of an individual meteorological forcing from gcms is eliminated using 5 f y equal variance i k decade x y s i m i x decade x decade where x decade is the decadal average of meteorological forcing from gcms x y s i m i is the annual forcing in a given decade in year i k decade is the correction coefficient of variance and f y equal variance i is the equal variance annual meteorological forcing in the same year i we note that 6 k decade s t d x y s i m b a s e s t d x y s i m d e c a d e where s t d x y s i m b a s e is the standard deviation of annual meteorological forcing from gcms over the baseline period and s t d x y s i m d e c a d e is the standard deviation of annual meteorological forcing from gcms in each decadal period such as 1850 1859 1860 1869 2080 2089 and 2090 2099 subsequently the monthly equal variance forcing can be generated from 7 f m equal variance i f y equal variance i x m s i m i x y s i m i where x m s i m i is the monthly meteorological forcings from gcms in year i and f m equal variance i is the monthly equal variance in meteorological forcings from gcms in the same year i 2 4 framework of numerical experiments for attributing the changes in future extreme droughts to separate different responses i e trend or and variability components of the pdsi to meteorological forcing from the gcms and quantify the sensitivity of droughts we design a baseline case to examine the pdsi series when all climatic forcing is free of trends and variability to this end we apply the detrending technique described in step 1 and then use the equal variance approach of step 2 to form a new climatic time series without the long term climate change signals it should be emphasized that most climatic variables are generally bounded by zero e g precipitation wind speed radiation and relative humidity and certain climatic variables are further bounded by one e g relative humidity for these meteorological variables we first apply detrending or equal variance to eliminate the trend or variability components then we take the relevant physical constraints into account no less than zero and or no larger than one to avoid unphysical outcomes next we conduct a series of numerical experiments in which all of the forcing are detrended and equal variance and the trend signal in a single meteorological variable is used in the pdsi estimates for example the precipitation p trend case is a numerical experiment in which all meteorological variables are detrended and equal variance but only the precipitation trend signal is retained the same approach is also applied to the temperature t trend wind speed ws trend net radiation rn trend and relative humidity rh trend cases similarly we conduct a further series of numerical experiments in which all of the forcings are detrended while retaining the variability signal in a single meteorological variable i e the precipitation p variability temperature t variability wind speed ws variability net radiation rn variability and relative humidity rh variability cases finally we release the forcing trend and variability signals in all meteorological variables as the future simulated estimate denoted as sim case 3 results 3 1 changes in projected extreme droughts in china to estimate and reveal the characteristics of future droughts in china a long term series of annual pdsis ensemble mean standard from 1980 to 2099 is presented in fig 3 a the overall trend of the pdsi indicates a slightly drying trend 0 04 10a 1 with a widening range of annual pdsi the standard deviation of annual pdsi significantly increases for all the 30 year periods i e stdpdsi 1980 2009 0 16 stdpdsi 2010 2039 0 21 stdpdsi 2040 2069 0 23 and stdpdsi 2070 2099 0 24 in the end of 21st century stdpdsi 2070 2099 is 1 5 times higher than stdpdsi 1980 2009 fig 3a according to the conceptual models mentioned above fig 1 the projected drought pattern for the 21st century is characterized by an increase in the drying trend and amplification of drought variability it is expected that the frequency of extreme drought fed would increase drastically from the baseline period i e fed baseline 5 2 to the end of the 21st century i e fed 2090s 14 8 fig 3b and that there would be a strong linear relationship between fed and warming signals i e fed 0 016 t 0 03 r 0 96 with a slight change in the mean state of drought the projected extreme drought frequency would dramatically increase in a warmer climate trenberth et al 2003 liu et al 2016 to quantify the response of extreme drought to warming we define an extreme drought rate with warming denoted as e d r w and defined as r c f e d t u n i t k 1 which is the ratio of the change in rcfed unit 10a 1 to the decadal change in temperature unit k 10a 1 overall the projected rcfed would increase by approximately 29 3 per kelvin in china edrw sim 29 3 k 1 fig 3c and spatial difference showed in fig 7a 3 2 quantifying the sensitivity of extreme droughts using pdsi 3 2 1 designing a baseline case without climate change signals a series of numerical experiments are performed to quantify the future sensitivity of extreme drought from there the probability density function pdf of edrw r c f e d t is provided from 282 grid boxes fig 4 and table 2 according to the baseline case designed in section 2 4 the trend and variability signals are removed from all meteorological variables in a sense it can be regarded as a climate system without long term climate change signals in this baseline case the mean trend of rcfed approaches zero and is approximately normally distributed the blue line in fig 4 the average edrw is 1 97 k 1 with a standard deviation of 8 14 k 1 the new pdsi time series can be regarded as a baseline case and serve as a basis for comparison in the following numerical experiments 3 2 2 trend components of projected extreme droughts in china to decompose the sensitivity of extreme droughts into the trend components the pdf of edrw from the averaged multimodel is shown for each individual numerical experiment first we release the trend signals of near surface temperature and precipitation i e the t trend case and the p trend case significant increasing trends for edrw t trend μ 56 90 k 1 and decreasing trends of the same order of magnitude for edrw p trend μ 60 12 k 1 termed wetting are shown in fig 4a and b respectively then we release the trend signal of net radiation and find that a significant increase in edrw rn trend μ 14 80 k 1 occurs on average as much as a quarter of the warming contribution to extreme drought although a counterintuitive

amplification of precipitation variability reported here could also markedly increase the risk of extreme drought he and li 2018 swain et al 2018 these outcomes suggest that the change in extreme

6537,climate change in mean state or variability could lead to more less frequency of extreme drought in this study we developed a new framework for decomposing the contributing factors of changes in future extreme drought frequency in china in accordance to the palmer drought severity index pdsi we performed a series of numerical experiments to ensure that the sensitivity of trend and variability in individual climatic variables can be distinguished in addition an extreme drought rate with warming edrw unit k 1 is defined to quantify the relative change in extreme drought frequency per kelvin overall the edrw will increase dramatically by an average of 27 71 k 1 the ascended edrw are attributed to increases in temperature 56 90 k 1 net radiation 14 80 k 1 and precipitation variability 8 23

latitude regions due to their enhanced sensitivity to wetting keywords extreme drought global warming numerical experiments attribution china 1 introduction drought is a major natural hazard that occurs intermittently in many climates mishra and singh 2010 measured by the level of water availability below normal conditions over a given period monthly scale up to multiannual scale drought severity of a region can be quantitatively assessed using drought indices i e the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 according to drought classifications extreme or severe droughts can be identified when an indicator value falls below a given threshold e g 4 or 3 for pdsi palmer 1965 kauffman and vonck 2011 because of their serious social economic consequences e g widespread crop failure or water shortages liu et al 2018a extreme droughts have gained widespread attentions and discussions such as the recent california drought aghakouchak et al 2015 diffenbaugh et al 2015 the millennium drought in southeast australia van dijk et al 2013 kiem et al 2016 and the once in a century droughts in the southwest china qiu 2010 zou et al 2005 in a climate system that is not subject to adverse impacts of climate change the frequency of extreme drought could be expected to maintain a relatively stable low probability fig 1 a however the frequency of extreme droughts are expected to increase as a consequence of the climate change dai and zhao 2016 and the increase in frequency of extreme drought due to global warming in recent decades was confirmed in many regions including china zhang et al 2018 theoretically the conditions of sustained drying due to decreasing long term precipitation and or increasing evaporation could increase the risk of extreme droughts dai and zhao 2016 herrera estrada et al 2017 conceptual model 1 in fig 1b nonetheless there is no evidence of an increase in mean state of drought over china in recent decades sheffield et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 the contrasting changes in the mean state of drought and its extremes can be identified using the increasing volatility of drought with global warming zhao and dai 2016 swain et al 2018 he and li 2018 previous studies highlighted that increased climate variability i e precipitation could cause more extreme droughts floods despite the change in mean state is small wetherald 2009 seager et al 2012 chen and sun 2015 he and li 2018 conceptual model 2 in fig 1c hence the projected increase in extreme drought frequency in a warmer world prudhomme et al 2014 cook et al 2015 lehner et al 2017 liu et al 2018b should be due to the change in mean state and variability of drought however a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of future extreme droughts in response to the changes in the mean and variability of various climate variables in a warming climate is not available he and li 2018 to this end we propose a new framework involving a series of numerical experiments for attributing changes in future extreme droughts across china in accordance to the pdsi in section 2 we describe the data and design a series of numerical experiments to attribute changes in extreme droughts in section 3 we report the assessment and attribution results of projected changes in future extreme drought frequency across china we present our conclusions and summary in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 data monthly meteorological variables from the outputs of seven general circulation models gcms under the concentration pathway scenario rcp8 5 8 5 w m2 see table 1 for details are used in this study they were archived by the program on climate model diagnosis at a website that permits downloading http pcmdi9 llnl gov esgf web fe the data sets include monthly precipitation denoted p surface air temperature maximum minimum denoted t surface relative humidity denoted rh net radiation shortwave downwelling upwelling flux rsup rsdown and longwave downwelling upwelling flux rlup rldown net radiation rsup rsdown rlup rldown denoted rn and wind speed to obtain the monthly wind speed we averaged the daily values surface zonal velocity component uwnd and meridional velocity component vwnd wind speed uwn d 2 v w n d 2 over a month denoted ws to ensure physical consistency between the climatic variables naumann et al 2018 liu et al 2018b we directly apply the raw climate outputs instead of bias corrected data we use the bilinear interpolation to re grid all gcm climate fields to a common resolution 2 2 longitude by latitude grid 2 2 estimating the frequency of extreme drought the pdsi is used in this study to quantify the frequency of extreme drought it was improved using a simple two layer water balance model palmer 1965 which considered water supply i e precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand the precipitation used in pdsi estimation need to be estimated under climatically appropriate conditions zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2018b to calculate the pdsi series we follow allen et al 1998 and apply the penman fao56 equation denoted as pet pm 1 p e t p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s 1 r h 100 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation can be calculated using surface downwelling upwelling shortwave longwave radiation δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve g is the soil heat flux u2 is the wind speed ws at 2 m above ground level γ is the psychometric constant es is the saturation vapor pressure at a given air temperature and rh is the relative humidity in this study long term pdsi series over the period 1850 2099 were calculated using the tool provided by the palmer drought severity index jacobi et al 2013 according to pdsi classification the severely dry conditions considered as extreme drought in this study are identified using a pdsi value less than 3 the threshold 3 in a given month for each decade the frequency of extreme drought denoted as fed and its relative change denoted as rcfed can be further quantified the change in rcfed with warming can be obtained from the statistical value of the linear trend at the grid box level note that we set the baseline period as 2090 2099 instead of 1980 2000 in the decreasing rcfed cases in this way the rcfed values for increasing or decreasing extreme drought cases can be compared with one another the absolute value for rcfed in both increasing and decreasing extreme drought frequency can exceed 100 refer to brief description in fig 2 2 3 design of numerical experiments to quantify the sensitivity of extreme drought step 1 eliminating the trend signals to disentangle different responses of extreme droughts pdsi 3 to individual meteorological forcing from gcms in a trend component as in zhang et al 2018 a detrended approach was applied the detrended forcing series can be considered as a scenario without the trend signals of climate change in this study the detrended approach for a given grid box 2000 2099 is expressed as follows 2 f m d e t r e n d i f m s i m i α i order 2000 where fm sim i is the monthly temperature t meteorological forcings in year i fm detrend i is the detrended monthly forcings in the same year α is the annual trend for a grid box the time series iorder is from 2000 to 2099 for other meteorological forcings the detrended approach for a given grid box is expressed as follows 3 f y d e t r e n d i f y s i m i α i order 2000 where fy sim i is the annual precipitation p wind speed ws relative humidity rh and net radiation rn meteorological forcings in year i respectively fy detrend i is the detrended annual meteorological forcings in the same year respectively α is the annual trend for a grid box the time series iorder is from 1980 to 2099 from above the monthly detrended forcing p ws rh and sd can be generated using 4 f m det r e n d i f m s i m i f y det r e n d i f y s i m i where fm sim i is the projected monthly forcings p ws rh and sd in year i and fm detrend i is the detrended monthly meteorological forcings p ws rh and sd in the same year step 2 eliminating the variability signals to further quantify the different responses of extreme droughts to a single meteorological forcing as a result of a change in variability a new method for eliminating individual meteorological forcing variability is applied termed as the equal variance approach based on the variance of t he baseline period 1980 1999 at the grid box level a new series of long term forcing can be reconstructed using constant variance for each decadal period i e 1850 1859 1860 1869 2090 2099 meanwhile the decadal mean state of the pdsi is not modified thus the new series only contains the signals of the trend components a detailed proof in appendix a for a given grid box the variability heteroscedasticity of an individual meteorological forcing from gcms is eliminated using 5 f y equal variance i k decade x y s i m i x decade x decade where x decade is the decadal average of meteorological forcing from gcms x y s i m i is the annual forcing in a given decade in year i k decade is the correction coefficient of variance and f y equal variance i is the equal variance annual meteorological forcing in the same year i we note that 6 k decade s t d x y s i m b a s e s t d x y s i m d e c a d e where s t d x y s i m b a s e is the standard deviation of annual meteorological forcing from gcms over the baseline period and s t d x y s i m d e c a d e is the standard deviation of annual meteorological forcing from gcms in each decadal period such as 1850 1859 1860 1869 2080 2089 and 2090 2099 subsequently the monthly equal variance forcing can be generated from 7 f m equal variance i f y equal variance i x m s i m i x y s i m i where x m s i m i is the monthly meteorological forcings from gcms in year i and f m equal variance i is the monthly equal variance in meteorological forcings from gcms in the same year i 2 4 framework of numerical experiments for attributing the changes in future extreme droughts to separate different responses i e trend or and variability components of the pdsi to meteorological forcing from the gcms and quantify the sensitivity of droughts we design a baseline case to examine the pdsi series when all climatic forcing is free of trends and variability to this end we apply the detrending technique described in step 1 and then use the equal variance approach of step 2 to form a new climatic time series without the long term climate change signals it should be emphasized that most climatic variables are generally bounded by zero e g precipitation wind speed radiation and relative humidity and certain climatic variables are further bounded by one e g relative humidity for these meteorological variables we first apply detrending or equal variance to eliminate the trend or variability components then we take the relevant physical constraints into account no less than zero and or no larger than one to avoid unphysical outcomes next we conduct a series of numerical experiments in which all of the forcing are detrended and equal variance and the trend signal in a single meteorological variable is used in the pdsi estimates for example the precipitation p trend case is a numerical experiment in which all meteorological variables are detrended and equal variance but only the precipitation trend signal is retained the same approach is also applied to the temperature t trend wind speed ws trend net radiation rn trend and relative humidity rh trend cases similarly we conduct a further series of numerical experiments in which all of the forcings are detrended while retaining the variability signal in a single meteorological variable i e the precipitation p variability temperature t variability wind speed ws variability net radiation rn variability and relative humidity rh variability cases finally we release the forcing trend and variability signals in all meteorological variables as the future simulated estimate denoted as sim case 3 results 3 1 changes in projected extreme droughts in china to estimate and reveal the characteristics of future droughts in china a long term series of annual pdsis ensemble mean standard from 1980 to 2099 is presented in fig 3 a the overall trend of the pdsi indicates a slightly drying trend 0 04 10a 1 with a widening range of annual pdsi the standard deviation of annual pdsi significantly increases for all the 30 year periods i e stdpdsi 1980 2009 0 16 stdpdsi 2010 2039 0 21 stdpdsi 2040 2069 0 23 and stdpdsi 2070 2099 0 24 in the end of 21st century stdpdsi 2070 2099 is 1 5 times higher than stdpdsi 1980 2009 fig 3a according to the conceptual models mentioned above fig 1 the projected drought pattern for the 21st century is characterized by an increase in the drying trend and amplification of drought variability it is expected that the frequency of extreme drought fed would increase drastically from the baseline period i e fed baseline 5 2 to the end of the 21st century i e fed 2090s 14 8 fig 3b and that there would be a strong linear relationship between fed and warming signals i e fed 0 016 t 0 03 r 0 96 with a slight change in the mean state of drought the projected extreme drought frequency would dramatically increase in a warmer climate trenberth et al 2003 liu et al 2016 to quantify the response of extreme drought to warming we define an extreme drought rate with warming denoted as e d r w and defined as r c f e d t u n i t k 1 which is the ratio of the change in rcfed unit 10a 1 to the decadal change in temperature unit k 10a 1 overall the projected rcfed would increase by approximately 29 3 per kelvin in china edrw sim 29 3 k 1 fig 3c and spatial difference showed in fig 7a 3 2 quantifying the sensitivity of extreme droughts using pdsi 3 2 1 designing a baseline case without climate change signals a series of numerical experiments are performed to quantify the future sensitivity of extreme drought from there the probability density function pdf of edrw r c f e d t is provided from 282 grid boxes fig 4 and table 2 according to the baseline case designed in section 2 4 the trend and variability signals are removed from all meteorological variables in a sense it can be regarded as a climate system without long term climate change signals in this baseline case the mean trend of rcfed approaches zero and is approximately normally distributed the blue line in fig 4 the average edrw is 1 97 k 1 with a standard deviation of 8 14 k 1 the new pdsi time series can be regarded as a baseline case and serve as a basis for comparison in the following numerical experiments 3 2 2 trend components of projected extreme droughts in china to decompose the sensitivity of extreme droughts into the trend components the pdf of edrw from the averaged multimodel is shown for each individual numerical experiment first we release the trend signals of near surface temperature and precipitation i e the t trend case and the p trend case significant increasing trends for edrw t trend μ 56 90 k 1 and decreasing trends of the same order of magnitude for edrw p trend μ 60 12 k 1 termed wetting are shown in fig 4a and b respectively then we release the trend signal of net radiation and find that a significant increase in edrw rn trend μ 14 80 k 1 occurs on average as much as a quarter of the warming contribution to extreme drought although a counterintuitive decrease in net radiation was observed worldwide in the 20th century under global warming termed global dimming a rapid increase in net radiation commenced after the 1990 s wild et al 2005 trenberth and fasullo 2009 in response to a sharp increase in temperature termed global brightening from the early 21st century to quantify the sensitivity of extreme drought in terms of trend components we investigate the remaining two meteorological variables i e wind speed and relative humidity in separate manner by releasing the wind speed trend wind speed trend case the pdf of edrw ws trend is nearly unchanged according to average and standard deviation μ 0 64 k 1 σ 7 86 k 1 a decrease in relative humidity has been widely confirmed lorenz et al 2010 byrne et al 2016 as expected by releasing the relative humidity trend edrw rh trend exhibits a minor increasing trend μ 4 61 k 1 with a slightly larger standard deviation σ 9 79 k 1 the projected increase in net radiation and decrease in relative humidity in a warmer climate could result in higher atmospheric evaporative demand and hence more extreme droughts 3 2 3 variability components of projected extreme droughts in china the same

6538,intensive potato production is an important contributor to groundwater and surface water nitrate contamination in the province of prince edward island pei canada in pei the presence of a permeability contrast between soil and the underlying compact basal till at approximately 1 m depth is known to cause temporary perched water table conditions but the implications for agricultural nitrate transport are not well understood this study is the first detailed field investigation to examine the impact of the soil compact basal till interface on vertical and lateral subsurface flow of water and solutes on a moderate hillslope in pei a surface applied tracer test was conducted and a shallow drain tile pipe system with a tipping bucket gauge was installed down gradient of the tracer application to monitor lateral subsurface flow in addition three dimensional electrical resistivity imaging eri was employed to monitor the evolution of the applied tracer plume over a period of 1 year a small scale transient flow and transport model was used to simulate the tracer test and to investigate the sensitivity of tracer transport to selected parameters primarily the hydraulic conductivities of the soils and underlying compact basal till monitoring conducted from october 2013 to june 2015 and numerical modeling showed a strong tendency for vertical flow of water and tracer through the soil compact basal till interface as opposed to lateral down slope subsurface flow water balance calculations estimated a total vertical flow of 94 5 of the infiltration for the october 2014 to january 2015 period the preference for vertical over lateral flow and transport was consistent with electrical resistivity images for the same time period these findings indicate that the fate of infiltrating water and dissolved nitrate is the deeper bedrock aquifer water table and that intermittent perched water table conditions do not result in significant lateral flow toward nearby surface waters keywords nitrate contamination vadose zone flow and transport tracer test electrical resistivity imaging numerical modeling 1 introduction there is growing concern in many regions over nitrate contamination of groundwater and surface water due to a variety of anthropogenic activities including intensive agriculture for example groundwater nitrate concentrations greater than the maximum acceptable concentration for drinking water 10 mg l no3 n health canada 2013 have been observed in agricultural regions within the province of prince edward island pei canada commission on nitrates in groundwater in pei 2008 benson et al 2006 excessive nitrate in groundwater can also lead to increased groundwater transported nitrate loadings to surface water which presents a risk to aquatic life if anoxic conditions develop the prominence of elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater and surface water in pei has largely been attributed to the significant percentage approximately 15 of the land base that is used for potato production benson et al 2006 zebarth et al 2015 jiang et al 2015b the issue of groundwater contamination is especially important in pei because the entire drinking water supply for the province is drawn from the fractured sandstone aquifer the occurrence of anoxic conditions as a result of heavy nutrient loading to streams and estuaries has also been documented in pei e g finley et al 2013 there is a growing consensus that land use changes or nutrient reduction strategies including agricultural best management practices bmps will be required to reduce nutrient loadings to groundwater and surface waters danielescu and macquarrie 2011 zebarth et al 2015 jiang et al 2015b recent studies have shown that the implementation of certain bmps could result in an overall reduction in nitrate loading to the pei aquifer jiang et al 2015a zebarth et al 2015 however the movement of water and solutes after leaching from the root zone has not been investigated in detail and it has been suggested by zebarth et al 2015 that shallow subsurface soil conditions and topography will play a role in controlling nitrate transport in particular the sudden decrease in hydraulic conductivity between the lower boundary of the soil zone and the upper boundary of the compact glacial till at approximately 1 m depth results in the occurrence of an intermittent perched water table that may be a key determinant in promoting the lateral movement of water and solutes to surface water bodies as opposed to vertical percolation towards the bedrock aquifer such lateral transport would have implications for loading of nitrate to surface waters via shallow lateral drainage and for the lag time between implementing bmps and detecting significant water quality improvements jiang et al 2017 recently investigated the response time of groundwater nitrate concentrations to the implementation of bmps at an agricultural field site in pei the study utilized water chemistry data and water levels from multi level groundwater monitoring wells that were monitored over a period of 2 5 years a lag time of approximately 2 4 years was estimated from the near surface i e water and nitrate percolating past the root zone to the groundwater table at a depth of approximately 5 6 m the calculation assumed uniform non preferential and steady vertical flow through the vadose zone these simplifying assumptions therefore did not account for the potential impact of a permeability contrast between shallow soil and the underlying glacial till on the travel pathway and residence time of water and thus nitrate several field scale experimental approaches have been used in previous studies to investigate shallow subsurface flow and associated solute transport for example dahlke et al 2012 used a tile drain system as a means of collecting lateral flow in a silt loam soil overlying a shallow relatively impermeable soil layer fragipan in new york state usa drain tile pipes were installed at the interface between the fragipan layer and the overlying soil and near the surface i e 10 cm from ground surface to measure lateral subsurface flow and near surface runoff respectively deep percolation was determined by subtracting the lateral subsurface flow and near surface runoff from the total drain tile pipe discharge the study concluded that the partitioning of flow between vertical percolation and lateral subsurface flow was dependent largely on antecedent moisture conditions dry antecedent conditions favored vertical percolation while wet antecedent conditions favored lateral subsurface flow the contributing upslope length for shallow flow to the drain tile pipe system was estimated to vary between 1 6 and 55 6 m depending on the intensity of the rainfall event as well as the antecedent moisture condition for the event the flow occurring laterally above the fragipan layer as observed in the drain tile flow collectors ranged between 3 and 19 of the total effective rainfall allaire et al 2016 applied tracers to 2 m by 2 m plots to investigate shallow 1 5 m preferential lateral and vertical flow in sandy loam soils in an agricultural field in southern quebec canada their semi quantitative observations of dye tracers in trenches showed that lateral flow occurred in part because of buried decomposed tree stumps and a compact soil layer although convincing excavating trenches to observe tracer movement is time consuming and disturbs the subsurface soil structure and it has been noted allaire et al 2009 that non intrusive continuous tracer monitoring methods are needed to overcome the limitations of sampling at discrete locations times when conducting field scale studies of water flow and solute transport in soils in this study time lapse 3d electrical resistivity imaging eri has been used to complement direct sampling of water chemistry and hydraulic heads an expanding migrating low resistivity anomaly emanating from the tracer application area was tracked over a period of one year and interpreted to be representative of the evolving saline tracer plume in the shallow vadose zone resistivities are of course influenced by variations in water saturation and temperature in addition to pore water salinity e g rein et al 2004 some previous applications of time lapse eri have been successful in quantitatively estimating one of these parameters by correcting for temperature and constraining the other hayley et al 2009 hayley et al 2010 for example demonstrated how temperature corrections may be applied to allow estimation of soil water salinity variations from time lapse eri images in a case where water saturation varied only in a narrow range close to 1 similarly jayawickreme et al 2008 2010 demonstrated how temperature corrected time lapse resistivity images could be used to estimate variations in water saturation in the vadose zone in a natural temperate environment where pore water salinity was quite stable in our field experiment we fully expected subsurface resistivities to be influenced by seasonal variations in both water saturation and temperature however the effects of those variations were expected to be very small and exhibit little lateral variability compared to the influence of the saline tracer such that they would not impede our ability to infer migration of the tracer plume the present study is the first to test the conceptual model of recharge and nitrate transport proposed by zebarth et al 2015 by conducting a detailed field investigation of water and solute transport in the shallow subsurface beneath a sloping agricultural field in pei the goal was to determine the significance of the apparent contrast in hydraulic conductivity at the soil till interface on the partitioning of shallow subsurface water flow and nitrate transport between vertical percolation and lateral down slope flow in the shallow variably saturated groundwater system we have employed a combination of hydrological measurements field scale tracer application non intrusive electrical resistivity imaging and numerical simulations to provide a comprehensive assessment of shallow flow and solute transport over a one year period that included the development and dissipation of perched water table conditions above the soil till interface 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was located in field 355 fig 1 at the agriculture and agri food canada aafc harrington research farm located 11 km north of charlottetown pei canada 46 14 n 63 8 w this location was selected for the field experiment because a soil compact till interface was known to be present and the field was also the focus of complementary deep hydrogeological investigations malenica 2015 wang 2017 the surficial soils of pei can be characterized as strongly acidic sandy loams of reddish brown color the soils are classified as podzols macdougall et al 1981 the soils are underlain by a glacial till of varying thickness glacial till across pei is generally quite thin 0 5 m with an average less than 2 m macdougall et al 1981 jiang somers 2009 however there are locations where the thickness of till is as great as 8 m the glacial tills of pei are dominated by a compact basal till covering at least three quarters of the province macdougall et al 1981 the compact basal till is reddish brown in color dense and is of dominantly fine sandy loam texture with lesser amounts of clay macdougall et al 1981 the compact basal till is friable at times of increased saturation however during dry periods it becomes hard macdougall et al 1981 and may act as a barrier to vertical percolation of infiltrating water zebarth et al 2015 horizontal and vertical fractures are also thought to occur in the compact basal till zebarth et al 2015 the pei bedrock aquifer is composed predominantly of fractured reddish brown permo carboniferous sandstone with lesser amounts of claystone mudstone and or siltstone macdougall et al 1981 van de poll 1989 zebarth et al 2015 the sandstone bedrock is fractured principally along horizontal bedding planes although vertical fractures are also present the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock aquifer is therefore generally significantly greater in the horizontal direction jiang and somers 2009 the average annual precipitation in pei 1981 2010 is 1158 mm environment and climate change canada 2015 the total recharge to the bedrock aquifer has been estimated to be 35 45 of the precipitation or approximately 405 520 mm per year jiang and somers 2009 previous studies have sought to characterize the stratigraphy at field 355 malenica 2015 zebarth et al 2015 the soil zone is approximately 1 m thick and contains three horizons a b and c the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil horizons ranges from approximately 0 4 m d to 3 m d while porosity ranges from approximately 41 50 zebarth et al 2015 the soil is underlain by approximately eight meters of compact basal till with a porosity estimated to be 35 zebarth et al 2015 the compact basal till overlies the fractured sandstone bedrock aquifer the bulk hydraulic conductivity of the fractured bedrock is estimated to be 4 m d malenica 2015 with a porosity of 17 zebarth et al 2015 the groundwater table beneath field 355 occurs within the fractured bedrock at an average annual depth of approximately 18 m wang 2017 malenica 2015 field 355 is divided into subsections to accommodate different phases of a standard potato barley clover crop rotation fig 1 in 2014 the crops in field subsections a b and c were potatoes barley and clover respectively the investigations for this study were conducted in subsection b where slope ranges from approximately 4 6 and an area of approximately 200 m2 was selected for the detailed investigations an investigation area of 200 m2 allowed for good control of the various inputs e g water tracer solution while limiting variability in subsurface stratigraphy and the effort required for background characterization prior to the experiments the relatively small area also allowed for high resolution monitoring of the tracer plume using surface eri methods shallow piezometers a subsurface drain tile flow collection system a surface electrical resistivity array a tipping bucket flow gauge and auto sampler were installed at the research site fig 2 the instruments were installed to monitor the occurrence of natural perched water table conditions and to monitor a surface applied tracer test monitoring was conducted from october 2013 to june 2015 the tracer test was executed during the dry summer season so that the volume of fluid being applied to the test area could be accurately managed 2 2 perched water table and soil moisture monitoring eight 50 mm diameter piezometers p1 p8 were installed fig 2 piezometers p1 p6 and p8 were completed just above the soil till interface which was readily identified at a depth of 1 m depth 30 cm by an abrupt increase in the resistance to penetration of a 50 mm diameter hand auger piezometer p7 was installed deeper than the soil till interface to a depth of approximately 2 m all piezometers were equipped with pressure transducers solinst levelogger edge model 3001 or schlumberger mini divers to monitor perched water occurrence two of the loggers in piezometers p2 and p3 also monitored electrical conductivity the loggers were programmed to obtain readings once every hour barometric pressure was also recorded solinst barologger edge model 3001 and the logger data were corrected for barometric pressure changes the elevations of the top of the piezometers were determined and water levels were converted to hydraulic heads manual water level readings were also taken periodically solinst tlc model 107 five soil moisture sensors decagon 5te were also installed these sensors were installed adjacent to piezometers p2 p5 at a depth of 25 cm below ground surface with an additional sensor located adjacent to p2 at 12 cm depth these sensors monitored volumetric soil moisture content bulk soil electrical conductivity and temperature every 15 min 2 3 lateral flow measurement and water sampling drain tile pipes two 10 5 m long sections of perforated pipe were installed at the southeast corner of field subsection b figs 1 and 2 in september 2013 to capture down slope lateral water flow above the soil till interface a trench was excavated down to the soil till interface and polyvinyl plastic sheeting was placed on the down gradient face of the trench while geotextile fabric was placed on the up gradient face to prevent the accumulation of sediment the 100 mm diameter drain tile pipe was then placed and the trench backfilled with a highly permeable clean 31 5 mm crushed stone plastic sheeting was laid over the crushed stone to prevent direct surface infiltration into the trench a flow measurement and water sampling hut for collecting water from the drain tile pipe was subsequently installed the sampling hut contained a 1 3 l tipping bucket for discharge measurement an auto sampler isco model 3700 teledyne isco inc for water sampling a deep cycle battery connected to a solar panel and a datalogger hobo pendant event datalogger ua 003 64 onset computer corporation to record the time of each bucket tip the sampling rate for the auto sampler was first set to 1000 tips sample but was later changed to 500 tips sample on october 23 2014 sampling began at the time of installation october 2013 and continued throughout the course of the study water samples were retrieved periodically from the auto sampler and stored at 5 c for subsequent water quality analyses at the university of new brunswick fredericton 2 4 surface applied tracer test as part of previous investigations two passive capillary samplers pcaps were installed in field 355 approximately 40 m up gradient of the tracer application area water chemistry results for samples collected from the pcaps were used to determine background tracer concentrations at the site during the tracer test water and tracer solution were delivered from a storage tank by gravity flow through a pipe into a 1 2 m 2 4 m infiltration containment system ics consisting of four plywood panels forming a rectangular frame the ics walls were installed 150 mm into the soil leaving about 300 mm above the ground surface the locations of the two ics relative to the piezometers and drain tile pipes are shown in fig 2 the first location ics 1 was abandoned due to a drastic decline in infiltration capacity of the soil during the application of water this was apparently caused by the suspension and clogging of the soil surface with bentonite that was used to seal the inside edges of ics 1 ics 2 was subsequently installed approximately 2 m up slope of ics 1 and used to apply tracer solution for subsequent monitoring ics 1 was used to apply water from june 26 june 30 2014 while ics 2 was used to apply water and tracer solution from july 1 to july 11 2014 table 1 bromide as kbr was selected as the conservative tracer due to low background concentrations at the study site prior to the tracer solution being applied water was added to ics 2 at a rate of approximately 400 l day for 1 day tracer solution was then applied to the ground surface within ics 2 at a concentration of 4675 mg kbr l for 5 days at rates ranging from 350 to 1180 l day the outflow from the storage tank tended to decrease as the water level measured by a pressure transducer deployed on the storage tank decreased following application of the tracer solution fresh water was added to ics 2 for 4 days in attempt to encourage perched conditions in total 5720 l of fresh water and 1350 l of tracer solution containing a total mass of 6 31 kg of kbr 4 21 kg as br were applied to ics 2 2 5 electrical resistivity imaging eri the electrode array consisting of eight lines of 24 electrodes spaced 1 m apart with 1 5 m spacing between lines fig 3 was installed above the region in which the tracer plume was expected to migrate the stainless steel electrodes 20 cm long and 1 cm in diameter were connected to stranded 16 awg copper polyethylene jacketed lead wires using a plastic tubing sleeve that was compressed by a stainless steel pinch clamp and covered with electrical tape to limit corrosion during the year long deployment the electrodes and lead wires were buried 5 cm below the ground surface each line of electrodes was connected to a switching box that was in turn connected to a low power 10 w single channel resistivity meter lippmann model 4ptlight10w powered by a 12 v marine battery recharged by solar panels in total there were 4170 different measurements including a complete set of reciprocals for each resistivity survey these consisted of 2096 in line wenner schlumberger measurements 1834 off line wenner schlumberger measurements and 240 cross line wenner measurements see appendix and lamb 2016 for more details the measurement sequence was loaded into the resistivity meter and ran autonomously on an assigned schedule ranging from four times to once per day each survey required approximately 2 h to acquire the apparent resistivity survey data were processed using dcip3d v 5 0 li and oldenburg 2000 university of british columbia geophysical inversion facility 2014 which is a three dimensional finite volume inverse modeling program this processing yielded smoothness constrained models of the electrical resistivity distribution in the subsurface over time the dcip3d model had a 102 31 25 cell domain 79050 cells this equated to model dimensions length width depth of 44 31 5 13 44 m the individual finite volume dimensions in line length cross line width height ranged from 0 25 0 5 0 25 m immediately beneath the electrode array to padding cells at the outer edges of the model as large as 4 4 2 m more details on the methods used to acquire and process the eri data are provided in the appendix 2 6 numerical flow and transport modeling the hydrological modeling component included the application of two software packages swb salazar and macnutt 2010 and feflow diersch 2014 swb provided a method of performing soil water balance calculations to determine a time series for infiltration feflow was selected to simulate subsurface groundwater flow and solute transport due to its capacity for simulating variably saturated groundwater flow as well as advective dispersive and density dependent contaminant transport swb uses the thornthwaite mather water balance method on daily time steps and requires daily temperature and precipitation environment and climate change canada 2015 as inputs in addition to land use and soil class swb was used to generate surface infiltration boundary conditions for the feflow simulations the feflow model domain was a small portion 348 m2 of field subsection b bound by the two segments of the drain tile pipes and extending upslope beyond the electrode array an equivalent porous media approach was employed for both the overburden and bedrock layers the 3d model for variably saturated flow and transport consisted of 176 976 finite elements with 94 575 nodes with element sizes ranging from approximately 5 cm to 1 8 m key numerical schemes used in the model included 1 the gfem bubnov galerkin finite element method for transport processes i e no upwinding was applied in the model 2 automatic time step control 3 the forward adams bashforth backward trapezoid rule time integration scheme for transient simulations and 4 picard iteration for solution of richard s equation diersch 2014 the surface applied br tracer test was simulated for a 190 day period june 25 2014 to january 1 2015 this simulation duration was chosen to correspond to the field data that were available for comparison the van genuchten unsaturated model van genuchten 1980 was employed for the soil and upper till while a linear unsaturated model diersch 2014 was used for the lower till and bedrock layers table 2 key boundary conditions employed in the numerical simulations are summarized in table 3 the cumulative tipping bucket flow data were used to calibrate the 3d variably saturated flow model the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the upper till kv the van genuchten fitting parameter α of the soil layers and the porosity η of the soil layers were varied during the model calibration and sensitivity analysis in the sensitivity analysis each of the three parameters used for calibration was adjusted to assess the sensitivity while the other calibration parameters were held at the calibrated values 2 7 water and tracer mass balance methods water balance calculations were performed using a topographically delineated catchment area for the drain tile system the measured tipping bucket discharge volume the

catchment l3 vl lateral flow volume as determined from the drain tile pipe discharge l3 δs change in soil moisture storage as determined from soil moisture sensor data l3 the primary assumptions for this analysis were that the topography of the soil till interface followed the ground surface topography which is believed to be justified based on hand auger investigations in the field and that there was no surface runoff during the precipitation events an additional assumption was that the soil moisture content over the full depth 1 m of the soil layers was equal to the values measured by the soil moisture sensors the topographically derived catchment area assumed to be the subsurface area contributing water to the drain tile pipes was determined using the ground surface elevation map for field 355 fig 1 the slope flow length was defined by extending a line perpendicular to the ground surface elevation contours up gradient of the drain tile pipes to the local topographic high the catchment area was then approximated as a triangle with a base equal to the distance between the two extents of the drain tiles pipes and a height equal to the slope flow length a mass balance

3 1 hydrological and hydrogeophysical monitoring the first occurrence of a perched water table on june 26 2014 was a result of the application of water to ics 1 followed by the application of water and tracer to ics 2 fig 4 perched water table conditions persisted for the duration of water and tracer solution application june 26 to july 12 after which they quickly receded during the dry summer months july september there was no occurrence of a perched water table with the exception of one brief event on september 21 22 fig 4 resulting from 65 mm of rainfall during the july september period a total of 270 mm of precipitation was recorded at the charlottetown eccc weather station however high evapotranspiration and root zone moisture storage meant that this resulted in negligible infiltration past the root zone following the growing season a period of sustained perched water table conditions began on october 22 2014 and persisted until approximately january 1 2015 this was followed by snowpack accumulation during the cold winter months january april and dissipation of the perched water table a perched water table occurred beginning may 5 2015 as a result of snowmelt caused by increased air temperatures the tracer test beginning june 26 2014 did not result in lateral flow into the drain tile flow collection system fig 5 the antecedent moisture conditions of the subsurface were presumably too dry to produce significant lateral migration above the soil till interface some lateral flow into the drain tile pipes did occur on september 22 because of an isolated precipitation event however as with the piezometer water levels sustained lateral flow did not begin until october 22 fig 5 lateral down slope flow continued as the perched water levels persisted through the late fall into winter lateral flow then ceased during snowpack accumulation and recommenced during spring snowmelt in 2015 the fall winter infiltration period october 24 to december 18 yielded a total lateral flow volume of 30 093 l as measured by the drain tile collection system the cumulative infiltration simulated with the swb model for the same time interval was 295 mm multiplying 295 mm by the topographically derived catchment area of 3670 m2 yields a total infiltration volume of 1082 650 l the average soil moisture content increased from 0 355 immediately prior to october 24 to 0 363 on january 1 representing a total change in soil moisture storage of 29 360 l for a 3670 m2 area and assumed soil depth of 1 m using these values in eq 1 produces a total vertical flow volume past the soil till interface of 1 023 197 l which is approximately 94 5 of the total infiltration volume approximately 2 8 of the infiltration volume contributed to lateral flow into the drain tile pipes and 2 7 to changes in soil moisture storage bromide concentrations in piezometers p1 p3 and p6 remained consistently above the background concentration as measured in the pcaps throughout the fall infiltration period fig 6 the br concentrations in these wells decreased over the duration of the monitoring period with concentrations in p3 and p6 returning to below the background concentration on may 12 2015 fig 6 the auto sampler br concentrations did not significantly exceed the background concentration until december 25 excepting two samples collected on october 26 and november 2 after which the concentrations were consistently above the background concentration a mass balance was performed using the auto sampler br data eq 2 knowing that the total mass of br applied was 4 21 kg the total br recovered in the auto sampler water samples was estimated as 7 47 g as of may 12 representing only 0 18 of the applied mass a decrease in resistivity directly below the ics2 tracer application area was apparent on day 3 as shown in fig 7 which illustrates the evolution of resistivity variations in a horizontal slice 0 5 m below ground surface some lateral transport of the tracer was evident by day 8 as shown by the spreading of the low resistivity plume in fig 7 very little additional lateral migration of the tracer at this shallow depth was resolved by the eri surveys following day 8 the vertical section time lapse resistivity images in fig 8 and resistivity ratio images in fig 9 show that the plume remained predominantly above the soil till interface prior to day 8 the day 22 resistivity images show a relative increase in resistivity in the soil zone immediately below the application area 1 m depth but decreased resistivities extended vertically below the soil till interface the reduction in resistivity in the soil zone was a result of a rainfall event 65 mm occurring on september 21 and 22 i e day 87 and 88 of the test infiltrating rainfall caused a portion of the tracer contained in the residual moisture of the soil zone to be flushed past the soil till interface this can be attributed to both reduced water saturation in the soil zone water application stopped on day 12 and vertical migration of the tracer plume by day 88 soil resistivity at depths 1 m below the application area had decreased further indicating that tracer was continuing to move vertically past the soil till interface the day 179 sections display an increase above the soil till interface and a significant decrease in resistivity below the soil till interface demonstrating further vertical migration of the tracer the resistivity image for day 357 was very similar to that for day 179 indicating that no detectable lateral transport of the applied tracer above the soil till interface had occurred as a point of interest unrelated to the tracer test fig 8 shows that the resistivity of the upper 1 m across the whole of section a a was about three times higher on june 18 2015 than it had been one year earlier on june 25 2014 this may be a consequence of residual fertilizer applied to fields in spring 2014 prior to the tracer test having been leached away by infiltrating rain and snowmelt in fall 2014 and spring 2015 respectively 3 2 numerical modeling of flow and solute transport the three dimensional variably saturated flow model was calibrated using the drain tile cumulative flow data for the period of june 25 2014 to january 1 2015 the measured and simulated results for cumulative flow into the drain tiles are shown in fig 10 while the simulated and observed hydraulic heads at p1 and p4 are shown in fig 11 the parameters adjusted during model calibration were the saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity of the soil layers the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity of the upper till the van genuchten fitting parameter α for the soil layers and the porosity of the soil layers the r2 value residuals standard deviation sd root of the mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae for the calibrated model were 0 978 1360 l 3336 l and 3046 l respectively the calibrated parameter values are given in table 2 the values used for solute transport simulation are given in table 4 the dispersivities were estimated based on the scale of the tracer plume transport and are generally consistent with those presented by zech et al 2015 the calibrated model replicated the observed cumulative flow data quite well the observed cumulative lateral flow was 30 898 l as of january 1 2015 while the simulated cumulative flow was 30 781 l for the same time interval despite good agreement between the observed and predicted flows and timing of perched water table conditions the calibrated model tended to under estimate the observed hydraulic head values fig 11 the two sensitivity simulations presented in fig 10 illustrate the impact of varying the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the shallow till on the simulated drain tile discharge a relative increase of 23 for the shallow till vertical hydraulic conductivity results in a relative decrease of 19 for the total simulated drain tile flow conversely a relative decrease of 14 for the shallow till vertical hydraulic conductivity results in a relative increase of 15 for the total simulated drain tile flow in addition the effect of varying the van genuchten scale parameter α for the soil layers on the simulated drain tile flows was assessed results not shown the results indicated that increasing α from 4 to 10 m 1 resulted in a 173 increase in the simulated total drain tile flow while decreasing α from 4 to 1 m 1 resulted in a 43 decrease in the in the simulated total drain tile flow 4 discussion 4 1 field observations water balance calculations revealed that lateral down slope flow was approximately 3 of the total water volume infiltrated from october 27 2014 to january 1 2015 the subsurface catchment area used for this calculation was necessarily an approximation and it is possible that the actual contributing area was larger or smaller than that computed which would result in under over estimation of the vertical flow through the soil till interface however a relative increase of 20 for the catchment area would increase the estimated proportion of vertical flow by only 0 5 suggesting low sensitivity to the catchment area similarly a 20 decrease in the catchment area would decrease the vertical flow component by only 0 7 uncertainty associated with the swb computed infiltration or in the measured change in soil moisture storage would also contribute to potential uncertainty in the estimate of the proportion of vertical flow the br plume was observed to largely remain above the soil till interface as indicated by the eri images from the time of application through to the beginning of the wet season at which point a period of sustained perched conditions developed beginning october 23 during perched water table conditions a horizontal advective transport velocity of 1 m day was estimated using the porosity of the soil layers 0 44 the average hydraulic gradient 0 049 and the saturated horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the overlying soil 8 m day inferred from feflow calibration the shortest distance of the tracer plume to the down gradient drain tile pipes was approximately 7 m at the beginning of the wet season as seen in the eri results therefore the expected advective travel time for br to reach the drain tile pipes was approximately seven days from the beginning of the wet season the first occurrence of br concentrations significantly above background was on october 27 four days after the beginning of the wet season the shorter travel time may be attributed to the inability of the eri instrumentation to resolve low br concentrations near the leading edge of the plume or preferential transport pathways through zones of higher than average hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil layer the impact of the soil till interface on tracer transport can be inferred through comparison of the eri vertical images for days 3 and 8 figs 8 and 9 an apparent impediment of the tracer transport was observed at a depth of approximately 1 m and the migration of the tracer was mostly lateral above this depth this is attributed to the perched water table conditions present at the initiation of the tracer test in the immediate vicinity of the application area as indicated by water table elevations in piezometer p1 fig 4 from days 1 12 the highest tracer concentrations were still above the soil till interface on day 88 fig 8 just prior to the onset of the natural perched water table conditions that persisted through most of the fall from october 25 january 1 however the subsequent image from day 179 december 22 2014 figs 8 and 9 indicates that the tracer migration during the fall winter infiltration period october 24 2014 to december 22 2014 was dominantly vertical thus the vertical and plan view fig 7 eri images indicate that the bulk of the applied tracer mass had migrated vertically through the soil till interface rather than laterally down slope 4 2 numerical simulation despite the close agreement between the observed and simulated volumetric water discharge to the tile drains fig 10 the simulated pressure heads above the soil till interface were generally lower than those observed fig 11 daniels and fritton 1994 simulated groundwater mounding above a shallow fragiudalf using a finite element solution to richards equation in their study as was the case in this study the simulated perched water table elevation was consistently lower by approximately 70 cm in both studies than the observed water table elevation they used an exponential relationship to model the dependence of the hydraulic conductivity on soil water suction head and attributed some of the error to this approximation they also attributed some of the model error to possible unidentified heterogeneity within the low permeability layer i e discontinuities and or secondary porosity may have contributed to increased permeability the current study also lacked detailed measurements for the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the soil and shallow till and used model calibration to arrive at these parameters while underestimating the hydraulic heads the calibrated model adequately simulated periods of perched water table conditions and volumetric discharge to the drain tiles these two model outputs were considered most relevant for interpreting the bulk movement of the applied tracer a qualitative comparison between the feflow simulated tracer plume and the eri results is provided in fig 12 the eri data and simulation results for july 3 and july 8 are in good agreement as both show that the tracer had remained above the soil till interface the simulation results for july 22 show the migration of relatively low tracer concentrations below the soil till interface while the eri results show more apparent vertical migration of the tracer past the soil till interface by december 22 the simulation results show that much of the tracer mass exists below the soil till interface the eri data for december 22 show the same general distribution of the applied tracer the estimated cumulative bromide mass collected by the tile drains was 3 5 g 0 08 of the applied mass as of january 1 2015 the transport simulation produced a cumulative br mass for the same time period of 122 g which is 2 9 of the simulated applied mass of br the transport simulation results therefore suggest greater lateral migration of the tracer plume than was evident in either the drain tile or eri results however both the simulation results and field data indicate that the bulk of the tracer mass did not reach the down slope drain tiles but instead migrated vertically it should also be noted that the eri array would not have been able to resolve the minor changes in conductivity that would have been associated with the leading edge of the plume because the change in bulk resistivity of the soil associated with the low concentration region of the plume would not be easily differentiated from the background images 4 3 implications for the fate of agricultural nitrate in pei the findings of this field experiment have several important implications for the transport of nitrate in this setting if the applied tracer is considered a surrogate for nitrate derived from fertilizer application allowing for the time necessary for the applied ammonium fertilizer to be converted to nitrate fertilizer for potato production is typically applied at the time of potato planting in the spring and leaching of fertilizer derived nitrate as well as nitrate derived from mineralization of soil organic nitrogen would be initiated by infiltration events following the application of fertilizer although some limited nitrate leaching may occur during the growing season in response to significant rainfall events the tracer test has shown that the majority of nitrate transport past the soil till interface would be expected to occur during the fall and winter the bulk of the applied tracer mass and by inference nitrate would be expected to remain above the soil till interface during the relatively dry growing season e g fig 8 the model sensitivity simulations fig 10 illustrate the importance of the contrast in hydraulic conductivity between the soil layers and the underlying till on the partitioning of lateral and vertical flows the hydrogeological property contrasts i e a ratio of approximately 650 1 between the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil layers and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the shallow till at the site were such that significant lateral flows approximately 3 for the monitoring period did not occur however lateral flow may become more significant at sites where there is a greater contrast in permeability between these materials the tracer test results and the supporting numerical simulations indicate that there was a tendency for the br tracer to migrate vertically through the compact till i e soil till interface nitrate being a mobile and conservative solute neglecting the potential for denitrification at the near surface would therefore also be expected to follow the same transport pathway jiang et al 2015b discussed that flow and nitrate transport through predominantly sub vertical fractures may be important in the deep vadose zone i e 1 m depth thus providing for potentially rapid deep penetration of agricultural nitrate considering the lack of a significant impediment to vertical migration of the tracer plume as revealed in this study the fate of the majority of nitrate leached from the root zone is expected to be deep groundwater barring any lateral flow occurring in the deeper vadose zone this finding is consistent with elevated nitrate concentrations of more than 10 mg l no3 n that have been observed in deep 15 m monitoring wells installed at field 355 malenica 2015 5 conclusions this study utilized a surface applied tracer test in conjunction with hydrogeophysical and hydrogeological monitoring methods to investigate water and solute transport in the shallow vadose zone above a soil compact till interface the study was designed to improve the understanding of nitrate transport after leaching from the root zone of agricultural crops in prince edward island the shallow piezometer and drain tile discharge data clearly demonstrated the development of sustained perched water table conditions and the occurrence of lateral down slope flow during the late fall winter and spring periods the perched water table conditions that occurred in the fall winter were attributed to infiltration of rainfall and reduced evapotranspiration while those occurring in spring were dominantly a result of snowmelt infiltration during perched water table conditions saturated soil zone thicknesses of up to 100 cm developed above the soil till interface and the lateral hydraulic gradients were consistent with down slope flow the duration of continuous perched conditions varied from hours following rainfall events to approximately 2 5 months during the late fall however water mass balance estimates indicated that even during the extended period of perched conditions in the fall 95 of infiltrating water percolated vertically through the soil till interface observations of tracer movement as imaged by three dimensional electrical resistivity monitoring and quantified by br concentrations in piezometers and drain tiles showed that the tracer spread laterally above the compact till layer during the short approximately 4 days period of perched conditions resulting from its application following that period however the majority of the surface applied tracer mass was observed to migrate vertically through the subsurface despite the presence of perched water table conditions the numerical flow and transport modeling results also showed that the majority of the br tracer migrated vertically into the soil till interface which suggests the fate of leached nitrate would primarily be the deeper bedrock aquifer water table as a result it is concluded that the presence of the low permeability soil till interface does not promote sufficient lateral down slope transport of nitrate to mitigate to a significant extent the vertical migration of nitrate towards deeper groundwater lateral flow and transport may be more significant at sites with a greater contrast in permeability between the soil and underlying till investigations at this site show that lateral water flow and solute transport above the compact till layer are relatively minor and therefore unlikely to be a significant contributor to nitrate in surface water bodies ponds streams estuaries at the base of slopes as a consequence it is expected that response times of both surface water and groundwater nitrate concentrations to changes in bmps depends on the combined residence times of water in the shallow and deep

meter provided a maximum output current of 100 ma a maximum output voltage of 380 v peak to peak and utilized a 5 hz square wave waveform the surveys utilized a sequence containing in line and off line wenner schlumberger array configurations lamb 2016 the off line configurations provided increased sensitivity to areas between survey lines effective depths of exploration were varied by using a spacings of 1 4 m and n values of 1 5 as defined in fig a 1 the maximum effective depths of exploration for these measurements or more precisely the maximum median depths of exploration were approximately 3 6 m barker 1989 loke 2012 additional sensitivity to regions between survey lines was provided by a series of cross line measurements using the wenner array with a spacings of 1 5 3 m reciprocal measurements were performed current dipole becomes potential dipole and vice versa for all measurements in line off line and cross line measurements the dcip3d inversion code seeks to obtain a model that reproduces the observed apparent resistivity data to within a tolerance that is justified by the estimated errors associated with measurement and discretization based on a trial and error approach errors of 5 were assigned to each apparent resistivity measurement although that value was significantly higher than the typical reciprocal errors it must also account for inaccuracies in the modeling related to discretization of the geology and linearization of the inverse problem a value of 5 was selected to prevent the inversion algorithm from generating artifacts suggestive of over fitting the data due to the non uniqueness of the inversion process various models could be obtained that adequately reproduce the observed data dcip3d like many inversion algorithms may be configured to seek the particular resistivity model ρ that is as close as possible to some reference model ρ0 sometimes called a smallest model or the model that deviates as smoothly as possible from the reference model i e minimizes the gradient of ρ ρ0 a so called flattest model in this case we chose not to bias the solution towards any particular reference model the algorithm therefore effectively sought a model that fit the data for which resistivity varied as smoothly as possible in space minimizing the gradient of ρ such a smooth model inversion is not unreasonable in seeking to resolve the shape of a conductive tracer plume however it may be expected that the recovered model will tend to smear out any sharp changes in resistivity associated with the plume or subsurface geology inversions for resistivity models were performed on select eri data sets independently to illustrate movement of the conductive tracer over time the starting model for each inversion was a homogeneous half space with a resistivity set equal to the average measured apparent resistivity i e the default starting model used by dcip3d variations in resistivity over time were emphasized by taking the ratio of the resistivity model obtained at a given time to the resistivity model obtained immediately prior to tracer application methodological studies of time lapse eri e g kim et al 2009 hayley et al 2011 loke et al 2014 have pointed out that other approaches to time lapse inversion such as inverting the differences between apparent resistivity measurements at different times or otherwise simultaneously inverting data sets acquired at different times can help to improve the resolution of anomalous features with less risk of introducing artifacts however the method of comparing resistivity models obtained by independent inversions yielded physically reasonable results and was simpler to implement given the hundreds of data sets acquired over the course of a year particularly given that some data sets e g late sept 2014 had reduced numbers of active electrodes cell weighting functions were used to increase the bias towards model smoothness at shallow depths thereby counter acting a tendency for the inversion algorithm to introduce excessive variability near the electrodes where sensitivity is greatest values for cell weighting ranged from 1 to 32 a weight of 32 was applied to the top layer of the model the weight was then reduced by a factor of 2 for every 25 cm of depth until a base weight of 1 was reached at a depth of 125 cm several filters were applied to the survey data prior to inverse modeling with dcip3d these data filters removed apparent resistivity measurements having negative voltages poor repeatability 5 error poor reciprocals 5 difference and excessively small currents 1 ma symptomatic of excessively high electrode contact resistances the number of discarded measurements generally did not exceed 20 1 of the acquired measurements poor reciprocal measurements indicative of systematic errors and or low signal to noise ratios kilfu et al 2016 typically accounted for the greatest number of rejected measurements these filters were applied to assure quality data for inversion in dcip3d 
6538,intensive potato production is an important contributor to groundwater and surface water nitrate contamination in the province of prince edward island pei canada in pei the presence of a permeability contrast between soil and the underlying compact basal till at approximately 1 m depth is known to cause temporary perched water table conditions but the implications for agricultural nitrate transport are not well understood this study is the first detailed field investigation to examine the impact of the soil compact basal till interface on vertical and lateral subsurface flow of water and solutes on a moderate hillslope in pei a surface applied tracer test was conducted and a shallow drain tile pipe system with a tipping bucket gauge was installed down gradient of the tracer application to monitor lateral subsurface flow in addition three dimensional electrical resistivity imaging eri was employed to monitor the evolution of the applied tracer plume over a period of 1 year a small scale transient flow and transport model was used to simulate the tracer test and to investigate the sensitivity of tracer transport to selected parameters primarily the hydraulic conductivities of the soils and underlying compact basal till monitoring conducted from october 2013 to june 2015 and numerical modeling showed a strong tendency for vertical flow of water and tracer through the soil compact basal till interface as opposed to lateral down slope subsurface flow water balance calculations estimated a total vertical flow of 94 5 of the infiltration for the october 2014 to january 2015 period the preference for vertical over lateral flow and transport was consistent with electrical resistivity images for the same time period these findings indicate that the fate of infiltrating water and dissolved nitrate is the deeper bedrock aquifer water table and that intermittent perched water table conditions do not result in significant lateral flow toward nearby surface waters keywords nitrate contamination vadose zone flow and transport tracer test electrical resistivity imaging numerical modeling 1 introduction there is growing concern in many regions over nitrate contamination of groundwater and surface water due to a variety of anthropogenic activities including intensive agriculture for example groundwater nitrate concentrations greater than the maximum acceptable concentration for drinking water 10 mg l no3 n health canada 2013 have been observed in agricultural regions within the province of prince edward island pei canada commission on nitrates in groundwater in pei 2008 benson et al 2006 excessive nitrate in groundwater can also lead to increased groundwater transported nitrate loadings to surface water which presents a risk to aquatic life if anoxic conditions develop the prominence of elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater and surface water in pei has largely been attributed to the significant percentage approximately 15 of the land base that is used for potato production benson et al 2006 zebarth et al 2015 jiang et al 2015b the issue of groundwater contamination is especially important in pei because the entire drinking water supply for the province is drawn from the fractured sandstone aquifer the occurrence of anoxic conditions as a result of heavy nutrient loading to streams and estuaries has also been documented in pei e g finley et al 2013 there is a growing consensus that land use changes or nutrient reduction strategies including agricultural best management practices bmps will be required to reduce nutrient loadings to groundwater and surface waters danielescu and macquarrie 2011 zebarth et al 2015 jiang et al 2015b recent studies have shown that the implementation of certain bmps could result in an overall reduction in nitrate loading to the pei aquifer jiang et al 2015a zebarth et al 2015 however the movement of water and solutes after leaching from the root zone has not been investigated in detail and it has been suggested by zebarth et al 2015 that shallow subsurface soil conditions and topography will play a role in controlling nitrate transport in particular the sudden decrease in hydraulic conductivity between the lower boundary of the soil zone and the upper boundary of the compact glacial till at approximately 1 m depth results in the occurrence of an intermittent perched water table that may be a key determinant in promoting the lateral movement of water and solutes to surface water bodies as opposed to vertical percolation towards the bedrock aquifer such lateral transport would have implications for loading of nitrate to surface waters via shallow lateral drainage and for the lag time between implementing bmps and detecting significant water quality improvements jiang et al 2017 recently investigated the response time of groundwater nitrate concentrations to the implementation of bmps at an agricultural field site in pei the study utilized water chemistry data and water levels from multi level groundwater monitoring wells that were monitored over a period of 2 5 years a lag time of approximately 2 4 years was estimated from the near surface i e water and nitrate percolating past the root zone to the groundwater table at a depth of approximately 5 6 m the calculation assumed uniform non preferential and steady vertical flow through the vadose zone these simplifying assumptions therefore did not account for the potential impact of a permeability contrast between shallow soil and the underlying glacial till on the travel pathway and residence time of water and thus nitrate several field scale experimental approaches have been used in previous studies to investigate shallow subsurface flow and associated solute transport for example dahlke et al 2012 used a tile drain system as a means of collecting lateral flow in a silt loam soil overlying a shallow relatively impermeable soil layer fragipan in new york state usa drain tile pipes were installed at the interface between the fragipan layer and the overlying soil and near the surface i e 10 cm from ground surface to measure lateral subsurface flow and near surface runoff respectively deep percolation was determined by subtracting the lateral subsurface flow and near surface runoff from the total drain tile pipe discharge the study concluded that the partitioning of flow between vertical percolation and lateral subsurface flow was dependent largely on antecedent moisture conditions dry antecedent conditions favored vertical percolation while wet antecedent conditions favored lateral subsurface flow the contributing upslope length for shallow flow to the drain tile pipe system was estimated to vary between 1 6 and 55 6 m depending on the intensity of the rainfall event as well as the antecedent moisture condition for the event the flow occurring laterally above the fragipan layer as observed in the drain tile flow collectors ranged between 3 and 19 of the total effective rainfall allaire et al 2016 applied tracers to 2 m by 2 m plots to investigate shallow 1 5 m preferential lateral and vertical flow in sandy loam soils in an agricultural field in southern quebec canada their semi quantitative observations of dye tracers in trenches showed that lateral flow occurred in part because of buried decomposed tree stumps and a compact soil layer although convincing excavating trenches to observe tracer movement is time consuming and disturbs the subsurface soil structure and it has been noted allaire et al 2009 that non intrusive continuous tracer monitoring methods are needed to overcome the limitations of sampling at discrete locations times when conducting field scale studies of water flow and solute transport in soils in this study time lapse 3d electrical resistivity imaging eri has been used to complement direct sampling of water chemistry and hydraulic heads an expanding migrating low resistivity anomaly emanating from the tracer application area was tracked over a period of one year and interpreted to be representative of the evolving saline tracer plume in the shallow vadose zone resistivities are of course influenced by variations in water saturation and temperature in addition to pore water salinity e g rein et al 2004 some previous applications of time lapse eri have been successful in quantitatively estimating one of these parameters by correcting for temperature and constraining the other hayley et al 2009 hayley et al 2010 for example demonstrated how temperature corrections may be applied to allow estimation of soil water salinity variations from time lapse eri images in a case where water saturation varied only in a narrow range close to 1 similarly jayawickreme et al 2008 2010 demonstrated how temperature corrected time lapse resistivity images could be used to estimate variations in water saturation in the vadose zone in a natural temperate environment where pore water salinity was quite stable in our field experiment we fully expected subsurface resistivities to be influenced by seasonal variations in both water saturation and temperature however the effects of those variations were expected to be very small and exhibit little lateral variability compared to the influence of the saline tracer such that they would not impede our ability to infer migration of the tracer plume the present study is the first to test the conceptual model of recharge and nitrate transport proposed by zebarth et al 2015 by conducting a detailed field investigation of water and solute transport in the shallow subsurface beneath a sloping agricultural field in pei the goal was to determine the significance of the apparent contrast in hydraulic conductivity at the soil till interface on the partitioning of shallow subsurface water flow and nitrate transport between vertical percolation and lateral down slope flow in the shallow variably saturated groundwater system we have employed a combination of hydrological measurements field scale tracer application non intrusive electrical resistivity imaging and numerical simulations to provide a comprehensive assessment of shallow flow and solute transport over a one year period that included the development and dissipation of perched water table conditions above the soil till interface 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was located in field 355 fig 1 at the agriculture and agri food canada aafc harrington research farm located 11 km north of charlottetown pei canada 46 14 n 63 8 w this location was selected for the field experiment because a soil compact till interface was known to be present and the field was also the focus of complementary deep hydrogeological investigations malenica 2015 wang 2017 the surficial soils of pei can be characterized as strongly acidic sandy loams of reddish brown color the soils are classified as podzols macdougall et al 1981 the soils are underlain by a glacial till of varying thickness glacial till across pei is generally quite thin 0 5 m with an average less than 2 m macdougall et al 1981 jiang somers 2009 however there are locations where the thickness of till is as great as 8 m the glacial tills of pei are dominated by a compact basal till covering at least three quarters of the province macdougall et al 1981 the compact basal till is reddish brown in color dense and is of dominantly fine sandy loam texture with lesser amounts of clay macdougall et al 1981 the compact basal till is friable at times of increased saturation however during dry periods it becomes hard macdougall et al 1981 and may act as a barrier to vertical percolation of infiltrating water zebarth et al 2015 horizontal and vertical fractures are also thought to occur in the compact basal till zebarth et al 2015 the pei bedrock aquifer is composed predominantly of fractured reddish brown permo carboniferous sandstone with lesser amounts of claystone mudstone and or siltstone macdougall et al 1981 van de poll 1989 zebarth et al 2015 the sandstone bedrock is fractured principally along horizontal bedding planes although vertical fractures are also present the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock aquifer is therefore generally significantly greater in the horizontal direction jiang and somers 2009 the average annual precipitation in pei 1981 2010 is 1158 mm environment and climate change canada 2015 the total recharge to the bedrock aquifer has been estimated to be 35 45 of the precipitation or approximately 405 520 mm per year jiang and somers 2009 previous studies have sought to characterize the stratigraphy at field 355 malenica 2015 zebarth et al 2015 the soil zone is approximately 1 m thick and contains three horizons a b and c the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil horizons ranges from approximately 0 4 m d to 3 m d while porosity ranges from approximately 41 50 zebarth et al 2015 the soil is underlain by approximately eight meters of compact basal till with a porosity estimated to be 35 zebarth et al 2015 the compact basal till overlies the fractured sandstone bedrock aquifer the bulk hydraulic conductivity of the fractured bedrock is estimated to be 4 m d malenica 2015 with a porosity of 17 zebarth et al 2015 the groundwater table beneath field 355 occurs within the fractured bedrock at an average annual depth of approximately 18 m wang 2017 malenica 2015 field 355 is divided into subsections to accommodate different phases of a standard potato barley clover crop rotation fig 1 in 2014 the crops in field subsections a b and c were potatoes barley and clover respectively the investigations for this study were conducted in subsection b where slope ranges from approximately 4 6 and an area of approximately 200 m2 was selected for the detailed investigations an investigation area of 200 m2 allowed for good control of the various inputs e g water tracer solution while limiting variability in subsurface stratigraphy and the effort required for background characterization prior to the experiments the relatively small area also allowed for high resolution monitoring of the tracer plume using surface eri methods shallow piezometers a subsurface drain tile flow collection system a surface electrical resistivity array a tipping bucket flow gauge and auto sampler were installed at the research site fig 2 the instruments were installed to monitor the occurrence of natural perched water table conditions and to monitor a surface applied tracer test monitoring was conducted from october 2013 to june 2015 the tracer test was executed during the dry summer season so that the volume of fluid being applied to the test area could be accurately managed 2 2 perched water table and soil moisture monitoring eight 50 mm diameter piezometers p1 p8 were installed fig 2 piezometers p1 p6 and p8 were completed just above the soil till interface which was readily identified at a depth of 1 m depth 30 cm by an abrupt increase in the resistance to penetration of a 50 mm diameter hand auger piezometer p7 was installed deeper than the soil till interface to a depth of approximately 2 m all piezometers were equipped with pressure transducers solinst levelogger edge model 3001 or schlumberger mini divers to monitor perched water occurrence two of the loggers in piezometers p2 and p3 also monitored electrical conductivity the loggers were programmed to obtain readings once every hour barometric pressure was also recorded solinst barologger edge model 3001 and the logger data were corrected for barometric pressure changes the elevations of the top of the piezometers were determined and water levels were converted to hydraulic heads manual water level readings were also taken periodically solinst tlc model 107 five soil moisture sensors decagon 5te were also installed these sensors were installed adjacent to piezometers p2 p5 at a depth of 25 cm below ground surface with an additional sensor located adjacent to p2 at 12 cm depth these sensors monitored volumetric soil moisture content bulk soil electrical conductivity and temperature every 15 min 2 3 lateral flow measurement and water sampling drain tile pipes two 10 5 m long sections of perforated pipe were installed at the southeast corner of field subsection b figs 1 and 2 in september 2013 to capture down slope lateral water flow above the soil till interface a trench was excavated down to the soil till interface and polyvinyl plastic sheeting was placed on the down gradient face of the trench while geotextile fabric was placed on the up gradient face to prevent the accumulation of sediment the 100 mm diameter drain tile pipe was then placed and the trench backfilled with a highly permeable clean 31 5 mm crushed stone plastic sheeting was laid over the crushed stone to prevent direct surface infiltration into the trench a flow measurement and water sampling hut for collecting water from the drain tile pipe was subsequently installed the sampling hut contained a 1 3 l tipping bucket for discharge measurement an auto sampler isco model 3700 teledyne isco inc for water sampling a deep cycle battery connected to a solar panel and a datalogger hobo pendant event datalogger ua 003 64 onset computer corporation to record the time of each bucket tip the sampling rate for the auto sampler was first set to 1000 tips sample but was later changed to 500 tips sample on october 23 2014 sampling began at the time of installation october 2013 and continued throughout the course of the study water samples were retrieved periodically from the auto sampler and stored at 5 c for subsequent water quality analyses at the university of new brunswick fredericton 2 4 surface applied tracer test as part of previous investigations two passive capillary samplers pcaps were installed in field 355 approximately 40 m up gradient of the tracer application area water chemistry results for samples collected from the pcaps were used to determine background tracer concentrations at the site during the tracer test water and tracer solution were delivered from a storage tank by gravity flow through a pipe into a 1 2 m 2 4 m infiltration containment system ics consisting of four plywood panels forming a rectangular frame the ics walls were installed 150 mm into the soil leaving about 300 mm above the ground surface the locations of the two ics relative to the piezometers and drain tile pipes are shown in fig 2 the first location ics 1 was abandoned due to a drastic decline in infiltration capacity of the soil during the application of water this was apparently caused by the suspension and clogging of the soil surface with bentonite that was used to seal the inside edges of ics 1 ics 2 was subsequently installed approximately 2 m up slope of ics 1 and used to apply tracer solution for subsequent monitoring ics 1 was used to apply water from june 26 june 30 2014 while ics 2 was used to apply water and tracer solution from july 1 to july 11 2014 table 1 bromide as kbr was selected as the conservative tracer due to low background concentrations at the study site prior to the tracer solution being applied water was added to ics 2 at a rate of approximately 400 l day for 1 day tracer solution was then applied to the ground surface within ics 2 at a concentration of 4675 mg kbr l for 5 days at rates ranging from 350 to 1180 l day the outflow from the storage tank tended to decrease as the water level measured by a pressure transducer deployed on the storage tank decreased following application of the tracer solution fresh water was added to ics 2 for 4 days in attempt to encourage perched conditions in total 5720 l of fresh water and 1350 l of tracer solution containing a total mass of 6 31 kg of kbr 4 21 kg as br were applied to ics 2 2 5 electrical resistivity imaging eri the electrode array consisting of eight lines of 24 electrodes spaced 1 m apart with 1 5 m spacing between lines fig 3 was installed above the region in which the tracer plume was expected to migrate the stainless steel electrodes 20 cm long and 1 cm in diameter were connected to stranded 16 awg copper polyethylene jacketed lead wires using a plastic tubing sleeve that was compressed by a stainless steel pinch clamp and covered with electrical tape to limit corrosion during the year long deployment the electrodes and lead wires were buried 5 cm below the ground surface each line of electrodes was connected to a switching box that was in turn connected to a low power 10 w single channel resistivity meter lippmann model 4ptlight10w powered by a 12 v marine battery recharged by solar panels in total there were 4170 different measurements including a complete set of reciprocals for each resistivity survey these consisted of 2096 in line wenner schlumberger measurements 1834 off line wenner schlumberger measurements and 240 cross line wenner measurements see appendix and lamb 2016 for more details the measurement sequence was loaded into the resistivity meter and ran autonomously on an assigned schedule ranging from four times to once per day each survey required approximately 2 h to acquire the apparent resistivity survey data were processed using dcip3d v 5 0 li and oldenburg 2000 university of british columbia geophysical inversion facility 2014 which is a three dimensional finite volume inverse modeling program this processing yielded smoothness constrained models of the electrical resistivity distribution in the subsurface over time the dcip3d model had a 102 31 25 cell domain 79050 cells this equated to model dimensions length width depth of 44 31 5 13 44 m the individual finite volume dimensions in line length cross line width height ranged from 0 25 0 5 0 25 m immediately beneath the electrode array to padding cells at the outer edges of the model as large as 4 4 2 m more details on the methods used to acquire and process the eri data are provided in the appendix 2 6 numerical flow and transport modeling the hydrological modeling component included the application of two software packages swb salazar and macnutt 2010 and feflow diersch 2014 swb provided a method of performing soil water balance calculations to determine a time series

and density dependent contaminant transport swb uses the thornthwaite mather water balance method on daily time steps and requires daily temperature and precipitation environment and climate change canada 2015 as inputs in addition to land use and soil class swb was used to generate surface infiltration boundary conditions for the feflow simulations the feflow model domain was a small portion 348 m2 of field subsection b bound by the two segments of the drain tile pipes and extending upslope beyond the electrode array an equivalent porous media approach was employed for both the overburden and bedrock layers the 3d model for variably saturated flow and transport consisted of 176 976 finite elements with 94 575 nodes with element sizes ranging from approximately 5 cm to 1 8 m key numerical schemes used in the model included 1 the gfem bubnov galerkin finite element method for transport processes i e no upwinding was applied in the model 2 automatic time step control 3 the forward adams bashforth backward trapezoid rule time integration scheme for transient simulations and 4 picard iteration for solution of richard s equation diersch 2014 the surface applied br tracer test was simulated for a 190 day period june 25 2014 to january 1 2015 this simulation duration was chosen to correspond to the field data that were available for comparison the van genuchten unsaturated model van genuchten 1980 was employed for the soil and upper till while a linear unsaturated model diersch 2014 was used for the lower till and bedrock layers table 2 key boundary

this analysis were that the topography of the soil till interface followed the ground surface topography which is believed to be justified based on hand auger investigations in the field and that there was no surface runoff during the precipitation events an additional assumption was that the soil moisture content over the full depth 1 m of the soil layers was equal to the values measured by the soil moisture sensors the topographically derived catchment area assumed to be the subsurface area contributing water to the drain tile pipes was determined using the ground surface elevation map for field 355 fig 1 the slope flow length was defined by extending a line perpendicular to the ground surface elevation contours up gradient of the drain tile pipes to the local topographic high the catchment area was then approximated as a triangle with a base equal to the distance between the two extents of the drain tiles pipes and a height equal to the slope flow length a mass balance

3 1 hydrological and hydrogeophysical monitoring the first occurrence of a perched water table on june 26 2014 was a result of the application of water to ics 1 followed by the application of water and tracer to ics 2 fig 4 perched water table conditions persisted for the duration of water and tracer solution application june 26 to july 12 after which they quickly receded during the dry summer months july september there was no occurrence of a perched water table with the exception of one brief event on september 21 22 fig 4 resulting from 65 mm of rainfall during the july september period a total of 270 mm of precipitation was recorded at the charlottetown eccc weather station however high evapotranspiration and root zone moisture storage meant that this resulted in negligible infiltration past the root zone following the growing season a period of sustained perched water table conditions began on october 22 2014 and persisted until approximately january 1 2015 this was followed by snowpack accumulation during the cold winter months january april and dissipation of the perched water table a perched water table occurred beginning may 5 2015 as a result of snowmelt caused by increased air temperatures the tracer test beginning june 26 2014 did not result in lateral flow into the drain tile flow collection system fig 5 the antecedent moisture conditions of the subsurface were presumably too dry to produce significant lateral migration above the soil till interface some lateral flow into the drain tile pipes did occur on september 22 because of an isolated precipitation event however as with the piezometer water levels sustained lateral flow did not begin until october 22 fig 5 lateral down slope flow continued as the perched water levels persisted through the late fall into winter lateral flow then ceased during snowpack accumulation and recommenced during spring snowmelt in 2015 the fall winter infiltration period october 24 to december 18 yielded a total lateral flow volume of 30 093 l as measured by the drain tile collection system the cumulative infiltration simulated with the swb model for the same time interval was 295 mm multiplying 295 mm by the topographically derived catchment area of 3670 m2 yields a total infiltration volume of 1082 650 l the average soil moisture content increased from 0 355 immediately prior to october 24 to 0 363 on january 1 representing a total change in soil moisture storage of 29 360 l for a 3670 m2 area and assumed soil depth of 1 m using these values in eq 1 produces a total vertical flow volume past the soil till interface of 1 023 197 l which is approximately 94 5 of the total infiltration volume approximately 2 8 of the infiltration volume contributed to lateral flow into the drain tile pipes and 2 7 to changes in soil moisture storage bromide concentrations in piezometers p1 p3 and p6 remained consistently above the background concentration as measured in the pcaps throughout the fall infiltration period fig 6 the br concentrations in these wells decreased over the duration of the monitoring period with concentrations in p3 and p6 returning to below the background concentration on may 12 2015 fig 6 the auto sampler br concentrations did not significantly exceed the background concentration until december 25 excepting two samples collected on october 26 and november 2 after which the concentrations were consistently above the background concentration a mass balance was performed using the auto sampler br data eq 2 knowing that the total mass of br applied was 4 21 kg the total br recovered in the auto sampler water samples was estimated as 7 47 g as of may 12 representing only 0 18 of the applied mass a decrease in resistivity directly below the ics2 tracer application area was apparent on day 3 as shown in fig 7 which illustrates the evolution of resistivity variations in a horizontal slice 0 5 m below ground surface some lateral transport of the tracer was evident by day 8 as shown by the spreading of the low resistivity plume in fig 7 very little additional lateral migration of the tracer at this shallow depth was resolved by the eri surveys following day 8 the vertical section time lapse resistivity images in fig 8 and resistivity ratio images in fig 9 show that the plume remained predominantly above the soil till interface prior to day 8 the day 22 resistivity images show a relative increase in resistivity in the soil zone immediately below the application area 1 m depth but decreased resistivities extended vertically below the soil till interface the reduction in resistivity in the soil zone was a result of a rainfall event 65 mm occurring on september 21 and 22 i e day 87 and 88 of the test infiltrating rainfall caused a portion of the tracer contained in the residual moisture of the soil zone to be flushed past the soil till interface this can be attributed to both reduced water saturation in the soil zone water application stopped on day 12 and vertical migration of the tracer plume by day 88 soil resistivity at depths 1 m below the application area had decreased further indicating that tracer was continuing to move vertically past the soil till interface the day 179 sections display an increase above the soil till interface and a significant decrease in resistivity below the soil till interface demonstrating further vertical migration of the tracer the resistivity image for day 357 was very similar to that for day 179 indicating that no detectable lateral transport of the applied tracer above the soil till interface had occurred as a point of interest unrelated to the tracer test fig 8 shows that the resistivity of the upper 1 m across the whole of section a a was about three times higher on june 18 2015 than it had been one year earlier on june 25 2014 this may be a consequence of residual fertilizer applied to fields in spring 2014 prior to the tracer test having been leached away by infiltrating rain and snowmelt in fall 2014 and spring 2015 respectively 3 2 numerical modeling of flow and solute transport the three dimensional variably saturated flow model was calibrated using the drain tile cumulative flow data for the period of june 25 2014 to january 1 2015 the measured and simulated results for cumulative flow into the drain tiles are shown in fig 10 while the simulated and observed hydraulic heads at p1 and p4 are shown in fig 11 the parameters adjusted during model calibration were the saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity of the soil layers the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity of the upper till the van genuchten fitting parameter α for the soil layers and the porosity of the soil layers the r2 value residuals standard deviation sd root of the mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae for the calibrated model were 0 978 1360 l 3336 l and 3046 l respectively the calibrated parameter values are given in table 2 the values used for solute transport simulation are given in table 4 the dispersivities were estimated based on the scale of the tracer plume transport and are generally consistent with those presented by zech et al 2015 the calibrated model replicated the observed cumulative flow data quite well the observed cumulative lateral flow was 30 898 l as of january 1 2015 while the simulated cumulative flow was 30 781 l for the same time interval despite good agreement between the observed and predicted flows and timing of perched water table conditions the calibrated model tended to under estimate the observed hydraulic head values fig 11 the two sensitivity simulations presented in fig 10 illustrate the impact of varying the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the shallow till on the simulated drain tile discharge a relative increase of 23 for the shallow till vertical hydraulic conductivity results in a relative decrease of 19 for the total simulated drain tile flow conversely a relative decrease of 14 for the shallow till vertical hydraulic conductivity results in a relative increase of 15 for the total simulated drain tile flow in addition the effect of varying the van genuchten scale parameter α for the soil layers on the simulated drain tile flows was assessed results not shown the results indicated that increasing α from 4 to 10 m 1 resulted in a 173 increase in the simulated total drain tile flow while decreasing α from 4 to 1 m 1 resulted in a 43 decrease in the in the simulated total drain tile flow 4 discussion 4 1 field observations water balance calculations revealed that lateral down slope flow was approximately 3 of the total water volume infiltrated from october 27 2014 to january 1 2015 the subsurface catchment area used for this calculation was necessarily an approximation and it is possible that the actual contributing area was larger or smaller than that computed which would result in under over estimation of the vertical flow through the soil till interface however a relative increase of 20 for the catchment area would increase the estimated proportion of vertical flow by only 0 5 suggesting low sensitivity to the catchment area similarly a 20 decrease in the catchment area would decrease the vertical flow component by only 0 7 uncertainty associated with the swb computed infiltration or in the measured change in soil moisture storage would also contribute to potential uncertainty in the estimate of the proportion of vertical flow the br plume was observed to largely remain above the soil till interface as indicated by the eri images from the time of application through to the beginning of the wet season at which point a period of sustained perched conditions developed beginning october 23 during perched water table conditions a horizontal advective transport velocity of 1 m day was estimated using the porosity of the soil layers 0 44 the average hydraulic gradient 0 049 and the saturated horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the overlying soil 8 m day inferred from feflow calibration the shortest distance of the tracer plume to the down gradient drain tile pipes was approximately 7 m at the beginning of the wet season as seen in the eri results therefore the expected advective travel time for br to reach the drain tile pipes was approximately seven days from the beginning of the wet season the first occurrence of br concentrations significantly above background was on october 27 four days after the beginning of the wet season the shorter travel time may be attributed to the inability of the eri instrumentation to resolve low br concentrations near the leading edge of the plume or preferential transport pathways through zones of higher than average hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil layer the impact of the soil till interface on tracer transport can be inferred through comparison of the eri vertical images for days 3 and 8 figs 8 and 9 an apparent impediment of the tracer transport was observed at a depth of approximately 1 m and the migration of the tracer was mostly lateral above this depth this is attributed to the perched water table conditions present at the initiation of the tracer test in the immediate vicinity of the application area as indicated by water table elevations in piezometer p1 fig 4 from days 1 12 the highest tracer concentrations were still above the soil till interface on day 88 fig 8 just prior to the onset of the natural perched water table conditions that persisted through most of the fall from october 25 january 1 however the subsequent image from day 179 december 22 2014 figs 8 and 9 indicates that the tracer migration during the fall winter infiltration period october 24 2014 to december 22 2014 was dominantly vertical thus the vertical and plan view fig 7 eri images indicate that the bulk of the applied tracer mass had migrated vertically through the soil till interface rather than laterally down slope 4 2 numerical simulation despite the close agreement between the observed and simulated volumetric water discharge to the tile drains fig 10 the simulated pressure heads above the soil till interface were generally lower than those observed fig 11 daniels and fritton 1994 simulated groundwater mounding above a shallow fragiudalf using a finite element solution to richards equation in their study as was the case in this study the simulated perched water table elevation was consistently lower by approximately 70 cm in both studies than the observed water table elevation they used an exponential relationship to model the dependence of the hydraulic conductivity on soil water suction head and attributed some of the error to this approximation they also attributed some of the model error to possible unidentified heterogeneity within the low permeability layer i e discontinuities and or secondary porosity may have contributed to increased permeability the current study also lacked detailed measurements for the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the soil and shallow till and used model calibration to arrive at these parameters while underestimating the hydraulic heads the calibrated model adequately simulated periods of perched water table conditions and volumetric discharge to the drain tiles these two model outputs were considered most relevant for interpreting the bulk movement of the applied tracer a qualitative comparison between the feflow simulated tracer plume and the eri results is provided in fig 12 the eri data and simulation results for july 3 and july 8 are in good agreement as both show that the tracer had remained above the soil till interface the simulation results for july 22 show the migration of relatively low tracer concentrations below the soil till interface while the eri results show more apparent vertical migration of the tracer past the soil till interface by december 22 the simulation results show that much of the tracer mass exists below the soil till interface the eri data for december 22 show the same general distribution of the applied tracer the estimated cumulative bromide mass collected by the tile drains was 3 5 g 0 08 of the applied mass as of january 1 2015 the transport simulation produced a cumulative br mass for the same time period of 122 g which is 2 9 of the simulated applied mass of br the transport simulation results therefore suggest greater lateral migration of the tracer plume than was evident in either the drain tile or eri results however both the simulation results and field data indicate that the bulk of the tracer mass did not reach the down slope drain tiles but instead migrated vertically it should also be noted that the eri array would not have been able to resolve the minor changes in conductivity that would have been associated with the leading edge of the plume because the change in bulk resistivity of the soil associated with the low concentration region of the plume would not be easily differentiated from the background images 4 3 implications for the fate of agricultural nitrate in pei the findings of this field experiment have several important implications for the transport of nitrate in this setting if the applied tracer is considered a surrogate for nitrate derived from fertilizer application allowing for the time necessary for the applied ammonium fertilizer to be converted to nitrate fertilizer for potato production is typically applied at the time of potato planting in the spring and leaching of fertilizer derived nitrate as well as nitrate derived from mineralization of soil organic nitrogen would be initiated by infiltration events following the application of fertilizer although some limited nitrate leaching may occur during the growing season in response to significant rainfall events the tracer test has shown that the majority of nitrate transport past the soil till interface would be expected to occur during the fall and winter the bulk of the applied tracer mass and by inference nitrate would be expected to remain above the soil till interface during the relatively dry growing season e g fig 8 the model sensitivity simulations fig 10 illustrate the importance of the contrast in hydraulic conductivity between the soil layers and the underlying till on the partitioning of lateral and vertical flows the hydrogeological property contrasts i e a ratio of approximately 650 1 between the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil layers and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the shallow till at the site were such that significant lateral flows approximately 3 for the monitoring period did not occur however lateral flow may become more significant at sites where there is a greater contrast in permeability between these materials the tracer test results and the supporting numerical simulations indicate that there was a tendency for the br tracer to migrate vertically through the compact till i e soil till interface nitrate being a mobile and conservative solute neglecting the potential for denitrification at the near surface would therefore also be expected to follow the same transport pathway jiang et al 2015b discussed that flow and nitrate transport through predominantly sub vertical fractures may be important in the deep vadose zone i e 1 m depth thus providing for potentially rapid deep penetration of agricultural nitrate considering the lack of a significant impediment to vertical migration of the tracer plume as revealed in this study the fate of the majority of nitrate leached from the root zone is expected to be deep groundwater barring any lateral flow occurring in the deeper vadose zone this finding is consistent with elevated nitrate concentrations of more than 10 mg l no3 n that have been observed in deep 15 m monitoring wells installed at field 355 malenica 2015 5 conclusions this study utilized a surface applied tracer test in conjunction with hydrogeophysical and hydrogeological monitoring methods to investigate water and solute transport in the shallow vadose zone above a soil compact till interface the study was designed to improve the understanding of nitrate transport after leaching from the root zone of agricultural crops in prince edward island the shallow piezometer and drain tile discharge data clearly demonstrated the development of sustained perched water table conditions and the occurrence of lateral down slope flow during the late fall winter and spring periods the perched water table conditions that occurred in the fall winter were attributed to infiltration of rainfall and reduced evapotranspiration while those occurring in spring were dominantly a result of snowmelt infiltration during perched water table conditions saturated soil zone thicknesses of up to 100 cm developed above the soil till interface and the lateral hydraulic gradients were consistent with down slope flow the duration of continuous perched conditions varied from hours following rainfall events to approximately 2 5 months during the late fall however water mass balance estimates indicated that even during the extended period of perched conditions in the fall 95 of infiltrating water percolated vertically through the soil till interface observations of tracer movement as imaged by three dimensional electrical resistivity monitoring and quantified by br concentrations in piezometers and drain tiles showed that the tracer spread laterally above the compact till layer during the short approximately 4 days period of perched conditions resulting from its application following that period however the majority of the surface applied tracer mass was observed to migrate vertically through the subsurface despite the presence of perched water table conditions the numerical flow and transport modeling results also showed that the majority of the br tracer migrated vertically into the soil till interface which suggests the fate of leached nitrate would primarily be the deeper bedrock aquifer water table as a result it is concluded that the presence of the low permeability soil till interface does not promote sufficient lateral down slope transport of nitrate to mitigate to a significant extent the vertical migration of nitrate towards deeper groundwater lateral flow and transport may be more significant at sites with a greater contrast in permeability between the soil and underlying till investigations at this site show that lateral water flow and solute transport above the compact till layer are relatively minor and therefore unlikely to be a significant contributor to nitrate in surface water bodies ponds streams estuaries at the base of slopes as a consequence it is expected that response times of both surface water and groundwater nitrate concentrations to changes in bmps depends on the combined residence times of water in the shallow and deep

meter provided a maximum output current of 100 ma a maximum output voltage of 380 v peak to peak and utilized a 5 hz square wave waveform the surveys utilized a sequence containing in line and off line wenner schlumberger array configurations lamb 2016 the off line configurations provided increased sensitivity to areas between survey lines effective depths of exploration were varied by using a spacings of 1 4 m and n values of 1 5 as defined in fig a 1 the maximum effective depths of exploration for these measurements or more precisely the maximum median depths of exploration were approximately 3 6 m barker 1989 loke 2012 additional sensitivity to regions between survey lines was provided by a series of cross line measurements using the wenner array with a spacings of 1 5 3 m reciprocal measurements were performed current dipole becomes potential dipole and vice versa for all measurements in line off line and cross line measurements the dcip3d inversion code seeks to obtain a model that reproduces the observed apparent resistivity data to within a tolerance that is justified by the estimated errors associated with measurement and discretization based on a trial and error approach errors of 5 were assigned to each apparent resistivity measurement although that value was significantly higher than the typical reciprocal errors it must also account for inaccuracies in the modeling related to discretization of the geology and linearization of the inverse problem a value of 5 was selected to prevent the inversion algorithm from generating artifacts suggestive of over fitting the data due to the non uniqueness of the inversion process various models could be obtained that adequately reproduce the observed data dcip3d like many inversion algorithms may be configured to seek the particular resistivity model ρ that is as close as possible to some reference model ρ0 sometimes called a smallest model or the model that deviates as smoothly as possible from the reference model i e minimizes the gradient of ρ ρ0 a so called flattest model in this case we chose not to bias the solution towards any particular reference model the algorithm therefore effectively sought a model that fit the data for which resistivity varied as smoothly as possible in space minimizing the gradient of ρ such a smooth model inversion is not unreasonable in seeking to resolve the shape of a conductive tracer plume however it may be expected that the recovered model will tend to smear out any sharp changes in resistivity associated with the plume or subsurface geology inversions for resistivity models were performed on select eri data sets independently to illustrate movement of the conductive tracer over time the starting model for each inversion was a homogeneous half space with a resistivity set equal to the average measured apparent resistivity i e the default starting model used by dcip3d variations in resistivity over time were emphasized by taking the ratio of the resistivity model obtained at a given time to the resistivity model obtained immediately prior to tracer application methodological studies of time lapse eri e g kim et al 2009 hayley et al 2011 loke et al 2014 have pointed out that other approaches to time lapse inversion such as inverting the differences between apparent resistivity measurements at different times or otherwise simultaneously inverting data sets acquired at different times can help to improve the resolution of anomalous features with less risk of introducing artifacts however the method of comparing resistivity models obtained by independent inversions yielded physically reasonable results and was simpler to implement given the hundreds of data sets acquired over the course of a year particularly given that some data sets e g late sept 2014 had reduced numbers of active electrodes cell weighting functions were used to increase the bias towards model smoothness at shallow depths thereby counter acting a tendency for the inversion algorithm to introduce excessive variability near the electrodes where sensitivity is greatest values for cell weighting ranged from 1 to 32 a weight of 32 was applied to the top layer of the model the weight was then reduced by a factor of 2 for every 25 cm of depth until a base weight of 1 was reached at a depth of 125 cm several filters were applied to the survey data prior to inverse modeling with dcip3d these data filters removed apparent resistivity measurements having negative voltages poor repeatability 5 error poor reciprocals 5 difference and excessively small currents 1 ma symptomatic of excessively high electrode contact resistances the number of discarded measurements generally did not exceed 20 1 of the acquired measurements poor reciprocal measurements indicative of systematic errors and or low signal to noise ratios kilfu et al 2016 typically accounted for the greatest number of rejected measurements these filters were applied to assure quality data for inversion in dcip3d 
6539,in this study synchronized gridded precipitation and temperature generators were developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to reconstruct the spatial structure and other statistical properties of high resolution capa canadian precipitation analysis precipitation and gem global environmental multiscale model temperature products the precipitation generator is an extension to the gridded multi site occurrence amount model while the multi site framework is not efficiently applicable to regions with limited precipitation information and sparse observation network this paper provides the full mathematical description of estimating the model based on high resolution gridded products the temperature model on the other hand introduces the first gridded hourly generator in the literature in which cyclic temperature components are conditioned using wet and dry day status information this was achieved using harmonic functions establishing the connection between the simulated daily precipitation occurrence time series and the moments of the generated temperature data one of the key features of the proposed gridded generators is the capacity to produce temporally coherent fields of precipitation and temperature an essential prerequisite for hydrologic modeling applications the generators were evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce the standard interannual and extreme value characteristics of observed gridded products the gridded precipitation model can preserve key statistical and spatial properties of the gridded capa observations to an acceptable level while similar to the original multi site framework it falls short to capture long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation the temperature model on the other hand preserves the majority of key features of the gridded gem temperature observations including the first two moments of the hourly data and the cumulative frequency of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds the only notable defect identified is the departure of the interannual variability of the generated maximum and minimum temperatures from those observed keywords stochastic modeling gridded generator precipitation generator temperature generator capa gem 1 introduction the main goal of hydro geostatistical assessment of weather observation networks is to merge physically based and statistical evaluations of how network properties affect precipitation estimations and ensuing simulated flows see e g bardossy and das 2008 essou et al 2017 st hilaire et al 2003 wilson et al 1979 xu et al 2015 currently this objective is pursued through deterministic i e application of actual readings and stochastic i e simulation of precipitation data approaches dong et al 2005 the first approach is applicable when high quality weather information including precipitation and temperature can be collected by means of ground or radar observations the second scheme however is effective when observations are scattered in both time and space limiting hydrologic modeling the second approach can be undertaken using weather generators which are probabilistic tools used to generate weather data with the same statistical properties as historical observations there are numerous examples of stochastic weather generators used in hydro geostatistical network assessment studies tarboton et al 1987 and bras et al 1988 used the nine parameter model developed by waymire et al 1984 commonly known as the wgr stochastic generator over 1995 to synthesize precipitation while estimating variance of the simulated runoff to assess the accuracy of the observation network krajewski et al 1991 also used the wgr model to generate precipitation data while performing a monte carlo simulation experiment to investigate the effect of the spatial and temporal resolutions of the network on the simulated hydrological response of a small catchment abbasnezhadi et al 2019 designed a stochastic hydro geostatistical algorithm to evaluate the impact of increasing meteorological network density on hydrologic modeling outcomes the algorithm was designed within the framework of a data assimilation simulation experiment which was based on the paradigm of observing system simulation experiments osse this framework specifically requires that synthetic observations are created through a step referred to as the nature run nr see abbasnezhadi et al 2019 for more details the generation of the nr atmosphere is conventionally carried out by running a sophisticated atmospheric model with no data assimilation masutani et al 2013 for the atmospheric model to run extensive data resources are required which makes this stage computationally expensive abbasnezhadi et al 2019 suggested an alternative approach in which stochastically generated gridded weather data are used to create physically coherent reference weather fields in this context a gridded weather generator had to be designed with an emphasis on producing temporally coherent fields of precipitation and temperature that is temperature field is conditioned using wet and dry day precipitation status information this coherency also represents an essential feature in hydrological modeling applications in addition to their application in assessment of weather networks gridded weather simulators can be used for several other purposes in hydrology such as climate change impact studies and statistical downscaling see e g brissette et al 2007 or seasonal climate forecasts see e g wilks 2002 for downscaling climate simulations various statistical relationships between locally observed meteorological data and large scale predictors have been developed in the literature alaya et al 2018 jeong et al 2012 however the quality and availability of observed climate variables is a recurring issue in many parts of the world which has negatively affected downscaling practices with recent developments in reanalysis and other gridded products a better understanding of the spatial distribution and climatology of precipitation and temperature is now available thus there is now an opportunity to exploit gridded products to disaggregate simulation outputs from climate models the developed synchronized gridded generators in this study provide one such means for downscaling outputs from global and regional climate models by incorporating gridded numerical and reanalysis precipitation and temperature data the gridded framework is particularly advantageous in order to evaluate the sensitivity of distributed hydrologic models to changes in climate wilks 1999 as srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 discuss ignoring the spatial correlation between weather stations while using single site weather generators in hydrologic modeling studies can result in major modeling inaccuracies in distributed hydrologic modeling it is preferred to incorporate gridded input data with a resolution similar to that of the model s grid resolution shrestha et al 2006 this however becomes a challenging task if the resolution of input data is coarser than that of the model s grid resolution in addition recent studies have shown that the accuracy of streamflow simulations can be highly sensitive to changes in spatial resolution of gridded input data abbasnezhadi et al 2019 the results of an observation network assessment in the canadian boreal ecoclimatic zone indicated that the nash sutcliffe efficiency shows a hyperbolic variation with respect to various resolutions of input meteorological data this trend is in line with the findings of bardossy and das 2008 dong et al 2005 and xu et al 2013 who reported that when resolution falls beneath a certain limit flow simulation skill drops rapidly the aggregate of these factors indicates the significance of high resolution gridded weather generators in hydrologic modeling applications there has not been much done in the past with respect to developing gridded precipitation and temperature generators there were only a few models developed for multi site generation of precipitation and temperature including the space time model bardossy and plate 1992 the nearest neighbor resampling approach buishand and brandsma 2001 the spatial moving average process khalili et al 2007 2011 the latent autoregressive model rasmussen 2013 the disaggregation approach based on gibbs sampling gagnon et al 2012 2017 rasmussen and abbasnezhadi 2014 or the multi site temperature model described by baigorria 2014 the majority of what has already been developed for precipitation modeling is based on the multi site approach explained by wilks 1998 2009 who generalized the single site precipitation and temperature generators introduced by richardson 1981 when developing a multi site model the spatial structure of observed data is arguably one of the most important properties that should be preserved wilks 2009 took care of this objective by applying the multivariate nonparametric regression procedure described by lall et al 2006 to interpolate generator parameters derived at observation locations onto a matrix of grid points this regression function associates model parameters derived at each observation location to the coordinates and elevations of target grid points with elevation acting as the main covariate this scheme for constructing a gridded model works well for observation networks of decent density if the network density is low the quality of the interpolation suffers regardless of the interpolation technique to avoid this problem in this study a gridded model was designed rather than interpolating parameters in the proposed approach gridded daily precipitation analysis datasets were used to estimate model parameters at each analysis grid point when regional analysis of the effect of precipitation and temperature spatial variability on flow characteristics is at stake distributed or semi distributed hydrologic models are used khakbaz et al 2012 this signifies the importance of conditioning the generation of temperature fields on precipitation data moreover designing a temperature generator to operate at sub daily temporal scales facilitates the application of the generated data in future event based hydrologic models which typically function at short time intervals while there have been efforts to develop procedures for disaggregating temperature time series from daily to subdaily time steps see e g sharif et al 2007 waichler and wigmosta 2003 no literature has yet been published on the generation of gridded temperature data at sub daily temporal scales e g hourly conditioned on precipitation time series this paper presents a full description of the mathematical details of the models used for the synchronized generation of gridded daily precipitation and hourly temperature data as part of the osse based network assessment framework developed by abbasnezhadi et al 2019 2 study area the churchill river basin crb is located in the boreal ecoclimatic zone in northern manitoba and saskatchewan canada the crb is a prime example of a region where limited precipitation information makes the gridded precipitation generation as described by wilks 2009 inapplicable fig 1 shows the crb which spans roughly 1200 km in latitude from 52 9900 to 59 6900 north

in latitude and 0 15 in longitude roughly 10 km in both directions at 60 n before application in the modeling framework fig 1 shows the location of the grid points in the rectangular grid over the crb 3 methodology 3 1 precipitation generator the generation of precipitation data is carried out in two separate stages richardson 1981 in the first stage a binary series of wet and dry days are generated through a chain dependent process in the second stage precipitation amounts on wet days are simulated by randomly drawing from a distribution fitted to observed precipitation amounts on wet days fig 2 shows the two stages of the precipitation generation algorithm the occurrence process is shown by the single weighted line while the amount model goes through the double weighted process as shown in the algorithm these two simulation processes are not isolated from each other in order to ensure a gradual transition in precipitation amounts from high intensity cells to low intensity cells at the boundary of the wet regions the amount model of the precipitation generator should be associated with the occurrence model 3 1 1 gridded occurrence model in order to produce wet and dry sequences of precipitation the occurrence process simulates precipitation incidents at daily time steps using first order two state markov dependence precipitation can be broken down into two independent components x l t and y l t which explain occurrence and amount components respectively the observed precipitation occurrence on day t at grid point l x l t is given by 1 x l t 1 if y l t 0 0 if y l t 0 which states that at a given grid point a day is reported as wet when a value greater than zero is recorded for that grid point if precipitation amounts are truncated at a given detection level threshold dlt then the value of x l t should be reported as zero below the aforementioned dlt the markovian model is described by its parameters commonly referred to as transition probabilities they explain the probabilities by which precipitation occurrence transitions from one state to another wilks 1999 fit markov models of orders 1 2 and 3 to evaluate the overall goodness of fit of each model to data taken from precipitation stations in different parts of the us depicting a variety of climates the models were assessed using the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and it was concluded that a model as simple a k a parsimonious as the first order markov dependence in which the precipitation occurrence state of the current day depends only on that of the previous day is adequate for simulating precipitation occurrence time series nevertheless the first order markov model can yield an insufficient number of very long dry spells if observed precipitation data illustrate great difference between wet and dry seasons this issue will be elaborated in more detail later for first order dependence two parameters are enough to explain the model at any grid point l these parameters capture the probability of a wet day preceded by either a wet day p 11 l or a dry day p 01 l 2 p 11 l prob x l t 1 x l t 1 1 3 p 01 l prob x l t 1 x l t 1 0 if transition probabilities are estimated on a monthly basis the seasonality of the observed time series can be captured once transition probabilities are computed then at each time step t a uniform random number u t u 0 1 is generated and a wet day is produced if 4 u t p c l where p c l is the critical probability at grid point l and is defined as 5 p c l p 01 l if x l t 1 0 p 11 l if x l t 1 1 a dry day is generated if the condition given by eq 4 is not satisfied in order to model gridded occurrence time series the single site generator should be expanded to the synchronized generation of precipitation over a matrix of grid points this is possible if the generation of precipitation occurrence across grid points is carried out using temporally independent and spatially correlated random numbers to ensure that the spatial correlation of the generated precipitation fields resembles that of the historical data cross correlation of the forcing random numbers at all grid points must be taken into consideration at each grid point random numbers are generated such that they account for the intra grid spatial correlations of observed occurrence time series the cross correlations between the vectors of random numbers at all grid points are defined prior to generating the vectors of precipitation occurrence throughout the domain let w l w l 1 w l 2 w l t represent a vector of random numbers at grid point l where w l t is the random variate generated at time step t for the same grid point the correlation between w l and another vector e g w k at grid point k may then be expressed by ω l k corr w l w k similarly the correlation between vectors of observed precipitation occurrence time series at grid points l and k can be stated as ρ l k corr x l x k the challenge is then to find ω l k so as to minimize l k ρ l k ρ l k 2 for every possible pair of grid points l and k in the domain here ρ l k is the modeled counterpart of ρ l k and is not yet known an equation of the form ρ ω ρ does not have a direct solution for convenience the random variates w l t are generated from a normal rather than a uniform distribution wilks 1999 this allows vectors of random variates to be generated from a multivariate gaussian distribution for a given network of n grid points the correlations between generated normal variates are populated into an n n covariance matrix ω 6 ω ω 1 1 ω 1 2 ω 1 n ω 2 1 ω 2 2 ω 2 n ω n 1 ω n 2 ω n n the ω matrix is determined by first generating the matrix of gaussian random numbers at all grid points from w n o ω where mean o is a 1 n column vector of zeros the diagonal elements of ω diag ω ω 1 1 ω 2 2 ω n n representing the variances of the random variates at all grid points are equal to unity w l w l t n 0 1 this means that the marginal distribution of the random numbers for each grid point is standard gaussian populating the ω matrix is handled numerically the value of ω l k is directly influenced by a total of five parameters the pairs of transition probabilities at each of the two grid points and the correlation coefficient of the precipitation occurrence between the two grid points therefore a five dimensional table of ω values as a function of the five parameters can be produced at the beginning of the simulation and table interpolation is performed to look up values of ω for the given values of p 01 p 11 l p 01 p 11 k and ρ l k the covariance matrix is explained by the exponential model for each calendar month the correlation function given below is used to describe the spatial dependencies 7 ω exp ψ occ 1 d ψ occ 2 where d is the domain wide matrix of the horizontal distance between pairs of grid points l and k 8 d d 1 1 d 1 2 d 1 n d 2 1 d 2 2 d 2 n d n 1 d n 2 d n n also ψ occ 1 and ψ occ 2 are the monthly model parameters which can be obtained using iterative least squares estimation to fit the nonlinear regression given by eq 7 the optimized parameters are shown in table 1 finally a wet day is generated if w l t φ 1 p c l where p c l is the critical probability at grid point l defined by eq 5 and φ 1 is the inverse standard gaussian cumulative distribution operator 3 1 2 gridded amount model in the second stage of the richardson model daily precipitation amounts on wet days are simulated by randomly drawing amounts from a distribution fitted to observed amounts on wet days several distributions are available to fit the daily accumulations of the precipitation amount exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution the formulation of which is provided below location and time indices are dropped for r and β for simplicity 9 f r β 1 β exp r β where r is the total precipitation amount observed β is the distribution s scale parameter and f r β identifies the probability density function for the precipitation event r when high intensity precipitation skews the distribution of precipitation the single exponential distribution given by eq 9 cannot capture the full range of amounts that may occur in such a case a weighted sum of two or more exponential distributions a k a a mixed exponential distribution may better represent the full range of precipitation amounts in the majority of cases dividing the range of amounts into two possible regimes is enough to explain the full precipitation distribution one regime possesses a probability of α that precipitation amounts may happen with mean β 1 and the other regime has a complementary probability of 1 α that the precipitation amounts may be observed with mean β 2 the probability distribution of precipitation amounts can then be written as 10 f r α β 1 β 2 α f 1 1 α f 2 where f 1 and f 2 are the two exponential distributions with means β 1 and β 2 respectively as follows 11 f 1 1 β 1 exp r β 1 f 2 1 β 2 exp r β 2 substituting f 1 and f 2 from eq 11 into eq 10 yields the following 12 f r α β 1 β 2 α 1 β 1 exp r β 1 1 α 1 β 2 exp r β 2 where α is the weighting parameter associated with the larger of the two scale parameters β 1 and β 2 wilks 2006 wilks 1999 compared the mixed exponential distribution against the gamma distribution and explained that although the three parameter distribution shows a lower parsimony the bic statistic favors the mixed exponential distribution as it shows a better goodness of fit with observations chapman 1994 wilks and wilby 1999 therefore in this study the three parameter distribution was selected to generate precipitation amounts this decision also accounts for tendency of precipitation fields to exhibit a gradual transition from high intensity rain cells to regions of no precipitation which can be captured by interconnecting the parameters of the markov model to those of eq 12 wilks 1998 to maintain the spatial consistency of generated precipitation amounts a technique similar to the one used in the occurrence process is applied assuming z l z l 1 z l 2 z l t and z k z k 1 z k 2 z k t be vectors of random numbers from a standard normal distribution at grid points l and k respectively then ζ l k corr z l z k furthermore γ l k corr y l y k can be defined as the pairwise correlation between observed time series of precipitation amounts on wet days and γ l k as the corresponding correlations between the synthesized data a ζ l k value must then be found so that γ ζ γ in other words z l and z k must be generated such that the correlation between vectors of precipitation amounts at a pair of grid points resembles the observed correlation the challenge is to determine the correlation ζ l k between z l and z k that satisfies this requirement the value of ζ l k is derived through a function similar to eq 7 although a new set of parameters should be determined for each month to minimize σ l k γ l k γ l k 2 this problem can be handled using a similar table interpolation approach as explained for the occurrence process however this would result in a 7 dimensional table and interpolating such a table is computationally expensive and may result in inconsistencies in the correlation matrix therefore for the amount process a new set of monthly parameters ψ amn 1 and ψ amn 2 are obtained from monte carlo simulations on the amount model this approach yields the parameter set that results in vectors of random numbers with a ζ l k minimizing the sum of squared errors sse function σ l k γ l k γ l k 2 the parameters search domain should be selected by some initial sampling in order to find the proper range therefore values in the order of ψ amn 1 0 0001 0 0030 and ψ amn 2 1 000 1 400 were considered for parameter tuning table 2 provides the optimal monthly parameters derived by monte carlo simulation for the spatial correlation function for vectors of random numbers of the amount process with the values of ψ amn 1 and ψ amn 2 identified for the amount process monthly covariance matrices for the random normal variates throughout the whole domain can be obtained in matrix format as follows 13 σ exp ψ amn 1 d ψ amn 2 where the σ matrix has the following elements 14 σ ζ 1 1 ζ 1 2 ζ 1 n ζ 2 1 ζ 2 2 ζ 2 n ζ n 1 ζ n 2 ζ n n similar to the occurrence model the σ matrix is used in the amount process to generate the matrix of the gaussian random numbers at all grid points from z n o σ the diagonal elements of σ are equal to unity implying that for each grid location l z l z l t n 0 1 this ensures that all marginal distributions of precipitation amounts are preserved as wilks 1998 explains in order to avoid unrealistic patterns in synthesized precipitation fields the amount process should be associated with the occurrence process by comparing α l from the amount model to the φ w l t p c l ratio where w l t is the random variate of the occurrence model at time t and grid point l pooled from the same generated batch for the occurrence process if φ w l t α p c l the smaller of the two scale parameters of the mixed exponential distribution is selected as the distribution mean β l t of the exponential distribution i e β l t β 2 l otherwise 15 β l t β 2 l 2 β 1 l β 2 l 1 φ w l t α l t p c l in fact if φ w l t α p c l then a linear combination between the scale parameters can better capture the lower precipitation amounts at the boundary of wet regions if φ w l t α p c l then β 2 l is selected if φ w l t α p c l 0 5 then β 1 l is selected and if φ w l t 0 then β l t 2 β 1 l β 2 l 3 1 3 simulating precipitation data the precipitation amount r t l at grid point l and daily time step t on wet days is randomly generated using an inverse cdf procedure by drawing from the exponential distribution the cumulative distribution function of which is given as follows 16 r l t β l t ln 1 v l t where β l t and v l t are the distribution mean and a randomly generated uniform number respectively similar to the occurrence process it is helpful to generate the variates in the normal space if observed precipitation amounts are truncated at a given dlt e g 2 mm it is necessary to shift these amounts to the origin by subtracting the dlt from the observed precipitation amounts prior to estimating the parameters of the mixed exponential distribution correspondingly once precipitation amounts are modeled the same threshold level must be added back to the simulated precipitation amounts taking these provisions into consideration eq 16 is revised as follows 17 r l t dlt β l t ln 1 φ z l t once precipitation amounts are generated over the whole domain then 18 y l t 0 if x l t 0 r l t if x l t 1 which means that for a grid point l on day t if the occurrence model has generated a dry day the precipitation amount generated on that day should be zero otherwise the modeled amount is considered 3 2 temperature generator it is computationally less challenging to model temperature as temperature time series do not have the intermittent and discontinuous nature observed in precipitation time series nevertheless temperature time series have important deterministic components in the form of standard and diurnal cycles which should be identified and removed prior to obtaining and modeling normalized residuals in order to remove the deterministic component of hourly temperature data this study adopted the single site hourly temperature model introduced by hansen and driscoll 1977 this approach separates hourly temperature data using harmonic functions to characterize annual and diurnal cycles however hansen s single site temperature model does not associate the moments of the temperature time series to the state of precipitation which does not ensure coherency between temperature and precipitation models in this paper an approach is introduced for constructing a gridded hourly temperature model conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence by incorporating two sets of harmonic functions these harmonics establish the connection between simulated daily precipitation occurrence time series and the moments of the generated temperature data this approach is similar to the one applied by wilks 2008 who combined the first two moments of daily maximum and minimum temperatures using separate moments on wet and dry days fig 3 displays the temperature model algorithm 3 2 1 cyclic moments of hourly temperature annual cycles of the diurnal variation in the first two moments mean and variance of the hourly temperature data at each grid point can be explained by harmonics these deterministic components of temperature are derived regardless of the state of precipitation occurrence to capture the diurnal cycle of the observed data the 730th and 1095th harmonics consistent with 12 and 8 h periods are considered along with the 1st and the 365th harmonics thus for a given grid point g the harmonic function is given by 19 p h t g t g n α h n g cos 2 π nt 8760 β h n g sin 2 π nt 8760 where p h t g is the modeled parameter representing either the mean μ h t g or the standard deviation σ h t g of the hourly temperature data t g is the mean hourly temperature over the whole record α h n g and β h n g are the fourier coefficients associated with the harmonic member n and n 1 365 730 1095 when temperature data are equally spaced and continuous in time i e no missing time steps the fourier coefficients for each modeled parameter can be estimated as follows 20 α h n g 2 8760 t 1 8760 m h t g cos 2 π nt 8760 21 β h n g 2 8760 t 1 8760 m h t g sin 2 π nt 8760 in which m h t g is any of the two moments μ h t g or σ h t g of the hourly temperature time series evaluated at each time step t over the full record of observed data and n is the harmonic number of the set described for eq 19 once the deterministic components μ h t g and σ h t g of the hourly temperature are derived they are used to reduce observed hourly temperature time series at each grid point to time series of normalized residuals as follows 22 r h t g t h t g μ h t g σ h t g where t h t g and r h t g are the observed hourly temperature and the corresponding normalized residual respectively at time step t and grid point g having the r h t g values derived the multi site first order autoregressive model given by eq 23 is applied to generate time series of hourly residuals at each grid point 23 r h t x r h t 1 y e t where r h t is the n 1 column vector here n is the number of grid points of the generated zero mean unit variance temperature residuals r h t g at each hourly time step t and grid point g r h t 1 is the lagged by 1 time step counterpart of r h t x and y are n n matrices containing autoregression parameters which force the generated time series to exhibit the required serial correlation and cross correlation coefficients and can be obtained by the method of moments bras and rodriguez iturbe 1985 and e t is a n 1 vector of random normal variates ε t g n 0 1 denoting the simultaneous unlagged and lag 1 correlation matrices of the normalized data as c 0 and c 1 respectively the autoregression parameters are computed by 24 x c 1 c 0 1 25 g c 0 xc 1 t where the 1 and t superscripts designate inverse and transpose matrices respectively and g is the gramian of y i e g yy t therefore y is obtained through cholesky decomposition of g it is important to note that in order to obtain full rank correlation matrices records of hourly temperature should be longer than the number of grid points which was the case in this work 3 2 2 conditioning hourly temperature data generated hourly temperature residuals can be transformed back to hourly temperatures by reversing eq 22 for grid point g 26 t h t g r h t g σ h t g μ h t g where t h t g is the generated temperature for grid point g at time step t in order to generate temperature fields that are temporally coherent with the generated precipitation fields eq 26 is conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence at each time step and grid point the cyclic moments of hourly temperature data described by eq 19 can be partitioned into two separate cycles describing the annual variation of each parameter according to the state of precipitation occurrence more specifically μ h t g is partitioned into μ h 0 t g and μ h 1 t g explaining the variation of mean hourly temperature during dry and wet hours respectively similarly σ h t g can be partitioned into σ h 0 t g and σ h 1 t g eq 26 can then be broken down into two separate cases at grid point g and for each time step t 27 t h t g r h t g σ h 0 t g μ h 0 t g if x g t 0 r h t g σ h 1 t g μ h 1 t g if x g t 1 where t h t g is now the generated hourly temperature data conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence at each time step t and grid point g and x is the generated precipitation occurrence at the same time step and grid point to the extent of the authors knowledge deriving the wet and dry components on the right hand side of eq 27 has not yet been discussed in the literature a simple procedure is outlined in the following section 3 2 3 simulating conditioned temperature data in order to obtain the hourly deterministic components of temperature conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence new sets of fourier functions representing mean daily temperature are considered here three harmonics are used to represent the annual cycle i e n 1 2 3 denoting the state of precipitation occurrence by the s superscript which can be either 0 for dry or 1 for wet conditions the fourier function can be written as follows 28 p d s t g t s g n 1 3 α d s n g cos 2 π nt 365 β d s n g sin 2 π nt 365 where p d s t g describes any of μ d 0 t g μ d 1 t g σ d 0 t g and σ d 1 t g t s g is the mean daily temperature on either wet or dry days computed over the whole observed record and α d s n g and β d s n g are the fourier coefficients computed separately for each the four modeled parameters and are given by 29 α d s n g 2 365 t 1 365 m d s t g cos 2 π nt 365 30 β d s n g 2 365 t 1 365 m d s t g sin 2 π nt 365 in which m d s t g is any of the two moments of the mean daily temperature data conditioned on the state of the day μ d s t g and σ d s t g the harmonic functions derived in eq 28 explaining the cyclic components of mean daily temperature take into account precipitation occurrence on each day these functions are thus used to shift the unconditional hourly harmonic curves explained by eq 19 such that they are conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence on each day and at each grid point 4 results and discussion 4 1 generated gridded weather fields fig 4 shows two realizations of daily precipitation fields in april and july synthesized in and around the crb by the gridded daily occurrence amount model the overall spatial integrity of the generated data as well as the gradual transition of precipitation amounts from higher intensity rain cells to regions of no precipitation is evident in both realizations fig 4a shows a realization of daily precipitation accumulation in april illustrating what could be a frontal system with amounts less than 20 mm fig 4b on the other hand depicts a synthesized daily accumulation in july where the precipitation field is dominated by what could be identified as high intensity convective rain cells scattered throughout the region fig 5 shows two realizations of hourly temperature fields in march and november synthesized in and around the crb by the gridded hourly temperature model fig 5a shows a realization in march demonstrating what could be a large temperature gradient through the study domain in early spring where freezing conditions as low as 30 c are seen in northeastern crb while western regions are dominated by warmer conditions around 8 c fig 5b on the other hand depicts a realization of what could be an early november condition showing mainly frigid conditions in the northern and central regions and relatively milder temperatures in the western parts of the basin the generated weather fields were evaluated while focusing not only on the parameters used directly in the modeling procedure e g transition probabilities used in the precipitation occurrence model but also on several other key features of the observed time series e g extreme value characteristics one hundred years of daily precipitation data 36 500 time steps and hourly temperature data 876 000 time steps were synthesized and were evaluated the number of years each variable was synthesized for was selected to minimize the uncertainty of each measured statistic in this analysis scatterplots are used to compare summary statistics of observed and synthesized data in order to improve the clarity of the graphs the evaluation was at times carried out over a subset of grid points spread out evenly throughout the study domain this sub domain consists of 32 grid points taken from the original domain and is shown in fig 1 4 2 evaluation of generated precipitation 4 2 1 inter grid correlation fig 6 illustrates the relationship between intra grid correlations for the capa rdpa observation and generated precipitation for the occurrence and the amount processes these graphs indicate that at both stages of the precipitation generation procedure the observed correlation patterns were adequately reconstructed in all calendar months a closer inspection of the graphs indicates that for the amount process some underestimation of the observed dependencies between nearby grid points is detectable this can in part be associated with mesoscale weather patterns which are more difficult to capture in the amount process 4 2 2 wet and dry spells another criterion of importance for the evaluation of the markov chain model used to synthesize the occurrence time series is the distribution of wet and dry spell lengths fig 7 shows the frequency distribution of wet and dry spells for a sample grid point as shown in fig 7a the model has preserved the frequency of wet spells to an acceptable level the frequency analysis of dry spells on the other hand as shown in fig 7b confirms that short to medium dry spells are simulated sufficiently whereas long dry spells 15 days are underestimated by the occurrence model the probability distribution of the dry spell lengths for observed and generated sequences affirms what was described by wilks and wilby 1999 as the incapacity of the first order markov model to produce a sufficient number of long dry spells for the first order dependence model the probability distribution of spell lengths follows the simple geometric distribution given by 31 pr x x p 1 p x 1 x 1 2 3 where p p 01 for dry spells and p 1 p 11 for wet spells eq 31 is true only if the probability p is constant year round which is not the case in practice since differences in frontal and convective systems cause the transition probabilities to change throughout the year because of this it can be concluded that the first order two state markov model oversimplifies the trends in transition probabilities which are subject to seasonal patterns hopkins and robillard 1964 4 2 3 moments of the precipitation amounts fig 8 compares historical capa rdpa and the generated precipitation with respect to the first two moments of the precipitation amounts for monthly accumulations as shown the model has fully preserved the observed monthly means with marginal errors for the standard deviation however for almost all grid points the spread of the generated daily precipitation amounts is consistently higher than that of the observations with errors as high as nearly 10 as wilks 1998 points out the application of eq 15 for fizzling out higher precipitation amounts towards the margins of wet regions results in the generated intensities generally exhibiting a higher variance additionally the monthly plot of the standard deviation indicates that the model performs slightly better during winter from october to march than summer from april to september this is directly related to the performance of the amount model in simulating convective precipitation 4 2 4 interannual variability when synthesized precipitation is aggregated to yield for instance annual or monthly totals stochastic models often show discrepancies between observed and simulated data this can typically be linked to the existence of low frequency variation wilks 1999 this phenomenon is known as overdispersion and can be assessed by the following equation wilks 1999 32 overdispersion observed variance modeled variance 1 100 fig 9 shows that the standard deviation of the monthly and annual totals are generally underestimated which is in line with the findings of other studies as shown in the figures the overdispersion intensity expressed by the average percentage of overdispersion is highest between november and january among distributions the mixed exponential distribution has been found to represent the least percentage of overdispersion as reported by wilks 1999 this is due to the flexibility of the model to better fit the range of intensities that exist fig 10 illustrates the standard deviation of the number of wet days per month for the first order markov model compared to capa rdpa historical data over the basin the figure shows that first order markov dependence has resulted in a moderate overdispersion for the majority of the grid points the model s weakness in reproducing the observed interannual variability of the number of wet days per month is due to the boreal ecoclimatic conditions of northern manitoba and saskatchewan characterizing the crb and governing accordingly moderate precipitation seasonality i e difference between wet and dry months within and in the vicinity of the basin abbasnezhadi 2017 showed that the crb experiences progressively drier conditions from december until june and the probability of precipitation occurrence grows substantially from july through november these conditions expose the basin to some degree of seasonality between dry and wet months such that the first order dependence model is not able to fully capture in order to alleviate overdispersion for the occurrence process higher order or hybrid order markov models or spell length models e g mixed geometric distribution could be applied as an alternative solution generalized linear modeling glm kim et al 2012 could be introduced to reduce overdispersion in both synthesized daily occurrence and amount variables it should however be reminded that none of these schemes were applied here to improve the interannual variability of the synthesized precipitation since the degree of shortfall was not found to be sufficiently drastic to justify the application of more complex procedures moreover such schemes may only decrease the degree of overdispersion and would not necessarily remove it entirely katz and parlange 1998 4 2 5 extreme value characteristics the occurrence and amount processes used by the proposed gridded daily precipitation generator are also assessed as to their ability to simulate extreme events such as maximum observed precipitation amounts or maximum wet or dry spells care should be taken when computing the extremes of the synthetic data as the number of years to be considered should be equal to the number of years in the observed time series this is to ensure that the computed extremes for both the observations and the generated data have the same empirical return periods as the capa rdpa data covers a temporal range between 2002 and 2011 10 years generated precipitation amounts were grouped into 10 year time windows the average of the largest generated daily precipitation amounts in each window was computed and compared with their observed counterpart as shown in fig 11 a for the analysis subnetwork although the model overestimated the maximum daily precipitation at several grid points fig 11a generally illustrates a clear relationship between observed and generated extremes fig 11b on the other hand shows the relationship between the largest generated precipitation amounts in each month based the rmse scores the generated precipitation is least accurate from june through september when high intensity rainfall happens over the basin bias scores on the other hand indicate that between july and september the largest observed amount was on average underestimated which again highlights the poorer performance of the model during summer the maximum precipitation amount is best preserved between november and march it is important to note that only 10 year records are being evaluated and so some degree of scatter is expected in one way the observed quantity is more uncertain because it is based on just one sample whereas the simulated samples are averaged over several 10 year records fig 12 compares the longest generated wet and dry spells at each grid point against the longest spells in the historical capa rdpa record for a sample grid point although at some grid points the largest generated dry and wet spell durations differ greatly from the observations on average the generated extremes are longer by only 2 1 and 2 2 days as shown by the graphs some of the longest observed extreme dry and wet spells on the order of 50 to 110 days respectively are underestimated 4 3 evaluation of the generated temperature 4 3 1 inter grid correlation similar to the precipitation model the gridded nature of the temperature model makes the observed pairwise correlation of gem hourly temperature data between grid points a vital statistic to preserve fig 13 shows the intra grid correlation relationships between observed gem hourly temperatures and the corresponding generated temperature time series a close agreement between the correlation structure of observed and modeled hourly temperature fields generally exists although stronger correlations are marginally underestimated 4 3 2 diurnal variation fig 14 depicts time variation in the first two moments of hourly temperatures averaged over all the grid points as shown in fig 14a the gridded hourly model generally performs well in terms of recreating the variation of the first moment of the gem hourly temperature throughout the year at different synoptic hours however from may through july and between 6am and 1 pm the mean hourly temperatures were marginally overestimated by a few degrees fig 14b on the other hand shows the time variation in the standard deviation of hourly temperatures illustrating that for the majority of the months the standard deviation of hourly temperatures was underestimated this is not a surprising outcome since standard deviation is typically more subject to nonsystematic variability and moreover the standard deviations shown in fig 14b were smoothed by fourier analysis to normalize the hourly temperature data 4 3 3 interannual variability and extreme value characteristics the temperature model may also be evaluated in terms of interannual monthly moments and monthly high and low extremes fig 15 a shows that the model perfectly preserves the mean monthly temperature at different grid points throughout the domain except for february when it is slightly underestimated bias values are shown parenthetically to assess the divergence of the moments between the generated temperatures and the historical records fig 15b shows that the monthly spread of the temperature data is generally underestimated in spring and summer but is well represented from november through january fig 15c and e illustrate the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures depicting an agreeing pattern during spring and summer when monthly means are well captured between november and february the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are respectively over and underestimated for most of the grid points fig 15d and f show the spread of monthly extremes demonstrating a weak relationship between the observed and generated data fig 16 compares the annual mean and standard deviation of the modeled temperatures evaluated over all available individual years against the observed statistics using contour maps to depict different statistics the figure also shows the extent to which the model has preserved the first two moments of the annual maximum and minimum temperatures over the network fig 16a c and e show mean mean maximum and mean minimum annual temperatures respectively in and around the crb while the model has quite decently preserved the mean annual temperature throughout the domain the mean annual high and low extremes are under and overestimated by 3 5 and 14 5 respectively fig 16b d and f depict the interannual variance of the maximum and minimum annual temperatures the interannual variance of the hourly temperatures are slightly underestimated throughout the basin which is related to the overdispersion problem discussed earlier for maximum annual temperatures the generated data are generally overdispersed by almost 70 which translates to an underestimated interannual variability of 1 5 c at the other extreme the interannual variance of the minimum annual temperatures has been overestimated domain wide by nearly 0 7 c translating into an underdispersion of the interannual variability by 33 4 3 4 frequency analysis of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds the generated hourly temperature can also be evaluated in terms of the duration of time maximum and minimum temperatures remain below or above a certain threshold denoting h as the number of hours within a time period e g any month any season or the whole record and c as the number of successive hours of interest e g 3 6 12 24 72 144 there are h c 1 individual overlapping c hour time spans during the period of time h therefore the number of c hour time spans during which the maximum or minimum temperature remained below or above the threshold for the entire period of time under investigation was analyzed probabilistically fig 17 a shows the frequencies with which the maximum temperature falls below selected threshold temperatures for various time spans specified in hours the figure is produced by taking into account the full period of record for both observed and generated data for thresholds between 30 and 10 c the probability that the maximum generated hourly temperatures stays below the specified threshold for any duration is smaller than for the observed temperatures for thresholds of 20 and 30 c the cumulative frequency of generated temperatures below the thresholds is larger in the case of the observed temperatures however the simulated frequencies are generally close to the observed ones fig 17b shows the frequencies with which the minimum temperature is above the selected threshold temperatures for various time spans for threshold values between 30 and 10 c it is more likely that the generated minimum temperatures stay above the threshold temperatures than the observations but for thresholds of 0 and 10 c the simulated cumulative frequency is smaller than that for the observed temperatures the frequency with which the minimum temperature stays above 20 c in any of the 3 6 or 12 h periods is overestimated while for longer time spans it is marginally underestimated 5 summary and conclusions in this study two stochastic weather models were introduced for the synchronized generation of gridded daily precipitation and hourly temperature data these models were used by abbasnezhadi et al 2019 as part of a hydro geostatistical framework for the assessment of weather observation networks in spite of wide variety of applications for gridded weather generators there is far less literature available on these generators than on single site ones for the multi site generation of daily precipitation data the majority of available literature is based on the approach described by wilks 1998 2009 which in turn is based on the general parametric technique introduced by richardson 1981 the gridded precipitation generator described in this study is similar to the multi site daily model introduced by wilks 2009 however unlike the approach described by wilks in which generator parameters derived at observation locations were interpolated onto a matrix of grid points we used gridded reanalysis data to directly estimate model parameters at each grid point the temperature model introduced in this study on the other hand combines the multi site daily maximum and minimum temperature generator described by wilks 2008 with the single site hourly temperature generator outlined by hansen and driscoll 1977 the resulting model is the first gridded hourly temperature generator in which the generation of temperature at a given grid point is conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence at the same grid point when conditioning the temperature data on precipitation time series it is necessary to identify the state of precipitation for contemporaneous observed temperature time series on each hourly time step and for each grid point this should be done prior to estimating the fourier coefficients given by eqs 29 and 30 this is not an straightforward task as capa precipitation data is reported in daily accumulations while gem temperature data are recorded in hourly time steps it was possible to disaggregate daily precipitation amounts through temporal downscaling procedures sharif et al 2007 to distinguish between wet and dry hours on each day or to design an hourly precipitation generator however it was assumed that hourly variations in temperatures between wet and dry hours was negligible and a simplified approach was used for a particular grid point and a particular day all hourly temperatures on a given day were flagged as wet if that day was reported as wet in the observed capa record and vice versa this simplification however quite by chance caused a particular hour on a specific day to be either flagged as wet or dry over the entire observed record of gem data creating instability in the computations to prevent this hurdle mean daily temperature data were first smoothed by a 3 day moving average window smoothed daily mean data were then used to estimate the coefficients of the fourier function the efficiency of the generators should be investigated in terms of the computational budget required for creating the synthesized fields as well as the generators performance in terms of capturing the observed statistics the two most crucial steps to re create the spatial structure of observed precipitation fields was to solve ρ ω ρ and γ ζ γ for ω and ζ respectively for large domains with thousands of grid points such as the case of the study basin where there were as many as 8772 capa grid points in and around the crb these two steps would become computationally expensive the total number of cross correlations to explain the spatial dependencies among all pairs of capa grid points is approximately 40 million n n 1 2 for each month defining this number of dependencies would be computationally expensive and could cause data storage problems on both hard disk and ram while making computations of random variables intensive therefore it would not have been efficient computationally to follow wilks 1998 approach and apply empirically derived curves for each pair of stations in order to associate the required correlation of random numbers to the observed correlation of occurrences there have been efforts to solve this seemingly simple yet computationally demanding problem khalili et al 2004 tried to make this procedure more efficient by using regional curves instead of all possible station pairs although some improvements were achieved their approach continues to inherit some of the efficiency drawbacks of the wilks approach brissette et al 2007 in this study we came up with a simple and robust alternative solution by drawing ω values for given values of transition probabilities and observed correlation coefficient of precipitation occurrence for pairs of grid points from a pre populated multi dimensional matrix produced at the beginning of the simulation the runtime of the generation algorithm was also significantly reduced in this work by summarizing the spatial information throughout the gridded network given the spatial resolution of the capa reanalysis products used in this study which was around 10 km the change in spatial correlation over short distances in the order of 1 km was small enough to justify summarizing the correlation data moreover as many as 50 000 cross correlations could be defined over such short spans therefore all distances were rounded to the nearest integer value in km and then the associated correlations over the span of 0 5 km surrounding the grid point were averaged in addition to further simplify the computations it was reasonable to choose a subset of grid points extracted from the full network rather than performing the computations over the entire network of grid points the density of the network in both latitude and longitude was reduced by some factor for instance a subnetwork extracted by a factor of 3 in both coordinates resulted in a total of 989 grid points 1 grid point per 900 km2 subsequently the number of cross correlations were reduced from 40 million to less than 0 5 million the performance of the weather generators was analyzed and confirmed this assessment was necessary to ensure that the synthesized precipitation and temperature fields retained the statistical characteristics of the gridded observations the evaluation of the precipitation fields focused on both the occurrence and amount processes generated and observed daily precipitation fields were compared with each other in terms of correlation patterns wet and dry spells moments of the precipitation distributions interannual variability and extreme value characteristics the assessments proved that the precipitation model preserved several key statistical properties of the gridded capa rdpa observations to an acceptable level however a few discrepancies were also detected the most significant shortfalls included the ability of the model to capture long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation while both of these shortcomings are in line with the findings of other studies see e g buishand 1978 guttorp 1995 jones and thornton 1997 racsko et al 1991 wilks 1999 wilks and wilby 1999 neither of them were found to be critical temperature fields were evaluated by comparing generated and observed hourly temperatures in terms of correlation patterns diurnal variation interannual variability extreme value characteristics and a frequency analysis of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds similar to the precipitation model it was revealed that the proposed temperature generator is robust yet simple the assessment showed that several key features are well preserved and only a few discrepancies were detected the most significant defect identified is the departure of the interannual variability of the generated maximum and minimum temperatures from those observed several statistical properties of the temperature data which are crucial for hydrological simulation were preserved to a satisfactory level the most important of these well preserved attributes are the first two moments of the hourly data and the cumulative frequency of the maximum and minimum temperature thresholds if the empirical distribution of temperature data used as input in a hydrologic model does not reflect the true atmospheric conditions over the basin various hydrological processes will be poorly modeled for instance evapotranspiration which is found to have a relationship with precipitation in the crb is a dominant watershed process governed by the air temperature in the basin in general it can be concluded that the proposed precipitation and temperature models generated weather fields that can be considered good representations of observed data

6539,in this study synchronized gridded precipitation and temperature generators were developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to reconstruct the spatial structure and other statistical properties of high resolution capa canadian precipitation analysis precipitation and gem global environmental multiscale model temperature products the precipitation generator is an extension to the gridded multi site occurrence amount model while the multi site framework is not efficiently applicable to regions with limited precipitation information and sparse observation network this paper provides the full mathematical description of estimating the model based on high resolution gridded products the temperature model on the other hand introduces the first gridded hourly generator in the literature in which cyclic temperature components are conditioned using wet and dry day status information this was achieved using harmonic functions establishing the connection between the simulated daily precipitation occurrence time series and the moments of the generated temperature data one of the key features of the proposed gridded generators is the capacity to produce temporally coherent fields of precipitation and temperature an essential prerequisite for hydrologic modeling applications the generators were evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce the standard interannual and extreme value characteristics of observed gridded products the gridded precipitation model can preserve key statistical and spatial properties of the gridded capa observations to an acceptable level while similar to the original multi site framework it falls short to capture long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation the temperature model on the other hand preserves the majority of key features of the gridded gem temperature observations including the first two moments of the hourly data and the cumulative frequency of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds the only notable defect identified is the departure of the interannual variability of the generated maximum and minimum temperatures from those observed keywords stochastic modeling gridded generator precipitation generator temperature generator capa gem 1 introduction the main goal of hydro geostatistical assessment of weather observation networks is to merge physically based and statistical evaluations of how network properties affect precipitation estimations and ensuing simulated flows see e g bardossy and das 2008 essou et al 2017 st hilaire et al 2003 wilson et al 1979 xu et al 2015 currently this objective is pursued through deterministic i e application of actual readings and stochastic i e simulation of precipitation data approaches dong et al 2005 the first approach is applicable when high quality weather information including precipitation and temperature can be collected by means of ground or radar observations the second scheme however is effective when observations are scattered in both time and space limiting hydrologic modeling the second approach can be undertaken using weather generators which are probabilistic tools used to generate weather data with the same statistical properties as historical observations there are numerous examples of stochastic weather generators used in hydro geostatistical network assessment studies tarboton et al 1987 and bras et al 1988 used the nine parameter model developed by waymire et al 1984 commonly known as the wgr stochastic generator over 1995 to synthesize precipitation while estimating variance of the simulated runoff to assess the accuracy of the observation network krajewski et al 1991 also used the wgr model to generate precipitation data while performing a monte carlo simulation experiment to investigate the effect of the spatial and temporal resolutions of the network on the simulated hydrological response of a small catchment abbasnezhadi et al 2019 designed a stochastic hydro geostatistical algorithm to evaluate the impact of increasing meteorological network density on hydrologic modeling outcomes the algorithm was designed within the framework of a data assimilation simulation experiment which was based on the paradigm of observing system simulation experiments osse this framework specifically requires that synthetic observations are created through a step referred to as the nature run nr see abbasnezhadi et al 2019 for more details the generation of the nr atmosphere is conventionally carried out by running a sophisticated atmospheric model with no data assimilation masutani et al 2013 for the atmospheric model to run extensive data resources are required which makes this stage computationally expensive abbasnezhadi et al 2019 suggested an alternative approach in which stochastically generated gridded weather data are used to create physically coherent reference weather fields in this context a gridded weather generator had to be designed with an emphasis on producing temporally coherent fields of precipitation and temperature that is temperature field is conditioned using wet and dry day precipitation status information this coherency also represents an essential feature in hydrological modeling applications in addition to their application in assessment of weather networks gridded weather simulators can be used for several other purposes in hydrology such as climate change impact studies and statistical downscaling see e g brissette et al 2007 or seasonal climate forecasts see e g wilks 2002 for downscaling climate simulations various statistical relationships between locally observed meteorological data and large scale predictors have been developed in the literature alaya et al 2018 jeong et al 2012 however the quality and availability of observed climate variables is a recurring issue in many parts of the world which has negatively affected downscaling practices with recent developments in reanalysis and other gridded products a better understanding of the spatial distribution and climatology of precipitation and temperature is now available thus there is now an opportunity to exploit gridded products to disaggregate simulation outputs from climate models the developed synchronized gridded generators in this study provide one such means for downscaling outputs from global and regional climate models by incorporating gridded numerical and reanalysis precipitation and temperature data the gridded framework is particularly advantageous in order to evaluate the sensitivity of distributed hydrologic models to changes in climate wilks 1999 as srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 discuss ignoring the spatial correlation between weather stations while using single site weather generators in hydrologic modeling studies can result in major modeling inaccuracies in distributed hydrologic modeling it is preferred to incorporate gridded input data with a resolution similar to that of the model s grid resolution shrestha et al 2006 this however becomes a challenging task if the resolution of input data is coarser than that of the model s grid resolution in addition recent studies have shown that the accuracy of streamflow simulations can be highly sensitive to changes in spatial resolution of gridded input data abbasnezhadi et al 2019 the results of an observation network assessment in the canadian boreal ecoclimatic zone indicated that the nash sutcliffe efficiency shows a hyperbolic variation with respect to various resolutions of input meteorological data this trend is in line with the findings of bardossy and das 2008 dong et al 2005 and xu et al 2013 who reported that when resolution falls beneath a certain limit flow simulation skill drops rapidly the aggregate of these factors indicates the significance of high resolution gridded weather generators in hydrologic modeling applications there has not been much done in the past with respect to developing gridded precipitation and temperature generators there were only a few models developed for multi site generation of precipitation and temperature including the space time model bardossy and plate 1992 the nearest neighbor resampling approach buishand and brandsma 2001 the spatial moving average process khalili et al 2007 2011 the latent autoregressive model rasmussen 2013 the disaggregation approach based on gibbs sampling gagnon et al 2012 2017 rasmussen and abbasnezhadi 2014 or the multi site temperature model described by baigorria 2014 the majority of what has already been developed for precipitation modeling is based on the multi site approach explained by wilks 1998 2009 who generalized the single site precipitation and temperature generators introduced by richardson 1981 when developing a multi site model the spatial structure of observed data is arguably one of the most important properties that should be preserved wilks 2009 took care of this objective by applying the multivariate nonparametric regression procedure described by lall et al 2006 to interpolate generator parameters derived at observation locations onto a matrix of grid points this regression function associates model parameters derived at each observation location to the coordinates and elevations of target grid points with elevation acting as the main covariate this scheme for constructing a gridded model works well for observation networks of decent density if the network density is low the quality of the interpolation suffers regardless of the interpolation technique to avoid this problem in this study a gridded model was designed rather than interpolating parameters in the proposed approach gridded daily precipitation analysis datasets were used to estimate model parameters at each analysis grid point when regional analysis of the effect of precipitation and temperature spatial variability on flow characteristics is at stake distributed or semi distributed hydrologic models are used khakbaz et al 2012 this signifies the importance of conditioning the generation of temperature fields on precipitation data moreover designing a temperature generator to operate at sub daily temporal scales facilitates the application of the generated data in future event based hydrologic models which typically function at short time intervals while there have been efforts to develop procedures for disaggregating temperature time series from daily to subdaily time steps see e g sharif et al 2007 waichler and wigmosta 2003 no literature has yet been published on the generation of gridded temperature data at sub daily temporal scales e g hourly conditioned on precipitation time series this paper presents a full description of the mathematical details of the models used for the synchronized generation of gridded daily precipitation and hourly temperature data as part of the osse based network assessment framework developed by abbasnezhadi et al 2019 2 study area the churchill river basin crb is located in the boreal ecoclimatic zone in northern manitoba and saskatchewan canada the crb is a prime example of a region where limited precipitation information makes the gridded precipitation generation as described by wilks 2009 inapplicable fig 1 shows the crb which spans roughly 1200 km in latitude from 52 9900 to 59 6900 north and 700 km in longitude from 93 7150 to 112 9150 west gridded daily precipitation analysis datasets from 2002 to 2012 were extracted from the canadian meteorological center cmc s canadian precipitation analysis capa system version 2 4 β 8 the product of which is known as the regional deterministic precipitation analysis rdpa mahfouf et al 2007 concurrent hourly temperature datasets were collected from the regional deterministic prediction system version 3 0 0 rdps 300 which in turn relies on the cmc s global environmental multiscale gem model côté et al 1998a b capa rdpa and gem temperature data at the location of 8772 grid points in and around the crb were acquired in grib2 format and were converted into a two dimensional rectangular format with a spatial resolution of 0 10 in latitude and 0 15 in longitude roughly 10 km in both directions at 60 n before application in the modeling framework fig 1 shows the location of the grid points in the rectangular grid over the crb 3 methodology 3 1 precipitation generator the generation of precipitation data is carried out in two separate stages richardson 1981 in the first stage a binary series of wet and dry days are generated through a chain dependent process in the second stage precipitation amounts on wet days are simulated by randomly drawing from a distribution fitted to observed precipitation amounts on wet days fig 2 shows the two stages of the precipitation generation algorithm the occurrence process is shown by the single weighted line while the amount model goes through the double weighted process as shown in the algorithm these two simulation processes are not isolated from each other in order to ensure a gradual transition in precipitation amounts from high intensity cells to low intensity cells at the boundary of the wet regions the amount model of the precipitation generator should be associated with the occurrence model 3 1 1 gridded occurrence model in order to produce wet and dry sequences of precipitation the occurrence process simulates precipitation incidents at daily time steps using first order two state markov dependence precipitation can be broken down into two independent components x l t and y l t which explain occurrence and amount components respectively the observed precipitation occurrence on day t at grid point l x l t is given by 1 x l t 1 if y l t 0 0 if y l t 0 which states that at a given grid point a day is reported as wet when a value greater than zero is recorded for that grid point if precipitation amounts are truncated at a given detection level threshold dlt then the value of x l t should be reported as zero below the aforementioned dlt the markovian model is described by its parameters commonly referred to as transition probabilities they explain the probabilities by which precipitation occurrence transitions from one state to another wilks 1999 fit markov models of orders 1 2 and 3 to evaluate the overall goodness of fit of each model to data taken from precipitation stations in different parts of the us depicting a variety of climates the models were assessed using the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and it was concluded that a model as simple a k a parsimonious as the first order markov dependence in which the precipitation occurrence state of the current day depends only on that of the previous day is adequate for simulating precipitation occurrence time series nevertheless the first order markov model can yield an insufficient number of very long dry spells if observed precipitation data illustrate great difference between wet and dry seasons this issue will be elaborated in more detail later for first order dependence two parameters are enough to explain the model at any grid point l these parameters capture the probability of a wet day preceded by either a wet day p 11 l or a dry day p 01 l 2 p 11 l prob x l t 1 x l t 1 1 3 p 01 l prob x l t 1 x l t 1 0 if transition probabilities are estimated on a monthly basis the seasonality of the observed time series can be captured once transition probabilities are computed then at each time step t a uniform random number u t u 0 1 is generated and a wet day is produced if 4 u t p c l where p c l is the critical probability at grid point l and is defined as 5 p c l p 01 l if x l t 1 0 p 11 l if x l t 1 1 a dry day is generated if the condition given by eq 4 is not satisfied in order to model gridded occurrence time series the single site generator should be expanded to the synchronized generation of precipitation over a matrix of grid points this is possible if the generation of precipitation occurrence across grid points is carried out using temporally independent and spatially correlated random numbers to ensure that the spatial correlation of the generated precipitation fields resembles that of the historical data cross correlation of the forcing random numbers at all grid points must be taken into consideration at each grid point random numbers are generated such that they account for the intra grid spatial correlations of observed occurrence time series the cross correlations between the vectors of random numbers at all grid points are defined prior to generating the vectors of precipitation occurrence throughout the domain let w l w l 1 w l 2 w l t represent a vector of random numbers at grid point l where w l t is the random variate generated at time step t for the same grid point the correlation between w l and another vector e g w k at grid point k may then be expressed by ω l k corr w l w k similarly the correlation between vectors of observed precipitation occurrence time series at grid points l and k can be stated as ρ l k corr x l x k the challenge is then to find ω l k so as to minimize l k ρ l k ρ l k 2 for every possible pair of grid points l and k in the domain here ρ l k is the modeled counterpart of ρ l k and is not yet known an equation of the form ρ ω ρ does not have a direct solution for convenience the random variates w l t are generated from a normal rather than a uniform distribution wilks 1999 this allows vectors of random variates to be generated from a multivariate gaussian distribution for a given network of n grid points the correlations between generated normal variates are populated into an n n covariance matrix ω 6 ω ω 1 1 ω 1 2 ω 1 n ω 2 1 ω 2 2 ω 2 n ω n 1 ω n 2 ω n n the ω matrix is determined by first generating the matrix of gaussian random numbers at all grid points from w n o ω where mean o is a 1 n column vector of zeros the diagonal elements of ω diag ω ω 1 1 ω 2 2 ω n n representing the variances of the random variates at all grid points are equal to unity w l w l t n 0 1 this means that the marginal distribution of the random numbers for each grid point is standard gaussian populating the ω matrix is handled numerically the value of ω l k is directly influenced by a total of five parameters the pairs of transition probabilities at each of the two grid points and the correlation coefficient of the precipitation occurrence between the two grid points therefore a five dimensional table of ω values as a function of the five parameters can be produced at the beginning of the simulation and table interpolation is performed to look up values of ω for the given values of p 01 p 11 l p 01 p 11 k and ρ l k the covariance matrix is explained by the exponential model for each calendar month the correlation function given below is used to describe the spatial dependencies 7 ω exp ψ occ 1 d ψ occ 2 where d is the domain wide matrix of the horizontal distance between pairs of grid points l and k 8 d d 1 1 d 1 2 d 1 n d 2 1 d 2 2 d 2 n d n 1 d n 2 d n n also ψ occ 1 and ψ occ 2 are the monthly model parameters which can be obtained using iterative least squares estimation to fit the nonlinear regression given by eq 7 the optimized parameters are shown in table 1 finally a wet day is generated if w l t φ 1 p c l where p c l is the critical probability at grid point l defined by eq 5 and φ 1 is the inverse standard gaussian cumulative distribution operator 3 1 2 gridded amount model in the second stage of the richardson model daily precipitation amounts on wet days are simulated by randomly drawing amounts from a distribution fitted to observed amounts on wet days several distributions are available to fit the daily accumulations of the precipitation amount exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution the formulation of which is provided below location and time indices are dropped for r and β for simplicity 9 f r β 1 β exp r β where r is the total precipitation amount observed β is the distribution s scale parameter and f r β identifies the probability density function for the precipitation event r when high intensity precipitation skews the distribution of precipitation the single exponential distribution given by eq 9 cannot capture the full range of amounts that may occur in such a case a weighted sum of two or more exponential distributions a k a a mixed exponential distribution may better represent the full range of precipitation amounts in the majority of cases dividing the range of amounts into two possible regimes is enough to explain the full precipitation distribution one regime possesses a probability of α that precipitation amounts may happen with mean β 1 and the other regime has a complementary probability of 1 α that the precipitation amounts may be observed with mean β 2 the probability distribution of precipitation amounts can then be written as 10 f r α β 1 β 2 α f 1 1 α f 2 where f 1 and f 2 are the two exponential distributions with means β 1 and β 2 respectively as follows 11 f 1 1 β 1 exp r β 1 f 2 1 β 2 exp r β 2 substituting f 1 and f 2 from eq 11 into eq 10 yields the following 12 f r α β 1 β 2 α 1 β 1 exp r β 1 1 α 1 β 2 exp r β 2 where α is the weighting parameter associated with the larger of the two scale parameters β 1 and β 2 wilks 2006 wilks 1999 compared the mixed exponential distribution against the gamma distribution and explained that although the three parameter distribution shows a lower parsimony the bic statistic favors the mixed exponential distribution as it shows a better goodness of fit with observations chapman 1994 wilks and wilby 1999 therefore in this study the three parameter distribution was selected to generate precipitation amounts this decision also accounts for tendency of precipitation fields to exhibit a gradual transition from high intensity rain cells to regions of no precipitation which can be captured by interconnecting the parameters of the markov model to those of eq 12 wilks 1998 to maintain the spatial consistency of generated precipitation amounts a technique similar to the one used in the occurrence process is applied assuming z l z l 1 z l 2 z l t and z k z k 1 z k 2 z k t be vectors of random numbers from a standard normal distribution at grid points l and k respectively then ζ l k corr z l z k furthermore γ l k corr y l y k can be defined as the pairwise correlation between observed time series of precipitation amounts on wet days and γ l k as the corresponding correlations between the synthesized data a ζ l k value must then be found so that γ ζ γ in other words z l and z k must be generated such that the correlation between vectors of precipitation amounts at a pair of grid points resembles the observed correlation the challenge is to determine the correlation ζ l k between z l and z k that satisfies this requirement the value of ζ l k is derived through a function similar to eq 7 although a new set of parameters should be determined for each month to minimize σ l k γ l k γ l k 2 this problem can be handled using a similar table interpolation approach as explained for the occurrence process however this would result in a 7 dimensional table and interpolating such a table is computationally expensive and may result in inconsistencies in the correlation matrix therefore for the amount process a new set of monthly parameters ψ amn 1 and ψ amn 2 are obtained from monte carlo simulations on the amount model this approach yields the parameter set that results in vectors of random numbers with a ζ l k minimizing the sum of squared errors sse function σ l k γ l k γ l k 2 the parameters search domain should be selected by some initial sampling in order to find the proper range therefore values in the order of ψ amn 1 0 0001 0 0030 and ψ amn 2 1 000 1 400 were considered for parameter tuning table 2 provides the optimal monthly parameters derived by monte carlo simulation for the spatial correlation function for vectors of random numbers of the amount process with the values of ψ amn 1 and ψ amn 2 identified for the amount process monthly covariance matrices for the random normal variates throughout the whole domain can be obtained in matrix format as follows 13 σ exp ψ amn 1 d ψ amn 2 where the σ matrix has the following elements 14 σ ζ 1 1 ζ 1 2 ζ 1 n ζ 2 1 ζ 2 2 ζ 2 n ζ n 1 ζ n 2 ζ n n similar to the occurrence model the σ matrix is used in the amount process to generate the matrix of the gaussian random numbers at all grid points from z n o σ the diagonal elements of σ are equal to unity implying that for each grid location l z l z l t n 0 1 this ensures that all marginal distributions of precipitation amounts are preserved as wilks 1998 explains in order to avoid unrealistic patterns in synthesized precipitation fields the amount process should be associated with the occurrence process by comparing α l from the amount model to the φ w l t p c l ratio where w l t is the random variate of the occurrence model at time t and grid point l pooled from the same generated batch for the occurrence process if φ w l t α p c l the smaller of the two scale parameters of the mixed exponential distribution is selected as the distribution mean β l t of the exponential distribution i e β l t β 2 l otherwise 15 β l t β 2 l 2 β 1 l β 2 l 1 φ w l t α l t p c l in fact if φ w l t α p c l then a linear combination between the scale parameters can better capture the lower precipitation amounts at the boundary of wet regions if φ w l t α p c l then β 2 l is selected if φ w l t α p c l 0 5 then β 1 l is selected and if φ w l t 0 then β l t 2 β 1 l β 2 l 3 1 3 simulating precipitation data the precipitation amount r t l at grid point l and daily time step t on wet days is randomly generated using an inverse cdf procedure by drawing from the exponential distribution the cumulative distribution function of which is given as follows 16 r l t β l t ln 1 v l t where β l t and v l t are the distribution mean and a randomly generated uniform number respectively similar to the occurrence process it is helpful to generate the variates in the normal space if observed precipitation amounts are truncated at a given dlt e g 2 mm it is necessary to shift these amounts to the origin by subtracting the dlt from the observed precipitation amounts prior to estimating the parameters of the mixed exponential distribution correspondingly once precipitation amounts are modeled the same threshold level must be added back to the simulated precipitation amounts taking these provisions into consideration eq 16 is revised as follows 17 r l t dlt β l t ln 1 φ z l t once precipitation amounts are generated over the whole domain then 18 y l t 0 if x l t 0 r l t if x l t 1 which means that for a grid point l on day t if the occurrence model has generated a dry day the precipitation amount generated on that day should be zero otherwise the modeled amount is considered 3 2 temperature generator it is computationally less challenging to model temperature as temperature time series do not have the intermittent and discontinuous nature observed in precipitation time series nevertheless temperature time series have important deterministic components in the form of standard and diurnal cycles which should be identified and removed prior to obtaining and modeling normalized residuals in order to remove the deterministic component of hourly temperature data this study adopted the single site hourly temperature model introduced by hansen and driscoll 1977 this approach separates hourly temperature data using harmonic functions to characterize annual and diurnal cycles however hansen s single site temperature model does not associate the moments of the temperature time series to the state of precipitation which does not ensure coherency between temperature and precipitation models in this paper an approach is introduced for constructing a gridded hourly temperature model conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence by incorporating two sets of harmonic functions these harmonics establish the connection between simulated daily precipitation occurrence time series and the moments of the generated temperature data this approach is similar to the one applied by wilks 2008 who combined the first two moments of daily maximum and minimum temperatures using separate moments on wet and dry days fig 3 displays the temperature model algorithm 3 2 1 cyclic moments of hourly temperature annual cycles of the diurnal variation in the first two moments mean and variance of the hourly temperature data at each grid point can be explained by harmonics these deterministic components of temperature are derived regardless of the state of precipitation occurrence to capture the diurnal cycle of the observed data the 730th and 1095th harmonics consistent with 12 and 8 h periods are considered along with the 1st and the 365th harmonics thus for a given grid point g the harmonic function is given by 19 p h t g t g n α h n g cos 2 π nt 8760 β h n g sin 2 π nt 8760 where p h t g is the modeled parameter representing either the mean μ h t g or the standard deviation σ h t g of the hourly temperature data t g is the mean hourly temperature over the whole record α h n g and β h n g are the fourier coefficients associated with the harmonic member n and n 1 365 730 1095 when temperature data are equally spaced and continuous in time i e no missing time steps the fourier coefficients for each modeled parameter can be estimated as follows 20 α h n g 2 8760 t 1 8760 m h t g cos 2 π nt 8760 21 β h n g 2 8760 t 1 8760 m h t g sin 2 π nt 8760 in which m h t g is any of the two moments μ h t g or σ h t g of the hourly temperature time series evaluated at each time step t over the full record of observed data and n is the harmonic number of the set described for eq 19 once the deterministic components μ h t g and σ h t g of the hourly temperature are derived they are used to reduce observed hourly temperature time series at each grid point to time series of normalized residuals as follows 22 r h t g t h t g μ h t g σ h t g where t h t g and r h t g are the observed hourly temperature and the corresponding normalized residual respectively at time step t and grid point g having the r h t g values derived the multi site first order autoregressive model given by eq 23 is applied to generate time series of hourly residuals at each grid point 23 r h t x r h t 1 y e t where r h t is the n 1 column vector here n is the number of grid points of the generated zero mean unit variance temperature residuals r h t g at each hourly time step t and grid point g r h t 1 is the lagged by 1 time step counterpart of r h t x and y are n n matrices containing autoregression parameters which force the generated time series to exhibit the required serial correlation and cross correlation coefficients and can be obtained by the method of moments bras and rodriguez iturbe 1985 and e t is a n 1 vector of random normal variates ε t g n 0 1 denoting the simultaneous unlagged and lag 1 correlation matrices of the normalized data as c 0 and c 1 respectively the autoregression parameters are computed by 24 x c 1 c 0 1 25 g c 0 xc 1 t where the 1 and t superscripts designate inverse and transpose matrices respectively and g is the gramian of y i e g yy t therefore y is obtained through cholesky decomposition of g it is important to note that in order to obtain full rank correlation matrices records of hourly temperature should be longer than the number of grid points which was the case in this work 3 2 2 conditioning hourly temperature data generated hourly temperature residuals can be transformed back to hourly temperatures by reversing eq 22 for grid point g 26 t h t g r h t g σ h t g μ h t g where t h t g is the generated temperature for grid point g at time step t in order to generate temperature fields that are temporally coherent with the generated precipitation fields eq 26 is conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence at each time step and grid point the cyclic moments of hourly temperature data described by eq 19 can be partitioned into two separate cycles describing the annual variation of each parameter according to the state of precipitation occurrence more specifically μ h t g is partitioned into μ h 0 t g and μ h 1 t g explaining the variation of mean hourly temperature during dry and wet hours respectively similarly σ h t g can be partitioned into σ h 0 t g and σ h 1 t g eq 26 can then be broken down into two separate cases at grid point g and for each time step t 27 t h t g r h t g σ h 0 t g μ h 0 t g if x g t 0 r h t g σ h 1 t g μ h 1 t g if x g t 1 where t h t g is now the generated hourly temperature data conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence at each time step t and grid point g and x is the generated precipitation occurrence at the same time step and grid point to the extent of the authors knowledge deriving the wet and dry components on the right hand side of eq 27 has not yet been discussed in the literature a simple procedure is outlined in the following section 3 2 3 simulating conditioned temperature data in order to obtain the hourly deterministic components of temperature conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence new sets of fourier functions representing mean daily temperature are considered here three harmonics are used to represent the annual cycle i e n 1 2 3 denoting the state of precipitation occurrence by the s superscript which can be either 0 for dry or 1 for wet conditions the fourier function can be written as follows 28 p d s t g t s g n 1 3 α d s n g cos 2 π nt 365 β d s n g sin 2 π nt 365 where p d s t g describes any of μ d 0 t g μ d 1 t g σ d 0 t g and σ d 1 t g t s g is the mean daily temperature on either wet or dry days computed over the whole observed record and α d s n g and β d s n g are the fourier coefficients computed separately for each the four modeled parameters and are given by 29 α d s n g 2 365 t 1 365 m d s t g cos 2 π nt 365 30 β d s n g 2 365 t 1 365 m d s t g sin 2 π nt 365 in which m d s t g is any of the two moments of the mean daily temperature data conditioned on the state of the day μ d s t g and σ d s t g the harmonic functions derived in eq 28 explaining the cyclic components of mean daily temperature take into account precipitation occurrence on each day these functions are thus used to shift the unconditional hourly harmonic curves explained by eq 19 such that they are conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence on each day and at each grid point 4 results and discussion 4 1 generated gridded weather fields fig 4 shows two realizations of daily precipitation fields in april and july synthesized in and around the crb by the gridded daily occurrence amount model the overall spatial integrity of the generated data as well as the gradual transition of precipitation amounts from higher intensity rain cells to regions of no precipitation is evident in both realizations fig 4a shows a realization of daily precipitation accumulation in april illustrating what could be a frontal system with amounts less than 20 mm fig 4b on the other hand depicts a synthesized daily accumulation in july where the precipitation field is dominated by what could be identified as high intensity convective rain cells scattered throughout the region fig 5 shows two realizations of hourly temperature fields in march and november synthesized in and around the crb by the gridded hourly temperature model fig 5a shows a realization in march demonstrating what could be a large temperature gradient through the study domain in early spring where freezing conditions as low as 30 c are seen in northeastern crb while western regions are dominated by warmer conditions around 8 c fig 5b on the other hand depicts a realization of what could be an early november condition showing mainly frigid conditions in the northern and central regions and relatively milder temperatures in the western parts of the basin the generated weather fields were evaluated while focusing not only on the parameters used directly in the modeling procedure e g transition probabilities used in the precipitation occurrence model but also on several other key features of the observed time series e g extreme value characteristics one hundred years of daily precipitation data 36 500 time steps and hourly temperature data 876 000 time steps were synthesized and were evaluated the number of years each variable was synthesized for was selected to minimize the uncertainty of each measured statistic in this analysis scatterplots are used to compare summary statistics of observed and synthesized data in order to improve the clarity of the graphs the evaluation was at times carried out over a subset of grid points spread out evenly throughout the study domain this sub domain consists of 32 grid points taken from the original domain and is shown in fig 1 4 2 evaluation of generated precipitation 4 2 1 inter grid correlation fig 6 illustrates the relationship between intra grid correlations for the capa rdpa observation and generated precipitation for the occurrence and the amount processes these graphs indicate that at both stages of the precipitation generation procedure the observed correlation patterns were adequately reconstructed in all calendar months a closer inspection of the graphs indicates that for the amount process some underestimation of the observed dependencies between nearby grid points is detectable this can in part be associated with mesoscale weather patterns which are more difficult to capture in the amount process 4 2 2 wet and dry spells another criterion of importance for the evaluation of the markov chain model used to synthesize the occurrence time series is the distribution of wet and dry spell lengths fig 7 shows the frequency distribution of wet and dry spells for a sample grid point as shown in fig 7a the model has preserved the frequency of wet spells to an acceptable level the frequency analysis of dry spells on the other hand as shown in fig 7b confirms that short to medium dry spells are simulated sufficiently whereas long dry spells 15 days are underestimated by the occurrence model the probability distribution of the dry spell lengths for observed and generated sequences affirms what was described by wilks and wilby 1999 as the incapacity of the first order markov model to produce a sufficient number of long dry spells for the first order dependence model the probability distribution of spell lengths follows the simple geometric distribution given by 31 pr x x p 1 p x 1 x 1 2 3 where p p 01 for dry spells and p 1 p 11 for wet spells eq 31 is true only if the probability p is constant year round which is not the case in practice since differences in frontal and convective systems cause the transition probabilities to change throughout the year because of this it can be concluded that the first order two state markov model oversimplifies the trends in transition probabilities which are subject to seasonal patterns hopkins and robillard 1964 4 2 3 moments of the precipitation amounts fig 8 compares historical capa rdpa and the generated precipitation with respect to the first two moments of the precipitation amounts for monthly accumulations as shown the model has fully preserved the observed monthly means with marginal errors for the standard deviation however for almost all grid points the spread of the generated daily precipitation amounts is consistently higher than that of the observations with errors as high as nearly 10 as wilks 1998 points out the application of eq 15 for fizzling out higher precipitation amounts towards the margins of wet regions results in the generated intensities generally exhibiting a higher variance additionally the monthly plot of the standard deviation indicates that the model performs slightly better during winter from october to march than summer from april to september this is directly related to the performance of the amount model in simulating convective precipitation 4 2 4 interannual variability when synthesized precipitation is aggregated to yield for instance annual or monthly totals stochastic models often show discrepancies between observed and simulated data this can typically be linked to the existence of low frequency variation wilks 1999 this phenomenon is known as overdispersion and can be assessed by the following equation wilks 1999 32 overdispersion observed variance modeled variance 1 100 fig 9 shows that the standard deviation of the monthly and annual totals are generally underestimated which is in line with the findings of other studies as shown in the figures the overdispersion intensity expressed by the average percentage of overdispersion is highest between november and january among distributions the mixed exponential distribution has been found to represent the least percentage of overdispersion as reported by wilks 1999 this is due to the flexibility of the model to better fit the range of intensities that exist fig 10 illustrates the standard deviation of the number of wet days per month for the first order markov model compared to capa rdpa historical data over the basin the figure shows that first order markov dependence has resulted in a moderate overdispersion for the majority of the grid points the model s weakness in reproducing the observed interannual variability of the number of wet days per month is due to the boreal ecoclimatic conditions of northern manitoba and saskatchewan characterizing the crb and governing accordingly moderate precipitation seasonality i e difference between wet and dry months within and in the vicinity of the basin abbasnezhadi 2017 showed that the crb experiences progressively drier conditions from december until june and the probability of precipitation occurrence grows substantially from july through november these conditions expose the basin to some degree of seasonality between dry and wet months such that the first order dependence model is not able to fully capture in order to alleviate overdispersion for the occurrence process higher order or hybrid order markov models or spell length models e g mixed geometric distribution could be applied as an alternative solution generalized linear modeling glm kim et al 2012 could be introduced to reduce overdispersion in both synthesized daily occurrence and amount variables it should however be reminded that none of these schemes were applied here to improve the interannual variability of the synthesized precipitation since the degree of shortfall was not found to be sufficiently drastic to justify the application of more complex procedures moreover such schemes may only decrease the degree of overdispersion and would not necessarily remove it entirely katz and parlange 1998 4 2 5 extreme value characteristics the occurrence and amount processes used by the proposed gridded daily precipitation generator are also assessed as to their ability to simulate extreme events such as maximum observed precipitation amounts or maximum wet or dry spells care should be taken when computing the extremes of the synthetic data as the number of years to be considered should be equal to the number of years in the observed time series this is to ensure that the computed extremes for both the observations and the generated data have the same empirical return periods as the capa rdpa data covers a temporal range between 2002 and 2011 10 years generated precipitation amounts were grouped into 10 year time windows the average of the largest generated daily precipitation amounts in each window was computed and compared with their observed counterpart as shown in fig 11 a for the analysis subnetwork although the model overestimated the maximum daily precipitation at several grid points fig 11a generally illustrates a clear relationship between observed and generated extremes fig 11b on the other hand shows the relationship between the largest generated precipitation amounts in each month based the rmse scores the generated precipitation is least accurate from june through september when high intensity rainfall happens over the basin bias scores on the other hand indicate that between july and september the largest observed amount was on average underestimated which again highlights the poorer performance of the model during summer the maximum precipitation amount is best preserved between november and march it is important to note that only 10 year records are being evaluated and so some degree of scatter is expected in one way the observed quantity is more uncertain because it is based on just one sample whereas the simulated samples are averaged over several 10 year records fig 12 compares the longest generated wet and dry spells at each grid point against the longest spells in the historical capa rdpa record for a sample grid point although at some grid points the largest generated dry and wet spell durations differ greatly from the observations on average the generated extremes are longer by only 2 1 and 2 2 days as shown by the graphs some of the longest observed extreme dry and wet spells on the order of 50 to 110 days respectively are underestimated 4 3 evaluation of the generated temperature 4 3 1 inter grid correlation similar to the precipitation model the gridded nature of the temperature model makes the observed pairwise correlation of gem hourly temperature data between grid points a vital statistic to preserve fig 13 shows the intra grid correlation relationships between observed gem hourly temperatures and the corresponding generated temperature time series a close agreement between the correlation structure of observed and modeled hourly temperature fields generally exists although stronger correlations are marginally underestimated 4 3 2 diurnal variation fig 14 depicts time variation in the first two moments of hourly temperatures averaged over all the grid points as shown in fig 14a the gridded hourly model generally performs well in terms of recreating the variation of the first moment of the gem hourly temperature throughout the year at different synoptic hours however from may through july and between 6am and 1 pm the mean hourly temperatures were marginally overestimated by a few degrees fig 14b on the other hand shows the time variation in the standard deviation of hourly temperatures illustrating that for the majority of the months the standard deviation of hourly temperatures was underestimated this is not a surprising outcome since standard deviation is typically more subject to nonsystematic variability and moreover the standard deviations shown in fig 14b were smoothed by fourier analysis to normalize the hourly temperature data 4 3 3 interannual variability and extreme value characteristics the temperature model may also be evaluated in terms of interannual monthly moments and monthly high and low extremes fig 15 a shows that the model perfectly preserves the mean monthly temperature at different grid points throughout the domain except for february when it is slightly underestimated bias values are shown parenthetically to assess the divergence of the moments between the generated temperatures and the historical records fig 15b shows that the monthly spread of the temperature data is generally underestimated in spring and summer but is well represented from november through january fig 15c and e illustrate the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures depicting an agreeing pattern during spring and summer when monthly means are well captured between november and february the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are respectively over and underestimated for most of the grid points fig 15d and f show the spread of monthly extremes demonstrating a weak relationship between the observed and generated data fig 16 compares the annual mean and standard deviation of the modeled temperatures evaluated over all available individual years against the observed statistics using contour maps to depict different statistics the figure also shows the extent to which the model has preserved the first two moments of the annual maximum and minimum temperatures over the network fig 16a c and e show mean mean maximum and mean minimum annual temperatures respectively in and around the crb while the model has quite decently preserved the mean annual temperature throughout the domain the mean annual high and low extremes are under and overestimated by 3 5 and 14 5 respectively fig 16b d and f depict the interannual variance of the maximum and minimum annual temperatures the interannual variance of the hourly temperatures are slightly underestimated throughout the basin which is related to the overdispersion problem discussed earlier for maximum annual temperatures the generated data are generally overdispersed by almost 70 which translates to an underestimated interannual variability of 1 5 c at the other extreme the interannual variance of the minimum annual temperatures has been overestimated domain wide by nearly 0 7 c translating into an underdispersion of the interannual variability by 33 4 3 4 frequency analysis of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds the generated hourly temperature can also be evaluated in terms of the duration of time maximum and minimum temperatures remain below or above a certain threshold denoting h as the number of hours within a time period e g any month any season or the whole record and c as the number of successive hours of interest e g 3 6 12 24 72 144 there are h c 1 individual overlapping c hour time spans during the period of time h therefore the number of c hour time spans during which the maximum or minimum temperature remained below or above the threshold for the entire period of time under investigation was analyzed probabilistically fig 17 a shows the frequencies with which the maximum temperature falls below selected threshold temperatures for various time spans specified in hours the figure is produced by taking into account the full period of record for both observed and generated data for thresholds between 30 and 10 c the probability that the maximum generated hourly temperatures stays below the specified threshold for any duration is smaller than for the observed temperatures for thresholds of 20 and 30 c the cumulative frequency of generated temperatures below the thresholds is larger in the case of the observed temperatures however the simulated frequencies are generally close to the observed ones fig 17b shows the frequencies with which the minimum temperature is above the selected threshold temperatures for various time spans for threshold values between 30 and 10 c it is more likely that the generated minimum temperatures stay above the threshold temperatures than the observations but for thresholds of 0 and 10 c the simulated cumulative frequency is smaller than that for the observed temperatures the frequency with which the minimum temperature stays above 20 c in any of the 3 6 or 12 h periods is overestimated while for longer time spans it is marginally underestimated 5 summary and conclusions in this study two stochastic weather models were introduced for the synchronized generation of gridded daily precipitation and hourly temperature data these models were used by abbasnezhadi et al 2019 as part of a hydro geostatistical framework for the assessment of weather observation networks in spite of wide variety of applications for gridded weather generators there is far less literature available on these generators than on single site ones for the multi site generation of daily precipitation data the majority of available literature is based on the approach described by wilks 1998 2009 which in turn is based on the general parametric technique introduced by richardson 1981 the gridded precipitation generator described in this study is similar to the multi site daily model introduced by wilks 2009 however unlike the approach described by wilks in which generator parameters derived at observation locations were interpolated onto a matrix of grid points we used gridded reanalysis data to directly estimate model parameters at each grid point the temperature model introduced in this study on the other hand combines the multi site daily maximum and minimum temperature generator described by wilks 2008 with the single site hourly temperature generator outlined by hansen and driscoll 1977 the resulting model is the first gridded hourly temperature generator in which the generation of temperature at a given grid point is conditioned on the state of precipitation occurrence at the same grid point when conditioning the temperature data on precipitation time series it is necessary to identify the state of precipitation for contemporaneous observed temperature time series on each hourly time step and for each grid point this should be done prior to estimating the fourier coefficients given by eqs 29 and 30 this is not an straightforward task as capa precipitation data is reported in daily accumulations while gem temperature data are recorded in hourly time steps it was possible to disaggregate daily precipitation amounts through temporal downscaling procedures sharif et al 2007 to distinguish between wet and dry hours on each day or to design an hourly precipitation generator however it was assumed that hourly variations in temperatures between wet and dry hours was negligible and a simplified approach was used for a particular grid point and a particular day all hourly temperatures on a given day were flagged as wet if that day was reported as wet in the observed capa record and vice versa this simplification however quite by chance caused a particular hour on a specific day to be either flagged as wet or dry over the entire observed record of gem data creating instability in the computations to prevent this hurdle mean daily temperature data were first smoothed by a 3 day moving average window smoothed daily mean data were then used to estimate the coefficients of the fourier function the efficiency of the generators should be investigated in terms of the computational budget required for creating the synthesized fields as well as the generators performance in terms of capturing the observed statistics the two most crucial steps to re create the spatial structure of observed precipitation fields was to solve ρ ω ρ and γ ζ γ for ω and ζ respectively for large domains with thousands of grid points such as the case of the study basin where there were as many as 8772 capa grid points in and around the crb these two steps would become computationally expensive the total number of cross correlations to explain the spatial dependencies among all pairs of capa grid points is approximately 40 million n n 1 2 for each month defining this number of dependencies would be computationally expensive and could cause data storage problems on both hard disk and ram while making computations of random variables intensive therefore it would not have been efficient computationally to follow wilks 1998 approach and apply empirically derived curves for each pair of stations in order to associate the required correlation of random numbers to the observed correlation of occurrences there have been efforts to solve this seemingly simple yet computationally demanding problem khalili et al 2004 tried to make this procedure more efficient by using regional curves instead of all possible station pairs although some improvements were achieved their approach continues to inherit some of the efficiency drawbacks of the wilks approach brissette et al 2007 in this study we came up with a simple and robust alternative solution by drawing ω values for given values of transition probabilities and observed correlation coefficient of precipitation occurrence for pairs of grid points from a pre populated multi dimensional matrix produced at the beginning of the simulation the runtime of the generation algorithm was also significantly reduced in this work by summarizing the spatial information throughout the gridded network given the spatial resolution of the capa reanalysis products used in this study which was around 10 km the change in spatial correlation over short distances in the order of 1 km was small enough to justify summarizing the correlation data moreover as many as 50 000 cross correlations could be defined over such short spans therefore all distances were rounded to the nearest integer value in km and then the associated correlations over the span of 0 5 km surrounding the grid point were averaged in addition to further simplify the computations it was reasonable to choose a subset of grid points extracted from the full network rather than performing the computations over the entire network of grid points the density of the network in both latitude and longitude was reduced by some factor for instance a subnetwork extracted by a factor of 3 in both coordinates resulted in a total of 989 grid points 1 grid point per 900 km2 subsequently the number of cross correlations were reduced from 40 million to less than 0 5 million the performance of the weather generators was analyzed and confirmed this assessment was necessary to ensure that the synthesized precipitation and temperature fields retained the statistical characteristics of the gridded observations the evaluation of the precipitation fields focused on both the occurrence and amount processes generated and observed daily precipitation fields were compared with each other in terms of correlation patterns wet and dry spells moments of the precipitation distributions interannual variability and extreme value characteristics the assessments proved that the precipitation model preserved several key statistical properties of the gridded capa rdpa observations to an acceptable level however a few discrepancies were also detected the most significant shortfalls included the ability of the model to capture long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation while both of these shortcomings are in line with the findings of other studies see e g buishand 1978 guttorp 1995 jones and thornton 1997 racsko et al 1991 wilks 1999 wilks and wilby 1999 neither of them were found to be critical temperature fields were evaluated by comparing generated and observed hourly temperatures in terms of correlation patterns diurnal variation interannual variability extreme value characteristics and a frequency analysis of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds similar to the precipitation model it was revealed that the proposed temperature generator is robust yet simple the assessment showed that several key features are well preserved and only a few discrepancies were detected the most significant defect identified is the departure of the interannual variability of the generated maximum and minimum temperatures from those observed several statistical properties of the temperature data which are crucial for hydrological simulation were preserved to a satisfactory level the most important of these well preserved attributes are the first two moments of the hourly data and the cumulative frequency of the maximum and minimum temperature thresholds if the empirical distribution of temperature data used as input in a hydrologic model does not reflect the true atmospheric conditions over the basin various hydrological processes will be poorly modeled for instance evapotranspiration which is found to have a relationship with precipitation in the crb is a dominant watershed process governed by the air temperature in the basin in general it can be concluded that the proposed precipitation and temperature models generated weather fields that can be considered good representations of observed data
