2350,the inverse parameter s estimation of unsaturated seepage models is important to ensure the safety of earth dams while most existing studies determine the hydraulic characteristics only based on seepage pressure monitoring data which may lead to inversion results deviating from the intrinsic properties of dam materials this study proposed an advanced methodology for unsaturated seepage parameter inversion of earth dams driven by multi source data the transient unsaturated seepage behavior of earth dams is simulated using the van genuchten vg model and the extreme learning machine elm is adopted as the surrogate model to estimate the approximate simulation results then the multi objective function for parameter inversion is constructed by combining the observed transient pressure data and elm models and the pareto optimal solutions are generated using the elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii multi source information including parameter design values in situ testing results and monitoring data are fused to construct a comprehensive index to drive the parameter decision the proposed method is applied to the pb core rockfill dam which has a well established seepage pressure monitoring system in addition the design values and in situ testing results of the hydraulic conductivity of the dam material are also available the results showed that the inversion parameters of the proposed method are closer to the physical characteristics of materials and have advantages in prediction accuracy keywords unsaturated seepage parameter inversion multi source data multi objective optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction core rockfill dam is one of the most widely constructed dam types worldwide which has the advantage of favorable adaptability to geological conditions direct utilization of local materials and low construction cost china possesses the largest number of core rockfill dams with dam hight over 100 m e g shiziping 136 m pubugou 186 m changheba 242 5 m and nuozhadu 261 5 m wu et al 2013 to accumulate hydropower a very large hydrostatic pressure difference is generated between the upstream and downstream of these dams the impermeability of the core which is generally composed of clay loperte et al 2015 is directly related to dam safety sjödahl et al 2009 the seepage failure of high core rockfill dams will lead to serious disaster and the accurate prediction of the saturated unsaturated seepage behavior is particularly important to ensure the safe operation of the dam zhang et al 2022 in the unsaturated seepage analysis the parameters are typically determined through laboratory testing or engineering analogy amnyattalab and rezaie 2017 ma et al 2020 xu et al 2022 which may not accurately reflect the actual service performance of the dam due to effect of size construction quality and operation environment dafny et al 2015 mouyeaux et al 2019 luo et al 2020 rezaei et al 2021 the inversion analysis has become an effective method to determine the seepage parameters of the dam and foundation huisman et al 2010 chi et al 2015 ren et al 2016 chen et al 2020 yu et al 2022a the purpose of model calibration is to minimize the objective function which reflects the error between the simulation results and the observed seepage pressure vasco and karasaki 2001 existing studies have yielded appreciable achievements in this area but there are still some critical issues that need to be addressed first most of the existing research generally focuses on the single objective optimization problem that is the joint inversion analysis involving multi point monitoring data is transformed into the optimization of a single objective function by assigning the weight coefficient while the selection of inappropriate weights may lead to biased inversion results sun et al 2018 in addition the information source of the traditional parameter inversion method only includes seepage monitoring data the calibration of parameters relies on the objective function and the surrogate model while the physical significance of the parameters is ignored which may lead to inversion results that deviate from the intrinsic properties of the material li et al 2022 given the shortcomings of the traditional single objective inversion multi objective optimization is considered more applicable and superior in inversion analysis wen et al 2017 sun et al 2018 schnaidt et al 2018 fang et al 2019 which treats each monitoring sequence as a separate objective avoiding forced weighting the multi objective optimization can provide various sets of non dominated parameters called pareto optimal solutions instead of a single optimal solution of traditional methods each individual in the pareto solutions i e a combination of parameters is considered acceptable and a high level decision is required to determine the final inversion results the existing researches generally follow two kinds of approach for high level decision one is based on engineering experience and personal preference zhang et al 2018 and the other is based on the fitting accuracy of multi point wen et al 2017 sun et al 2018 the former is too subjective and not suitable for parameter inversion analysis while the latter also faces the problem of only considering monitoring data which is equivalent to single objective inversion when the fitting accuracy is evaluated in the same way in addition to the monitoring data other information such as parameter design values and in situ test results can also help researchers improve their cognition of parameters which inspired us to develop a multi source data driven decision criterion for multi objective inversion in this paper an advanced multi source data driven parameter inversion methodology is proposed and its engineering application in unsaturated seepage analysis of core rockfill dams is studied the in situ monitoring data are divided into the fitted data set and the predicted data set and the former was used to construct the parametric inverse multi objective function the elm is used as a surrogate model to replace the time consuming finite element simulation that is the input layer is unsaturated seepage parameters and the output layer is seepage pressure calculation results the multi objective function is constructed to reflect the error between the in situ multi point monitoring data and approximate simulation results estimated by elm and the nsga ii algorithm deb et al 2002 is applied to generate the pareto optimal solutions this algorithm circumvents the issues that may arise from unreasonable weight settings and can provide multiple compromise solutions non dominated solutions that allow researchers to make decisions from a higher level based on muti source data related to the material properties including the parameter design values the in situ testing results and the observation seepage pressure sequences a quantitative composite evaluation index is constructed to compare each combination of parameters in the pareto optimal solutions to decide the final inversion results the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 an advanced architecture for unsaturated seepage parameter inversion for core rockfill dams is provided 2 a novel multi source data driven parameter decision method for multi objective optimization is proposed the method proposed in this paper may inspire other inversion and optimization problems in engineering 2 methodology 2 1 saturated unsaturated seepage simulation method the unsaturated seepage model is the basis for simulating the seepage behavior of earth dams compared with saturated soil the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil is not constant which is related to the matric suction and water content the differential equation governing the transient seepage flow in a three dimensional domain can be derived using darcy s law lu and likos 2004 1 x k x θ h m x y k y θ h m y z k z θ h m x 1 c θ h m t where hm is the matric suction head θ is the volumetric water content kx θ ky θ and kz θ are unsaturated hydraulic conductivities in different directions respectively c θ is the slope of the soil water characteristic curve swcc a dimensionless variable se is defined to represent the unsaturated state of soils named effective saturation 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θs and θr represent the volumetric water content at saturation and the residual volumetric water content of the soil respectively when se 1 the soil is assumed to be saturated and the permeability is constant while the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated soil should be determined by swcc and hydraulic conductivity function several unsaturated seepage models have been proposed to predict the unsaturated behavior of soils and the van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 is one of the most commonly used unsaturated seepage models in geotechnical engineering amnyattalab and rezaie 2017 stark et al 2017 tan et al 2017 nan et al 2022 yu et al 2022b the swcc represents the relationship between effective saturation and matrix suction van genuchten proposed a closed form mathematical model which can be expressed as follows 3 s e 1 1 a w ψ n w m w where aw nw and m are fitting parameters of the vg model aw is related to the inverse of the air entry suction nw is a measure of the pore size distribution and mw 1 1 nw the hydraulic conductivity function gives the relationship between matric suction or effective saturation and the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils and the corresponding hydraulic conductivity functions of the vg model are defined by the following expressions 4 k ψ k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m w m w 2 where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity 2 2 multi objective optimization for parameter inversion analysis 2 2 1 multi objective function of parameter inversion to investigate the seepage behavior of core rockfill dams several seepage pressure measuring points are usually arranged in the core of the dam and some measuring points are located in the saturated area while others are located in the unsaturated area luo et al 2019 the purpose of parameter inversion is to make the numerical simulation results as consistent as possible with the measured values at each point the parameter inversion issues can be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem in feasible parameter space and the objective function can be expressed as 5 f x min f 1 x t 1 t δ 1 x t δ 1 t δ 1 t 2 min f n x t 1 t δ n x t δ n t δ n t 2 min f n x t 1 t δ n x t δ n t δ n t 2 6 x x 1 x 2 x m x m x m min x m x m max where f x is the multi objective functions x ℝ m is a combination of unknown parameters with m being the number of parameters n is the number of seepage pressure measuring points t is the number of time points chosen for inversion δn x t and δ n t are the calculated seepage pressure and measured seepage pressure of measuring point n at t time respectively xm min and xm max are value boundaries of parameter xm 2 2 2 construction of the surrogate model using elm the finite element simulation of transient unsaturated seepage flow of earth dams is very time consuming it is unrealistic to directly embed the finite element simulation into the multi objective optimization process and surrogate based optimization is an effective and widely used approach to solve this problem the surrogate model is a general term for simple analytical models that mimic the input output behavior of complex systems several surrogate models have been developed and successfully applied in optimization or uncertainty analysis such as the response surface model rsm li et al 2022 multiple response surface model mrsm jiang and huang 2016 support vector machine svm fei et al 2022 artificial neural networks ann maiti et al 2012 and kriging model yu et al 2022a et al in this study the extreme learning machine elm is utilized as the surrogate model to establish the mapping relationship between unsaturated seepage parameters and seepage pressure at dam measuring points the elm is one of the improved anns which shows excellent performance in learning efficiency and generalization ability majumder and lu 2021 to estimate the simulated seepage pressure δn x t a single output elm model can be established as follows 7 δ n x t e x w n t γ n t h 1 h γ h n t ϕ ω h n t x where e x w n t γ n t is the elm model to estimate the value of δn x t h is the number of hidden neurons ϕ is the activation function which is a sigmoid function such that the output of a neuron is between 0 and 1 w n t ωn t 1 ωn t 2 ωn t h is the matrix of hidden layer weights γ n t γn t 1 γn t 2 γn t h is the vector of output weights the design sites of the training dataset are generated by the orthogonal design which is an effective statistics method to arrange multifactorial experiments karunanayaka and tang 2018 and is widely used in constructing surrogate models chen et al 2020 then the forward simulations are performed based on the parameter design sites combining the parameter design sites and the corresponding simulation results as the training dataset of elm models then the efficient and reasonable estimation of the simulation results can be achieved the main concern of researchers for neural network based surrogate models is the accuracy and generalization ability in this study the constructed surrogate model is embedded into the nags ii algorithm for the estimation of simulation results in the multi objective optimization process the initial population is obtained by random sampling from the parameter space so the same approach is used to generate the validation datasets the performance of the elm model is evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 li et al 2021 given by 8 r 2 1 i 1 p δ i δ i 2 i 1 p δ i δ 2 where p is the number of samples in the training or validation datasets δ i and δ i are the estimated and observed seepage pressure respectively δ is the mean value of δ i r2 0 1 and the larger the r2 the higher the prediction accuracy of the elm model in this study the metric to accept the surrogate model is defined as r2 greater than 0 95 for both the training and validation datasets 2 2 3 multi objective optimization using nsga ii the traditional single objective genetic algorithm calculates the fitness value of individuals through a single objective function evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of individuals and finally obtains a single optimal solution however each objective function can get a fitness value in the multi objective optimization problem the objective functions restrict each other because they have the same random variables and it is difficult to achieve the optimization for all of the objective functions at the same time the non dominated sorting based genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is an advanced multi objective optimization algorithm developed by deb et al 2002 similar to the classical intelligent algorithms the nsga ii algorithm uses an iterative update of the population to implement parameter optimization and borrows the cross variance process from the traditional genetic algorithm in the population update based on which the non dominated sorting approach and crowding distance operator are introduced to generate the pareto optimal solutions kao and jacobson 2007 singh et al 2014 for the minimization problem if for any objective function fi x there exists fi xa fi xb and at least under a certain objective function fi xa fi xb i e the solution xa is always better than the solution xb then xb is dominated by xa denoted as xa xb and its mathematical expression is shown in eq conversely if there is a solution that cannot be dominated by any other solution that is there is no other individual that is superior to the solution in all objective functions it is called a non dominated solution 9 x a x b i f i 1 2 n f i x a f i x b j 1 2 n f j x a f j x b the non dominated sorting method is used in the nsga ii algorithm to divide all individuals in the population into different front layers by comparing the non dominated relationship between individuals all non dominated solutions are classified into a set which is called front 1 denoted as ℱ1 and the remaining individuals in the population are sorted again and the new non dominated solution set is front 2 denote it as ℱ2 repeat the above process until the entire population is divided into several fronts ℱ ℱ1 ℱ2 fig 1 is a schematic diagram of the pareto fronts in a bi objective optimization problem to ensure that individuals at the same front are uniformly distributed in the solution space and to avoid the issue of local optimum the crowding distance operator is introduced to evaluate the local aggregation of solutions which can be expressed as follows for the k dimensional multi objective optimization problem 10 c j i 1 k f i x j 1 f i x j 1 f i max f i min where cj is the crowding distance of xj fi xj 1 and fi xj 1 are the i th objective function values of solutions xj 1 and xj 1 f max iand fmin i are the extremums of the i th objective function in the current front fig 1 also shows the crowding distance in a bi objective optimization problem the nsga ii algorithm roughly includes the following steps initially a population xg of size p is randomly generated and the offspring population q g is generated through crossover and mutation the two populations xg and q g are merged to form a new population rg of size 2p next each individual in rg is sorted by the non dominated sorting method and divided into different fronts after sorting the local crowding distance is calculated to select individuals of size p from population rg to form a new parent population xg 1 the above process is repeated until the maximum number of iterations gmax is reached and the final pareto optimal solutions are generated the detailed procedure of nsga ii is shown in table 1 the nsga ii has been widely utilized in inversion and optimization problems deb and dhar 2011 deb and dhar 2013 sun et al 2018 hamzehkolaei et al 2018 in this study the nsga ii algorithm is applied to optimize the multi objective functions of unsaturated seepage inversion and obtain the pareto optimal solutions of the parameters the solution process is realized by the open source matlab platform for evolutionary multi objective optimization platemo tian et al 2017 2 3 multi source data driven parameter decision as mentioned above there is no absolute optimal solution in the pareto optimal solutions the purpose of parameter inversion is to obtain a set of specific parameters which requires researchers to make a higher level decision sun et al 2018 in the existing research the prediction accuracy is generally taken as the index of parameter decision wen et al 2017 sun et al 2018 which can be expressed as 11 x s arg min n 1 n f n x arg min n 1 n t 1 t δ n x t δ n t δ n t 2 where x s is the selected optimal parameter combination the surrogate model was adopted in the study of wen et al 2017 to calculate δn x t in the decision process and this approach is recorded as method a while sun et al 2018 calculated δn x t via numerical simulation directly which is recorded as method b in this paper in fact for the multi objective parameter inversion analysis the discrimination degree of the prediction errors of different parameters in the pareto solutions may be very slight and it is insufficient that select the optimal solution only based on this single index the final inversion results may deviate from the intrinsic characteristics of materials which is not conducive to predicting the future operation behavior of dams it is particularly necessary to consider all the information related to parameters in the high level decision in this study the following four information sources are considered 1 the fitting effect 2 the design values of parameters 3 the in situ test results of parameters 4 the over fitting coefficient the indexes corresponding to the above information sources are named index i index ii index iii and index iv respectively then a comprehensive index integrating the above four indexes is constructed for the final parameter decision 2 3 1 index i the fitting effect the primary purpose of parameter inversion is to ensure the accuracy of numerical simulation the pareto optimal solutions are distributed in an n dimensional euclidean space with the objective function value as the coordinate axis the position of each non dominated solution represents its fitting effect for different seepage pressure monitoring points and its euclidean metric with the origin of spatial coordinates i e all objective functions are 0 reflects the comprehensive prediction effect of this parameter combination the formula can be expressed as follows 12 e x n 1 n f n x 2 where e x is the value of index i and the parameter combination with the smaller e x provides higher fitting accuracy 2 3 2 index ii the design values of parameters in the design stage of dams the design values or interval of hydraulic conductivities of dam materials can be obtained by permeability test or engineering analogy the design values not only reflect the researchers prior cognition of parameters but also include the approximate relationship between hydraulic conductivities among different materials under the condition that the multi objective function values have little difference the closer to the parameter design values the higher the reliability of the solution in this study the membership function a x is used to express the deviation degree between the inversion results and the design values membership functions have various forms including triangle distribution ridge distribution polynomial distribution and gaussian distribution et al de luca di roseto et al 2018 in this paper the triangular distribution form is selected and its expression is as follows 13 a x 0 x x min x x min x d x min x min x x d 1 x x d x max x x max x d x d x x max 0 x x max where x max and x min are the value interval of parameters and xd is the design value of parameters the hydraulic conductivity value interval of each material of the core rockfill dam is taken as the upper and lower limits of the membership function the membership corresponding to the design values is 1 and the factor based on the parameter design values can be expressed as 14 m f x i 1 m a a i x i where ma is the number of parameters that have design values ai is the membership function of the parameter xi 2 3 3 index iii the in situ test results of parameters after the dam is constructed and operated due to the size effect construction quality and the migration and reorganization of soil particles under seepage the real hydraulic conductivity will be different from the design values dafny et al 2015 mouyeaux et al 2019 luo et al 2020 rezaei et al 2021 in the process of dam operation the actual impermeability of soil can be obtained by the in situ test which can be intrusive or non intrusive sjödahl et al 2009 hu et al 2013 soueid ahmed et al 2020 the in situ test is of great significance to improve the accuracy of parameters decision and the parameters of artificial soil generally follow a certain distribution which can be fitted when the amount of in situ test data is sufficient the index iii can be calculated by multiplying the probability density function of all parameters 15 i x j 1 m p p d f x j where ma is the number of parameters that have in situ test results pdf is the probability density function of the parameter xj 2 3 4 indexes iv over fitting coefficient in parameter inversion analysis the monitoring sequence over a period of time will be selected to construct the elm models and multi objective functions which can be referred to as the fitting dataset through the parameter inversion results the future operation behavior of the dam can be predicted and compared with the in situ monitoring data of the dam the new monitoring sequence is called the prediction dataset the inversion problem can be described as using fitting data set to calibrate parameters and the predicted dataset is the basis to test the inversion effect the operation process of dams is complex and the future operating environment is unpredictable the parameter inversion results obtained according to the existing information may have the problem of over fitting that is the numerical simulation only has high accuracy for the fitting data set and the fitting effect for the predicted data set is not ideal in this study based on the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the mean absolute percentage error mape of the fitted data set and the predicted data set the over fitting coefficient oc is defined and the expression is as follows yin and wu 2022 16 o c x 1 3 rms e p rms e f ma e p ma e f map e p map e f where 17 rmse n 1 n t 1 u δ n x t δ n t 2 u 18 mae n 1 n 1 u t 1 u δ n x t δ n t 19 mape n 1 n 100 u t 1 u δ n x t δ n t δ n t where the subscript f represents the fitting data set and p represents the prediction data set u is the number of measured data in the fitting data set or prediction data set of all measuring points δn x t and δn t are the calculated and measured values of the seepage pressure respectively the smaller the oc the better the prediction effect of dam operation behavior indicating that the fitness of parameters is higher 2 3 5 the comprehensive index integrating the above four indexes a comprehensive index q x for parameter decision is defined as shown in eq 20 and 21 the parameter combination x with the smallest q x is selected as the final inversion result 20 q x e x o c x m f x i x 1 3 n 1 n f n x 2 i 1 m a a i x i j 1 m p p d f x j rms e p rms e f ma e p ma e f map e p map e f 21 x s arg min q x it needs to be declared that the most important contribution of this paper is the idea of constructing the comprehensive index to drive the parameter decision for the dam with incomplete information sources the comprehensive index can be reconstructed by removing the corresponding independent indexes what s more for projects with more available information the comprehensive index can be improved to suit new issues by borrowing the ideas from this paper 2 4 implementation procedure of the proposed method a parameter inversion method of unsaturated seepage for core rockfill dams is proposed in which the transient unsaturated seepage simulation multi objective optimization algorithm and multi source data driven parameter decision are integrated the flow chart of the proposed method is shown in fig 2 and the procedure can be described as follows step 1 training of elm models the finite element model of the dam and foundation is constructed and the boundary conditions are imposed according to the analysis period and reservoir water level sequence for a certain unsaturated seepage model several representative combinations of parameters are generated by orthogonal design and the elm models of monitoring points at different inversion times are trained by corresponding forward finite element simulation results step 2 generation of pareto optimal solutions combining the elm models e x w n t γ n t and the seepage pressure monitoring data δn t the multi objective function is constructed according to eq the nsga ii algorithm is adopted for multi objective optimization and the pareto optimal solutions set is generated step 3 multi source data driven parameter decision for each parameter combination in the pareto optimal solutions the index i iv are calculated according to the corresponding information sources using eq 12 16 then the comprehensive index can be computed by eq 20 the parameter combination with the smallest comprehensive index is selected as the final inversion results 3 case study 3 1 introduction of the pb core rockfill dam the pb core rockfill dam is located in dadu river sichuan province china fig 3 the maximum dam height is 186 m and the elevation of the dam crest is 856 00 m the normal water level and the dead water level are 850 00 m and 790 00 m respectively the main anti seepage structure of the dam body is a gravelly soil core with filter layers on both sides and a transition layer is arranged between the filter layer and the rockfill the pb dam is built on a deep overburden and two concrete anti seepage walls with a thickness of 1 2 m are set at the dam foundation the auxiliary anti seepage wall located on the upstream side is inserted into the core for 10 m and the main anti seepage wall is located on the downstream side with a 50 m deep anti seepage curtain at the bottom the dam anti seepage system consists of the gravelly soil core anti seepage wall and anti seepage curtain the highest cross section of the pb dam is shown in fig 4 to investigate the seepage behavior of the dam several seepage pressure measuring points are installed in the core during the operation of the dam there are five measuring points under normal monitoring in the section shown in fig 4 namely p15 p16 p19 p20 and p83 the core is divided into the saturated area and unsaturated area with dead water level as the boundary p83 with an elevation of 818 m is located in the unsaturated area and other measuring points are located in the saturated area the unit of seepage pressure observed by the monitoring instrument is pa which is converted to total hydraulic head according to eq and compared with the reservoir water level as shown in fig 5 it should be stated that the same conversion is used for the simulated values 22 δ p ρ g h where p is the observed or simulated seepage pressure pa ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water g 9 8 n kg h is the elevation of the measurement point the pb hydropower station is an annual regulating reservoir and the water level of the reservoir changes periodically every year at the beginning of the dam operation the seepage pressure at each measurement point is relatively high which can be attributed to the influence of excess pore water pressure chen et al 2008 as soil consolidation caused by external loads develops excess pore water pressure gradually decreases deng et al 2019 in addition the hydraulic head of p83 which is located in the unsaturated area is significantly high and the difference with the water level is less than 15 m indicating that there might be a weak area of seepage resistance in the unsaturated area hu et al 2013 excessive seepage pressure may lead to internal seepage erosion and even dam failure therefore investigating the seepage resistance of the dam e g hydraulic conductivity is essential to guarantee the safety operation of the pb dam during the design phase of the dam extensive in situ testing tests were conducted in the dam site area to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the overburden and bedrock the hydraulic conductivity of the core and rockfill area are determined based on laboratory seepage tests the design values and range of hydraulic conductivity are listed in table 2 after the anomalous high seepage pressure in the unsaturated zone is observed an in situ drilling testing was conducted on august 9 2010 to test the hydraulic conductivity of the core the test results are shown in fig 6 and the original data can refer to hu et al 2013 the kolmogorov smirnov ks test proves that the in situ test data follow a lognormal distribution i e lnk 1 n 11 44 1 13 the histogram of the in situ test data and the fitting results of the lognormal distribution are also shown in fig 6 the main objective of this case study is to determine the unsaturated seepage model and parameters of the pb dam based on the observed seepage pressure monitoring data parameter design information and in situ testing results the monitoring data of 2014 with relatively stable water level rise and fall is selected as the inversion analysis period at which time the excess pore water pressure in the core had dissipated basically take january 1 to june 31 as the fitting period july 1 to december 31 as the prediction period and three days per month are selected as control points to generate the corresponding fitting data set and prediction data set i e each data set has 18 control points fig 7 shows the water level sequence of the pb dam in 2014 and the location of the control points 3 2 inversion of the saturated unsaturated seepage parameters 3 2 1 finite element model and undetermined parameters a finite element model of the highest cross section of the pb dam was created for seepage simulation with the following simulation domain in the upstream and downstream directions as well as in the depth direction the model extends twice the height of the dam i e 372 m the zoning of the dam body in the model is consistent with the actual project including the upstream and downstream rockfill transition layer filter layer gravelly soil core and waste slag the dam foundation is divided into four layers from top to bottom overburden i overburden ii slightly weathered rock and fresh bedrock in addition the anti seepage walls and curtain which are located at the dam foundation are also considered the discretized model of the dam foundation system contains 23 492 nodes and 11 555 elements the seepage pressure monitoring points are arranged at the corresponding nodes as shown in fig 8 commercial software abaqus is adopted for transient unsaturated seepage simulation with an analysis duration of 365 days i e from january 1 to december 31 2014 for the transient analysis issue the boundary conditions of the model are also variable specifically the upstream water pressure boundary is consistent with the measured water level see fig 5 which is defined using the amplitude function while the elevation of the tailwater is more stable and maintained at 672 m the downstream slope and surface below this elevation are set as the water pressure boundary and the slope above is set as the drainage only flow boundary the execution time of this transient unsaturated seepage simulation on a desktop computer i7 8700 3 2 ghz ram 16 gb ranged from 60 to 70 min and increasing the performance of the hardware did not significantly improve the computational efficiency indicating that the construction of surrogate models is necessary since the seepage parameters of the pb dam have high dimensions it is necessary to select the parameters which have a great impact on dam seepage as undetermined parameters the variance based global sensitivity analysis is performed refer to saltelli and marivoet 1990 and the selected undetermined parameters include the parameters of the vg model of the unsaturated area in the core i e k 1 aw nw the hydraulic conductivity k 2 of the saturated area in the core and the hydraulic conductivity k 3 of the slightly weathered rock while the insensitive parameters adopt the design values in table 2 3 2 2 optimization of multi objective functions as mentioned above 5 parameters of the vg model need to be calibrated according to the value range of inversion parameters see table 1 three levels of parameter values are determined as listed in table 3 from that an orthogonal experiment table l41 35 is constructed which generates 41 sets of parameter combinations the purpose of the orthogonal design is to investigate the response relationships across the parameter space with fewer representative design points which are uniformly distributed in the parameter space the generated parameter combinations are adopted for the seepage simulation to guarantee the accuracy of the surrogate model all 41 design sites and the corresponding seepage simulation results are adopted as training datasets for the elm in addition 20 sets of parameter combinations are generated by random sampling to construct the validation dataset in this study there are 5 measurement points with simulated seepage pressure at 36 moments to be estimated a total of 180 elm models need to be constructed for each model the r2 of the training dataset r2 training dataset validation dataset r2 validation dataset and the combination of them r2 total are calculated respectively the performance of elm based surrogate models is shown in fig 9 given a large number of surrogate models as a representative the comparison of the simulation and estimation seepage pressure for the p83 on january 10 2014 is shown see fig 9 a while fig 9 b presents the r2 total of all elm models which are all greater than 0 95 indicating the accuracy and reliability of the constructed surrogate models as mentioned previously in section 3 1 the observed seepage pressure unsaturated zone is higher in view of the different seepage characteristics in the saturated and unsaturated zones a bi objective function is constructed for parameter inversion in which the objective function f 1 contains the sum of the squared errors sse of the simulated seepage pressure of p83 in the unsaturated zone while the objective function f 2 reflects the sse for the measurement points in the saturated zone p15 p16 p19 and p20 given by 23 f x min f 1 x t 1 18 δ p 83 x t δ p 83 t δ p 83 t 2 min f 2 x i p 15 p16 p19 p20 t 1 18 δ i x t δ i t δ i t 2 the nsga ii algorithm is combined with elm based surrogate models to search for the pareto optimal solution of the established multi objective function the settings of the algorithm are as follows the population size p 100 and the maximum number of iterations gmax 10000 the optimization is implemented in matlab and the output pareto optimal solutions are named po which is a set containing 100 parameter combinations the pareto front in the two dimensional objective function space is shown in fig 10 it can be found that the range of f 1 is from 1 10 4 to 3 5 10 4 while the range of f 2 is from 2 25 10 4 to 3 75 10 4 which is a smaller interval and the objective function values for a large number of parameter combinations are relatively close fig 11 shows the distribution of parameter combinations and corresponding objective function values while their statistical characteristics i e mean μ standard deviation σ and coefficients of variation c v are listed in table 4 the results show that although the dispersion of the different parameter combinations is large the differences of their objective function values are not significant two reasons might lead to this situation firstly the seepage pressure at different measurement points is not only related to the material properties of the area in which they are located but also influenced by the overall seepage resistance of the dam thus different parameter combinations may result in similar observed seepage pressure secondly the information contained in the observed seepage pressure is very limited as the available data is provided by only five measurement points which hardly reflects the overall seepage field of the dam while the dimensionality of the calibrated parameters is high which causes the parameter inversion to be an ill posed problem i e it does not have a unique global optimal solution juang et al 2018 huang 2020 in summary the uncertainty in the inversion results is difficult to reduce when the available information includes only the observed seepage pressure and it is necessary to implement parameter decisions using multi source data 3 2 3 results of parameter decision the parameter decision is driven by the muti source information through the comprehensive index proposed above the index i is calculated from the values of the objective functions at five measuring points it should be noted that since there are 100 parameter combinations the calculated seepage pressure δn x i t is obtained through elm models the design values and range of hydraulic conductivity are listed in table 2 since there are no design values for vg model parameters aw and nw the index ii can be calculated by the product of the membership function of k 1 k 2 and k 3 mf x i a 1 k 1 i a 2 k 2 i a 3 k 3 i based on the in situ detection results shown in fig 6 the index iii can be calculated by the probability distribution function of hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated area 24 i x i p d f k 1 i 1 1 13 2 π exp ln k 1 i 11 44 2 2 54 k 1 i 0 0 k 1 i 0 the multi objective optimization of parameter inversion is based on the fitting data set while the prediction data set is to verify the prediction effect of the parameter inversion results as mentioned above the over fitting phenomenon in the inversion analysis should be considered in the parameter decision and the index iv can be calculated by eq the indexes for each parameter combination in pareto optimal solutions are calculated respectively and the comprehensive index q x i is obtained according to eq the parameter combination with the smallest q x i is selected as the final parameter inversion result which is listed in table 5 this table also lists the parameter decision results based on method a method b and all of the single indexes except index iii which is not suitable to be applied for the parameter decision of the pb dam as an independent index due to the limitation of the in situ test results it should be noted that index i and method a provide the same decision results which is attributed to their consistent basic ideas of parameter decision the position of the solutions decided by different methods on the pareto front is shown in fig 10 and the rationality and accuracy of these solutions will be compared and discussed later 3 2 4 comparison of different parameter decision methods the monitoring data shows that the seepage pressure above el788m in the core is high indicating that the hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated area may be relatively large the in situ test results also confirm this view as the average hydraulic conductivity of this area is 1 69 10 5cm s hu et al 2013 which is higher than the design value of 4 30 10 6 fig 12 is a scatter plot of that the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated and unsaturated area in the core under different parameter decision indexes this figure also identifies the position of the parameter point when k 1 is the in situ test mean value and k 2 is the design value it can be seen that the parameter inversion results selected by the comprehensive index are closest to the in situ test results and design values except for index i and method a other results even show that the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated area is greater than that in the unsaturated area which is inconsistent with engineering practice the purpose of parameter decision is to select the most reliable inversion result from the pareto optimal solutions by considering various indexes it will be very easy to select the best solution with the condition that the discrimination degree of each solution is very high on the contrary misjudgment may occur if the discrimination degree is not obvious in this study according to different decision indexes the advantage index g x is defined for comparing the discrimination degree of the alternative parameter combinations which can be written as 25 g x min index x index x where min index x is the minimum index value of all alternative parameter combinations under a certain decision method the discrimination degree of the pareto optimal solutions based on different decision methods is compared in fig 13 it can be seen that the advantage curve of the proposed method drops the fastest and the discrimination degree of each solution is greater than that of other methods which shows that the decision of inversion results is the most credible and acceptable through the comprehensive index considering multi source information the index ii has also achieved good performance because the design value reflects the actual value and correlation of materials parameters to some extent and is one of the most important decision information for other indexes the discrimination degree of each solution is not obvious which is unfavorable for the parameter decision fig 14 shows the hydraulic heads of the monitoring points calculated by the forward numerical simulations it can be seen that all the calculated results are in general agreement with the measurements which is due to the fact that all the parameter combinations are chosen from the pareto optimal solutions to further demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method three prediction performance indicators root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape are adopted to evaluate the simulation error of different parameter decision results the calculation formula is the same as eq 19 but includes the simulation error for each day in 2014 the results are listed in table 6 it can be seen that except for the rmse of p15 the accuracy of the parameter combinations selected using the comprehensive index proposed in this paper is the highest this can be attributed to the fact that for the fitted data set used for the parameter inversion period the simulation accuracy of individuals in the pareto optimal solutions is similar while the multi source data are considered in the proposed method and the decided parameter combination has better performance in the predicted dataset to sum up the comprehensive index fused with multi source information proposed in this paper is an effective method for parameter decision which can select the parameter combination that is most in line with engineering practice and has the highest accuracy from the pareto optimal solutions 4 conclusion in this paper an advanced multi source data driven parameter inversion methodology is proposed for the unsaturated seepage simulation of core rockfill dams the main innovation of this method is that the multi source data such as the observed seepage pressure the design value of the material parameter and in situ test results are fused to drive the decision of the pareto optimal solutions which can make the parameter inversion results more in line with the engineering practice and improve the prediction accuracy the proposed method is applied to the inversion of unsaturated seepage parameters of the pb dam which has a well established seepage pressure monitoring system the van genuchten model is adopted for numerical simulation and the multi objective function for parameter inversion is constructed based on the error of simulation results and observed seepage pressure the nsga ii algorithm is used to search for pareto optimal solutions the statistical analysis of the non dominated solutions shows that different parameter combinations may have closer accuracy indicating that the limited information may lead to uncertainty of the inversion results and it is necessary to perform parameter decision the process of the comprehensive index construction and the parameter decision is described in detail compared with the traditional parameter decision method the parameter inversion results using the proposed method are more consistent with the engineering practice and have higher simulation accuracy in the prediction period moreover through the comparison of the advantage index curve it can be seen that the discrimination degree of comprehensive indexes of different parameter combinations in the pareto optimal solutions is the most obvious which is beneficial to the credibility of the parameter decision the study of the real engineering example further verified the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method it can be predicted that the method proposed in this paper can be applied to other inversion issues such as the seepage or mechanical parameter inversion for slope tunnel and embankment et al the analysis of spatial variability characteristics of unsaturated seepage parameters driven by multi source information

2350,the inverse parameter s estimation of unsaturated seepage models is important to ensure the safety of earth dams while most existing studies determine the hydraulic characteristics only based on seepage pressure monitoring data which may lead to inversion results deviating from the intrinsic properties of dam materials this study proposed an advanced methodology for unsaturated seepage parameter inversion of earth dams driven by multi source data the transient unsaturated seepage behavior of earth dams is simulated using the van genuchten vg model and the extreme learning machine elm is adopted as the surrogate model to estimate the approximate simulation results then the multi objective function for parameter inversion is constructed by combining the observed transient pressure data and elm models and the pareto optimal solutions are generated using the elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii multi source information including parameter design values in situ testing results and monitoring data are fused to construct a comprehensive index to drive the parameter decision the proposed method is applied to the pb core rockfill dam which has a well established seepage pressure monitoring system in addition the design values and in situ testing results of the hydraulic conductivity of the dam material are also available the results showed that the inversion parameters of the proposed method are closer to the physical characteristics of materials and have advantages in prediction accuracy keywords unsaturated seepage parameter inversion multi source data multi objective optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction core rockfill dam is one of the most widely constructed dam types worldwide which has the advantage of favorable adaptability to geological conditions direct utilization of local materials and low construction cost china possesses the largest number of core rockfill dams with dam hight over 100 m e g shiziping 136 m pubugou 186 m changheba 242 5 m and nuozhadu 261 5 m wu et al 2013 to accumulate hydropower a very large hydrostatic pressure difference is generated between the upstream and downstream of these dams the impermeability of the core which is generally composed of clay loperte et al 2015 is directly related to dam safety sjödahl et al 2009 the seepage failure of high core rockfill dams will lead to serious disaster and the accurate prediction of the saturated unsaturated seepage behavior is particularly important to ensure the safe operation of the dam zhang et al 2022 in the unsaturated seepage analysis the parameters are typically determined through laboratory testing or engineering analogy amnyattalab and rezaie 2017 ma et al 2020 xu et al 2022 which may not accurately reflect the actual service performance of the dam due to effect of size construction quality and operation environment dafny et al 2015 mouyeaux et al 2019 luo et al 2020 rezaei et al 2021 the inversion analysis has become an effective method to determine the seepage parameters of the dam and foundation huisman et al 2010 chi et al 2015 ren et al 2016 chen et al 2020 yu et al 2022a the purpose of model calibration is to minimize the objective function which reflects the error between the simulation results and the observed seepage pressure vasco and karasaki 2001 existing studies have yielded appreciable achievements in this area but there are still some critical issues that need to be addressed first most of the existing research generally focuses on the single objective optimization problem that is the joint inversion analysis involving multi point monitoring data is transformed into the optimization of a single objective function by assigning the weight coefficient while the selection of inappropriate weights may lead to biased inversion results sun et al 2018 in addition the information source of the traditional parameter inversion method only includes seepage monitoring data the calibration of parameters relies on the objective function and the surrogate model while the physical significance of the parameters is ignored which may lead to inversion results that deviate from the intrinsic properties of the material li et al 2022 given the shortcomings of the traditional single objective inversion multi objective optimization is considered more applicable and superior in inversion analysis wen et al 2017 sun et al 2018 schnaidt et al 2018 fang et al 2019 which treats each monitoring sequence as a separate objective avoiding forced weighting the multi objective optimization can provide various sets of non dominated parameters called pareto optimal solutions instead of a single optimal solution of traditional methods each individual in the pareto solutions i e a combination of parameters is considered acceptable and a high level decision is required to determine the final inversion results the existing researches generally follow two kinds of approach for high level decision one is based on engineering experience and personal preference zhang et al 2018 and the other is based on the fitting accuracy of multi point wen et al 2017 sun et al 2018 the former is too subjective and not suitable for parameter inversion analysis while the latter also faces the problem of only considering monitoring data which is equivalent to single objective inversion when the fitting accuracy is evaluated in the same way in addition to the monitoring data other information such as parameter design values and in situ test results can also help researchers improve their cognition of parameters which inspired us to develop a multi source data driven decision criterion for multi objective inversion in this paper an advanced multi source data driven parameter inversion methodology is proposed and its engineering application in unsaturated seepage analysis of core rockfill dams is studied the in situ monitoring data are divided into the fitted data set and the predicted data set and the former was used to construct the parametric inverse multi objective function the elm is used as a surrogate model to replace the time consuming finite element simulation that is the input layer is unsaturated seepage parameters and the output layer is seepage pressure calculation results the multi objective function is constructed to reflect the error between the in situ multi point monitoring data and approximate simulation results estimated by elm and the nsga ii algorithm deb et al 2002 is applied to generate the pareto optimal solutions this algorithm circumvents the issues that may arise from unreasonable weight settings and can provide multiple compromise solutions non dominated solutions that allow researchers to make decisions from a higher level based on muti source data related to the material properties including the parameter design values the in situ testing results and the observation seepage pressure sequences a quantitative composite evaluation index is constructed to compare each combination of parameters in the pareto optimal solutions to decide the final inversion results the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 an advanced architecture for unsaturated seepage parameter inversion for core rockfill dams is provided 2 a novel multi source data driven parameter decision method for multi objective optimization is proposed the method proposed in this paper may inspire other inversion and optimization problems in engineering 2 methodology 2 1 saturated unsaturated seepage simulation method the unsaturated seepage model is the basis for simulating the seepage behavior of earth dams compared with saturated soil the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil is not constant which is related to the matric suction and water content the differential equation governing the transient seepage flow in a three dimensional domain can be derived using darcy s law lu and likos 2004 1 x k x θ h m x y k y θ h m y z k z θ h m x 1 c θ h m t where hm is the matric suction head θ is the volumetric water content kx θ ky θ and kz θ are unsaturated hydraulic conductivities in different directions respectively c θ is the slope of the soil water characteristic curve swcc a dimensionless variable se is defined to represent the unsaturated state of soils named effective saturation 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θs and θr represent the volumetric water content at saturation and the residual volumetric water content of the soil respectively when se 1 the soil is assumed to be saturated and the permeability is constant while the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated soil should be determined by swcc and hydraulic conductivity function several unsaturated seepage models have been proposed to predict the unsaturated behavior of soils and the van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 is one of the most commonly used unsaturated seepage models in geotechnical engineering amnyattalab and rezaie 2017 stark et al 2017 tan et al 2017 nan et al 2022 yu et al 2022b the swcc represents the relationship between effective saturation and matrix suction van genuchten proposed a closed form mathematical model which can be expressed as follows 3 s e 1 1 a w ψ n w m w where aw nw and m are fitting parameters of the vg model aw is related to the inverse of the air entry suction nw is a measure of the pore size distribution and mw 1 1 nw the hydraulic conductivity function gives the relationship between matric suction or effective saturation and the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils and the corresponding hydraulic conductivity functions of the vg model are defined by the following expressions 4 k ψ k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m w m w 2 where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity 2 2 multi objective optimization for parameter inversion analysis 2 2 1 multi objective function of parameter inversion to investigate the seepage behavior of core rockfill dams several seepage pressure measuring points are usually arranged in the core of the dam and some measuring points are located in the saturated area while others are located in the unsaturated area luo et al 2019 the purpose of parameter inversion is to make the numerical simulation results as consistent as possible with the measured values at each point the parameter inversion issues can be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem in feasible parameter space and the objective function can be expressed as 5 f x min f 1 x t 1 t δ 1 x t δ 1 t δ 1 t 2 min f n x t 1 t δ n x t δ n t δ n t 2 min f n x t 1 t δ n x t δ n t δ n t 2 6 x x 1 x 2 x m x m x m min x m x m max where f x is the multi objective functions x ℝ m is a combination of unknown parameters with m being the number of parameters n is the number of seepage pressure measuring points t is the number of time points chosen for inversion δn x t and δ n t are the calculated seepage pressure and measured seepage pressure of measuring point n at t time respectively xm min and xm max are value boundaries of parameter xm 2 2 2 construction of the surrogate model using elm the finite element simulation of transient unsaturated seepage flow of earth dams is very time consuming it is unrealistic to directly embed the finite element simulation into the multi objective optimization process and surrogate based optimization is an effective and widely used approach to solve this problem the surrogate model is a general term for simple analytical models that mimic the input output behavior of complex systems several surrogate models have been developed and successfully applied in optimization or uncertainty analysis such as the response surface model rsm li et al 2022 multiple response surface model mrsm jiang and huang 2016 support vector machine svm fei et al 2022 artificial neural networks ann maiti et al 2012 and kriging model yu et al 2022a et al in this study the extreme learning machine elm is utilized as the surrogate model to establish the mapping relationship between unsaturated seepage parameters and seepage pressure at dam measuring points the elm is one of the improved anns which shows excellent performance in learning efficiency and generalization ability majumder and lu 2021 to estimate the simulated seepage pressure δn x t a single output elm model can be established as follows 7 δ n x t e x w n t γ n t h 1 h γ h n t ϕ ω h n t x where e x w n t γ n t is the elm model to estimate the value of δn x t h is the number of hidden neurons ϕ is the activation function which is a sigmoid function such that the output of a neuron is between 0 and 1 w n t ωn t 1 ωn t 2 ωn t h is the matrix of hidden layer weights γ n t γn t 1 γn t 2 γn t h is the vector of output weights the design sites of the training dataset are generated by the orthogonal design which is an effective statistics method to arrange multifactorial experiments karunanayaka and tang 2018 and is widely used in constructing surrogate models chen et al 2020 then the forward simulations are performed based on the parameter design sites combining the parameter design sites and the corresponding simulation results as the training dataset of elm models then the efficient and reasonable estimation of the simulation results can be achieved the main concern of researchers for neural network based surrogate models is the accuracy and generalization ability in this study the constructed surrogate model is embedded into the nags ii algorithm for the estimation of simulation results in the multi objective optimization process the initial population is obtained by random sampling from the parameter space so the same approach is used to generate the validation datasets the performance of the elm model is evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 li et al 2021 given by 8 r 2 1 i 1 p δ i δ i 2 i 1 p δ i δ 2 where p is the number of samples in the training or validation datasets δ i and δ i are the estimated and observed seepage pressure respectively δ is the mean value of δ i r2 0 1 and the larger the r2 the higher the prediction accuracy of the elm model in this study the metric to accept the surrogate model is defined as r2 greater than 0 95 for both the training and validation datasets 2 2 3 multi objective optimization using nsga ii the traditional single objective genetic algorithm calculates the fitness value of individuals through a single objective function evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of individuals and finally obtains a single optimal solution however each objective function can get a fitness value in the multi objective optimization problem the objective functions restrict each other because they have the same random variables and it is difficult to achieve the optimization for all of the objective functions at the same time the non dominated sorting based genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is an advanced multi objective optimization algorithm developed by deb et al 2002 similar to the classical intelligent algorithms the nsga ii algorithm uses an iterative update of the population to implement parameter optimization and borrows the cross variance process from the traditional genetic algorithm in the population update based on which the non dominated sorting approach and crowding distance operator are introduced to generate the pareto optimal solutions kao and jacobson 2007 singh et al 2014 for the minimization problem if for any objective function fi x there exists fi xa fi xb and at least under a certain objective function fi xa fi xb i e the solution xa is always better than the solution xb then xb is dominated by xa denoted as xa xb and its mathematical expression is shown in eq conversely if there is a solution that cannot be dominated by any other solution that is there is no other individual that is superior to the solution in all objective functions it is called a non dominated solution 9 x a x b i f i 1 2 n f i x a f i x b j 1 2 n f j x a f j x b the non dominated sorting method is used in the nsga ii algorithm to divide all individuals in the population into different front layers by comparing the non dominated relationship between individuals all non dominated solutions are classified into a set which is called front 1 denoted as ℱ1 and the remaining individuals in the population are sorted again and the new non dominated solution set is front 2 denote it as ℱ2 repeat the above process until the entire population is divided into several fronts ℱ ℱ1 ℱ2 fig 1 is a schematic diagram of the pareto fronts in a bi objective optimization problem to ensure that individuals at the same front are uniformly distributed in the solution space and to avoid the issue of local optimum the crowding distance operator is introduced to evaluate the local aggregation of solutions which can be expressed as follows for the k dimensional multi objective optimization problem 10 c j i 1 k f i x j 1 f i x j 1 f i max f i min where cj is the crowding distance of xj fi xj 1 and fi xj 1 are the i th objective function values of solutions xj 1 and xj 1 f max iand fmin i are the extremums of the i th objective function in the current front fig 1 also shows the crowding distance in a bi objective optimization problem the nsga ii algorithm roughly includes the following steps initially a population xg of size p is randomly generated and the offspring population q g is generated through crossover and mutation the two populations xg and q g are merged to form a new population rg of size 2p next each individual in rg is sorted by the non dominated sorting method and divided into different fronts after sorting the local crowding distance is calculated to select individuals of size p from population rg to form a new parent population xg 1 the above process is repeated until the maximum number of iterations gmax is reached and the final pareto optimal solutions are generated the detailed procedure of nsga ii is shown in table 1 the nsga ii has been widely utilized in inversion and optimization problems deb and dhar 2011 deb and dhar 2013 sun et al 2018 hamzehkolaei et al 2018 in this study the nsga ii algorithm is applied to optimize the multi objective functions of unsaturated seepage inversion and obtain the pareto optimal solutions of the parameters the solution process is realized by the open source matlab platform for evolutionary multi objective optimization platemo tian et al 2017 2 3 multi source data driven parameter decision as mentioned above there is no absolute optimal solution in the pareto optimal solutions the purpose of parameter inversion is to obtain a set of specific parameters which requires researchers to make a higher level decision sun et al 2018 in the existing research the prediction accuracy is generally taken as the index of parameter decision wen et al 2017 sun et al 2018 which can be expressed as 11 x s arg min n 1 n f n x arg min n 1 n t 1 t δ n x t δ n t δ n t 2 where x s is the selected optimal parameter combination the surrogate model was adopted in the study of wen et al 2017 to calculate δn x t in the decision process and this approach is recorded as method a while sun et al 2018 calculated δn x t via numerical simulation directly which is recorded as method b in this paper in fact for the multi objective parameter inversion analysis the discrimination degree of the prediction errors of different parameters in the pareto solutions may be very slight and it is insufficient that select the optimal solution only based on this single index the final inversion results may deviate from the intrinsic characteristics of materials which is not conducive to predicting the future operation behavior of dams it is particularly necessary to consider all the information related to parameters in the high level decision in this study the following four information sources are considered 1 the fitting effect 2 the design values of parameters 3 the in situ test results of parameters 4 the over fitting coefficient the indexes corresponding to the above information sources are named index i index ii index iii and index iv respectively then a comprehensive index integrating the above four indexes is constructed for the final parameter decision 2 3 1 index i the fitting effect the primary purpose of parameter inversion is to ensure the accuracy of numerical simulation the pareto optimal solutions are distributed in an n dimensional euclidean space with the objective function value as the coordinate axis the position of each non dominated solution represents its fitting effect for different seepage pressure monitoring points and its euclidean metric with the origin of spatial coordinates i e all objective functions are 0 reflects the comprehensive prediction effect of this parameter combination the formula can be expressed as follows 12 e x n 1 n f n x 2 where e x is the value of index i and the parameter combination with the smaller e x provides higher fitting accuracy 2 3 2 index ii the design values of parameters in the design stage of dams the design values or interval of hydraulic conductivities of dam materials can be obtained by permeability test or engineering analogy the design values not only reflect the researchers prior cognition of parameters but also include the approximate relationship between hydraulic conductivities among different materials under the condition that the multi objective function values have little difference the closer to the parameter design values the higher the reliability of the solution in this study the membership function a x is used to express the deviation degree between the inversion results and the design values membership functions have various forms including triangle distribution ridge distribution polynomial distribution and gaussian distribution et al de luca di roseto et al 2018 in this paper the triangular distribution form is selected and its expression is as follows 13 a x 0 x x min x x min x d x min x min x x d 1 x x d x max x x max x d x d x x max 0 x x max where x max and x min are the value interval of parameters and xd is the design value of parameters the hydraulic conductivity value interval of each material of the core rockfill dam is taken as the upper and lower limits of the membership function the membership corresponding to the design values is 1 and the factor based on the parameter design values can be expressed as 14 m f x i 1 m a a i x i where ma is the number of parameters that have design values ai is the membership function of the parameter xi 2 3 3 index iii the in situ test results of parameters after the dam is constructed and operated due to the size effect construction quality and the migration and reorganization of soil particles under seepage the real hydraulic conductivity will be different from the design values dafny et al 2015 mouyeaux et al 2019 luo et al 2020 rezaei et al 2021 in the process of dam operation the actual impermeability of soil can be obtained by the in situ test which can be intrusive or non intrusive sjödahl et al 2009 hu et al 2013 soueid ahmed et al 2020 the in situ test is of great significance to improve the accuracy of parameters decision and the parameters of artificial soil generally follow a certain distribution which can be fitted when the amount of in situ test data is sufficient the index iii can be calculated by multiplying the probability density function of all parameters 15 i x j 1 m p p d f x j where ma is the number of parameters that have in situ test results pdf is the probability density function of the parameter xj 2 3 4 indexes iv over fitting coefficient in parameter inversion analysis the monitoring sequence over a period of time will be selected to construct the elm models and multi objective functions which can be referred to as the fitting dataset through the parameter inversion results the future operation behavior of the dam can be predicted and compared with the in situ monitoring data of the dam the new monitoring sequence is called the prediction dataset the inversion problem can be described as using fitting data set to calibrate parameters and the predicted dataset is the basis to test the inversion effect the operation process of dams is complex and the future operating environment is unpredictable the parameter inversion results obtained according to the existing information may have the problem of over fitting that is the numerical simulation only has high accuracy for the fitting data set and the fitting effect for the predicted data set is not ideal in this study based on the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the mean absolute percentage error mape of the fitted data set and the predicted data set the over fitting coefficient oc is defined and the expression is as follows yin and wu 2022 16 o c x 1 3 rms e p rms e f ma e p ma e f map e p map e f where 17 rmse n 1 n t 1 u δ n x t δ n t 2 u 18 mae n 1 n 1 u t 1 u δ n x t δ n t 19 mape n 1 n 100 u t 1 u δ n x t δ n t δ n t where the subscript f represents the fitting data set and p represents the prediction data set u is the number of measured data in the fitting data set or prediction data set of all measuring points δn x t and δn t are the calculated and measured values of the seepage pressure respectively the smaller the oc the better the prediction effect of dam operation behavior indicating that the fitness of parameters is higher 2 3 5 the comprehensive index integrating the above four indexes a comprehensive index q x for parameter decision is defined as shown in eq 20 and 21 the parameter combination x with the smallest q x is selected as the final inversion result 20 q x e x o c x m f x i x 1 3 n 1 n f n x 2 i 1 m a a i x i j 1 m p p d f x j rms e p rms e f ma e p ma e f map e p map e f 21 x s arg min q x it needs to be declared that the most important contribution of this paper is the idea of constructing the comprehensive index to drive the parameter decision for the dam with incomplete information sources the comprehensive index can be reconstructed by removing the corresponding independent indexes what s more for projects with more available information the comprehensive index can be improved to suit new issues by borrowing the ideas from this paper 2 4 implementation procedure of the proposed method a parameter inversion method of unsaturated seepage for core rockfill dams is proposed in which the transient unsaturated seepage simulation multi objective optimization algorithm and multi source data driven parameter decision are integrated the flow chart of the proposed method is shown in fig 2 and the procedure can be described as follows step 1 training of elm models the finite element model of the dam and foundation is constructed and the boundary conditions are imposed according to the analysis period and reservoir water level sequence for a certain unsaturated seepage model several representative combinations of parameters are generated by orthogonal design and the elm models of monitoring points at different inversion times are trained by corresponding forward finite element simulation results step 2 generation of pareto optimal solutions combining the elm models e x w n t γ n t and the seepage pressure monitoring data δn t the multi objective function is constructed according to eq the nsga ii algorithm is adopted for multi objective optimization and the pareto optimal solutions set is generated step 3 multi source data driven parameter decision for each parameter combination in the pareto optimal solutions the index i iv are calculated according to the corresponding information sources using eq 12 16 then the comprehensive index can be computed by eq 20 the parameter combination with the smallest comprehensive index is selected as the final inversion results 3 case study 3 1 introduction of the pb core rockfill dam the pb core rockfill dam is located in dadu river sichuan province china fig 3 the maximum dam height is 186 m and the elevation of the dam crest is 856 00 m the normal water level and the dead water level are 850 00 m and 790 00 m respectively the main anti seepage structure of the dam body is a gravelly soil core with filter layers on both sides and a transition layer is arranged between the filter layer and the rockfill the pb dam is built on a deep overburden and two concrete anti seepage walls with a thickness of 1 2 m are set at the dam foundation the auxiliary anti seepage wall located on the upstream side is inserted into the core for 10 m and the main anti seepage wall is located on the downstream side with a 50 m deep anti seepage curtain at the bottom the dam anti seepage system consists of the gravelly soil core anti seepage wall and anti seepage curtain the highest cross section of the pb dam is shown in fig 4 to investigate the seepage behavior of the dam several seepage pressure measuring points are installed in the core during the operation of the dam there are five measuring points under normal monitoring in the section shown in fig 4 namely p15 p16 p19 p20 and p83 the core is divided into the saturated area and unsaturated area with dead water level as the boundary p83 with an elevation of 818 m is located in the unsaturated area and other measuring points are located in the saturated area the unit of seepage pressure observed by the monitoring instrument is pa which is converted to total hydraulic head according to eq and compared with the reservoir water level as shown in fig 5 it should be stated that the same conversion is used for the simulated values 22 δ p ρ g h where p is the observed or simulated seepage pressure pa ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water g 9 8 n kg h is the elevation of the measurement point the pb hydropower station is an annual regulating reservoir and the water level of the reservoir changes periodically every year at the beginning of the dam operation the seepage pressure at each measurement point is relatively high which can be attributed to the influence of excess pore water pressure chen et al 2008 as soil consolidation caused by external loads develops excess pore water pressure gradually decreases deng et al 2019 in addition the hydraulic head of p83 which is located in the unsaturated area is significantly high and the difference with the water level is less than 15 m indicating that there might be a weak area of seepage resistance in the unsaturated area hu et al 2013 excessive seepage pressure may lead to internal seepage erosion and even dam failure therefore investigating the seepage resistance of the dam e g hydraulic conductivity is essential to guarantee the safety operation of the pb dam during the design phase of the dam extensive in situ testing tests were conducted in the dam site area to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the overburden and bedrock the hydraulic conductivity of the core and rockfill area are determined based on laboratory seepage tests the design values and range of hydraulic conductivity are listed in table 2 after the anomalous high seepage pressure in the unsaturated zone is observed an in situ drilling testing was conducted on august 9 2010 to test the hydraulic conductivity of the core the test results are shown in fig 6 and the original data can refer to hu et al 2013 the kolmogorov smirnov ks test proves that the in situ test data follow a lognormal distribution i e lnk 1 n 11 44 1 13 the histogram of the in situ test data and the fitting results of the lognormal distribution are also shown in fig 6 the main objective of this case study is to determine the unsaturated seepage model and parameters of the pb dam based on the observed seepage pressure monitoring data parameter design information and in situ testing results the monitoring data of 2014 with relatively stable water level rise and fall is selected as the inversion analysis period at which time the excess pore water pressure in the core had dissipated basically take january 1 to june 31 as the fitting period july 1 to december 31 as the prediction period and three days per month are selected as control points to generate the corresponding fitting data set and prediction data set i e each data set has 18 control points fig 7 shows the water level sequence of the pb dam in 2014 and the location of the control points 3 2 inversion of the saturated unsaturated seepage parameters 3 2 1 finite element model and undetermined parameters a finite element model of the highest cross section of the pb dam was created for seepage simulation with the following simulation domain in the upstream and downstream directions as well as in the depth direction the model extends twice the height of the dam i e 372 m the zoning of the dam body in the model is consistent with the actual project including the upstream and downstream rockfill transition layer filter layer gravelly soil core and waste slag the dam foundation is divided into four layers from top to bottom overburden i overburden ii slightly weathered rock and fresh bedrock in addition the anti seepage walls and curtain which are located at the dam foundation are also considered the discretized model of the dam foundation system contains 23 492 nodes and 11 555 elements the seepage pressure monitoring points are arranged at the corresponding nodes as shown in fig 8 commercial software abaqus is adopted for transient unsaturated seepage simulation with an analysis duration of 365 days i e from january 1 to december 31 2014 for the transient analysis issue the boundary conditions of the model are also variable specifically the upstream water pressure boundary is consistent with the measured water level see fig 5 which is defined using the amplitude function while the elevation of the tailwater is more stable and maintained at 672 m the downstream slope and surface below this elevation are set as the water pressure boundary and the slope above is set as the drainage only flow boundary the execution time of this transient unsaturated seepage simulation on a desktop computer i7 8700 3 2 ghz ram 16 gb ranged from 60 to 70 min and increasing the performance of the hardware did not significantly improve the computational efficiency indicating that the construction of surrogate models is necessary since the seepage parameters of the pb dam have high dimensions it is necessary to select the parameters which have a great impact on dam seepage as undetermined parameters the variance based global sensitivity analysis is performed refer to saltelli and marivoet 1990 and the selected undetermined parameters include the parameters of the vg model of the unsaturated area in the core i e k 1 aw nw the hydraulic conductivity k 2 of the saturated area in the core and the hydraulic conductivity k 3 of the slightly weathered rock while the insensitive parameters adopt the design values in table 2 3 2 2 optimization of multi objective functions as mentioned above 5 parameters of the vg model need to be calibrated according to the value range of inversion parameters see table 1 three levels of parameter values are determined as listed in table 3 from that an orthogonal experiment table l41 35 is constructed which generates 41 sets of parameter combinations the purpose of the orthogonal design is to investigate the response relationships across the parameter space with fewer representative design points which are uniformly distributed in the parameter space the generated parameter combinations are adopted for the seepage simulation to guarantee the accuracy of the surrogate model all 41 design sites and the corresponding seepage simulation results are adopted as training datasets for the elm in addition 20 sets of parameter combinations are generated by random sampling to construct the validation dataset in this study there are 5 measurement points with simulated seepage pressure at 36 moments to be estimated a total of 180 elm models need to be constructed for each model the r2 of the training dataset r2 training dataset validation dataset r2 validation dataset and the combination of them r2 total are calculated respectively the performance of elm based surrogate models is shown in fig 9 given a large number of surrogate models as a representative the comparison of the simulation and estimation seepage pressure for the p83 on january 10 2014 is shown see fig 9 a while fig 9 b presents the r2 total of all elm models which are all greater than 0 95 indicating the accuracy and reliability of the constructed surrogate models as mentioned previously in section 3 1 the observed seepage pressure unsaturated zone is higher in view of the different seepage characteristics in the saturated and unsaturated zones a bi objective function is constructed for parameter inversion in which the objective function f 1 contains the sum of the squared errors sse of the simulated seepage pressure of p83 in the unsaturated zone while the objective function f 2 reflects the sse for the measurement points in the saturated zone p15 p16 p19 and p20 given by 23 f x min f 1 x t 1 18 δ p 83 x t δ p 83 t δ p 83 t 2 min f 2 x i p 15 p16 p19 p20 t 1 18 δ i x t δ i t δ i t 2 the nsga ii algorithm is combined with elm based surrogate models to search for the pareto optimal solution of the established multi objective function the settings of the algorithm are as follows the population size p 100 and the maximum number of iterations gmax 10000 the optimization is implemented in matlab and the output pareto optimal solutions are named po which is a set containing 100 parameter combinations the pareto front in the two dimensional objective function space is shown in fig 10 it can be found that the range of f 1 is from 1 10 4 to 3 5 10 4 while the range of f 2 is from 2 25 10 4 to 3 75 10 4 which is a smaller interval and the objective function values for a large number of parameter combinations are relatively close fig 11 shows the distribution of parameter combinations and corresponding objective function values while their statistical characteristics i e mean μ standard deviation σ and coefficients of variation c v are listed in table 4 the results show that although the dispersion of the different parameter combinations is large the differences of their objective function values are not significant two reasons might lead to this situation firstly the seepage pressure at different measurement points is not only related to the material properties of the area in which they are located but also influenced by the overall seepage resistance of the dam thus different parameter combinations may result in similar observed seepage pressure secondly the information contained in the observed seepage pressure is very limited as the available data is provided by only five measurement points which hardly reflects the overall seepage field of the dam while the dimensionality of the calibrated parameters is high which causes the parameter inversion to be an ill posed problem i e it does not have a unique global optimal solution juang et al 2018 huang 2020 in summary the uncertainty in the inversion results is difficult to reduce when the available information includes only the observed seepage pressure and it is necessary to implement parameter decisions using multi source data 3 2 3 results of parameter decision the parameter decision is driven by the muti source information through the comprehensive index proposed above the index i is calculated from the values of the objective functions at five measuring points it should be noted that since there are 100 parameter combinations the calculated seepage pressure δn x i t is obtained through elm models the design values and range of hydraulic conductivity are listed in table 2 since there are no design values for vg model parameters aw and nw the index ii can be calculated by the product of the membership function of k 1 k 2 and k 3 mf x i a 1 k 1 i a 2 k 2 i a 3 k 3 i based on the in situ detection results shown in fig 6 the index iii can be calculated by the probability distribution function of hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated area 24 i x i p d f k 1 i 1 1 13 2 π exp ln k 1 i 11 44 2 2 54 k 1 i 0 0 k 1 i 0 the multi objective optimization of parameter inversion is based on the fitting data set while the prediction data set is to verify the prediction effect of the parameter inversion results as mentioned above the over fitting phenomenon in the inversion analysis should be considered in the parameter decision and the index iv can be calculated by eq the indexes for each parameter combination in pareto optimal solutions are calculated respectively and the comprehensive index q x i is obtained according to eq the parameter combination with the smallest q x i is selected as the final parameter inversion result which is listed in table 5 this table also lists the parameter decision results based on method a method b and all of the single indexes except index iii which is not suitable to be applied for the parameter decision of the pb dam as an independent index due to the limitation of the in situ test results it should be noted that index i and method a provide the same decision results which is attributed to their consistent basic ideas of parameter decision the position of the solutions decided by different methods on the pareto front is shown in fig 10 and the rationality and accuracy of these solutions will be compared and discussed later 3 2 4 comparison of different parameter decision methods the monitoring data shows that the seepage pressure above el788m in the core is high indicating that the hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated area may be relatively large the in situ test results also confirm this view as the average hydraulic conductivity of this area is 1 69 10 5cm s hu et al 2013 which is higher than the design value of 4 30 10 6 fig 12 is a scatter plot of that the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated and unsaturated area in the core under different parameter decision indexes this figure also identifies the position of the parameter point when k 1 is the in situ test mean value and k 2 is the design value it can be seen that the parameter inversion results selected by the comprehensive index are closest to the in situ test results and design values except for index i and method a other results even show that the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated area is greater than that in the unsaturated area which is inconsistent with engineering practice the purpose of parameter decision is to select the most reliable inversion result from the pareto optimal solutions by considering various indexes it will be very easy to select the best solution with the condition that the discrimination degree of each solution is very high on the contrary misjudgment may occur if the discrimination degree is not obvious in this study according to different decision indexes the advantage index g x is defined for comparing the discrimination degree of the alternative parameter combinations which can be written as 25 g x min index x index x where min index x is the minimum index value of all alternative parameter combinations under a certain decision method the discrimination degree of the pareto optimal solutions based on different decision methods is compared in fig 13 it can be seen that the advantage curve of the proposed method drops the fastest and the discrimination degree of each solution is greater than that of other methods which shows that the decision of inversion results is the most credible and acceptable through the comprehensive index considering multi source information the index ii has also achieved good performance because the design value reflects the actual value and correlation of materials parameters to some extent and is one of the most important decision information for other indexes the discrimination degree of each solution is not obvious which is unfavorable for the parameter decision fig 14 shows the hydraulic heads of the monitoring points calculated by the forward numerical simulations it can be seen that all the calculated results are in general agreement with the measurements which is due to the fact that all the parameter combinations are chosen from the pareto optimal solutions to further demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method three prediction performance indicators root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape are adopted to evaluate the simulation error of different parameter decision results the calculation formula is the same as eq 19 but includes the simulation error for each day in 2014 the results are listed in table 6 it can be seen that except for the rmse of p15 the accuracy of the parameter combinations selected using the comprehensive index proposed in this paper is the highest this can be attributed to the fact that for the fitted data set used for the parameter inversion period the simulation accuracy of individuals in the pareto optimal solutions is similar while the multi source data are considered in the proposed method and the decided parameter combination has better performance in the predicted dataset to sum up the comprehensive index fused with multi source information proposed in this paper is an effective method for parameter decision which can select the parameter combination that is most in line with engineering practice and has the highest accuracy from the pareto optimal solutions 4 conclusion in this paper an advanced multi source data driven parameter inversion methodology is proposed for the unsaturated seepage simulation of core rockfill dams the main innovation of this method is that the multi source data such as the observed seepage pressure the design value of the material parameter and in situ test results are fused to drive the decision of the pareto optimal solutions which can make the parameter inversion results more in line with the engineering practice and improve the prediction accuracy the proposed method is applied to the inversion of unsaturated seepage parameters of the pb dam which has a well established seepage pressure monitoring system the van genuchten model is adopted for numerical simulation and the multi objective function for parameter inversion is constructed based on the error of simulation results and observed seepage pressure the nsga ii algorithm is used to search for pareto optimal solutions the statistical analysis of the non dominated solutions shows that different parameter combinations may have closer accuracy indicating that the limited information may lead to uncertainty of the inversion results and it is necessary to perform parameter decision the process of the comprehensive index construction and the parameter decision is described in detail compared with the traditional parameter decision method the parameter inversion results using the proposed method are more consistent with the engineering practice and have higher simulation accuracy in the prediction period moreover through the comparison of the advantage index curve it can be seen that the discrimination degree of comprehensive indexes of different parameter combinations in the pareto optimal solutions is the most obvious which is beneficial to the credibility of the parameter decision the study of the real engineering example further verified the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method it can be predicted that the method proposed in this paper can be applied to other inversion issues such as the seepage or mechanical parameter inversion for slope tunnel and embankment et al the analysis of spatial variability characteristics of unsaturated seepage parameters driven by multi source information

2351,paleoclimate reconstructions are increasingly used to characterize climate variability and change prior to the instrumental record in order to improve our estimates of climate extremes and to provide a baseline for climate change projections most of these reconstructions are focused on temperature precipitation and or drought indices and to a lesser extent reconstruct streamflow variability in this study the first regional tree ring width chronology i e quercus sp from the caraorman forest danube delta romania was used to reconstruct the last 250 years of annual from november previous year to july of the current year streamflow of the lower danube river the obtained results indicate a stable and significant correlation between the tree ring width index from the caraorman forest and the danube streamflow at the ceatal izmail hydrologic station situated in the southeastern part of europe interannual streamflow variation for the analyzed period indicates 14 extremely high flow years with streamflow greater than 8780 m3 s 1770 1771 1799 1836 1838 1839 1871 1876 1877 1879 1940 1941 1997 and 2010 and 14 extremely low flow years with streamflow lower than 5300 m3 s 1741 1745 1750 1753 1773 1794 1812 1832 1843 1882 1899 1921 1964 and 1994 periods characterized by pluvials in the lower danube delta are associated with a low pressure system centered over europe positive sea surface temperature sst anomalies over the atlantic ocean and negative sst anomalies over the baltic north and mediterranean seas these large scale conditions favor the advection of moist air from the mediterranean and the black sea towards the southeastern part of romania which in turn leads to high precipitation rates over this region opposite to this low streamflow years are associated with a high pressure system centered over europe characterized by a northward shift of the storm tracks and negative sst anomalies over the atlantic ocean and positive sst anomalies over the baltic north and mediterranean seas based on our results we argue that the reconstruction of river streamflow data based on the tree ring width has important scientific and practical implications for a better understanding of the streamflow variation of the past necessary for water resource management and environmental hydrological protection keywords streamflow reconstruction lower danube tree rings oak data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the last ipcc report ipcc 2022 climate change has caused substantial deterioration of ecosystems and will cause unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards in the near and long term causing massive damages and increasingly irreversible losses including in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems ipcc 2022 the increased frequency and intensity of climatic extremes have already led to food and water scarcity ipcc 2022 and represent a high risk for future water supply kreibich et al 2022 in this context planning adaptation and mitigation strategies are necessary to face the current water related challenges and to have suitable water management water availability is a serious problem in densely populated and economically important regions boretti and rosa 2019 kreibich et al 2022 and water managers are increasingly confronted with supply and demand constraints on water resources especially in mediterranean type climatic regions where runoff decline is observed and expected to continue kundzewicz et al 2010 milly et al 2005 in particular surface runoff in the southern part of europe including the danube river basin is projected to decrease over the next few decades stagl and hattermann 2015 however uncertainty arises from the short and most of the time unavailable streamflow observations improvements in this respect can be facilitated by providing in depth analyses of how hydrological extremes impact water availability and long term climatological and hydrological information is essential to improve the accuracy of future hydrological scenarios the development of the water resource management plan is drawn back by very short instrumental hydrological records van lanen et al 2016 which are mostly limited to 50 years rarely reaching 100 years for many important river basins and are not enough to capture the natural variability of hydrological variables such as streamflow thus incorporating paleo hydrological and climatological data into water management plans will help to partially solve this problem tree ring data has proven its efficiency for reconstructing different climatic parameters e g precipitation and temperature due to temporal resolution precise dating and its widespread availability in different parts of the globe tree rings are the most suitable proxies to use when it comes to building long time scale chronologies with annual resolution different methodological approaches such as tree ring width intra annual density wood anatomy or stable isotopes are enabling us to explore the variability of multiple hydroclimatic parameters fritts 1976 gagen et al 2004 nagavciuc et al 2020 schweingruber 1988 however their potential in the reconstruction of the streamflow was not fully explored to our knowledge there are very few published studies of streamflow reconstruction for european rivers based on tree rings ballesteros cánovas et al 2015 formetta et al 2022 obertelli 2020 trlin et al 2021 although for regions such as the us canada or china there are many more tree ring based streamflow reconstruction studies ballesteros cánovas et al 2015 martin et al 2019 st george 2007 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2012 in europe the river basin management plans are established by the european water framework directive ec 2022 danube river plays an essential role in the water resource availability at the european level being the second largest river in europe with a catchment area of 817 000 km2 and comprising parts of 19 countries the river danube sustains the life of more than 80 million people schiller et al 2010 its strategic geographical position and spatial extension are complemented by a large number of stakeholders and decision makers who are facing significant challenges with respect to climate change and its impact on future water supply the southern eastern part of romania and the lower danube region represent areas with high exposure to aridity drought and even desertification phenomenon and are especially prone to drought risks due to extreme climatic phenomena nagavciuc et al 2022b thus over this region it is imperative to have long term perspective over the current extreme hydroclimatic conditions and variability a long term perspective of the variability and trends of danube river streamflow will allow different stakeholders and water managers to timely adopt the necessary precautionary measures which are needed to cushion the adverse effects of extreme events and to adapt and mitigate the current climatic conditions in order to minimize the socio cultural impacts in order to provide more information on long term streamflow variability of the lower danube river which can contribute to water resource management improvement here we report findings of the first tree ring width based multiseasonal streamflow reconstruction for the lower danube river the overall objectives of this study are i to investigate the hydroclimatic sensitivity of the latewood quercus sp tree rings from caraorman forest romania ii to develop an annual from november previous year to july current year streamflow reconstruction for the 1734 2020 period for the ceatal izmail hydrometric station lower danube on a well replicated tree ring dataset iii to investigate the long term streamflow variability of the lower danube river iv to analyze the possible teleconnection between reconstructed streamflow data and large scale climate patterns and v to describe the relative importance of the long term river streamflow variability for water resources management 2 methods 2 1 study area caraorman forest is located in the danube delta between the sulina and sfântu gheorghe

danube delta biosphere reserve administraţia rezervaţiei biosferei delta dunării 2022 it acquired this protection status to preserve the most impressive mobile and semi mobile dunes in the danube

the caraorman forest in may 2021 other 42 samples one core per tree were collected from the same caraorman forest in order to update the existing sample set to the year 2020 during the second field trip to avoid sampling the same trees the stems were carefully checked for core marks or scars the samples were extracted using a 5 mm pressler increment borer following standard dendrochronological sampling methods schweingruber 1988 the cores collected in 2006 were fixed in wooden supports and polished while the cores collected in 2021 were cut using the wsl core microtome gärtner and nievergelt 2010 all samples were scanned using silverfast v 8 1 software and an epson 11000 xl flatbed scanner with 1600 dpi true optical resolution and saved in a 48bit color image format based on the obtained images tree ring widths of the latewood were measured using the coorecorder v 9 31 software cybis elektronik 2010 with a precision of 0 01 mm all time series were cross dating using cdendro and checked for the missing rings using cofecha software using correlation analysis of 50 year intervals with a 25 year overlap grissino mayer 2001 holmes 1983 we decided to use latewood for future analyses due to their demonstrated higher sensitivity to capture hydroclimatic variability roibu et al 2020 the individual raw series were transformed into a growth index series to avoid any potential non climatic or biological trends all individual raw series were detrended using the negative exponential curve method in arstan software cook and kairiukstis 1990 after removing the autocorrelation the residual chronology further described as rwilw was used for further analyses the temporal stability of the obtained chronology was assessed using the expressed population signal eps and inter series correlation rbar eps and rbar were calculated using a 50 year moving window with a 25 year segment overlap wigley et al 1984 the strength of the chronology signal was evaluated using a threshold value of 0 85 for the eps parameter briffa and jones 1990 2 3 hydro climate data and statistical methods 2 3 1 hydro climate data to investigate the hydroclimatic sensitivity of the latewood tree ring width we analyzed the correlation between rwilw and precipitation pp relative humidity rh cloud cover cld mean temperature tt maximum temperature tx and minimum temperature tn using the data from mahmudia meteorological station for 1961 2013 period see location in fig 1 we also analyzed the relationship between rwilw and the monthly mean streamflow from seven gauging stations situated in the lower danube table 1 as well as one gauging station situated in the catchment area of siret river one of the main tributaries of the danube river in order to identify the most suitable period for paleo reconstruction the correlation analyses start from september previous year with one month window time period until the august current year afterward the time window increases with one month and the procedure is repeated the maximum window length was 12 months to assess the spatial stability of the correlation we used the gridded monthly precipitation pp covering the period 1901 2020 from the cru ts v 4 04 dataset harris et al 2020 the influence of the large scale atmospheric circulation on the variability of high and low streamflow periods has been investigated using the monthly means of geopotential height at 500 mbar mb z500 zonal wind u500 and meridional wind v500 at 500 mb from the twentieth century reanalysis v3 data set compo et al 2011 2006 slivinski et al 2019 on a 2 2 grid over the 1837 2015 ce period the vertically integrated water vapor transport wvt peixoto and oort 1992 was calculated through zonal wind u meridional wind v and specific humidity q from the same data set compo et al 2011 slivinski et al 2021 for sea surface temperature sst we used the extended reconstructed sea surface temperature ersst dataset v5 spatial resolution 2 x 2 covering the 1854 2020 period huang et al 2018 these two large scale datasets have been chosen for the current analysis due to their extended length allowing us to analyzed the large scale drivers for 180 years for the large scale atmospheric circulation and 167 years for the ocean circulation moreover the same datasets have been previously used in a successful and reliable manner for paleoclimate related studies ionita et al 2021 nagavciuc et al 2022a roibu et al 2022b a detailed list with all the dataset employed in this study is given table 1 2 3 2 statistical methods the relationship between rwilw residual chronology and the lower danube streamflow at the ceatal izmail hydrometric station was established using a linear regression model in order to validate our model the data was split into subsets of approximately equal lengths calibration 1921 1967 and verification 1968 2013 the explained variance r2 the reduction of error re the coefficient of efficiency ce and the durbin watson test dw statistical tests were performed to evaluate the strength and robustness of the final model all the statistical analyses have been performed in r statistical environment using the r packages dplr bunn 2008 and treeclim zang and biondi 2015 to test the spatial temporal stability of the relationship between the rwilw index and climate variables i e gridded monthly precipitation we also make use of stability maps a methodology successfully applied in the seasonal forecast of the european rivers and arctic sea ice as well as in dendroclimatological studies ionita et al 2019 ionita and nagavciuc 2020 nagavciuc et al 2020 2019b roibu et al 2022a in order to detect stable predictors the variability of the correlation between the rwilw time series and the monthly pp data was investigated within a 31 year moving window over the period from 1901 to 2020 the analysis was performed for a time window that starts in november of the previous year plus one cumulative month until june of the current year as for this period were obtained the higher correlation coefficients the correlation is considered stable for those regions where the rwilw index and the gridded pp data are significantly correlated at the 90 for more than 80 of the moving window the advantage of this methodology when compared with traditional correlation analysis is the possibility to identify just the regions which have a stable relationship in time with our tree rings based proxies the stability maps methodology is described more in detail in ionita 2017 the relationship between the large scale oceanic sst and atmospheric circulation z500 and the reconstructed streamflow variability has been identified based on the composite maps methodology von storch and zwiers 1999 the composite maps between reconstructed streamflow and the z500 and sst were constructed by selecting the years in which the value of the streamflow time series was higher than the 90th percentile high and lower than the 10th percentile low respectively this threshold was chosen as a compromise between the strength of the climate anomalies associated with streamflow anomalies and the number of maps that satisfy this criterion composite analysis is widely used to understand physical mechanisms and develop statistical prediction models von storch and zwiers 1999 the significance of the composite maps is based on a standard t test confidence level 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 chronology characteristics here we present a new tree ring latewood width chronology for danube delta from quercus sp over the period 1728 2020 the length of measured cores for this study ranged between 102 and 286 annual rings while the mean tree age is 150 years fig 2 the mean tree ring latewood width is 2 12 1 26 mm the inter series correlation values of the individual time series range from r 0 25 to r 0 75 and shows a strong similarity of growth trends among the records while the first order autocorrelation for raw data ac1 is 0 66 the sample replication for the last 200 years is higher than 40 series reaching up to 78 series between 1973 and 2006 before 1800 the sample replication decreases to 15 series for the obtained rwlw chronology the eps exceeds the 0 85 threshold after the year 1800 with a replication of 16 samples which is widely accepted wigley et al 1984 3 2 rwilw hydro climatic signal the strength of the hydro climate signal was evaluated by computing the monthly and seasonal different combinations of months from 2 to 12 months pearson s correlations from september of the previous year to august of the current year between the rwilw index and different climatic parameters from mahmudia meteorological station as well as the monthly streamflow in the lower danube measured at seven gauging stations fig 3 table 2 the oak rwilw index from the caraorman forest is negatively and significantly correlated with the maximum temperature of january r 0 37 march r 0 40 and april r 0 44 as well as with the january july period r 0 43 table 2 similar results were found for the mean temperature but also a significant positive correlation with the previous november mean temperature r 0 33 for the minimum temperature a significant and positive correlation was found only for the previous year november r 0 39 the rwilw index is also positive and significantly correlated with cloud cover relative humidity and precipitation with the highest correlation for november previous year to july current year period r 0 55 for cld r 0 40 for rh and r 0 70 for pp table 2 in terms of the streamflow correlation analyses we found a positive and significant correlation between the rwilw index and the streamflow data through the whole lower danube the highest correlation coefficient r 0 70 p 0 001 was obtained for the ceatal izmail gauging station for the case when we average the streamflow over a nine months period namely from november previous year to july current year fig 3 in the case of the other analyzed gauging stations to correlation was the highest also for a nine month average namely from november previous year to july current year except for the orsova gauging station fig 3a for the orsova gauging station which is the furthest station relative to our sampling site the highest correlations have been found for an average over 10 months october previous year july current year it is noteworthy to mention that the link between streamflow variability and tree growth is defined by a complex interplay of groundwater availability and climatic variability on the one hand tree ring growth is influenced by a complex interaction of the temperature and precipitation fritts 1976 while climatologically the streamflow variability depends on the evapotranspiration rate which is given by water availability and temperature thus the climatic factors associated with high streamflow e g temperature and precipitation are also associated with wider tree rings koprowski et al 2018 on the other hand low water availability causes a reduction in tree growth skiadaresis et al 2021 2019 furthermore lowering the groundwater level in the area near the sea will favor saltwater intrusion in the groundwater and soil salinization with a negative effect on tree growth antonellini and mollema 2010 ran et al 2021 the spatial temporal stability of climatic signals was tested by applying the stability maps approach between the rwilw index and the gridded pp data over the period 1901 2020 the obtained results indicate a positive stable and significant correlation between our rwilw chronology and the precipitation over ukraine the republic of moldova romania and bulgaria fig 4 for the cumulative period from november previous year to july current year which represents the period for which we obtained the best spatiotemporal results this is in agreement with the previous findings indicating that an accumulation period of 9 months i e november previous year july current year is the best signal for reconstructing the streamflow variability this 9 month accumulation time can be explained also by the fact that danube s catchment area is one of the largest in europe and our samples location is situated close to the lowest border of it before danube spills into the danube delta thus integrating the streamflow variability signal throughout most of the catchment area therefore tree rings could be considered a good indicator of hydroclimatic variability because they are influenced both by groundwater availability and temperature precipitation fluctuations which are directly link to streamflow variability accordingly a period of low streamflow low groundwater level determined by lack of moisture or drought conditions which represent a limiting factor for tree growth will result in narrow tree ring width while a period of high streamflow high groundwater level determined by exceeding moisture will be reflected as wide tree rings skiadaresis et al 2019 trlin et al 2021 3 3 streamflow reconstruction taking into account all obtained correlations and the stability of the climatic signal a linear regression model 1 was used to reconstruct the streamflow variability from the ceatal izmail hydrometric station averaged over the period for november previous year to july current year novpy julcy period 1 q t r w i lwt 0 48307 3629 15625 where q is streamflow for novpy julcy period at ceatal izmail hydrometric station and the rwilw is the tree ring latewood width index of the caraorman oak chronology at t year in order to evaluate the reconstruction skills the dataset was split into two equally long periods 1922 1967 and 1968 2013 for calibration verification approach in forward and reverse mode the obtained highly positive values of re and ce table 3 for both forward and reverse models indicate a good and predictive reconstruction skill fig 5 a while the dw values near 2 indicate little to no autocorrelation all calibration verification statistics suggest that the developed linear regression model is reliable for the streamflow reconstruction and can be used to reconstruct past streamflow variability the developed reconstruction model explains 45 r2 0 45 of the danube streamflow variation at the ceatal izmail hydrometric station fig 5b based on the aforementioned linear regression model the streamflow variability was reconstructed for the 1734 2020 period fig 6 a nevertheless since the esp value exceeded the threshold of 0 85 only after 1800 the reconstruction before 1800 might be prone to larger uncertainties the novpy julcy period reconstruction of streamflow variability at the ceatal izmail hydrometric station preserves both the inter annual to inter decadal variations over the analyzed period the interannual streamflow variability analysis revealed fourteen years with extreme low values when the streamflow did not exceed 5300 m3 s 5th percentile 1741 1745 1750 1753 1773 1794 1812 1832 1843 1882 1899 1921 1964 and 1994 and fourteen years with extreme high streamflow over the 8780 m3 s 95th percentile 1770 1771 1799 1836 1838 1839 1871 1876 1877 1879 1940 1941 1997 and 2010 over the last two centuries the periods with high streamflow occurred in the following intervals 1830 1844 1869 1886 1934 1948 1961 1985 and 1994 2014 fig 6a blue shaded areas while periods with low streamflow occurred between 1856 and 1868 1949 1960 1986 1993 and from 2015 to present fig 6a red shaded areas to investigate the low frequency variability of the reconstructed streamflow chronology and compare the streamflow reconstruction over different periods we split our chronology into a 40 years window and we performed box plot statistical analyses fig 6b the median distribution of all box plots is at the same level near 7000 m3 s but the distribution is different over the period 1821 1860 the majority of the streamflow data varies between 6500 and 7500 m3 s with the lower whisker longer than the higher ones but with three upper outliners which indicate the presence of the extreme events the period 1861 1900 is characterized by a higher variability the first and third quartile ranging between 6200 and 8000 m3 s with the longest outliners for the analyzed period the period 1901 1940is slightly skewed up indicating that the majority of data are lower than the median the period 1941 1980 is normally distributed while the period 1981 2020 is characterized by a higher variability slightly skewed up and with a much longer upper whisker than the lower one indicating that during this period the lower danube streamflow was predominantly lower than the median but with some very high streamflow values 3 4 large scale atmospheric circulation since the precipitation and temperature variability variables that are contributing substantially to the variations of the danube river streamflow are mainly driven by the large scale atmospheric circulation ionita 2015 ionita et al 2012 we have tested also the relationship between the large scale atmospheric circulation and our reconstructed streamflow in order to investigate the relationship between the interannual variability of the streamflow variability and the large scale atmospheric circulation we made use of the composite maps methodology between the streamflow reconstruction and the geopotential height at 500 mb z500 wvt and sst for the cases when the streamflow was higher than the 90th percentile 8237 m3 s and lower than the 10th percentile 5545 m3 s the large scale atmospheric circulation influences tree growth indirectly by influencing the intensity duration and variability of the climatic events usually anticyclonic cyclonic circulation patterns determine dry wet climatic conditions ionita et al 2015 and therefore low high river streamflow values which contribute to slowing down favors tree growth according to our obtained results periods with high streamflow values are associated with a low pressure system over central western europe and the middle atlantic ocean and a high pressure system over greenland siberia and the northern part of africa fig 7 a this pattern favors the advection of the moist air masses from the mediterranean region toward romania fig 7c which contributes to high precipitation rates high streamflow and wider tree ring widths contrary to this low flow periods are associated with a high pressure system over central western europe and a low pressure system over the northern atlantic ocean greenland and siberia fig 7b this pattern favors the advection of dry and warm air from the east creating an area of local divergence over the south eastern part of europe fig 7d which in turn inhibits precipitation and leads to low streamflow values and narrow tree ring widths a similar association between the large scale atmospheric circulation and streamflow variability over romania including our study region was found by ionita 2015 the role of the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sst on the european hydroclimate variability has been highlighted by numerous previous studies feudale and shukla 2011 ionita et al 2017 2012 kingston et al 2012 following this line the relationship between sst variability and tree ring growth has been previously quantified in dendrochronological studies nagavciuc et al 2020 2019a roibu et al 2022b the analyses of the composite map reveal that the periods with high streamflow values are associated with negative sst anomalies over the seas around the europe continent barents sea norwegian sea baltic sea north sea celtic sea and the mediterranean sea and positive sst anomalies over the atlantic ocean opposite to this low flow years are associated with positive sst anomalies over the seas around the europe continent the barents sea norwegian sea baltic sea north sea celtic sea and the mediterranean sea and negative sst anomalies over the central and northern atlantic ocean fig 8 the observed influence of the sst variability on the wet dry periods in the lower danube is in agreement with recent studies which have emphasized that the state of the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sst has a significant influence on the hydroclimate of europe including our analyzed region feudale and shukla 2011 ionita et al 2022 2021 kingston et al 2015 3 5 implications for the river streamflow management the danube river streamflow is used in a variety of sectors from navigation and hydropower generation to agriculture industry drinking water supply recreation or environmental purposes icpdr 2021 therefore streamflow variability plays a crucial role in water resource planning and management the presented here streamflow reconstruction based on the tree ring width is important not only for dendrohydrological studies but also for long timescale analyses and evaluation of the danube water availability at multi centennial scales especially since instrumental data are rather short 50 years and insufficient to capture long scale streamflow variations necessary for developing the hydrological models and resource water planning the reconstructed streamflow chronology allows us to put the instrumental record into a long term context indicating that the periods with the lowest highest streamflow from the instrumental record are not the most extreme low high streamflow periods when contextualized into a longer term perspective for example the low streamflow periods from the 20th century were not so extreme as the low streamflow period from 1857 to 1870 on the flood side the period 1871 1884 which was characterized by extreme high streamflow values exceeds the streamflow rates periods from the observational periods in addition our reconstruction of the lower danube river streamflow suggests that overall the streamflow rates were more variable at times preceding the instrumental period implying that water management decisions are made based on relatively short and insufficient instrumental records compared with the more extensive reconstruction also the streamflow from the ceatal izmail hydrometric station is significantly correlated with other hydrometric stations from upstream of the river not shown and can play a key role in decisions making and water resource management not only at the local scale but also at the regional scale considering the climate projections indicate that the impact of climate change will aggravate water availability especially in the lower danube basin and will lead to a significant increase in water demand in the future stagl and hattermann 2015 vanham 2012 now more than ever the long term streamflow reconstruction should be integrated into developing of the future water strategy and planning measures to ensure feasible long term water management including industrial and human consumption water use and distribution and conservation of the features of the danube basin 3 6 limitation of the study tree ring width data was been proven to be an extraordinary proxy for paleoclimatic reconstruction presenting numerous advantages over other natural proxies nevertheless we need to specify a few limitations tree ring width as well as all other climate proxies contain additional noise which add uncertainty into a chronology however we combined data from a very large sample of trees in order to reduce the influence of this noise another limitation of the study is the unavailability of instrumental climate data nearby the study site and the spatial resolution of the gridded data however we used the climate data from the nearest available meteorological stations 30 km and we used grid data sets with the best combination between spatial resolution and their extended length thus avoiding short climatic time series which does not fulfil the study aim 4 conclusion this study presents an annual streamflow reconstruction from the caraorman forest lower danube region over the past 250 years based on the significant correlation between the tree ring latewood width and november july streamflow r 0 70 p 0 001 our tree ring reconstruction explains 45 of the variance of lower danube streamflow reinforcing the idea that tree rings can be also a useful proxy for streamflow and not only for precipitation and temperature since our streamflow reconstruction covers only a small area it is essential for the subsequent construction of large scale streamflow reconstructions throughout the catchment area of the danube river the performance and reliability of our tree ring based streamflow reconstruction was proved by calibration and validation of our data and by using specific statistics for the regression model over the 1931 2013 period based on our reconstruction we have identified extremely dry and wet years over the last 250 years in the lower danube over the last 250 years the wettest high streamflow periods occurred in the following intervals 1830 1844 1869 1886 1934 1948 1961 1985 and 1994 2014 opposite to this the driest intervals low flow periods occurred between 1856 1868 1949 1960 1986 1993 and from 2015 to present in general high flow years are associated with a cyclonic circulation over the central and eastern part of europe convergence over the black sea and at country level and positive negative sst anomalies in the tropical atlantic ocean and south of greenland mediterranean sea and north sea these large scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies lead to high precipitation rates and high streamflow in the lower danube low flow years are associated with significant divergence over the black sea and our analyzed region a high pressure system over the central part of europe and a cold warm tropical and central north atlantic mediterranean sea which in turn inhibit precipitation from a water management perspective we believe that this reconstruction can help water managers and stakeholders to improve their knowledge about the variability of the danube streamflow especially since streamflow observations for the lower danube are rather short 50 years or are not freely available it is important to mention that this is the first streamflow reconstruction for the lower danube helping us to put the current water issues over this region into a longer term context overall tree rings based streamflow reconstruction enables us to better understand the long term streamflow changes and possible trends which could be of high value to water managers and regional planners leading to improved support useful in the decision making process and regional planning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2351,paleoclimate reconstructions are increasingly used to characterize climate variability and change prior to the instrumental record in order to improve our estimates of climate extremes and to provide a baseline for climate change projections most of these reconstructions are focused on temperature precipitation and or drought indices and to a lesser extent reconstruct streamflow variability in this study the first regional tree ring width chronology i e quercus sp from the caraorman forest danube delta romania was used to reconstruct the last 250 years of annual from november previous year to july of the current year streamflow of the lower danube river the obtained results indicate a stable and significant correlation between the tree ring width index from the caraorman forest and the danube streamflow at the ceatal izmail hydrologic station situated in the southeastern part of europe interannual streamflow variation for the analyzed period indicates 14 extremely high flow years with streamflow greater than 8780 m3 s 1770 1771 1799 1836 1838 1839 1871 1876 1877 1879 1940 1941 1997 and 2010 and 14 extremely low flow years with streamflow lower than 5300 m3 s 1741 1745 1750 1753 1773 1794 1812 1832 1843 1882 1899 1921 1964 and 1994 periods characterized by pluvials in the lower danube delta are associated with a low pressure system centered over europe positive sea surface temperature sst anomalies over the atlantic ocean and negative sst anomalies over the baltic north and mediterranean seas these large scale conditions favor the advection of moist air from the mediterranean and the black sea towards the southeastern part of romania which in turn leads to high precipitation rates over this region opposite to this low streamflow years are associated with a high pressure system centered over europe characterized by a northward shift of the storm tracks and negative sst anomalies over the atlantic ocean and positive sst anomalies over the baltic north and mediterranean seas based on our results we argue that the reconstruction of river streamflow data based on the tree ring width has important scientific and practical implications for a better understanding of the streamflow variation of the past necessary for water resource management and environmental hydrological protection keywords streamflow reconstruction lower danube tree rings oak data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the last ipcc report ipcc 2022 climate change has caused substantial deterioration of ecosystems and will cause unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards in the near and long term causing massive damages and increasingly irreversible losses including in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems ipcc 2022 the increased frequency and intensity of climatic extremes have already led to food and water scarcity ipcc 2022 and represent a high risk for future water supply kreibich et al 2022 in this context planning adaptation and mitigation strategies are necessary to face the current water related challenges and to have suitable water management water availability is a serious problem in densely populated and economically important regions boretti and rosa 2019 kreibich et al 2022 and water managers are increasingly confronted with supply and demand constraints on water resources especially in mediterranean type climatic regions where runoff decline is observed and expected to continue kundzewicz et al 2010 milly et al 2005 in particular surface runoff in the southern part of europe including the danube river basin is projected to decrease over the next few decades stagl and hattermann 2015 however uncertainty arises from the short and most of the time unavailable streamflow observations improvements in this respect can be facilitated by providing in depth analyses of how hydrological extremes impact water availability and long term climatological and hydrological information is essential to improve the accuracy of future hydrological scenarios the development of the water resource management plan is drawn back by very short instrumental hydrological records van lanen et al 2016 which are mostly limited to 50 years rarely reaching 100 years for many important river basins and are not enough to capture the natural variability of hydrological variables such as streamflow thus incorporating paleo hydrological and climatological data into water management plans will help to partially solve this problem tree ring data has proven its efficiency for reconstructing different climatic parameters e g precipitation and temperature due to temporal resolution precise dating and its widespread availability in different parts of the globe tree rings are the most suitable proxies to use when it comes to building long time scale chronologies with annual resolution different methodological approaches such as tree ring width intra annual density wood anatomy or stable isotopes are enabling us to explore the variability of multiple hydroclimatic parameters fritts 1976 gagen et al 2004 nagavciuc et al 2020 schweingruber 1988 however their potential in the reconstruction of the streamflow was not fully explored to our knowledge there are very few published studies of streamflow reconstruction for european rivers based on tree rings ballesteros cánovas et al 2015 formetta et al 2022 obertelli 2020 trlin et al 2021 although for regions such as the us canada or china there are many more tree ring based streamflow reconstruction studies ballesteros cánovas et al 2015 martin et al 2019 st george 2007 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2012 in europe the river basin management plans are established by the european water framework directive ec 2022 danube river plays an essential role in the water resource availability at the european level being the second largest river in europe with a catchment area of 817 000 km2 and comprising parts of 19 countries the river danube sustains the life of more than 80 million people schiller et al 2010 its strategic geographical position and spatial extension are complemented by a large number of stakeholders and decision makers who are facing significant challenges with respect to climate change and its impact on future water supply the southern eastern part of romania and the lower danube region represent areas with high exposure to aridity drought and even desertification phenomenon and are especially prone to drought risks due to extreme climatic phenomena nagavciuc et al 2022b thus over this region it is imperative to have long term perspective over the current extreme hydroclimatic conditions and variability a long term perspective of the variability and trends of danube river streamflow will allow different stakeholders and water managers to timely adopt the necessary precautionary measures which are needed to cushion the adverse effects of extreme events and to adapt and mitigate the current climatic conditions in order to minimize the socio cultural impacts in order to provide more information on long term streamflow variability of the lower danube river which can contribute to water resource management improvement here we report findings of the first tree ring width based multiseasonal streamflow reconstruction for the lower danube river the overall objectives of this study are i to investigate the hydroclimatic sensitivity of the latewood quercus sp tree rings from caraorman forest romania ii to develop an annual from november previous year to july current year streamflow reconstruction for the 1734 2020 period for the ceatal izmail hydrometric station lower danube on a well replicated tree ring dataset iii to investigate the long term streamflow variability of the lower danube river iv to analyze the possible teleconnection between reconstructed streamflow data and large scale climate patterns and v to describe the relative importance of the long term river streamflow variability for water resources management 2 methods 2 1 study area caraorman forest is located in the danube delta between the sulina and sfântu gheorghe

the caraorman forest in may 2021 other 42 samples one core per tree were collected from the same caraorman forest in order to update the existing sample set to the year 2020 during the second field trip to avoid sampling the same trees the stems were carefully checked for core marks or scars the samples were extracted using a 5 mm pressler increment borer following standard dendrochronological sampling methods schweingruber 1988 the cores collected in 2006 were fixed in wooden supports and polished while the cores collected in 2021 were cut using the wsl core microtome gärtner and nievergelt 2010 all samples were scanned using silverfast v 8 1 software and an epson 11000 xl flatbed scanner with 1600 dpi true optical resolution and saved in a 48bit color image format based on the obtained images tree ring widths of the latewood were measured using the coorecorder v 9 31 software cybis elektronik 2010 with a precision of 0 01 mm all time series were cross dating using cdendro and checked for the missing rings using cofecha software using correlation analysis of 50 year intervals with a 25 year overlap grissino mayer 2001 holmes 1983 we decided to use latewood for future analyses due to their demonstrated higher sensitivity to capture hydroclimatic variability roibu et al 2020 the individual raw series were transformed into a growth index series to avoid any potential non climatic or biological trends all individual raw series were detrended using the negative exponential curve method in arstan software cook and kairiukstis 1990 after removing the autocorrelation the residual chronology further described as rwilw was used for further analyses the temporal stability of the obtained chronology was assessed using the expressed population signal eps and inter series correlation rbar eps and rbar were calculated using a 50 year moving window with a 25 year segment overlap wigley et al 1984 the strength of the chronology signal was evaluated using a threshold value of 0 85 for the eps parameter briffa and jones 1990 2 3 hydro climate data and statistical methods 2 3 1 hydro climate data to investigate the hydroclimatic sensitivity of the latewood tree ring width we analyzed the correlation between rwilw and precipitation pp relative humidity rh cloud cover cld mean temperature tt maximum temperature tx and minimum temperature tn using the data from mahmudia meteorological station for 1961 2013 period see location in fig 1 we also analyzed the relationship between rwilw and the monthly mean streamflow from seven gauging stations situated in the lower danube table 1 as well as one gauging station situated in the catchment area of siret river one of the main tributaries of the danube river in order to identify the most suitable period for paleo reconstruction the correlation analyses start from september previous year with one month window time period until the august current year afterward the time window increases with one month and the procedure is repeated the maximum window length was 12 months to assess the spatial stability of the correlation we used the gridded monthly precipitation pp covering the period 1901 2020 from the cru ts v 4 04 dataset harris et al 2020 the influence of the large scale atmospheric circulation on the variability of high and low streamflow periods has been investigated using the monthly means of geopotential height at 500 mbar mb z500 zonal wind u500 and meridional wind v500 at 500 mb from the twentieth century reanalysis v3 data set compo et al 2011 2006 slivinski et al 2019 on a 2 2 grid over the 1837 2015 ce period the vertically integrated water vapor transport wvt peixoto and oort 1992 was calculated through zonal wind u meridional wind v and specific humidity q from the same data set compo et al 2011 slivinski et al 2021 for sea surface temperature sst we used the extended reconstructed sea surface temperature ersst dataset v5 spatial resolution 2 x 2 covering the 1854 2020 period huang et al 2018 these two large scale datasets have been chosen for the current analysis due to their extended length allowing us to analyzed the large scale drivers for 180 years for the large scale atmospheric circulation and 167 years for the ocean circulation moreover the same datasets have been previously used in a successful and reliable manner for paleoclimate related studies ionita et al 2021 nagavciuc et al 2022a roibu et al 2022b a detailed list with all the dataset employed in this study is given table 1 2 3 2 statistical methods the relationship between rwilw residual chronology and the lower danube streamflow at the ceatal izmail hydrometric station was established using a linear regression model in order to validate our model the data was split into subsets of approximately equal lengths calibration 1921 1967 and verification 1968 2013 the explained variance r2 the reduction of error re the coefficient of efficiency ce and the durbin watson test dw statistical tests were performed to evaluate the strength and robustness of the final model all the statistical analyses have been performed in r statistical environment using the r packages dplr bunn 2008 and treeclim zang and biondi 2015 to test the spatial temporal stability of the relationship between the rwilw index and climate variables i e gridded monthly precipitation we also make use of stability maps a methodology successfully applied in the seasonal forecast of the european rivers and arctic sea ice as well as in dendroclimatological studies ionita et al 2019 ionita and nagavciuc 2020 nagavciuc et al 2020 2019b roibu et al 2022a in order to detect stable predictors the variability of the correlation between the rwilw time series and the monthly pp data was investigated within a 31 year moving window over the period from 1901 to 2020 the analysis was performed for a time window that starts in november of the previous year plus one cumulative month until june of the current year as for this period were obtained the higher correlation coefficients the correlation is considered stable for those regions where the rwilw index and the gridded pp data are significantly correlated at the 90 for more than 80 of the moving window the advantage of this methodology when compared with traditional correlation analysis is the possibility to identify just the regions which have a stable relationship in time with our tree rings based proxies the stability maps methodology is described more in detail in ionita 2017 the relationship between the large scale oceanic sst and atmospheric circulation z500 and the reconstructed streamflow variability has been identified based on the composite maps methodology von storch and zwiers 1999 the composite maps between reconstructed streamflow and the z500 and sst were constructed by selecting the years in which the value of the streamflow time series was higher than the 90th percentile high and lower than the 10th percentile low respectively this threshold was chosen as a compromise between the strength of the climate anomalies associated with streamflow anomalies and the number of maps that satisfy this criterion composite analysis is widely used to understand physical mechanisms and develop statistical prediction models von storch and zwiers 1999 the significance of the composite maps is based on a standard t test confidence level 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 chronology characteristics here we present a new tree ring latewood width chronology for danube delta from quercus sp over the period 1728 2020 the length of measured cores for this study ranged between 102 and 286 annual rings while the mean tree age is 150 years fig 2 the mean tree ring latewood width is 2 12 1 26 mm the inter series correlation values of the individual time series range from r 0 25 to r 0 75 and shows a strong similarity of growth trends among the records while the first order autocorrelation for raw data ac1 is 0 66 the sample replication for the last 200 years is higher than 40 series reaching up to 78 series between 1973 and 2006 before 1800 the sample replication decreases to 15 series for the obtained rwlw chronology the eps exceeds the 0 85 threshold after the year 1800 with a replication of 16 samples which is widely accepted wigley et al 1984 3 2 rwilw hydro climatic signal the strength of the hydro climate signal was evaluated by computing the monthly and seasonal different combinations of months from 2 to 12 months pearson s correlations from september of the previous year to august of the current year between the rwilw index and different climatic parameters from mahmudia meteorological station as well as the monthly streamflow in the lower danube measured at seven gauging stations fig 3 table 2 the oak rwilw index from the caraorman forest is negatively and significantly correlated with the maximum temperature of january r 0 37 march r 0 40 and april r 0 44 as well as with the january july period r 0 43 table 2 similar results were found for the mean temperature but also a significant positive correlation with the previous november mean temperature r 0 33 for the minimum temperature a significant and positive correlation was found only for the previous year november r 0 39 the rwilw index is also positive and significantly correlated with cloud cover relative humidity and precipitation with the highest correlation for november previous year to july current year period r 0 55 for cld r 0 40 for rh and r 0 70 for pp table 2 in terms of the streamflow correlation analyses we found a positive and significant correlation between the rwilw index and the streamflow data through the whole lower danube the highest correlation coefficient r 0 70 p 0 001 was obtained for the ceatal izmail gauging station for the case when we average the streamflow over a nine months period namely from november previous year to july current year fig 3 in the case of the other analyzed gauging stations to correlation was the highest also for a nine month average namely from november previous year to july current year except for the orsova gauging station fig 3a for the orsova gauging station which is the furthest station relative to our sampling site the highest correlations have been found for an average over 10 months october previous year july current year it is noteworthy to mention that the link between streamflow variability and tree growth is defined by a complex interplay of groundwater availability and climatic variability on the one hand tree ring growth is influenced by a complex interaction of the temperature and precipitation fritts 1976 while climatologically the streamflow variability depends on the evapotranspiration rate which is given by water availability and temperature thus the climatic factors associated with high streamflow e g temperature and precipitation are also associated with wider tree rings koprowski et al 2018 on the other hand low water availability causes a reduction in tree growth skiadaresis et al 2021 2019 furthermore lowering the groundwater level in the area near the sea will favor saltwater intrusion in the groundwater and soil salinization with a negative effect on tree growth antonellini and mollema 2010 ran et al 2021 the spatial temporal stability of climatic signals was tested by applying the stability maps approach between the rwilw index and the gridded pp data over the period 1901 2020 the obtained results indicate a positive stable and significant correlation between our rwilw chronology and the precipitation over ukraine the republic of moldova romania and bulgaria fig 4 for the cumulative period from november previous year to july current year which represents the period for which we obtained the best spatiotemporal results this is in agreement with the previous findings indicating that an accumulation period of 9 months i e november previous year july current year is the best signal for reconstructing the streamflow variability this 9 month accumulation time can be explained also by the fact that danube s catchment area is one of the largest in europe and our samples location is situated close to the lowest border of it before danube spills into the danube delta thus integrating the streamflow variability signal throughout most of the catchment area therefore tree rings could be considered a good indicator of hydroclimatic variability because they are influenced both by groundwater availability and temperature precipitation fluctuations which are directly link to streamflow variability accordingly a period of low streamflow low groundwater level determined by lack of moisture or drought conditions which represent a limiting factor for tree growth will result in narrow tree ring width while a period of high streamflow high groundwater level determined by exceeding moisture will be reflected as wide tree rings skiadaresis et al 2019 trlin et al 2021 3 3 streamflow reconstruction taking into account all obtained correlations and the stability of the climatic signal a linear regression model 1 was used to reconstruct the streamflow variability from the ceatal izmail hydrometric station averaged over the period for november previous year to july current year novpy julcy period 1 q t r w i lwt 0 48307 3629 15625 where q is streamflow for novpy julcy period at ceatal izmail hydrometric station and the rwilw is the tree ring latewood width index of the caraorman oak chronology at t year in order to evaluate the reconstruction skills the dataset was split into two equally long periods 1922 1967 and 1968 2013 for calibration verification approach in forward and reverse mode the obtained highly positive values of re and ce table 3 for both forward and reverse models indicate a good and predictive reconstruction skill fig 5 a while the dw values near 2 indicate little to no autocorrelation all calibration verification statistics suggest that the developed linear regression model is reliable for the streamflow reconstruction and can be used to reconstruct past streamflow variability the developed reconstruction model explains 45 r2 0 45 of the danube streamflow variation at the ceatal izmail hydrometric station fig 5b based on the aforementioned linear regression model the streamflow variability was reconstructed for the 1734 2020 period fig 6 a nevertheless since the esp value exceeded the threshold of 0 85 only after 1800 the reconstruction before 1800 might be prone to larger uncertainties the novpy julcy period reconstruction of streamflow variability at the ceatal izmail hydrometric station preserves both the inter annual to inter decadal variations over the analyzed period the interannual streamflow variability analysis revealed fourteen years with extreme low values when the streamflow did not exceed 5300 m3 s 5th percentile 1741 1745 1750 1753 1773 1794 1812 1832 1843 1882 1899 1921 1964 and 1994 and fourteen years with extreme high streamflow over the 8780 m3 s 95th percentile 1770 1771 1799 1836 1838 1839 1871 1876 1877 1879 1940 1941 1997 and 2010 over the last two centuries the periods with high streamflow occurred in the following intervals 1830 1844 1869 1886 1934 1948 1961 1985 and 1994 2014 fig 6a blue shaded areas while periods with low streamflow occurred between 1856 and 1868 1949 1960 1986 1993 and from 2015 to present fig 6a red shaded areas to investigate the low frequency variability of the reconstructed streamflow chronology and compare the streamflow reconstruction over different periods we split our chronology into a 40 years window and we performed box plot statistical analyses fig 6b the median distribution of all box plots is at the same level near 7000 m3 s but the distribution is different over the period 1821 1860 the majority of the streamflow data varies between 6500 and 7500 m3 s with the lower whisker longer than the higher ones but with three upper outliners which indicate the presence of the extreme events the period 1861 1900 is characterized by a higher variability the first and third quartile ranging between 6200 and 8000 m3 s with the longest outliners for the analyzed period the period 1901 1940is slightly skewed up indicating that the majority of data are lower than the median the period 1941 1980 is normally distributed while the period 1981 2020 is characterized by a higher variability slightly skewed up and with a much longer upper whisker than the lower one indicating that during this period the lower danube streamflow was predominantly lower than the median but with some very high streamflow values 3 4 large scale atmospheric circulation since the precipitation and temperature variability variables that are contributing substantially to the variations of the danube river streamflow are mainly driven by the large scale atmospheric circulation ionita 2015 ionita et al 2012 we have tested also the relationship between the large scale atmospheric circulation and our reconstructed streamflow in order to investigate the relationship between the interannual variability of the streamflow variability and the large scale atmospheric circulation we made use of the composite maps methodology between the streamflow reconstruction and the geopotential height at 500 mb z500 wvt and sst for the cases when the streamflow was higher than the 90th percentile 8237 m3 s and lower than the 10th percentile 5545 m3 s the large scale atmospheric circulation influences tree growth indirectly by influencing the intensity duration and variability of the climatic events usually anticyclonic cyclonic circulation patterns determine dry wet climatic conditions ionita et al 2015 and therefore low high river streamflow values which contribute to slowing down favors tree growth according to our obtained results periods with high streamflow values are associated with a low pressure system over central western europe and the middle atlantic ocean and a high pressure system over greenland siberia and the northern part of africa fig 7 a this pattern favors the advection of the moist air masses from the mediterranean region toward romania fig 7c which contributes to high precipitation rates high streamflow and wider tree ring widths contrary to this low flow periods are associated with a high pressure system over central western europe and a low pressure system over the northern atlantic ocean greenland and siberia fig 7b this pattern favors the advection of dry and warm air from the east creating an area of local divergence over the south eastern part of europe fig 7d which in turn inhibits precipitation and leads to low streamflow values and narrow tree ring widths a similar association between the large scale atmospheric circulation and streamflow variability over romania including our study region was found by ionita 2015 the role of the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sst on the european hydroclimate variability has been highlighted by numerous previous studies feudale and shukla 2011 ionita et al 2017 2012 kingston et al 2012 following this line the relationship between sst variability and tree ring growth has been previously quantified in dendrochronological studies nagavciuc et al 2020 2019a roibu et al 2022b the analyses of the composite map reveal that the periods with high streamflow values are associated with negative sst anomalies over the seas around the europe continent barents sea norwegian sea baltic sea north sea celtic sea and the mediterranean sea and positive sst anomalies over the atlantic ocean opposite to this low flow years are associated with positive sst anomalies over the seas around the europe continent the barents sea norwegian sea baltic sea north sea celtic sea and the mediterranean sea and negative sst anomalies over the central and northern atlantic ocean fig 8 the observed influence of the sst variability on the wet dry periods in the lower danube is in agreement with recent studies which have emphasized that the state of the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sst has a significant influence on the hydroclimate of europe including our analyzed region feudale and shukla 2011 ionita et al 2022 2021 kingston et al 2015 3 5 implications for the river streamflow management the danube river streamflow is used in a variety of sectors from navigation and hydropower generation to agriculture industry drinking water supply recreation or environmental purposes icpdr 2021 therefore streamflow variability plays a crucial role in water resource planning and management the presented here streamflow reconstruction based on the tree ring width is important not only for dendrohydrological studies but also for long timescale analyses and evaluation of the danube water availability at multi centennial scales especially since instrumental data are rather short 50 years and insufficient to capture long scale streamflow variations necessary for developing the hydrological models and resource water planning the reconstructed streamflow chronology allows us to put the instrumental record into a long term context indicating that the periods with the lowest highest streamflow from the instrumental record are not the most extreme low high streamflow periods when contextualized into a longer term perspective for example the low streamflow periods from the 20th century were not so extreme as the low streamflow period from 1857 to 1870 on the flood side the period 1871 1884 which was characterized by extreme high streamflow values exceeds the streamflow rates periods from the observational periods in addition our reconstruction of the lower danube river streamflow suggests that overall the streamflow rates were more variable at times preceding the instrumental period implying that water management decisions are made based on relatively short and insufficient instrumental records compared with the more extensive reconstruction also the streamflow from the ceatal izmail hydrometric station is significantly correlated with other hydrometric stations from upstream of the river not shown and can play a key role in decisions making and water resource management not only at the local scale but also at the regional scale considering the climate projections indicate that the impact of climate change will aggravate water availability especially in the lower danube basin and will lead to a significant increase in water demand in the future stagl and hattermann 2015 vanham 2012 now more than ever the long term streamflow reconstruction should be integrated into developing of the future water strategy and planning measures to ensure feasible long term water management including industrial and human consumption water use and distribution and conservation of the features of the danube basin 3 6 limitation of the study tree ring width data was been proven to be an extraordinary proxy for paleoclimatic reconstruction presenting numerous advantages over other natural proxies nevertheless we need to specify a few limitations tree ring width as well as all other climate proxies contain additional noise which add uncertainty into a chronology however we combined data from a very large sample of trees in order to reduce the influence of this noise another limitation of the study is the unavailability of instrumental climate data nearby the study site and the spatial resolution of the gridded data however we used the climate data from the nearest available meteorological stations 30 km and we used grid data sets with the best combination between spatial resolution and their extended length thus avoiding short climatic time series which does not fulfil the study aim 4 conclusion this study presents an annual streamflow reconstruction from the caraorman forest lower danube region over the past 250 years based on the significant correlation between the tree ring latewood width and november july streamflow r 0 70 p 0 001 our tree ring reconstruction explains 45 of the variance of lower danube streamflow reinforcing the idea that tree rings can be also a useful proxy for streamflow and not only for precipitation and temperature since our streamflow reconstruction covers only a small area it is essential for the subsequent construction of large scale streamflow reconstructions throughout the catchment area of the danube river the performance and reliability of our tree ring based streamflow reconstruction was proved by calibration and validation of our data and by using specific statistics for the regression model over the 1931 2013 period based on our reconstruction we have identified extremely dry and wet years over the last 250 years in the lower danube over the last 250 years the wettest high streamflow periods occurred in the following intervals 1830 1844 1869 1886 1934 1948 1961 1985 and 1994 2014 opposite to this the driest intervals low flow periods occurred between 1856 1868 1949 1960 1986 1993 and from 2015 to present in general high flow years are associated with a cyclonic circulation over the central and eastern part of europe convergence over the black sea and at country level and positive negative sst anomalies in the tropical atlantic ocean and south of greenland mediterranean sea and north sea these large scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies lead to high precipitation rates and high streamflow in the lower danube low flow years are associated with significant divergence over the black sea and our analyzed region a high pressure system over the central part of europe and a cold warm tropical and central north atlantic mediterranean sea which in turn inhibit precipitation from a water management perspective we believe that this reconstruction can help water managers and stakeholders to improve their knowledge about the variability of the danube streamflow especially since streamflow observations for the lower danube are rather short 50 years or are not freely available it is important to mention that this is the first streamflow reconstruction for the lower danube helping us to put the current water issues over this region into a longer term context overall tree rings based streamflow reconstruction enables us to better understand the long term streamflow changes and possible trends which could be of high value to water managers and regional planners leading to improved support useful in the decision making process and regional planning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2352,streambed sediment and groundwater represent important stores of soluble reactive phosphorus srp in freshwater catchments yet their contributions to watershed srp loads remain unclear this study evaluates the spatio temporal variability and geochemical and hydrologic controls on porewater srp in the streambed along an agricultural reach including the influence of groundwater surface water interactions high porewater srp 1000 µg l and high available sediment bound srp were observed in low groundwater discharge zones specifically in the shallow 0 1 m streambed sediments porewater srp concentrations were linked to iron and possibly manganese redox cycling with more reducing conditions consistently coinciding with high srp porewater srp varied temporally but distinct seasonal changes across the stream reach were not observed a shallow oxic cap that may limit srp release to the stream was observed in the very shallow streambed but its presence was spatially and temporally discontinuous finally data indicate p rich shallow streambed sediments are the likely source of the observed high srp porewater concentrations in the streambed rather than incoming groundwater from the adjacent fields overall the findings highlight the complexity of srp dynamics in agricultural streambeds and provide insight into processes governing the timing and location of srp loading streams

introduction eutrophication of freshwater systems is a major global issue that can lead to harmful algal blooms and hypoxic events with negative impacts including impaired drinking and irrigation water quality fish kills and reduced biodiversity e g correll 1998 jarvie et al 2013 le moal et al 2019 a major driver of freshwater eutrophication is excess inputs of phosphorus p particularly from anthropogenic sources such as fertilizers and wastewater riemersma et al 2006 withers and jarvie 2008 although major efforts have focused on p reduction strategies over the past several decades freshwater eutrophication continues to be a major challenge one reason is because in many areas p reduction strategies have not been sufficiently effective in decreasing contemporary external p inputs stackpoole et al 2019 another reason is because of sustained inputs of p from legacy p stores these legacy p stores have accumulated in landscapes over decades and also continue to accumulate where contemporary p inputs are high haygarth et al 2014 jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2013 van meter et al 2021 legacy p stores have been suggested as a possible key factor for why some streams continue

primary forms of bioavailable p utilized by algae and aquatic plants lapworth et al 2011 the transfer of srp to stream water across the streambed sediment interface can represent inputs from two

conditions brookfield et al 2021 jarvie et al 2013 lapworth et al 2011 records et al 2016 srp in groundwater also represents an important legacy store due to the slow transport of srp along subsurface soil and groundwater pathways from the field to surface waters jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2013 while it is commonly thought that groundwater is not a dominant pathway delivering p to streams recent studies suggest that under certain geochemical conditions and or with prolonged p inputs groundwater srp transport can be important e g carlyle and hill 2001 domagalski and johnson 2011 holman

2011 many studies have reported high srp concentrations in streambed porewater which could be sourced from either groundwater or the streambed sediments themselves and thus reveal important information on the potential release of srp to streams from these legacy stores these studies have been conducted in both urban e g fitzgerald et al 2015 roy and bickerton 2014 and agricultural stream

and wetlands have been shown to be influenced by i redox conditions associated with the presence of metal fe and to a less extent mn oxides that can sequester srp under oxic conditions ii ph iii temperature and iv the presence and degradation of organic matter bai et al 2017 baken et al 2015 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 palmer felgate et al 2010 pettersson 1998 roy and bickerton 2014 several studies have performed highly detailed i e cm vertical chemical including srp fe redox sampling in shallow streambed sediments with observations suggesting the presence of an oxic cap extending down from the streambed interface burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 the oxic cap is thought to form due to the mixing of oxygen from the surface waters via diffusion or advection with more reducing groundwaters a common condition forming an fe oxide rich layer capable of sequestering srp and limiting its release to the stream burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 calculations of porewater srp fluxes to a stream have been done by jarvie et al 2008 for diffusive transport using vertical profiles of streambed srp concentration and by fitzgerald et al 2015 for advective groundwater transport using high spatial resolution streambed porewater srp concentrations and vertical profiles of streambed temperature along and across a stream reach despite these studies to date our understanding of srp concentrations in streambed porewater and the release of srp across the streambed interface is still limited in particular there is incomplete information on how srp porewater concentrations within the transition zone in streambeds vary spatially i e along a streambed and with depth and over time i e seasonally and the associated hydrological and geochemical controls for instance most field studies have used a large scale snapshot sampling design resulting in low spatial resolution sampling of porewater srp along a stream and with sampling one to two times only e g burns et al 2015 casillas ituarte et al 2019 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 roy and bickerton 2014 the high resolution spatial porewater srp sampling by fitzgerald et al 2015 had minimal detail on variation with depth or seasonal patterns likewise the small scale field studies that have shown the presence of an oxic cap typically used only one to three samplers over a single sampling period burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 palmer felgate et al 2010 thus additional information is needed to better understand when and where srp release across the streambed sediment interface is more likely to be important considering different land uses e g urban vs agricultural stream hydrogeological conditions seasons and climates for example it is currently unclear if the oxic cap which may limit porewater srp release to a stream is spatially continuous and if it persists over time as geochemical and hydrological conditions change furthermore studies conducted in an urban stream i e fitzgerald et al 2015 may not represent well the streambed p stores and geochemical conditions of an agricultural stream these limitations indicate the need for further field based investigations that include higher resolution sampling of streambed porewater across all seasons and different stream areas e g riffle pool combinations to more clearly understand the temporal and spatial variability in streambed porewater srp and its potential release to the overlying stream the objective of this study was to investigate the spatio temporal variability in streambed porewater srp along a 40 m agricultural stream reach in the lake erie basin ontario canada over one year and the potential hydrological and geochemical controls on it in particular the study addresses whether high porewater srp observed in the streambed may originate from i groundwater discharging through the streambed ii the streambed sediments themselves or iii the surface water via hyporheic exchange spatial temporal variability in the presence of an oxic cap is also examined due to its potential to limit srp release across the streambed interface the findings of this study can provide insight into the potential including when and where for groundwater surface water interactions to deliver srp from groundwater and streambed sediments to the overlying stream as needed to improve watershed p monitoring programs and models that aim to predict p loads to downstream surface waters 2 study site the study was conducted in an agricultural

permanently installed samplers either multilevel samplers mls or dedicated tip samplers dts or were collected using peepers which are a passive diffusion based sampling device the locations of these porewater sampling devices are shown in fig 1c samples were collected approximately monthly over the study period except for the peepers which were deployed in the streambed for 4 5 weeks over three periods july 2020 september 2020 october 2020 november 2020 and december 2020 january 2021 eight mls between 1 2 and 1 5 m in length were installed along the centerline of the stream in zone 2 fig 1c all mls were constructed of three channel polyethylene tubing with sampling ports consisting of 0 1 m long slotted screens cut into the tubing located at depths of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m below the

five 10 ml chambers spaced 0 05 m apart thus providing high vertical resolution data of streambed porewater quality peepers were installed such that the top chamber was exposed to the stream water and the remaining chambers were below the streambed surface reaching up to 0 2 m in depth before deploying in the field the peeper chambers were filled with degassed megapure water double distilled and covered with a dialysis membrane peepers were stored in a closed bucket filled with degassed water for transport from the laboratory to the field for installation upon removal from the streambed water

intervals and ranges differences between these sampling devices may also potentially influence the water chemistry results first the samplers disproportionately extract porewater across a larger volume and from larger pores rather than smaller pores while the peepers equilibrate via diffusion with all of the porewater small and large pores directly adjacent the sampling well fitzgerald et al 2015 second the sampler collection is a point in time measurement whereas the peepers give an integration of porewater concentrations over the span of the four to five week emplacement period but with recency bias finally the sampler and peeper pairs were not installed in the exact same location and so differences in concentrations may also result from small scale variability in the porewater chemistry all water samples were immediately filtered in the field using 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters samples were collected in 30 ml and 15 ml hdpe bottles with the sample for metal analysis acidified using concentrated 15 6 m nitric acid duplicate stream water samples were collected for some sampling events but no duplicate porewater samples were collected most mls and the peepers provided limited sample volume sample bottles were stored in a cooler with ice packs while in the field and during transportation to the laboratory at western university additionally a handheld multiparameter probe either hach hq40d portable multi parameter meter or ysi 650 multiparameter meter was used in the field to measure temperature ec ph and orp of the stream and porewater from well flowing mls and dts samplers 3 1 3 streambed sediment samples intact streambed sediment cores were collected at the end of the study period in june 2021 using a 0 06 m diameter 0 35 m long manual sediment corer cores were collected within 0 15 m of mls and dts locations along the center of the stream five locations to collect sediment to 0 4 m depth below the streambed surface multiple intact cores were taken from the same hole upon removal cores were immediately wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in a cooler for transport back to the laboratory cores were then stored in a cold room between 5 and 7 c until subsampling and chemical analyses 3 2 chemical analyses and classification 3 2 1 water sample analyses water samples were analyzed for srp and if there was sufficient volume for one or more of ammonium anions and specific metals when possible samples were analyzed for srp within 48 h of collection otherwise they were frozen along with all other samples and then re thawed and acidified before analysis srp was analyzed using a flow injection analysis fia instrument quikchem 8500 series 2 anions chloride nitrate sulphate were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc instruments thermo scientific dionex aquion ion chromatography system and waters 432 conductivity detector dissolved fe mn and al concentrations were determined using a flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas instrument 141 agilent 200 series vga 77 ammonium samples were shipped frozen to the canada centre for inland waters burlington on for analysis using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer at 640 nm beckman coulter du 720 uv vis spectrophotometer for all sample analyses qa qc measures were implemented including standard dilutions included on every sample run and duplicate standards and duplicate samples run after every 5 10 samples 3 2 2 sediment sample analyses p sediment extractions were conducted using sediment subsamples 10 35 g taken from depths of 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m below the streambed surface for the five sediment cores the subsamples were homogenized and then dried at 105 c for 24 h dried samples were analyzed using a sequential extraction method adapted from hedley stewart chauhan 1982 for each sample 2 g of sediment was placed in a bottle and exposed sequentially to the following extractant chemicals 1 deionized water 2 0 5 m nahco3 3 0 1 m naoh and 4 1 m hcl p fractions extracted from each of these steps are operationally defined based on the extractant used but hereafter are nominally ascribed to 1 labile p 2 loosely bound p 3 reducible labile p and 4 residual p includes srp associated with calcium carbonates and phosphate minerals such as apatite hedley et al 1982 the modified hedley method is one of the most widely used methods for characterization of available p in soil and sediment samples gu et al 2020 however caution is required in interpreting the results as discrete p forms e g fe bound ca bound are not precisely quantified by the different steps klotzbücher et al 2019 this limitation is considered in our interpretation of the data for each step of the extraction sediments and extractant were left on a shaker table for 16 h centrifuged for 20 min filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter and then analyzed for srp duplicate extracted water samples were analyzed for qa qc sediment subsampled from the same locations as those exposed to sequential extraction were also analyzed for organic matter content using a loss on ignition test heiri et al 2001 after drying at 105 c for 24 h subsamples 10 35 g were weighed and then dried at 550 c for 4 h samples were then weighed again to determine the mass of organic matter that had been lost 3 2 3 identification of dominant redox processes the redox processes dominating in the streambed porewater at the study site were identified based on the framework developed by mcmahon chapelle 2008 this framework compares the measured porewater concentrations of o2 no3 n mn fe and so4 at a given location and time against set thresholds of these concentrations to distinguish eight different redox conditions oxic suboxic no3 reducing no3 mn transition mn iv reducing fe iii so4 reducing methanogenesis mixed sm table s3 the threshold concentration values applied in our study are based on recommendations from mcmahon chapelle but those for no3 n mn and fe were modified slightly with consideration to specific conditions at our study site following the recommendation of mcmahon chapelle 2008 as o2 measurements in this study were not made or were not sufficiently accurate around the typical threshold value 0 5 mg l the o2 criteria could not be applied as such porewater under oxic suboxic and no3 reduction conditions i e mn and fe concentrations below their thresholds could not be separately distinguished and so are classified in our analysis as less reducing for samples that otherwise met the criteria for mn no3 transition mn iv reducing fe iii so4 reducing and methanogenesis which together can be considered more reducing o2 was assumed negligible 0 5 mg l and as such these conditions could be distinguished finally conditions were classified as mixed when both no3 n and fe concentrations were greater than their threshold values mixed conditions indicate mixing of waters of different redox conditions likely due to sampling water across spatial gradients or influenced by porewater extracted from both large and small pore spaces 4 results and discussion given the multiple and potentially interrelated factors that may influence streambed porewater srp concentrations the spatial and temporal patterns for srp are first presented with limited discussion of the factors contributing to the observed variability following this the possible contributing factors including the distribution of solid phase p in the streambed redox geochemistry and hydrological influences are explored finally the potential role of groundwater surface water interactions in increasing srp concentrations in the overlying stream at the study site is discussed 4 1 general stream conditions stream discharge from manual measurements varied from 0 01 to 0 32 m3 s over the study period with base flows highest during the spring melt stage 0 3 m march 2021 and lowest stage 0 2 m in the fall 2020 and early summer 2021 and with peaks in stage associated with rain and major melt events sm fig s2 considering the 11 sampling times during the main study period the median surface water srp concentration was 33 µg l interquartile range iqr 29 µg l n 18 with the srp concentrations higher in the summer compared to other seasons sm table s4 agricultural tile drains along the reach only discharged water to the stream during four of the eleven sampling times and only during summer 2020 and spring 2021 the median srp concentration of the discharging tile drain water was 67 µg l iqr 43 µg l n 4 the streambed topography elevation was fairly stable over the study period with changes in the elevation typically 7 cm across the study reach but reaching approximately 15 cm at one location associated with a temporary buildup of woody debris 4 2 variations in porewater srp concentrations 4 2 1 variation between zones porewater srp concentrations from the mls and dts termed samplers here representing extracted porewater along the centerline of the stream show distinct variation along the reach table 1 for the higher permeability high groundwater discharge areas of the study reach i e zones 1 and 3 porewater srp concentrations from the samplers were typically low with median values 12 µg l and 29 µg l for zone 1 and 3 respectively below the eutrophic threshold of 30 µg l canadian council of ministers of the environment 2004 and the median surface water concentration of 33 µg l n 18 the concentrations were about twice as high in zone 3 than found in zone 1 and more variable over time with the maximum concentration in zone 3 294 µg l considerably higher than the maximum concentration observed in zone 1 46 µg l while only one location was monitored in each of zone 1 and zone 3 the preliminary data collected in 2019 using temporary samplers showed porewater srp concentrations were consistently below the eutrophic threshold at multiple locations and depths in both zones sm fig s3 the sampler porewater srp concentrations for the lower permeability low groundwater discharge area zone 2 were generally higher and more variable compared to zones 1 and 3 with approximately 30 of samples above the threshold for hypereutrophic conditions 100 µg l canadian council of ministers of the environment 2004 and 4 of samples 1000 µg l herein the following levels are adopted in describing the magnitude of porewater srp concentrations very low 10 µg l low between 10 and 30 µg l eutrophic threshold 30 µg l and median surface water concentration 33 µg l moderate between 30 and 100 µg l high between 100 and 1000 µg l hypereutrophic threshold 100 µg l and very high 1000 µg l this difference between the high and low permeability groundwater discharge zones was also observed in the porewater data from the peepers chambers within the sediments representing equilibrium porewater with srp concentrations lower and less variable in zone 3 median 83 µg l iqr 106 µg l n 12 than zone 2 median 260 µg l iqr 438 µg l n 89 generally the peeper concentrations were higher than those of the samplers in the same area which may be due to the influence of higher srp concentrations within some smaller pores for the equilibrium based peeper samples further explanation on possible reasons for the differences between the sampler and peeper concentrations is provided in section 3 1 2 the range of porewater srp concentrations observed across this study reach fall within the ranges reported for other studies on agricultural streams e g burns et al 2015 casillas ituarte et al 2019 jarvie et al 2008 a common finding of these other studies which is supported here by the large differences in srp concentrations observed between the three zones of this study is that srp porewater concentrations in agriculture streams can be highly variable at small scales 10 m our data suggest potential links between this variability and the physical heterogeneity of the streambed sediments or differences in the groundwater stream interactions discussed in further detail in sections below 4 2 2 variation with depth and time srp concentrations for the samplers dts in zone 1 were relatively uniform with depth and showed limited variability over the sampling period i e iqr 4 µg l for all data see sm figs s7 and s11 with only one outlier sample 46 µg l at 10 m 0 1 m depth in september a similar depth pattern was observed in preliminary data for zone 1 sm fig s3 however in zone 2 and zone 3 srp concentrations varied with depth and changed over time though the observed spatial and temporal patterns differed between specific sampler locations for example data from the samplers dts in zone 3 showed that srp concentrations increased to 100 µg l from july to november 2020 at 0 1 m depth below the streambed and at the 0 4 m depth in october 2020 but were low 30 µg l six sampling times and moderate between 30 and 100 µg l one sampling time for all other sampling depths and dates sm figs s3 and s8 although the peeper results for zone 3 provide less temporal detail compared to the sampler data the data are consistent with this pattern with higher srp concentrations observed in september and november compared to january sm fig s19a c the sampler porewater srp concentration data in zone 2 centerline fig 2 reveals a notable spatial pattern with high to very high srp concentrations 200 µg l up to 1980 µg l generally restricted to shallow depths below the streambed 0 1 m depth median 261 µg l iqr 490 µg l n 83 depths of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m median 39 µg l iqr 36 µg l n 224 a similar pattern was observed in the preliminary data sm fig s3 the exception to this pattern was at the location x 21 m where only moderate srp concentrations were observed at shallow depth at all other locations in zone 2 the concentrations at 0 1 m depth varied between sampling times sometimes being moderate to low 100 µg l or changing by many 100 s of µg l between sampling times no clear temporal including seasonal pattern is apparent considering all sampler data for zone 2 the srp depth pattern was also not observed for all sampling times with some samples at depths of 0 2 0 4 m with high srp concentrations up to 100 416 µg l fig 2 the greater vertical resolution 0 05 m increments of the peepers deployed along the centerline of zone 2 provided additional information about the srp distribution within the shallow sediments 0 0 25 m depths fig 3 a c similar to the sampler data srp concentrations were generally very high and high within these shallow sediments at all locations with the exception of the location x 21 m where the concentrations were low in november and january 35 µg l the porewater srp concentrations just below the streambed surface i e depths 0 0 1 m indicate a temporal change from higher concentrations i e 500 µg l maximum 1080 µg l observed in the late summer fig 3a to lower concentrations 50 µg l in the fall and or winter x 21 23 25 27 m on 5 november x 24 25 5 m on 16 january with concentrations remaining consistently very high and high at greater depth fig 3b c a few of the locations exhibiting the temporal change e g x 21 m in november and january x 20 and 22 m in january fig 3 experienced small changes in streambed topography and so the top most buried peeper chamber of each was partially exposed to stream water for part of the deployment period which could explain the lower srp concentrations at those points though not the overall pattern given the limited sampling and long deployment of the peepers one 5 week period in each of three seasons it cannot be determined if the observed temporal change represents a seasonal pattern prior studies have attributed the low porewater srp concentrations close to the streambed surface with increasing concentrations below to the presence of an oxic cap burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 this could explain the srp distributions observed with the peepers this is explored further in section 4 4 importantly in contrast to prior studies our peeper results show that srp concentrations are not always lower close to the streambed surface and this may have important implications for srp release to the overlying surface water discussed further in section 4 5 4 2 3 variation across the stream while the field sampling design focused on porewater srp concentrations along the centerline of the stream additional samples were also taken from closer to the banks of the stream in zone 2 over the study period fig 1c dts depths of 0 1 and 0 3 m and peepers from the east and west sides of the stream respectively both showed that porewater srp concentrations were also high close to the banks dts median 130 µg l iqr 714 µg l maximum 1911 µg l n 48 peepers median 288 µg l iqr 442 µg l maximum 1150 n 21 sm tables s5 and 7 however in contrast to the centre of the stream there were no clear depth or temporal patterns observed sm table s6 this difference between center versus side of the stream could be due to streambed heterogeneities including a greater depth of high p sediment or organic matter content or differences in the groundwater flow paths e g more horizontal flow at the sides of the stream 4 3 streambed sediment p the abundance and availability of srp bound to the streambed sediment and the sediment organic matter content were measured for sediment samples from zones 1 3 to evaluate whether the streambed sediments themselves could be the source of the high porewater srp observed and to provide insight into the observed spatial variations in porewater srp the total extractable p concentrations for the streambed sediments the sum of the four different fractions ranged from 302 to 1117 mg kg this is similar to measurements for sediments of agricultural streams reported by casillas ituarte et al 2019 20 cores average 920 mg kg and palmer felgate et al 2009 seven stream sites 155 2678 mg kg on average the labile h2o srp loosely bound nahco3 srp reducible labile naoh srp and tightly bound hcl srp fractions accounted for 1 5 5 and nearly 90 of the total extractable p respectively sm fig s20 it should be noted that the sequential extractions were performed on dry rather than wet fresh sediments while this may have slightly altered the measured fractions particularly the labile and loosely bound nahco3 fractions condron and newman 2011 simpson et al 2019 it is expected that the overall relative magnitude of p extracted in the different steps and thus the spatial patterns would be the same similar results have been reported by previous studies for instance casillas ituarte et al 2019 and lewandowski nützmann 2010 similarly found that the labile h2o srp accounted for a small fraction of the total extractable p 1 while other studies used slightly different extraction methods and therefore the results from the other individual extraction steps cannot be directly compared casillas ituarte et al 2019 found that the recalcitrant tightly bound p fraction determined using combusted sediment digestion with 15 7 m hno3 accounted for up to 90 of total extractable p 57 on average considering that the relatively stable and tightly bound hcl srp fraction is unlikely to be released under naturally occurring conditions lewandowski and nützmann 2010 it has been excluded from the plot of the sediment srp extraction results in fig 4 a the om content of the streambed sediment was relatively low 1 6 fig 4b compared to results for some other agricultural streams often 5 16 casillas ituarte et al 2019 palmer felgate et al 2009 however similar to prior previous studies e g casillas ituarte et al 2019 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 palmer felgate et al 2009 the om content was positively correlated with the more available fractions of sediment srp here this includes h2o srp pearson correlation r 0 79 p value 0 05 nahco3 srp r 0 89 p value 0 05 and naoh srp r 0 82 p value 0 05 while the hcl srp was not significantly correlated r 0 31 p value 0 16 the correlation between the available sediment bound srp and om is shown in fig 4c which suggests that the former is partially associated with om mineralization the available sediment bound srp and om content fig 4 displayed similar overall spatial patterns to those observed in the porewater srp data for instance the available srp sediment concentrations were lowest averaging 3 mg kg in zone 1 x 10 m fig 4a where porewater srp concentrations were consistently low table 1 within zone 2 the sediment collected at the x 21 m location had relatively low available srp sediment concentrations mean 12 mg kg compared to the other samples in zone 2 fig 4a likewise porewater srp was lower at the 21 m location compared to other locations of zone 2 fig 2 at the other two sediment sample locations in zone 2 x 24 m and x 26 m fig 4a the highest values for available srp fractions and om generally occurred at shallower depths 0 0 2 m but especially at the 0 1 m depth where the highest srp porewater concentrations were found by the samplers especially compared to 0 3 0 4 m depths fig 2 a similar om and sediment p pattern with depth i e higher values at shallow depth was reported for a sediment profile of an oxbow lake lewandowski nützmann 2010 importantly the matching spatial patterns of the srp sediment and porewater data suggest that the availability of p sourced from the sediments may play a controlling role in the observed variability of the porewater srp concentrations further it is possible that mineralization of organic rich sediment materials could be the source of the high porewater srp concentrations in zone 2 it is unclear what causes localized high organic rich sediment materials in the shallow streambed sediments but possible reasons could be localized deposition and burial of vegetation including aquatic plants in the streambed possibly impacted by the periodic dredging of this agricultural stream reach the relationship between the porewater srp patterns and available sediment bound srp and om are not clear for zone 3 while the available srp sediment concentrations and om were relatively high but still decreased with depth fig 4 the porewater srp concentrations were typically 50 µg l with the exception of a few sampling times and locations e g srp concentration of 550 µg l observed in peeper chamber just below the sediment surface sm fig s19b this may be evidence of high sediment bound srp that is not typically released to the porewater except only at times when the geochemical conditions are favourable i e when reducing conditions occur as discussed further in section 4 4 4 4 geochemical conditions and influencing hydrology 4 4 1 porewater redox conditions a summary of the inferred dominating redox processes associated with the observed porewater srp concentrations is shown for the samplers in fig 5 with similar findings for the peepers given in sm table s10 the dominating redox processes were inferred from streambed porewater chemistry data dissolved no3 n mn fe so4 evaluated against specified redox criteria based on the framework developed by mcmahon chapelle 2008 sm table s3 from fig 5 it can be seen that low to moderate srp concentrations 50 µg l were found for samples under less reducing conditions i e oxic suboxic or no3 reduction as well as no3 mn transition conditions n 84 this is expected as these conditions favour retention of srp by adsorption to fe and mn oxides e g baken et al 2015 bol et al 2018 dolph et al 2019 jarvie et al 2008 in contrast higher and more variable concentrations of porewater srp were observed under more reducing conditions including mn iv and fe iii so4 reduction and methanogenesis at which fe iii so4 reduction would be at or near completion which favour fe and mn oxide dissolution and the release of any adsorbed or co precipitated p importantly all samples with high srp concentrations 100 µg l n 203 were under more reducing or mixed an indication of mixing of less reducing and more reducing waters conditions except for two outlier samples a similar srp redox relationship was reported by roy bickerton 2014 who applied the same framework to porewaters of several urban streams indeed many prior studies have found srp retention and release in streambeds to be closely linked to fe redox conditions e g lewandowski and nützmann 2010 including being implicated in the formation of the oxic cap e g jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 the controlling influence of the redox conditions close to the streambed surface may explain some of the observed spatial patterns in porewater srp within the study reach zones and over time this is examined in the following sections with the discussion separated into areas with predominantly less reducing conditions zones 1 and 3 and the x 21 m location in zone 2 and areas with predominantly more reducing conditions zone 2 except x 21 m location the possible influences of hydrological flow changes on the redox conditions are also explored with these changes inferred based on physical measurements by robinson et al 2022 table 1 combined with porewater concentration data for constituents that have different endmember concentrations in the stream versus the groundwater moving through the streambed sediments e g cl no3 n and so4 4 4 2 areas of predominantly less reducing conditions zones 1 and 3 typically had low srp concentrations and were predominantly under less reducing conditions table 1 sm fig s21 the same applies to x 21 m location of zone 2 fig 6 data for all sampling times provided in sm fig s21 thus redox conditions may have been favourable for srp to be sequestered to the sediments in these areas thus resulting in low porewater srp concentrations however as zone 1 10 m location and the 21 m location also had low available sediment bound srp fig 4a it is uncertain if a low srp source i e upwelling groundwater with low srp or the redox conditions i e less reducing conditions favouring srp sequestration was the dominant control in these locations sediment srp and om content were higher for zone 3 fig 4 suggesting redox was the primary control for the low porewater srp concentrations observed here further when the redox conditions changed to more reducing from july to october 2020 for the samplers in zone 3 there was a coincident increase in porewater srp concentrations particularly 0 1 m depth fig 7 though the temporal coverage was limited the peepers also showed reducing conditions and high srp concentrations in the fall of 2020 sept and nov compared to less reducing and low srp concentrations in winter 2021 jan sm figs s19and s22 these coincident changes further support the controlling influence of redox conditions in zone 3 the physical evidence including temperature and vertical hydraulic gradient measurements suggests that zones 1 and 3 experienced predominantly high groundwater discharge table 1 this is supported by observations that both zones typically exhibit consistent porewater concentrations with depth for cl high no3 n and high so4 sm fig s15 s7 though they change temporally similar chemical trends were seen for location x 21 m suggesting this location may also be a localized area of groundwater discharge these patterns suggest that the source groundwater is less reducing and its strong upwelling may have prevented development of more reducing conditions via contact with organic rich stream sediments especially zone 3 with higher om fig 4b an exception occurred in the fall of 2020 when higher srp and more reducing conditions were observed in zone 3 fig 7 and to a lesser extent at location x 21 m fig 6 during this period porewater cl and no3 n concentrations changed markedly in all three areas zones 1 and 3 location x 21 m towards values more similar to surface water concentrations cl increased from 10 mg l to around 20 mg l no3 n declined from an average of 61 mg l to 6 mg l figures s24 s26 these chemistry changes indicate that a temporary change in flow patterns may have occurred during the fall as in kaufman et al 2017 away from strong upwelling to more horizontal hyporheic flow or low downwelling conditions it is possible this could have been caused by a change in gradient between the aquifer and stream or a change in the streambed topography at zone 3 and location 21 m the data indicate either the new pathway brought water under more reducing conditions or the flow change allowed more reducing conditions to develop noting higher om and available sediment bound srp for zone 3 especially fig 4 no concurrent redox change was noted for zone 1 fig s21 possibly because of its very high permeability or low om content 4 4 3 areas of predominantly more reducing conditions the porewater within zone 2 aside from location x 21 m discussed above was generally and consistently more reducing over the study period e g sampler data in fig 6 for two sampling times with data for all sampling times provided in sm fig s21 sm table s10 this excludes the shallow oxic cap which is discussed in section 4 4 4 in zone 2 the streambed sediment is finer and there was minimal groundwater upwelling and possible surface water downwelling table 1 these groundwater stream interaction conditions and low permeability are expected to result in long porewater residence times whether for groundwater pathways from the adjacent fields or hyporheic flows this would allow more time for interactions between the organic rich streambed sediment and porewater and thus for reducing conditions to develop the more reducing conditions at the greater depths e g 0 4 m suggests any incoming groundwater to this zone may already be under more reducing conditions these more reducing conditions are favorable for srp to be released from sediments to the porewater or for incoming srp to remain mobile consistent with this very high and high porewater srpconcentrations were observed at shallow 0 1 m depths along the centerline in zone 2 figs 2 and 6 importantly however the srp concentrations were much lower at greater depths 0 2 0 4 m at these same locations despite the more reducing conditions fig 6 these findings suggest that the reducing conditions are leading to very high and high porewater srp concentrations where available sediment bound p is high i e in the shallow sediments along the stream centerline fig 4 but also probably to greater depth along the side of the stream given higher porewater srp at depth there sm table s6 thus both the availability of sediment bound p and redox conditions are important controls the low to moderate porewater srp concentrations at depth despite reducing conditions suggests any incoming groundwater to zone 2 has low to moderate srp concentrations depth 0 4 m median 35 µg l iqr 29 µg l n 71 this is supported by the preliminary porewater sampling which showed that porewater srp concentrations at depths of 0 5 0 9 m below the streambed in all zones were consistently low and less than the stream srp concentration median 11 µg l iqr 13 µg l 10 locations in zones 1 2 and 3 sm fig s3 this suggests that groundwater from the surrounding fields was likely not the major source of the very high and high porewater srp observed in the shallow streambed rather the availability of sediment bound p including that from the deposition and burial of organic matter is likely the source of the very high and high porewater srp concentrations 4 4 4 changes in the oxic cap the srp and redox data indicate that the oxic cap which prior studies indicate may regulate srp release from the streambed to the overlying stream burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 may be discontinuous in space and time considering the three peeper sampling times the conditions within the top 0 15 m of the streambed shifted from a dominance of more reducing conditions mn iv or fe iii so4 reducing in september fig 3d to increasingly more prevalent less reducing more oxic conditions in november and january fig 3e f this redox change was concurrent with a decrease in srp concentrations at shallow depth fig 3a c and may have been due to srp sequestering to fe and potentially mn oxide minerals that precipitated within the oxic cap for the peepers in zone 2 porewater concentrations of cl no3 n and so4 within the shallowest sediments 0 15 m increased and reached concentrations similar in magnitude to those observed in peeper chambers above the sediment surface representing the stream water in january fig 3 this apparent surface water influence in the shallow sediments could result from diffusion into the sediment with reduced to minimal groundwater upwelling as reported by jarvie et al 2008 or from surface water downwelling the latter condition is supported by the porewater cl spatial patterns which suggest the stream water higher cl than the incoming groundwater as represented by location 21 m is reaching deeper into the sediments than the apparent depth of the oxic cap represented by less reducing conditions as such the data indicate that groundwater surface water interactions played a role in the transient development of the oxic cap equally important are the conditions that may have caused the elimination of the oxic cap as appears to be the case for the centerline of the stream in september fig 3 it is possible that over this period upwelling conditions as supported by low cl no3 n and so4 concentrations in the shallow streambed fig 3g and j could have forced the reducing zone upwards potentially all the way to the streambed surface the apparent lack of an oxic cap was also seen for all three sampling periods for the peepers at the side of the stream sm fig s23 noting that groundwater discharge is often greater near the banks than middle of a stream winter et al 1998 the potential for upwelling conditions to eliminate the oxic cap is important because these conditions may be favourable for srp release from the streambed to the overlying stream 4 4 5 aluminum aluminum al which is not redox controlled is also known to affect srp retention and release in streambeds as al oxides can retain srp lijklema 1980 records et al 2016 however the porewater dissolved al concentrations were generally low 1 mg l median 0 3 mg l iqr 0 4 mg l maximum 6 mg l n 295 sm fig s14 with limited spatial or temporal variability across the stream reach for all sampling times as such al is not expected to be an important factor in srp retention or release at this study site 4 5 porewater srp contributions to the stream mass flux of srp from the streambed sediment porewaters to the overlying stream water may occur via diffusion if porewater concentrations are greater than those of the stream or by advection with groundwater discharge for this stream reach the srp mass flux from zone 1 was likely low despite predominant high groundwater discharge conditions due to the low porewater srp concentrations as observed in the sampler data as well as in the preliminary sampling data table 1 sm figs s3 and s7 as the porewater srp was typically similar to or less than the surface water srp concentrations in zone 1 it is not expected that this mass flux would increase stream srp concentrations similar conditions existed for zone 3 for many sampling times through the study period sm fig s8 as well as for other locations in this zone that were targeted during the preliminary sampling sm fig s3 zone 3 did experience times of high porewater srp concentrations 100 µg l sm fig s3 though these coincided with times of inferred surface water downwelling which would also limit the srp mass flux to the stream however it is possible there could be a strong pulse of this high srp porewater to the stream upon the transition back to discharging conditions not monitored adding srp mass and raising the stream srp concentration neglecting other instream srp sinks porewater srp concentrations near the streambed surface were typically much higher in zone 2 than the average stream concentrations but the srp release to the stream would have been limited because any upwelling groundwater flux here was likely small with potentially diffusion transport dominating regardless due to the high porewater srp concentrations in this zone any transfer of srp would tend to raise the stream concentration though only fractionally over this small reach it is possible that srp mass flux to the stream from zone 2 could have been greater in summer compared to fall and early winter as the temporary development of an oxic cap in fall and early winter would have restricted srp release to the stream potentially higher srp release to the stream during summer compared to other seasons is important because groundwater inputs may be the dominant water source in some streams during summer base flow conditions when ecological sensitivity to eutrophication is highest stamm et al 2014 upscaling the findings from this short study reach these influences of srp transfer to stream water across the streambed interface may add up and be important in regulating watershed srp loading 5 conclusions this study assessed the spatio temporal variability and geochemical and hydrologic controls on porewater srp in the streambed along a 40 m agricultural stream reach including the potential influence of groundwater surface water interactions high spatial variations in porewater srp concentrations ranging from 8 to 1981 µg l were seen along the stream across the stream and with depth at scales of m to cm approximately monthly porewater sampling conducted over one year indicated some temporal seasonal patterns which were largely limited to the shallow sediments 0 1 m depth these spatial and temporal differences were influenced by the streambed composition redox conditions and the water flux direction very high 1000 µg l and high 100 1000 µg porewater srp concentrations were typically found in shallow streambed experiencing more reducing geochemical conditions whereas low concentrations occurred in areas with less reducing conditions and deeper sediments under more reducing conditions areas of strong groundwater discharge zones 1 and at most times 3 had generally low srp concentrations 30 µg l and less reducing conditions with moderate srp concentrations between 30 and 100 µg l observed at few times and locations porewater at depths 0 5 m below the streambed consistently had low srp concentrations in all zones 30 µg l suggesting groundwater from the surrounding fields was not a source of the high and very high porewater srp observed in the shallow streambed rather shallow streambed sediments with high available sediment bound srp are the likely source of the high srp porewater concentrations high available srp sediment concentrations were positively correlated to sediment om content suggesting that om mineralization may supply some or all of this sediment bound srp shallow streambed sediments that experienced a change in redox state e g less to more reducing showed a corresponding change in porewater srp concentration low to high and very high which clearly illustrates the role of fe cycling and potentially also mn cycling on srp retention and release in the streambed sediments spatially detailed vertical porewater profiles also revealed the presence of an oxic cap below the streambed interface which can potentially limit srp flux to the overlying stream as proposed by jarvie et al 2008 however observations at our site also showed that this oxic cap is spatially and temporally discontinuous and therefore srp transfer from the streambed to stream may be greater at certain times of the year the spatial and temporal changes in redox conditions noted above were associated with changes in the direction of groundwater surface water flow i e upwelling vs downwelling conditions which shows its importance as a hydrologic control on srp retention and release in the streambed these changing hydrologic conditions are also likely to affect the mass flux of srp from the streambed to the stream via diffusion or advection and potentially the stream srp concentration though the influence is complicated by the other factors for example increasing groundwater discharge will typically increase srp mass flux to the stream including by eliminating or limiting the oxic cap unless it also causes a change from more reducing to less reducing conditions overall this study provides important new insights into srp dynamics near the groundwater stream interface as needed to better understand the factors that may promote release of legacy p from groundwater and streambed sediments to streams this understanding may help to inform watershed p modeling and management efforts in agricultural areas credit authorship contribution

2352,streambed sediment and groundwater represent important stores of soluble reactive phosphorus srp in freshwater catchments yet their contributions to watershed srp loads remain unclear this study evaluates the spatio temporal variability and geochemical and hydrologic controls on porewater srp in the streambed along an agricultural reach including the influence of groundwater surface water interactions high porewater srp 1000 µg l and high available sediment bound srp were observed in low groundwater discharge zones specifically in the shallow 0 1 m streambed sediments porewater srp concentrations were linked to iron and possibly manganese redox cycling with more reducing conditions consistently coinciding with high srp porewater srp varied temporally but distinct seasonal changes across the stream reach were not observed a shallow oxic cap that may limit srp release to the stream was observed in the very shallow streambed but its presence was spatially and temporally discontinuous finally data indicate p rich shallow streambed sediments are the likely source of the observed high srp porewater concentrations in the streambed rather than incoming groundwater from the adjacent fields overall the findings highlight the complexity of srp dynamics in agricultural streambeds and provide insight into processes governing the timing and location of srp loading streams

introduction eutrophication of freshwater systems is a major global issue that can lead to harmful algal blooms and hypoxic events with negative impacts including impaired drinking and irrigation water quality fish kills and reduced biodiversity e g correll 1998 jarvie et al 2013 le moal et al 2019 a major driver of freshwater eutrophication is excess inputs of phosphorus p particularly from anthropogenic sources such as fertilizers and wastewater riemersma et al 2006 withers and jarvie 2008 although major efforts have focused on p reduction strategies over the past several decades freshwater eutrophication continues to be a major challenge one reason is because in many areas p reduction strategies have not been sufficiently effective in decreasing contemporary external p inputs stackpoole et al 2019 another reason is because of sustained inputs of p from legacy p stores these legacy p stores have accumulated in landscapes over decades and also continue to accumulate where contemporary p inputs are high haygarth et al 2014 jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2013 van meter et al 2021 legacy p stores have been suggested as a possible key factor for why some streams continue to have increasing loads of soluble reactive p srp inorganic soluble p while total p tp inputs have declined baker et al 2019 bol et al 2018 jarvie et al 2017 van meter et al 2021 srp represents the primary forms of bioavailable p utilized by algae and aquatic plants lapworth et al 2011 the transfer of srp to stream water across the streambed sediment interface can represent inputs from two important legacy stores streambed sediments and groundwater systems agricultural streambed sediments have a long history of p exposure and can accumulate large amounts of p through deposition of p rich sediment organic matter deposition and adsorption and precipitation of p onto streambed sediment casillas ituarte et al 2019 jarvie et al 2013 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 orihel et al 2017 palmer felgate et al 2009 sharpley et al 2013 these streambed sediment stores can release srp to streams when the storage capacity is reached or in response to changing hydrological or geochemical conditions brookfield et al 2021 jarvie et al 2013 lapworth et al 2011 records et al 2016 srp in groundwater also represents an important legacy store due to the slow transport of srp along subsurface soil and groundwater pathways from the field to surface waters jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2013 while it is commonly thought that groundwater is not a dominant pathway delivering p to streams recent studies suggest that under certain geochemical conditions and or with prolonged p inputs groundwater srp transport can be important e g carlyle and hill 2001 domagalski and johnson 2011 holman et al 2010 lewandowski et al 2015 vadas et al 2007 the transfer of srp to a stream across the streambed interface from streambed sediments or groundwater pathways is influenced by the nature of the sediments i e mineralogy organic matter content the biogeochemical conditions within the transition zone volume beneath and adjacent to the stream where sediment conditions transition from a purely groundwater dominated system and by groundwater surface water interactions groundwater discharge diffusion and hyporheic exchange binley et al 2013 conant et al 2019 jarvie et al 2013 lapworth et al 2011 many studies have reported high srp concentrations in streambed porewater which could be sourced from either groundwater or the streambed sediments themselves and thus reveal important information on the potential release of srp to streams from these legacy stores these studies have been conducted in both urban e g fitzgerald et al 2015 roy and bickerton 2014 and agricultural stream reaches e g burns et al 2015 casillas ituarte et al 2019 jarvie et al 2008 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 palmer felgate et al 2009 srp porewater concentrations in streambeds as well as in lake beds and wetlands have been shown to be influenced by i redox conditions associated with the presence of metal fe and to a less extent mn oxides that can sequester srp under oxic conditions ii ph iii temperature and iv the presence and degradation of organic matter bai et al 2017 baken et al 2015 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 palmer felgate et al 2010 pettersson 1998 roy and bickerton 2014 several studies have performed highly detailed i e cm vertical chemical including srp fe redox sampling in shallow streambed sediments with observations suggesting the presence of an oxic cap extending down from the streambed interface burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 the oxic cap is thought to form due to the mixing of oxygen from the surface waters via diffusion or advection with more reducing groundwaters a common condition forming an fe oxide rich layer capable of sequestering srp and limiting its release to the stream burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 calculations of porewater srp fluxes to a stream have been done by jarvie et al 2008 for diffusive transport using vertical profiles of streambed srp concentration and by fitzgerald et al 2015 for advective groundwater transport using high spatial resolution streambed porewater srp concentrations and vertical profiles of streambed temperature along and across a stream reach despite these studies to date our understanding of srp concentrations in streambed porewater and the release of srp across the streambed interface is still limited in particular there is incomplete information on how srp porewater concentrations within the transition zone in streambeds vary spatially i e along a streambed and with depth and over time i e seasonally and the associated hydrological and geochemical controls for instance most field studies have used a large scale snapshot sampling design resulting in low spatial resolution sampling of porewater srp along a stream and with sampling one to two times only e g burns et al 2015 casillas ituarte et al 2019 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 roy and bickerton 2014 the high resolution spatial porewater srp sampling by fitzgerald et al 2015 had minimal detail on variation with depth or seasonal patterns likewise the small scale field studies that have shown the presence of an oxic cap typically used only one to three samplers over a single sampling period burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 palmer felgate et al 2010 thus additional information is needed to better understand when and where srp release across the streambed sediment interface is more likely to be important considering different land uses e g urban vs agricultural stream hydrogeological conditions seasons and climates for example it is currently unclear if the oxic cap which may limit porewater srp release to a stream is spatially continuous and if it persists over time as geochemical and hydrological conditions change furthermore studies conducted in an urban stream i e fitzgerald et al 2015 may not represent well the streambed p stores and geochemical conditions of an agricultural stream these limitations indicate the need for further field based investigations that include higher resolution sampling of streambed porewater across all seasons and different stream areas e g riffle pool combinations to more clearly understand the temporal and spatial variability in streambed porewater srp and its potential release to the overlying stream the objective of this study was to investigate the spatio temporal variability in streambed porewater srp along a 40 m agricultural stream reach in the lake erie basin ontario canada over one year and the potential hydrological and geochemical controls on it in particular the study addresses whether high porewater srp observed in the streambed may originate from i groundwater discharging through the streambed ii the streambed sediments themselves or iii the surface water via hyporheic exchange spatial temporal variability in the presence of an oxic cap is also examined due to its potential to limit srp release across the streambed interface the findings of this study can provide insight into the potential including when and where for groundwater surface water interactions to deliver srp from groundwater and streambed sediments to the overlying stream as needed to improve watershed p monitoring programs and models that aim to predict p loads to downstream surface waters 2 study site the study was conducted in an agricultural

method details provided in supplementary material sm section s2 1 the stream at the site was divided into three distinct zones fig 1b briefly zones 1 and 3 generally have high permeability sediments

techniques were used along the study reach to capture the spatio temporal variability in the streambed porewater srp concentrations and in the possible geochemical and hydrological controls the main sampling period extended from june 2020 to june 2021 field equipment was installed in higher spatial density in zone 2 compared to zones 1 and 3 based on the preliminary sampling data that showed considerably higher and more variable porewater srp concentrations in zone 2 including 1000 µg l compared to zones 1 and 3 srp 50 µg l sm fig s3 3 1 1 hydrological measurements stream stage was

stream pressure transducer location using a flow meter ott mf pro velocity and depth sensor 3 1 2 water sampling for all sampling events grab surface water samples were collected from the center of the stream at multiple locations along the study reach and from any flowing tile drain outlets samples of streambed porewater were collected during the main study period june 2020 to june 2021 using permanently installed samplers either multilevel samplers mls or dedicated tip samplers dts or were collected using peepers which are a passive diffusion based sampling device the locations of these porewater sampling devices are shown in fig 1c samples were collected approximately monthly over the study period except for the peepers which were deployed in the streambed for 4 5 weeks over three periods july 2020 september 2020 october 2020 november 2020 and december 2020 january 2021 eight mls between 1 2 and 1 5 m in length were installed along the centerline of the stream in zone 2 fig 1c all mls were constructed of three channel polyethylene tubing with sampling ports consisting of 0 1 m long slotted screens cut into the tubing located at depths of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m below the streambed surface nineteen dts were installed in zones 1 3 at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m zone 1 0 1 and 0 3 m zone 2 and 0 1 and 0 4 m zone 3 refer to sm table s1 for additional information to provide single point porewater sampling at shallower depths and in areas where mls could not be installed due to the streambed geology fig 1c the dts comprised a tip manufactured using a 3d printer pa2200 nylon with 16 holes at its base covered with 297 µm polypropylene mesh and connected to a 1 4 in od fluoropolymer tube samples were collected from the mls and dts using a peristaltic pump twelve peepers were installed in the streambed fig 1c with most peepers located next to an mls or dts the peepers consisted of a 0 32 m long acrylic rectangular rod with a pointed end and containing five 10 ml chambers spaced 0 05 m apart thus providing high vertical resolution data of streambed porewater quality peepers were installed such that the top chamber was exposed to the stream water and the remaining chambers were below the streambed surface reaching up to 0 2 m in depth before deploying in the field the peeper chambers were filled with degassed megapure water double distilled and covered with a dialysis membrane peepers were stored in a closed bucket filled with degassed water for transport from the laboratory to the field for installation upon removal from the streambed water was collected from the peeper chambers using a needle and syringe the extracted volume recorded and then diluted to 15 ml using megapure water additional details of the installation and sampling methods including the locations and depths of sampling devices are provided in supplementary material sm tables s1 and s2 figs s4 s6 it is important to note the differences between the samples collected using the samplers mls and dts referred to as extracted porewater and those collected using the peepers and referred to as equilibrium porewater in addition to having different depth intervals and ranges differences between these sampling devices may also potentially influence the water chemistry results first the samplers disproportionately extract porewater across a larger volume and from larger pores rather than smaller pores while the peepers equilibrate via diffusion with all of the porewater small and large pores directly adjacent the sampling well fitzgerald et al 2015 second the sampler collection is a point in time measurement whereas the peepers give an integration of porewater concentrations over the span of the four to five week emplacement period but with recency bias finally the sampler and peeper pairs were not installed in the exact same location and so differences in concentrations may also result from small scale variability in the porewater chemistry all water samples were immediately filtered in the field using 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters samples were collected in 30 ml and 15 ml hdpe bottles with the sample for metal analysis acidified using concentrated 15 6 m nitric acid duplicate stream water samples were collected for some sampling events but no duplicate porewater samples were collected most mls and the peepers provided limited sample volume sample bottles were stored in a cooler with ice packs while in the field and during transportation to the laboratory at western university additionally a handheld multiparameter probe either hach hq40d portable multi parameter meter or ysi 650 multiparameter meter was used in the field to measure temperature ec ph and orp of the stream and porewater from well flowing mls and dts samplers 3 1 3 streambed sediment samples intact streambed sediment cores were collected at the end of the study period in june 2021 using a 0 06 m diameter 0 35 m long manual sediment corer cores were collected within 0 15 m of mls and dts locations along the center of the stream five locations to collect sediment to 0 4 m depth below the streambed surface multiple intact cores were taken from the same hole upon removal cores were immediately wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in a cooler for transport back to the laboratory cores were then stored in a cold room between 5 and 7 c until subsampling and chemical analyses 3 2 chemical analyses and classification 3 2 1 water sample analyses water samples were analyzed for srp and if there was sufficient volume for one or more of ammonium anions and specific metals when possible samples were analyzed for srp within 48 h of collection otherwise they were frozen along with all other samples and then re thawed

visible spectrophotometer at 640 nm beckman coulter du 720 uv vis spectrophotometer for all sample analyses qa qc measures were implemented including standard dilutions included on every sample run and duplicate standards and duplicate samples run after every 5 10 samples 3 2 2 sediment sample analyses p sediment extractions were conducted using sediment subsamples 10 35 g taken from depths of 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m below the streambed surface for the five sediment cores the subsamples were homogenized and then dried at 105 c for 24 h dried samples were analyzed using a sequential extraction method adapted from hedley stewart chauhan 1982 for each sample 2 g of sediment was placed in a bottle and exposed sequentially to the following extractant chemicals 1 deionized water 2 0 5 m nahco3 3

reducible labile p and 4 residual p includes srp associated with calcium carbonates and phosphate minerals such as apatite hedley et al 1982 the modified hedley method is one of the most widely used methods for characterization of available p in soil and sediment samples gu et al 2020 however caution is required in interpreting the results as discrete p forms e g fe bound ca bound are not precisely quantified by the different steps klotzbücher et al 2019 this limitation is considered in our interpretation of the data for each step of the extraction sediments and extractant were left on a shaker table for 16 h centrifuged for 20 min filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter and then analyzed for srp duplicate extracted water samples were analyzed for qa qc sediment subsampled from the same locations as those exposed to sequential extraction were also analyzed for organic matter content using a loss on ignition test heiri et al 2001 after drying at 105 c for 24 h subsamples 10 35 g were weighed and then dried at 550 c for 4 h samples were then weighed again to determine the mass of organic matter that had been lost 3 2 3 identification of dominant redox processes the redox processes dominating in the streambed porewater at the study site were identified based on the framework developed by mcmahon chapelle 2008 this framework compares the measured porewater concentrations of o2 no3 n mn fe and so4 at a given location and time against set thresholds of these concentrations to distinguish eight different redox conditions oxic suboxic no3 reducing no3 mn transition mn iv reducing fe iii so4 reducing methanogenesis mixed sm table s3 the threshold concentration values applied in our study are based on recommendations from mcmahon chapelle but those for no3 n mn and fe were modified slightly with consideration to specific conditions at our study site following the recommendation of mcmahon chapelle 2008 as o2 measurements in this study were not made or were not sufficiently accurate around the typical threshold value 0 5 mg l the o2 criteria could not be applied as such porewater under oxic suboxic and no3 reduction conditions i e mn and fe concentrations below their thresholds could not be separately distinguished and so are classified in our analysis as less reducing for samples that otherwise met the criteria for mn no3 transition mn iv reducing fe iii so4 reducing and methanogenesis which together can be considered more reducing o2 was assumed negligible 0 5 mg l and as such these conditions could be distinguished finally conditions were classified as mixed when both no3 n and fe concentrations were greater than their threshold values mixed conditions indicate mixing of waters of different redox conditions likely due to sampling water across spatial gradients or influenced by porewater extracted from both large and small pore spaces 4 results and discussion given the multiple and potentially interrelated factors that may influence streambed porewater srp concentrations the spatial and temporal patterns for srp are first presented with limited discussion of the factors contributing to the observed variability following this the possible contributing factors including the distribution of solid phase p in the streambed redox geochemistry and hydrological influences are explored finally the potential role of groundwater surface water interactions in increasing srp concentrations in the overlying stream at the study site is discussed 4 1 general stream conditions stream discharge from manual measurements varied from 0 01 to 0 32 m3 s over the study period with base flows highest during the spring melt stage 0 3 m march 2021 and lowest stage 0 2 m in the fall 2020 and early summer 2021 and with peaks in stage associated with rain and major melt events sm fig s2 considering the 11 sampling times during the main study period the median surface water srp concentration was 33 µg l interquartile range iqr 29 µg l n 18 with the srp concentrations higher in the summer compared to other seasons sm table s4 agricultural tile drains along the reach only discharged water to the stream during four of the eleven sampling times and only during summer 2020 and spring 2021 the median srp concentration of the discharging tile drain water was 67 µg l iqr 43 µg l n 4 the streambed topography elevation was fairly stable over the study period with changes in the elevation typically 7 cm across the study reach but reaching approximately 15 cm at one location associated with a temporary buildup of woody debris 4 2 variations in porewater srp concentrations 4 2 1 variation between zones porewater srp concentrations from the mls and dts termed samplers here representing extracted porewater along the centerline of the stream show distinct variation along the reach table 1 for the higher permeability high groundwater discharge areas of the study reach i e zones 1 and 3 porewater srp concentrations from the samplers were typically low with median values 12 µg l and 29 µg l for zone 1 and 3 respectively below the eutrophic threshold of 30 µg l canadian council of ministers of the environment 2004 and the median surface water concentration of 33 µg l n 18 the concentrations were about twice as high in zone 3 than found in zone 1 and more variable over time with the maximum concentration in zone 3 294 µg l considerably higher than the maximum concentration observed in zone 1 46 µg l while only one location was monitored in each of zone 1 and zone 3 the preliminary data collected in 2019 using temporary samplers showed porewater srp concentrations were consistently below the eutrophic threshold at multiple locations and depths in both zones sm fig s3 the sampler porewater srp concentrations for the lower permeability low groundwater discharge area zone 2 were generally higher and more variable compared to zones 1 and 3 with approximately 30 of samples above the threshold for hypereutrophic conditions 100 µg l canadian council of ministers of the environment 2004 and 4 of samples 1000 µg l herein the following levels are adopted in describing the magnitude of porewater srp concentrations very low 10 µg l low between 10 and 30 µg l eutrophic threshold 30 µg l and median surface water concentration 33 µg l moderate between 30 and 100 µg l high between 100 and 1000 µg l hypereutrophic threshold 100 µg l and very high 1000 µg l this difference between the high and low permeability groundwater discharge zones was also observed in the porewater data from the peepers chambers within the sediments representing equilibrium porewater with srp concentrations lower and less variable in zone 3 median 83 µg l iqr 106 µg l n 12 than zone 2 median 260 µg l iqr 438 µg l n 89 generally the peeper concentrations were higher than those of the samplers in the same area which may be due to the influence of higher srp concentrations within some smaller pores for the equilibrium based peeper samples further explanation on possible reasons for the differences between the sampler and peeper concentrations is provided in section 3 1 2 the range of porewater srp concentrations observed across this study reach fall within the ranges reported for other studies on agricultural streams e g burns et al 2015 casillas ituarte et al 2019 jarvie et al 2008 a common finding of these other studies which is supported here by the large differences in srp concentrations observed between the three zones of this study is that srp porewater concentrations in agriculture streams can be highly variable at small scales 10 m our data suggest potential links between this variability and the physical heterogeneity of the streambed sediments or differences in the groundwater stream interactions discussed in further detail in sections below 4 2 2 variation with depth and time srp concentrations for the samplers dts in zone 1 were relatively uniform with depth and showed limited variability over the sampling period i e iqr 4 µg l for all data see sm figs s7 and s11 with only one outlier sample 46 µg l at 10 m 0 1 m depth in september a similar depth pattern was observed in preliminary data for zone 1 sm fig s3 however in zone 2 and zone 3 srp concentrations varied with depth and changed over time though the observed spatial and temporal patterns differed between specific sampler locations for example data from the samplers dts in zone 3 showed that srp concentrations increased to 100 µg l from july to november 2020 at 0 1 m depth below the streambed and at the 0 4 m depth in october 2020 but were low 30 µg l six sampling times and moderate between 30 and 100 µg l one sampling time for all other sampling depths and dates sm figs s3 and s8 although the peeper results for zone 3 provide less temporal detail compared to the sampler data the data are consistent with this pattern with higher srp concentrations observed in september and november compared to january sm fig s19a c the sampler porewater srp concentration data in zone 2 centerline fig 2 reveals a notable spatial pattern with high to very high srp concentrations 200 µg l up to 1980 µg l generally restricted to shallow depths below the streambed 0 1 m depth median 261 µg l iqr 490 µg l n 83 depths of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m median 39 µg l iqr 36 µg l n 224 a similar pattern was observed in the preliminary data sm fig s3 the exception to this pattern was at the location x 21 m where only moderate srp concentrations were observed at shallow depth at all other locations in zone 2 the concentrations at 0 1 m depth varied between sampling times sometimes being moderate to low 100 µg l or changing by many 100 s of µg l between sampling times no clear temporal including seasonal pattern is apparent considering all sampler data for zone 2 the srp depth pattern was also not observed for all sampling times with some samples at depths of 0 2 0 4 m with high srp concentrations up to 100 416 µg l fig 2 the greater vertical resolution 0 05 m increments of the peepers deployed along the centerline of zone 2 provided additional information about the srp distribution within the shallow sediments 0 0 25 m depths fig 3 a c similar to the sampler data srp concentrations were generally very high and high within these shallow sediments at all locations with the exception of the location x 21 m where the concentrations were low in november and january 35 µg l the porewater srp concentrations just below the streambed surface i e depths 0 0 1 m indicate a temporal change from higher concentrations i e 500 µg l maximum 1080 µg l observed in the late summer fig 3a to lower concentrations 50 µg l in the fall and or winter x 21 23 25 27 m on 5 november x 24 25 5 m on 16 january with concentrations remaining consistently very high and high at greater depth fig 3b c a few of the locations exhibiting the temporal change e g x 21 m in november and january x 20 and 22 m in january fig 3 experienced small changes in streambed topography and so the top most buried peeper chamber of each was partially exposed to stream water for part of the deployment period which could explain the lower srp concentrations at those points though not the overall pattern given the limited sampling and long deployment of the peepers one 5 week period in each of three seasons it cannot be determined if the observed temporal change represents a seasonal pattern prior studies have attributed the low porewater srp concentrations close to the streambed surface with increasing concentrations below to the presence of an oxic cap burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 this could explain the srp distributions observed with the peepers this is explored further in section 4 4 importantly in contrast to prior studies our peeper results show that srp concentrations are not always lower close to the streambed surface and this may have important implications for srp release to the overlying surface water discussed further in section 4 5 4 2 3 variation across the stream while the field sampling design focused on porewater srp concentrations along the centerline of the stream additional samples were also taken from closer to the banks of the stream in zone 2 over the study period fig 1c dts depths of 0 1 and 0 3 m and peepers from the east and west sides of the stream respectively both showed that porewater srp concentrations were also high close to the banks dts median 130 µg l iqr 714 µg l maximum 1911 µg l n 48 peepers median 288 µg l iqr 442 µg l maximum 1150 n 21 sm tables s5 and 7 however in contrast to the centre of the stream there were no clear depth or temporal patterns observed sm table s6 this difference between center versus side of the stream could be due to streambed heterogeneities including a greater depth of high p sediment or organic matter content or differences in the groundwater flow paths e g more horizontal flow at the sides of the stream 4 3 streambed sediment p the abundance and availability of srp bound to the streambed sediment and the sediment organic matter content were measured for sediment samples from zones 1 3 to evaluate whether the streambed sediments themselves could be the source of the high porewater srp observed and to provide insight into the observed spatial variations in porewater srp the total extractable p concentrations for the streambed sediments the sum of the four different fractions ranged from 302 to 1117 mg kg this is similar to measurements for sediments of agricultural streams reported by casillas ituarte et al 2019 20 cores average 920 mg kg and palmer felgate et al 2009 seven stream sites 155 2678 mg kg on average the labile h2o srp loosely bound nahco3 srp reducible labile naoh srp and tightly bound hcl srp fractions accounted for 1 5 5 and nearly 90 of the total extractable p respectively sm fig s20 it should be noted that the sequential extractions were performed on dry rather than wet fresh sediments while this may have slightly altered the measured fractions particularly the labile and loosely bound nahco3 fractions condron and newman 2011 simpson et al 2019 it is expected that the overall relative magnitude of p extracted in the different steps and thus the spatial patterns would be the same similar results have been reported by previous studies for instance casillas ituarte et al 2019 and lewandowski nützmann 2010 similarly found that the labile h2o srp accounted for a small fraction of the total extractable p 1 while other studies used slightly different extraction methods and therefore the results from the other individual extraction steps cannot be directly compared casillas ituarte et al 2019 found that the recalcitrant tightly bound p fraction determined using combusted sediment digestion with 15 7 m hno3 accounted for up to 90 of total extractable p 57 on average considering that the relatively stable and tightly bound hcl srp fraction is unlikely to be released under naturally occurring conditions lewandowski and nützmann 2010 it has been excluded from the plot of the sediment srp extraction results in fig 4 a the om content of the streambed sediment was relatively low 1 6 fig 4b compared to results for some other agricultural streams often 5 16 casillas ituarte et al 2019 palmer felgate et al 2009 however similar to prior previous studies e g casillas ituarte et al 2019 lewandowski and nützmann 2010 palmer felgate et al 2009 the om content was positively correlated with the more available fractions of sediment srp here this includes h2o srp pearson correlation r 0 79 p value 0 05 nahco3 srp r 0 89 p value 0 05 and naoh srp r 0 82 p value 0 05 while the hcl srp was not significantly correlated r 0 31 p value 0 16 the correlation between the available sediment bound srp and om is shown in fig 4c which suggests that the former is partially associated with om mineralization the available sediment bound srp and om content fig 4 displayed similar overall spatial patterns to those observed in the porewater srp data for instance the available srp sediment concentrations were lowest averaging 3 mg kg in zone 1 x 10 m fig 4a where porewater srp concentrations were consistently low table 1 within zone 2 the sediment collected at the x 21 m location had relatively low available srp sediment concentrations mean 12 mg kg compared to the other samples in zone 2 fig 4a likewise porewater srp was lower at the 21 m location compared to other locations of zone 2 fig 2 at the other two sediment sample locations in zone 2 x 24 m and x 26 m fig 4a the highest values for available srp fractions and om generally occurred at shallower depths 0 0 2 m but especially at the 0 1 m depth where the highest srp porewater concentrations were found by the samplers especially compared to 0 3 0 4 m depths fig 2 a similar om and sediment p pattern with depth i e higher values at shallow depth was reported for a sediment profile of an oxbow lake lewandowski nützmann 2010 importantly the matching spatial patterns of the srp sediment and porewater data suggest that the availability of p sourced from the sediments may play a controlling role in the observed variability of the porewater srp concentrations further it is possible that mineralization of organic rich sediment materials could be the source of the high porewater srp concentrations in zone 2 it is unclear what causes localized high organic rich sediment materials in the shallow streambed sediments but possible reasons could be localized deposition and burial of vegetation including aquatic plants in the streambed possibly impacted by the periodic dredging of this agricultural stream reach the relationship between the porewater srp patterns and available sediment bound srp and om are not clear for zone 3 while the available srp sediment concentrations and om were relatively high but still decreased with depth fig 4 the porewater srp concentrations were typically 50 µg l with the exception of a few sampling times and locations e g srp concentration of 550 µg l observed in peeper chamber just below the sediment surface sm fig s19b this may be evidence of high sediment bound srp that is not typically released to the porewater except only at times when the geochemical conditions are favourable i e when reducing conditions occur as discussed further in section 4 4 4 4 geochemical conditions and influencing hydrology 4 4 1 porewater redox conditions a summary of the inferred dominating redox processes associated with the observed porewater srp concentrations is shown for the samplers in fig 5 with similar findings for the peepers given in sm table s10 the dominating redox processes were inferred from streambed porewater chemistry data dissolved no3 n mn fe so4 evaluated against specified redox criteria based on the framework developed by mcmahon chapelle 2008 sm table s3 from fig 5 it can be seen that low to moderate srp concentrations 50 µg l were found for samples under less reducing conditions i e oxic suboxic or no3 reduction as well as no3 mn transition conditions n 84 this is expected as these conditions favour retention of srp by adsorption to fe and mn oxides e g baken et al 2015 bol et al 2018 dolph et al 2019 jarvie et al 2008 in contrast higher and more variable concentrations of porewater srp were observed under more reducing conditions including mn iv and fe iii so4 reduction and methanogenesis at which fe iii so4 reduction would be at or near completion which favour fe and mn oxide dissolution and the release of any adsorbed or co precipitated p importantly all samples with high srp concentrations 100 µg l n 203 were under more reducing or mixed an indication of mixing of less reducing and more reducing waters conditions except for two outlier samples a similar srp redox relationship was reported by roy bickerton 2014 who applied the same framework to porewaters of several urban streams indeed many prior studies have found srp retention and release in streambeds to be closely linked to fe redox conditions e g lewandowski and nützmann 2010 including being implicated in the formation of the oxic cap e g jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 the controlling influence of the redox conditions close to the streambed surface may explain some of the observed spatial patterns in porewater srp within the study reach zones and over time this is examined in the following sections with the discussion separated into areas with predominantly less reducing conditions zones 1 and 3 and the x 21 m location in zone 2 and areas with predominantly more reducing conditions zone 2 except x 21 m location the possible influences of hydrological flow changes on the redox conditions are also explored with these changes inferred based on physical measurements by robinson et al 2022 table 1 combined with porewater concentration data for constituents that have different endmember concentrations in the stream versus the groundwater moving through the streambed sediments e g cl no3 n and so4 4 4 2 areas of predominantly less reducing conditions zones 1 and 3 typically had low srp concentrations and were predominantly under less reducing conditions table 1 sm fig s21 the same applies to x 21 m location of zone 2 fig 6 data for all sampling times provided in sm fig s21 thus redox conditions may have been favourable for srp to be sequestered to the sediments in these areas thus resulting in low porewater srp concentrations however as zone 1 10 m location and the 21 m location also had low available sediment bound srp fig 4a it is uncertain if a low srp source i e upwelling groundwater with low srp or the redox conditions i e less reducing conditions favouring srp sequestration was the dominant control in these locations sediment srp and om content were higher for zone 3 fig 4 suggesting redox was the primary control for the low porewater srp concentrations observed here further when the redox conditions changed to more reducing from july to october 2020 for the samplers in zone 3 there was a coincident increase in porewater srp concentrations particularly 0 1 m depth fig 7 though the temporal coverage was limited the peepers also showed reducing conditions and high srp concentrations in the fall of 2020 sept and nov compared to less reducing and low srp concentrations in winter 2021 jan sm figs s19and s22 these coincident changes further support the controlling influence of redox conditions in zone 3 the physical evidence including temperature and vertical hydraulic gradient measurements suggests that zones 1 and 3 experienced predominantly high groundwater discharge table 1 this is supported by observations that both zones typically exhibit consistent porewater concentrations with depth for cl high no3 n and high so4 sm fig s15 s7 though they change temporally similar chemical trends were seen for location x 21 m suggesting this location may also be a localized area of groundwater discharge these patterns suggest that the source groundwater is less reducing and its strong upwelling may have prevented development of more reducing conditions via contact with organic rich stream sediments especially zone 3 with higher om fig 4b an exception occurred in the fall of 2020 when higher srp and more reducing conditions were observed in zone 3 fig 7 and to a lesser extent at location x 21 m fig 6 during this period porewater cl and no3 n concentrations changed markedly in all three areas zones 1 and 3 location x 21 m towards values more similar to surface water concentrations cl increased from 10 mg l to around 20 mg l no3 n declined from an average of 61 mg l to 6 mg l figures s24 s26 these chemistry changes indicate that a temporary change in flow patterns may have occurred during the fall as in kaufman et al 2017 away from strong upwelling to more horizontal hyporheic flow or low downwelling conditions it is possible this could have been caused by a change in gradient between the aquifer and stream or a change in the streambed topography at zone 3 and location 21 m the data indicate either the new pathway brought water under more reducing conditions or the flow change allowed more reducing conditions to develop noting higher om and available sediment bound srp for zone 3 especially fig 4 no concurrent redox change was noted for zone 1 fig s21 possibly because of its very high permeability or low om content 4 4 3 areas of predominantly more reducing conditions the porewater within zone 2 aside from location x 21 m discussed above was generally and consistently more reducing over the study period e g sampler data in fig 6 for two sampling times with data for all sampling times provided in sm fig s21 sm table s10 this excludes the shallow oxic cap which is discussed in section 4 4 4 in zone 2 the streambed sediment is finer and there was minimal groundwater upwelling and possible surface water downwelling table 1 these groundwater stream interaction conditions and low permeability are expected to result in long porewater residence times whether for groundwater pathways from the adjacent fields or hyporheic flows this would allow more time for interactions between the organic rich streambed sediment and porewater and thus for reducing conditions to develop the more reducing conditions at the greater depths e g 0 4 m suggests any incoming groundwater to this zone may already be under more reducing conditions these more reducing conditions are favorable for srp to be released from sediments to the porewater or for incoming srp to remain mobile consistent with this very high and high porewater srpconcentrations were observed at shallow 0 1 m depths along the centerline in zone 2 figs 2 and 6 importantly however the srp concentrations were much lower at greater depths 0 2 0 4 m at these same locations despite the more reducing conditions fig 6 these findings suggest that the reducing conditions are leading to very high and high porewater srp concentrations where available sediment bound p is high i e in the shallow sediments along the stream centerline fig 4 but also probably to greater depth along the side of the stream given higher porewater srp at depth there sm table s6 thus both the availability of sediment bound p and redox conditions are important controls the low to moderate porewater srp concentrations at depth despite reducing conditions suggests any incoming groundwater to zone 2 has low to moderate srp concentrations depth 0 4 m median 35 µg l iqr 29 µg l n 71 this is supported by the preliminary porewater sampling which showed that porewater srp concentrations at depths of 0 5 0 9 m below the streambed in all zones were consistently low and less than the stream srp concentration median 11 µg l iqr 13 µg l 10 locations in zones 1 2 and 3 sm fig s3 this suggests that groundwater from the surrounding fields was likely not the major source of the very high and high porewater srp observed in the shallow streambed rather the availability of sediment bound p including that from the deposition and burial of organic matter is likely the source of the very high and high porewater srp concentrations 4 4 4 changes in the oxic cap the srp and redox data indicate that the oxic cap which prior studies indicate may regulate srp release from the streambed to the overlying stream burns et al 2015 jarvie et al 2008 palmer felgate et al 2010 may be discontinuous in space and time considering the three peeper sampling times the conditions within the top 0 15 m of the streambed shifted from a dominance of more reducing conditions mn iv or fe iii so4 reducing in september fig 3d to increasingly more prevalent less reducing more oxic conditions in november and january fig 3e f this redox change was concurrent with a decrease in srp concentrations at shallow depth fig 3a c and may have been due to srp sequestering to fe and potentially mn oxide minerals that precipitated within the oxic cap for the peepers in zone 2 porewater concentrations of cl no3 n and so4 within the shallowest sediments 0 15 m increased and reached concentrations similar in magnitude to those observed in peeper chambers above the sediment surface representing the stream water in january fig 3 this apparent surface water influence in the shallow sediments could result from diffusion into the sediment with reduced to minimal groundwater upwelling as reported by jarvie et al 2008 or from surface water downwelling the latter condition is supported by the porewater cl spatial patterns which suggest the stream water higher cl than the incoming groundwater as represented by location 21 m is reaching deeper into the sediments than the apparent depth of the oxic cap represented by less reducing conditions as such the data indicate that groundwater surface water interactions played a role in the transient development of the oxic cap equally important are the conditions that may have caused the elimination of the oxic cap as appears to be the case for the centerline of the stream in september fig 3 it is possible that over this period upwelling conditions as supported by low cl no3 n and so4 concentrations in the shallow streambed fig 3g and j could have forced the reducing zone upwards potentially all the way to the streambed surface the apparent lack of an oxic cap was also seen for all three sampling periods for the peepers at the side of the stream sm fig s23 noting that groundwater discharge is often greater near the banks than middle of a stream winter et al 1998 the potential for upwelling conditions to eliminate the oxic cap is important because these conditions may be favourable for srp release from the streambed to the overlying stream 4 4 5 aluminum aluminum al which is not redox controlled is also known to affect srp retention and release in streambeds as al oxides can retain srp lijklema 1980 records et al 2016 however the porewater dissolved al concentrations were generally low 1 mg l median 0 3 mg l iqr 0 4 mg l maximum 6 mg l n 295 sm fig s14 with limited spatial or temporal variability across the stream reach for all sampling times as such al is not expected to be an important factor in srp retention or release at this study site 4 5 porewater srp contributions to the stream mass flux of srp from the streambed sediment porewaters to the overlying stream water may occur via diffusion if porewater concentrations are greater than those of the stream or by advection with groundwater discharge for this stream reach the srp mass flux from zone 1 was likely low despite predominant high groundwater discharge conditions due to the low porewater srp concentrations as observed in the sampler data as well as in the preliminary sampling data table 1 sm figs s3 and s7 as the porewater srp was typically similar to or less than the surface water srp concentrations in zone 1 it is not expected that this mass flux would increase stream srp concentrations similar conditions existed for zone 3 for many sampling times through the study period sm fig s8 as well as for other locations in this zone that were targeted during the preliminary sampling sm fig s3 zone 3 did experience times of high porewater srp concentrations 100 µg l sm fig s3 though these coincided with times of inferred surface water downwelling which would also limit the srp mass flux to the stream however it is possible there could be a strong pulse of this high srp porewater to the stream upon the transition back to discharging conditions not monitored adding srp mass and raising the stream srp concentration neglecting other instream srp sinks porewater srp concentrations near the streambed surface were typically much higher in zone 2 than the average stream concentrations but the srp release to the stream would have been limited because any upwelling groundwater flux here was likely small with potentially diffusion transport dominating regardless due to the high porewater srp concentrations in this zone any transfer of srp would tend to raise the stream concentration though only fractionally over this small reach it is possible that srp mass flux to the stream from zone 2 could have been greater in summer compared to fall and early winter as the temporary development of an oxic cap in fall and early winter would have restricted srp release to the stream potentially higher srp release to the stream during summer compared to other seasons is important because groundwater inputs may be the dominant water source in some streams during summer base flow conditions when ecological sensitivity to eutrophication is highest stamm et al 2014 upscaling the findings from this short study reach these influences of srp transfer to stream water across the streambed interface may add up and be important in regulating watershed srp loading 5 conclusions this study assessed the spatio temporal variability and geochemical and hydrologic controls on porewater srp in the streambed along a 40 m agricultural stream reach including the potential influence of groundwater surface water interactions high spatial variations in porewater srp concentrations ranging from 8 to 1981 µg l were seen along the stream across the stream and with depth at scales of m to cm approximately monthly porewater sampling conducted over one year indicated some temporal seasonal patterns which were largely limited to the shallow sediments 0 1 m depth these spatial and temporal differences were influenced by the streambed composition redox conditions and the water flux direction very high 1000 µg l and high 100 1000 µg porewater srp concentrations were typically found in shallow streambed experiencing more reducing geochemical conditions whereas low concentrations occurred in areas with less reducing conditions and deeper sediments under more reducing conditions areas of strong groundwater discharge zones 1 and at most times 3 had generally low srp concentrations 30 µg l and less reducing conditions with moderate srp concentrations between 30 and 100 µg l observed at few times and locations porewater at depths 0 5 m below the streambed consistently had low srp concentrations in all zones 30 µg l suggesting groundwater from the surrounding fields was not a source of the high and very high porewater srp observed in the shallow streambed rather shallow streambed sediments with high available sediment bound srp are the likely source of the high srp porewater concentrations high available srp sediment concentrations were positively correlated to sediment om content suggesting that om mineralization may supply some or all of this sediment bound srp shallow streambed sediments that experienced a change in redox state e g less to more reducing showed a corresponding change in porewater srp concentration low to high and very high which clearly illustrates the role of fe cycling and potentially also mn cycling on srp retention and release in the streambed sediments spatially detailed vertical porewater profiles also revealed the presence of an oxic cap below the streambed interface which can potentially limit srp flux to the overlying stream as proposed by jarvie et al 2008 however observations at our site also showed that this oxic cap is spatially and temporally discontinuous and therefore srp transfer from the streambed to stream may be greater at certain times of the year the spatial and temporal changes in redox conditions noted above were associated with changes in the direction of groundwater surface water flow i e upwelling vs downwelling conditions which shows its importance as a hydrologic control on srp retention and release in the streambed these changing hydrologic conditions are also likely to affect the mass flux of srp from the streambed to the stream via diffusion or advection and potentially the stream srp concentration though the influence is complicated by the other factors for example increasing groundwater discharge will typically increase srp mass flux to the stream including by eliminating or limiting the oxic cap unless it also causes a change from more reducing to less reducing conditions overall this study provides important new insights into srp dynamics near the groundwater stream interface as needed to better understand the factors that may promote release of legacy p from groundwater and streambed sediments to streams this understanding may help to inform watershed p modeling and management efforts in agricultural areas credit authorship contribution

2353,global warming can result in changes in droughts and hot events or compound droughts and hot events cdhes which can take a heavy toll on the society and environment recent studies have made substantial progress in the projection of these events however previous projection studies mostly focus on the concurrences of meteorological droughts and hot events but ignore the difference among various cdhes specifically the concurrence of hot events and different types of droughts e g agricultural droughts and hydrological droughts has been seldom explored from a hydrological perspective based on phase six of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 we evaluate changes in different types of cdhes including compound meteorological drought hot events cmdhes compound agricultural drought hot events cadhes and compound hydrological drought hot events chdhes for different future periods at the global scale based on comparisons with data from global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 0 cmip6 can reproduce the overall spatial distribution and temporal variation of different cdhes at the global scale in addition the frequency and spatial extent of the three compound events show a marked increase during different future periods relative to the base period 1995 2014 the projected increase in global average frequency of cmdhes in the long term period is lower than that of cadhes increase by 73 74 and 113 95 for cmdhes and cadhes respectively the uncertainty in the simulation of cadhes and chdhes is relatively larger than cmdhes in the future periods over most regions the results of this study highlight the urgent demand for adaptation measures of cdhes to cope with compound extremes in the future keywords drought dry and hot compound events cmip6 data availability i have shared the link to the data 1 introduction the concurrent or consecutive occurrences of multiple hazards or events are commonly termed compound events which can lead to disastrous repercussions even though the individual hazards or and events may not be extreme hao et al 2022 leonard et al 2014 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 among multiple types of compound events

al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 multiple lines of evidence have shown that cdhes may lead to a broader and larger impact on natural and social environments than do individual droughts or high temperature extremes poschlod et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 zscheischler et al 2020 for instance significant impacts of cdhes on food security water resources vegetation settlements and infrastructure over various regions have been observed in the past decades hao et al 2022 such as 2003 2018 in europe bastos et al 2020 fink et al 2004 and 2010 in russia trenberth and fasullo 2012 in addition a consensus already exists that cdhes have increased significantly in large regions of global land areas over the last few decades feng et al 2021 hao et al 2013 kirono et al 2017 manning et al 2019 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 wu et al 2021a zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the significant impacts and increased occurrences of cdhes call for an improved understanding of future changes

cmip5 simulations under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario wu et al 2021b showed global area affected by cmdhes will increase to about 1 7 1 8 times by the end of the 21st

highlighted the potential increase in cmdhes in the future periods with continued global warming meng et al 2022 ridder et al 2022 vogel et al 2020 wu et al 2021c zhang et al 2022 arguably a meteorological drought over an extended period due to precipitation deficits may further result in depleted soil moisture i e agricultural droughts and declined runoff streamflow i e hydrological droughts van loon 2015 vicente serrano et al 2022 different types of droughts have increased in large regions along with enhanced temperature related extremes for historical periods dai 2013 spinoni et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2022 which may increase the likelihood of concurrence of temperature extremes and agricultural hydrological droughts plaguing agricultural systems or crippling energy sectors recent studies have paid increasing attention to the changing patterns of agricultural hydrological droughts accompanied by high temperatures for instance high temperature extremes or enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand aed can increase evapotranspiration dry out vegetation and soil luo et al 2017 miralles et al 2019 and further cause depleted water resources e g runoff streamflow lake

generation feng et al 2022 under anthropogenic global warming temperature will continue to rise in the future which may further increase the concurrence of high temperatures and different types of droughts in the coming decades the potential increase of these extremes can result in risks that may cascade across sectors and regions ipcc 2022 highlighting the paramount importance of risk assessments of cdhes based on different drought types or different stages of the water cycle in the future however projections of different types of cdhes for future periods on a global scale are still lacking the objective of this study therefore is to assess the spatial and temporal variation in different compound droughts and hot events for the future period on a global scale based on climate model simulations from cmip6 we first evaluate changes in different types of cdhes during the historical period through comparisons with the reference data from global land data assimilation system gldas we then project the changes in cdhes for different future periods we focus on the ssp5 8 5 scenario which assumes the worst scenario pathway o neill et al 2016 wang et al 2021 building on these assessments we try to answer two questions 1 how do cmip6 models perform in simulating different types of compound events 2 what is the difference in variation of different types of compound events during future periods under the ssp5 8 5 scenario 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 gldas to assess the performance of cmip6 models we obtain monthly temperature total precipitation soil moisture and surface runoff from the global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 0 the gldas 2 0 data with a 0 25 degree resolution spanning 1948 2014 are provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa rodell et al 2004 the soil moisture from gldas is divided into four vertical layers including 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm here we focus on the shallow 0 10 cm soil moisture all variables are re gridded to the same resolution of 2 2 with cmip6 models based on the nearest neighbor interpolation 2 1 2 cmip6 multi model ensemble simulations of monthly 2 m near surface air temperature tas total precipitation rate pr top 10 cm soil moisture content mrsos and total surface runoff mrros from cmip6 models are selected for this study which includes simulations for the historical period 1955 2014 in this study and future periods following intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sixth assessment report ar6 ipcc 2022 we select three periods i e 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2081 2100 to define near term mid term and long term to assess the future risk of compound events models that include variables of interest for two experiments historical and ssp5 8 5 are selected in total we selected thirteen models table s1 for the model evaluation and future projection all cmip6 model outputs are re gridded to the common resolution 2 2 based on the nearest neighbor interpolation in this study the multi model ensembles mmes are constructed by using equal weights to all thirteen models i e the multi model ensemble means hereafter mmem to reduce uncertainties resulting from model differences 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identification of compound events there are different ways to define cdhes such as the combined threshold approach feng et al 2021 ridder et al 2022 zscheischler et al 2018 and joint distribution approach muthuvel and amai 2022 muthuvel et al 2023 shah and mishra 2020 here we apply the combined threshold approach to define cdhes on a monthly time scale this non parametric approach is easy to implement without making assumptions about the distribution family the hot conditions and droughts are identified using multiple variables namely temperature t for hot conditions precipitation p for meteorological drought shallow soil moisture s for agricultural drought and surface runoff r for hydrological drought at each grid point a compound event is considered to occur when the temperature is higher than a relative threshold and precipitation soil moisture surface runoff is lower than a threshold at the same time specifically compound droughts and hot events are defined based on the concurrence of drought variables i e precipitation soil moisture and runoff below the 50th percentile and temperature above the 50th percentile for each month during the period of interest i e historical periods and three future periods the thresholds of each variable are defined based on the base period 1995 2014 which is adopted by ipcc ipcc 2021 in addition plenty of major extreme events have occurred in this timeframe including the millennium droughts 1997 to 2010 in australia yildirim et al 2022 extreme droughts in china from 2000 to 2002 zhang et al 2019 and the severe droughts in south asia during 2002 muthuvel and amai 2022 thus applying the thresholds from this period can help us compare future extremes with these major extreme events in recent decades building on this three types of compound events can be defined for further analysis including compound meteorological droughts and hot events cmdhes t50 p50 compound agricultural droughts and hot events cadhes t50 s50 and compound hydrological droughts and hot events chdhes t50 r50 2 2 2 characteristics of compound events we mainly focus on the frequency and spatial extent of cdhes to assess the spatial and temporal variation here the frequency of compound events f dh for each grid during a specific period is defined as the number of months with occurrences of cdhes n 1 divided by the total number of months n and then multiplied by 100 unit which can be expressed as 1 f dh n 1 n 100 in addition the annual spatial extent s dh is defined as the number of grids covered by compound events averaged occurrence of 12 months for each year divided by the total number of grid points over the global land area which can be expressed as 2 s dh i 1 i m 1 12 o m i i 12 100 where o m i is the occurrence i e 0 or 1 of cdhes in month m at grid i i is the total number of grid points over global land area building on this we first compare the spatial distribution of frequency f dh and temporal variation of spatial extent s dh based on gldas and cmip6 models during the historical period 1955 2014 historical simulation data from cmip6 models extend to 2014 the relative change rc in the number of compound events during three future periods i e 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2081 2100 compared with that during the base period 1995 2014 can be expressed as follows 3 rc n f n b n b 100 where n b and n f are the number of compound events in the base period and future period respectively 2 2 3 the mann kendall mk trend and sen s slope test to assess the trend of changes in the spatial extent of different compound event types we apply the mk trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 here the sen s slope is applied to detect the magnitude of the linear trend of spatial extent which can be calculated 4 β m e d i a n x j x i j i where β represents the slope of the trend test x i and x j represent sample values i j for the time series x t t 1 2 n n indicates the length of spatial extent series 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 frequency distribution of cdhes to evaluate the performance of cmip6 models the spatial distributions of the frequency of three compound events cmdhes cadhes and chdhes are calculated first see methods fig 1 illustrates the spatial distribution of the frequency of different types of compound events based on gldas and cmip6 during the historical period from 1955 to 2014 the frequency of three compound events shows an overall consistent pattern which is related to the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural hydrological drought afshar et al 2022 feng et al 2023 zeng et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 specifically the regions with relatively low soil moisture and surface runoff generally correspond well to the dry center of precipitation and vice versa during the historical period qiao et al 2022 a high frequency of cmdhes cadhes and chdhes in central north america northern south america eastern europe southern asia and eastern china is observed from gldas these regions with a high frequency of compound events are generally consistent with results from cmip6 as shown in fig 1 d f indicating that cmip6 models can reproduce the overall spatial distribution of the three types of cdhes to further analyze the frequency difference between gldas and cmip6 the relative bias between gldas and cmip6 is shown in fig 1 g i these assessments reveal that a positive bias exists for cmdhes in certain regions 49 99 of total grids such as eastern south america most of africa southern asia and eastern australia the performance of cmip6 models in simulating compound events is related to the simulation performance of individual variables for example previous studies have shown that simulated precipitation from cmip6 is underestimated in south america and central africa compared with gldas qiao et al 2022 which may contribute to the higher frequency of cmdhes in cmip6 than that in gldas in these regions for cadhes a comparison of the cmip6 and gldas reveals a positive bias in large regions 57 30 of total grids such as eastern south america most of africa southern asia and eastern australia this may be related to the lower surface soil moisture simulated by cmip6 compared with gldas in these regions qiao et al 2022 which likely induces more cadhes in cmip6 models for chdhes the bias between gldas and cmip6 is largely negative in most regions about 70 00 of total grids which is probably because those cmip6 models produce high levels of surface runoff compared with that from gldas qiao et al 2022 causing a small number of chdhes in cmip6 a more detailed look at the regional difference in the frequency of cdhes for six continents i e north america south america europe africa asia and australia between gldas and cmip6 during 1955 2014 is provided in fig 2 with the relative bias between gldas and cmip6 shown in table 1 cmip6 model can reproduce the comparative relationship of the three types of compound events in gldas e g the frequency of cadhes is the highest in almost all continents high consistency between model simulations and gldas exists over europe with a low relative bias for cmdhes larger differences between the frequency of cadhes and chdhes from gldas and cmip6 simulations are shown in africa and australia 3 1 2 historical spatial extent of cdhes we then compare temporal changes in the annual spatial extent of the three types of compound events from 1955 to 2014 across the globe fig 3 the temporal variation in the spatial extent from cmip6 has relatively high pearson correlation coefficients with gldas i e 0 84 0 85 and 0 85 for cmdhes cadhes and chdhes respectively which indicates a relatively good simulation performance from cmip6 models at the global scale the temporal variation highlights a significant increase in the spatial extent of three compound events cmdhes cadhes and chdhes based on gldas especially after the 1990s fig 3 which is generally simulated well from cmip6 models for example the slopes of the spatial extent of cmdhes are 2 55 decade and 2 68 decade based on gldas and cmip6 respectively meanwhile the comparative relationship of spatial extent among three compound events is overall consistent in both datasets specifically the slope of the spatial extent of cadhes 2 80 decade is the highest followed by cmdhes 2 68 decade and chdhes 1 87 decade based on cmip6 models which is highly consistent with the results in gldas i e 2 80 decade 2 55 decade and 2 30 decade for cadhes cmdhes and chdhes respectively moreover we also find larger variability shaded area in the simulation of chdhes as shown in fig 3 c at the continental scale a consistent increase in the spatial extent of different types of cdhes with a high correlation between results from gldas and cmip6 is also shown in almost all continents in fig s1 however some exceptions exist in certain continents such as australia specifically the correlation coefficient of the spatial extent of those compound events between cmip6 models and gldas over australia is relatively low non significant it indicates the low performance of cmip6 models in simulating cdhes in australia which is consistent with previous studies ridder et al 2021 3 2 projection of hydro meteorological variables since changes in compound events are highly dependent on changes in individual variables we first assess changes in global mean temperature precipitation soil moisture and runoff in the 21st century under the ssp5 8 5 scenario fig 4 shows simulations from thirteen cmip6 models in this study these simulations show a continuing increase in temperature from 2021 2040 to 2081 2100 compared with the base period 1995 2014 higher temperature tends to lead to greater rates of evapotranspiration which may cause a higher frequency of agricultural drought as shown by the significant decline of soil moisture in fig 4 for example the soil moisture changes from 0 81 to 4 12 from 2021 2040 to 2081 2100 compared with that during the base period there is also an increase in mean precipitation runoff which changes from 1 66 0 10 in 2021 2040 to 8 27 0 13 in 2081 2100 different directions of individual variables changes also shown at different continents in fig s2 may cause complicated changes in corresponding compound events in the future thus given the interwoven and nonlinear relationships among temperature and hydro meteorological elements i e precipitation soil moisture and runoff in the future it is imperative to evaluate the compound events that span different aspects of the hydrologic cycle i e cmdhes cahdes and chdhes in a warmer climate 3 3 global projection of compound events 3 3 1 change in frequency to assess the future variation of three types of compound events we show the relative changes rc in the frequency of cmdhes cadhes and chdhes during three future periods i e near term mid term and long term under the ssp5 8 5 scenario overall the frequency of three types of compound events i e cmdhes cadhes and chdhes is projected to increase in the three future periods compared with the base period 1995 2014 fig 5 the increase in the frequency of different types of cdhes is consistent over northern south america parts of europe and the mediterranean region which is likely related to enhanced temperature and decreased precipitation shallow soil moisture and surface runoff over these regions in a warming climate fig s3 aadhar and mishra 2020 cook et al 2020 dutta and maity 2022 li and li 2022 naumann et al 2018 stevenson et al 2022 ukkola et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2022 zhao and dai 2022 in addition a slight increase or even decrease in frequency for three compound events is projected in some regions such as parts of extra tropical south america eastern africa and southern asia this is likely related to the increase in precipitation soil moisture surface runoff over those regions as shown in fig s3 for cmdhes the average frequency of cmdhes over global regions with the high model agreement more than 80 of the models agree on the sign of changing pattern enhances by 43 87 during the near term which increases to 73 74 in the long term compared with that during the base period compared with cmdhes the increase in cadhes is larger and more widespread in most regions some evidence has indicated that agricultural drought based on soil moisture is more widespread than drought estimated using precipitation under ssp5 8 5 by the end of the twenty first century cook et al 2020 which further causes more cadhes than cmdhes we confirm that this conclusion generally holds when employing more extreme thresholds than the 50th percentile e g the results based on the 30th and 70th percentile are shown in fig s4 note that some regions with only a marginal increase in cmdhes like northern north america and eurasia are projected to experience a remarkable increase in cadhes precipitation is the most important and direct factor among others affecting soil moisture zhang et al 2008 and the wetting of soil caused by precipitation is an intuitive process in nature koster et al 2004 koster et al 2003 however for some large regions like eurasia covering an extensive range of longitudes and latitudes the variables that can affect soil moisture are more complicated and diverse which may cause a more complex land atmosphere interaction and make the influence of precipitation on soil moisture weaker sang et al 2021 this highlights that precipitation is not the only determinant of soil moisture and other significant processes e g enhanced evaporative demand increased plant water use affecting soil moisture also change with warming cook et al 2020 hua et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 which may cause more concurrence of agricultural drought and high temperature i e cadhes in these regions under a warming climate an extensive and significant increase of chdhes is shown in large regions like northern north america eurasia southern africa and australia as shown in fig 5 g i note that an increase in precipitation over certain regions may not directly translate to enhanced surface runoff for example precipitation is projected to increase over the middle to high latitudes of northern hemisphere due to increased specific humidity and increased water vapor transport from the tropics dutta and maity 2022 ipcc 2021 li and li 2022 however surface runoff decreases in western north america canada and western russia cook et al 2020 as shown in fig s3 in addition we did not find a consistent pattern between changes in cadhes and chdhes based on different thresholds e g the relative change in cadhes is similar to that in chdhes in fig 5 while the relative change in chdhes is larger than cadhes based on a higher threshold as shown in fig s4 which may be related to complex influencing factors of runoff e g watershed features snow and vegetation or uncertainties associated with limited samples from extreme thresholds 3 3 2 change in spatial extent we further assess temporal changes in the spatial extent of different types of compound events from 2015 to 2100 and calculate changes in the slope of spatial extents as shown in fig 6 the significant increase in the spatial extents of cmdhes cadhes and chdhes is projected for different future periods the average spatial extent of three cdhes generally increases from near term to long term period as shown in fig 6 b this indicates that more areas will be affected by cdhes in the future under the ssp5 8 5 scenarios the increased spatial extent of cmdhes is accompanied by increased coverage of high temperatures and decreased coverage of meteorological droughts based on precipitation as shown in previous studies zeng et al 2022 and fig s5 indicating the dominant role of temperature in driving the variation of cmdhes cadhes have the largest increase in spatial extent which is likely due to the increased coverage of both agricultural drought and high temperature fig s5 the spatial extent of hydrological droughts shows a slight increase not significant fig s5 which contributes to less increase in the spatial extent of chdhes compared with that of cadhes fig 6 for the three future periods the slope of changes in different types of cdhes decreases from the near term to the longterm period as shown in fig 6 c for instance the slope of spatial extent for cmdhes changes from 3 28 decade to 1 90 decade from the near term to the mid term and even shows a slight downward trend during the long term 0 55 decade the slope of the increased spatial extent of high temperature decreases from the near term to long term period from 8 25 decade to 0 57 decade as shown in fig s5 which is consistent with the pattern of slope variation in different types of cdhes the slope and changes in the spatial extent of three types of droughts during the three periods are diverse fig s5 such as the decreasing spatial extent of meteorological drought and increasing spatial extent of agricultural drought zeng et al 2022 zhao and dai 2022 the slope of the spatial extent of agricultural drought decrease from the near term to the long term period with the slope of 1 32 decade 1 22 decade and 0 61 decade for the near term mid term and long term respectively an increase but non significant pattern from near term to long term applies to the changes in hydrological drought overall the three compound events will continue to increase by the end of the 21st century but the increase rate will gradually decrease in the future associated with diverse changes in the spatial extent of individual variables 3 3 3 regional projection and uncertainty following ipcc ar6 wgi reference regions iturbide et al 2020 the global land can be divided into 44 regions fig s6 based on that we then assess the regional change in the frequency unit see methods of different types of compound events during three future periods relative to the base period 1995 2014 over these regions fig 7 the frequency of different types of compound events in the future will increase over most regions and a larger increase is projected during the long term period the high increases are shown in several regions such as s central america sca for cmdhes the mediterranean med for cadhes and chdhes in the long term we also assess the uncertainty in the simulation of cdhes at the regional scale by defining the uncertainty as the difference between the 75th and 25th quantiles of the box greve et al 2018 wu et al 2021c the uncertainties among the models are relatively small for cmdhes relative to cadhes and chdhes as shown in fig 7 for most regions the uncertainties during the long term are larger than that during other future periods specifically the percentages of regions with maximum variability between 25th and 75th quantiles in the long term compared with other future periods for the three compound events are 70 45 cmdhes 81 82 cadhes and 81 82 chdhes respectively such uncertainty can result from multiple factors e g physical parameterization and internal variability and needs further investigation in the future 4 discussion 4 1 implication the development of different drought types in the hydrological cycle i e drought propagation has attracted increasing attention in recent decades gevaert et al 2018 van lanen et al 2013 wu et al 2018 under anthropogenic global warming the persistence of warm temperatures and drought propagation highlights the temporal linkage among different types of compound events in the hydrological cycle feng et al 2023 which may take a toll on the socioeconomics and ecosystems in this study we find a significant increase in frequency for cmdhes cadhes and chdhes in different future periods a higher increase in the frequency of three types of cdhes is projected in large regions e g northern south america and europe which underlines the amplified risk of increased cdhes in a warmer climate the cadhes and chdhes based on soil moisture and surface runoff respectively show different spatial responses e g sign and magnitude of variations to cmdhes in some regions thus these compound events cannot substitute as alternatives for each other highlighting the importance and necessity of considering the response of different types of compound events to climate change from the hydrologic cycle perspective 4 2 limitation there are some limitations in this study regarding the inherent uncertainty from climate model simulations and indicator threshold selection although there is robust agreement on the sign of the variations in the frequency of three types of compound events in large regions fig 5 large discrepancies in the magnitude or even sign of these changes among the cmip6 models exist as shown in fig 7 due to the inherent uncertainties in the simulations of precipitation soil moisture runoff and temperature in cmip6 models hou et al 2023 ukkola et al 2020 zhao and dai 2022 uncertainty analysis and quantification in the projection of multiple types of cdhes should be conducted in future studies based on different cmip6 models in addition previous studies highlighted a different changing pattern of surface and total soil moisture drought in some regions like america and europe zhao and dai 2022 besides this study only focuses on surface runoff responding to changes in climate variables at shorter timescales but not total runoff responding at longer time scales touma et al 2015 in defining compound hydrological drought and hot events thus the assessment of changes based on soil moisture of different depths or total runoff berg and sheffield 2017 wang and miao 2022 zhao and dai 2022 zhou et al 2022 is also important to understand the future changes in cadhes and chdhes for example for the future changes in chdhes based on total runoff fig s7 we found that the change pattern is consistent with changes in cmdhes in mid and high latitude regions which is partly due to consistent changes between precipitation and total runoff in these regions cook et al 2020 wang et al 2022 and differ from those based on surface runoff moreover we select the period 1995 2014 as the reference period to assess the changes of future compound events in this study selecting different thresholds based on different reference periods may lead to a discrepancy in variations of extremes jones et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 including cdhes feng et al 2021 for example a considerable positive bias can be found for cmdhes in some regions 65 96 of total grids compared with gldas with relatively larger bias in australia when applying the 1986 2005 as the reference period commonly used in ipcc ar5 ipcc 2013 as shown in fig s8 5 conclusion understanding how drought dynamics will change under persistent high temperatures in the future from a compound perspective is an important but rarely explored research area which involves a series of complex processes e g precipitation soil moisture and runoff across disciplinary boundaries climate meteorology and hydrology based on simulations from cmip6 models and reference data from gldas we evaluate the performance of models in simulating different types of compound droughts and hot events cdhes and assess the future projection of the frequency and spatial extent of different types of cdhes including compound meteorological drought hot events cmdhes compound agricultural drought hot events cadhes and compound hydrological drought hot events chdhes at the global scale under the ssp5 8 5 scenario we found that cmip6 climate models can reproduce the spatial distribution of three types of compound events compared with gldas there is high consistency in the temporal changes of different cdhes between cmip6 and gldas which indicates the relatively good performance of models in simulating temporal changes at the global scale with a larger discrepancy in certain regions such as australia for the future projection under ssp5 8 5 scenarios the frequency and spatial extent of three compound events show a marked increase during three future periods with a relatively large increase in cadhes and chdhes compared with cmdhes globally the average frequency of three compound events i e cmdhes cadhes and chdhes is projected to increase by 73 74 113 95 and 114 17 during the long term 2081 2100 relative to the base period 1995 2014 based on thirteen cmip6 models respectively in addition the uncertainty of cadhes and chdhes is larger than cmdhes in the future in most regions overall the results of this study can provide useful insights into climate model performance for model developers in addition it also provides valuable information for stakeholders to anticipate the negative impacts of cdhes and devise mitigation measures that alleviate the risks of compound extremes across

2353,global warming can result in changes in droughts and hot events or compound droughts and hot events cdhes which can take a heavy toll on the society and environment recent studies have made substantial progress in the projection of these events however previous projection studies mostly focus on the concurrences of meteorological droughts and hot events but ignore the difference among various cdhes specifically the concurrence of hot events and different types of droughts e g agricultural droughts and hydrological droughts has been seldom explored from a hydrological perspective based on phase six of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 we evaluate changes in different types of cdhes including compound meteorological drought hot events cmdhes compound agricultural drought hot events cadhes and compound hydrological drought hot events chdhes for different future periods at the global scale based on comparisons with data from global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 0 cmip6 can reproduce the overall spatial distribution and temporal variation of different cdhes at the global scale in addition the frequency and spatial extent of the three compound events show a marked increase during different future periods relative to the base period 1995 2014 the projected increase in global average frequency of cmdhes in the long term period is lower than that of cadhes increase by 73 74 and 113 95 for cmdhes and cadhes respectively the uncertainty in the simulation of cadhes and chdhes is relatively larger than cmdhes in the future periods over most regions the results of this study highlight the urgent demand for adaptation measures of cdhes to cope with compound extremes in the future keywords drought dry and hot compound events cmip6 data availability i have shared the link to the data 1 introduction the concurrent or consecutive occurrences of multiple hazards or events are commonly termed compound events which can lead to disastrous repercussions even though the individual hazards or and events may not be extreme hao et al 2022 leonard et al 2014 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 among multiple types of compound events compound droughts and hot events cdhes at different time scales have attractedincreasing attention recently feng et al 2021 li et al 2022 mukherjee et al 2020 sippel et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 multiple lines of evidence have shown that cdhes may lead to a broader and larger impact on natural and social environments than do individual droughts or high temperature extremes poschlod et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 zscheischler et al 2020 for instance significant impacts of cdhes on food security water resources vegetation settlements and infrastructure over various regions have been observed in the past decades hao et al 2022 such as 2003 2018 in europe bastos et al 2020 fink et al 2004 and 2010 in russia trenberth and fasullo 2012 in addition a consensus already exists that cdhes have increased significantly in large regions of global land areas over the last few decades feng et al 2021 hao et al 2013 kirono et al 2017 manning et al 2019 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 wu et al 2021a zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the significant impacts and increased occurrences of cdhes call for an improved understanding of future changes in cdhes which can provide valuable information to risk managers decision makers and engineers under a warming climate recently increased attention has been paid to the variation in high temperature accompanied by precipitation deficits i e compound meteorological droughts and hot events hereafter cmdhes during future periods based on climate model simulations from phase 5 of coupled model intercomparison project i e cmip5 at the global scale mukherjee et al 2022 sarhadi et al 2018 weber et al 2020 wu et al 2021b zhan et al 2020 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 for instance based on cmip5 simulations under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario wu et al 2021b showed global area affected by cmdhes will increase to about 1 7 1 8 times by the end of the 21st century relative to that during 1950 1999 as a new generation of climate models cmip6 simulations under different shared socioeconomic pathway representative concentration pathway ssp rcp scenarios combine both socioeconomic and technological development and fill gaps in previous rcps in cmip5 model simulations o neill et al 2016 the performance of cmip6 models in cmdhes ridder et al 2021 wu et al 2021c has been assessed to understand uncertainties in model simulations chen and yuan 2022 muthuvel et al 2023 for instance the useful skills of the cmip6 models in capturing the simultaneous occurrence of heat waves and meteorological drought has been found in large regions including north america europe and eurasia ridder et al 2021 based on cmip6 simulations extensive studies have highlighted the potential increase in cmdhes in the future periods with continued global warming meng et al 2022 ridder et al 2022 vogel et al 2020 wu et al 2021c zhang et al 2022 arguably a meteorological drought over an extended period due to precipitation deficits may further result in depleted soil moisture i e agricultural droughts and declined runoff streamflow i e hydrological droughts van loon 2015 vicente serrano et al 2022 different types of droughts have increased in large regions along with enhanced temperature related extremes for historical periods dai 2013 spinoni et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2022 which may increase the likelihood of concurrence of temperature extremes and agricultural hydrological droughts plaguing agricultural systems or crippling energy sectors recent studies have paid increasing attention to the changing patterns of agricultural hydrological droughts accompanied by high temperatures for instance high temperature extremes or enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand aed can increase evapotranspiration dry out vegetation and soil luo et al 2017 miralles et al 2019 and further cause depleted water resources e g runoff streamflow lake and groundwater brunner et al 2021 das et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2014 woodhouse et al 2016 which may damage agricultural production affect the domestic water supply and reduce hydropower generation feng et al 2022 under anthropogenic global warming temperature will continue to rise in the future which may further increase the concurrence of high temperatures and different types of droughts in the coming decades the potential increase of these extremes can result in risks that may cascade across sectors and regions ipcc 2022 highlighting the paramount importance of risk assessments of cdhes based on different drought types or different stages of the water cycle in the future however projections of different types of cdhes for future periods on a global scale are still lacking the objective of this study therefore is to assess the spatial and temporal variation in different compound droughts and hot events for the future period on a global scale based on climate model simulations from cmip6 we first evaluate changes in different types of cdhes during the historical period through comparisons with the reference data from global land data assimilation system gldas we then project the changes in cdhes for different future periods we focus on the ssp5 8 5 scenario which assumes the worst scenario pathway o neill et al 2016 wang et al 2021 building on these assessments we try to answer two questions 1 how do cmip6 models perform in simulating different types of compound events 2 what is the difference in variation of different types of compound events during future periods under the ssp5 8 5 scenario 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 gldas to assess the performance of cmip6 models we obtain monthly temperature total precipitation soil moisture and surface runoff from the global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 0 the gldas 2 0 data with a 0 25 degree resolution spanning 1948 2014 are provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa rodell et al 2004 the soil moisture from gldas is divided into four vertical layers including 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm here we focus on the shallow 0 10 cm soil moisture all variables are re gridded to the same resolution of 2 2 with cmip6 models based on the nearest neighbor interpolation 2 1 2 cmip6 multi model ensemble simulations of monthly 2 m near surface air temperature tas total precipitation rate pr top 10 cm soil moisture content mrsos and total surface runoff mrros from cmip6 models are selected for this study which includes simulations for the historical period 1955 2014 in this study and future periods following intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sixth assessment report ar6 ipcc 2022 we select three periods i e 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2081 2100 to define near term mid term and long term to assess the future risk of compound events models that include variables of interest for two experiments historical and ssp5 8 5 are selected in total we selected thirteen models table s1 for the model evaluation and future projection all cmip6 model outputs are re gridded to the common resolution 2 2 based on the nearest neighbor interpolation in this study the multi model ensembles mmes are constructed by using equal weights to all thirteen models i e the multi model ensemble means hereafter mmem to reduce uncertainties resulting from model differences 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identification of compound events there are different ways to define cdhes such as the combined threshold approach feng et al 2021 ridder et al 2022 zscheischler et al 2018 and joint distribution approach muthuvel and amai 2022 muthuvel et al 2023 shah and mishra 2020 here we apply the combined threshold approach to define cdhes on a monthly time scale this non parametric approach is easy to implement without making assumptions about the distribution family the hot conditions and droughts are identified using multiple variables namely temperature t for hot conditions precipitation p for meteorological drought shallow soil moisture s for agricultural drought and surface runoff r for hydrological drought at each grid point a compound event is considered to occur when the temperature is higher than a relative threshold and precipitation soil moisture surface runoff is lower than a threshold at the same time specifically compound droughts and hot events are defined based on the concurrence of drought variables i e precipitation soil moisture and runoff below the 50th percentile and temperature above the 50th percentile for each month during the period of interest i e historical periods and three future periods the thresholds of each variable are defined based on the base period 1995 2014 which is adopted by ipcc ipcc 2021 in addition plenty of major extreme events have occurred in this timeframe including the millennium droughts 1997 to 2010 in australia yildirim et al 2022 extreme droughts in china from 2000 to 2002 zhang et al 2019 and the severe droughts in south asia during 2002 muthuvel and amai 2022 thus applying the thresholds from this period can help us compare future extremes with these major extreme events in recent decades building on this three types of compound events can be defined for further analysis including compound meteorological droughts and hot events cmdhes t50 p50 compound agricultural droughts and hot events cadhes t50 s50 and compound hydrological droughts and hot events chdhes t50 r50 2 2 2 characteristics of compound events we mainly focus on the frequency and spatial extent of cdhes to assess the spatial and temporal variation here the frequency of compound events f dh for each grid during a specific period is defined as the number of months with occurrences of cdhes n 1 divided by the total number of months n and then multiplied by 100 unit which can be expressed as 1 f dh n 1 n 100 in addition the annual spatial extent s dh is defined as the number of grids covered by compound events averaged occurrence of 12 months for each year divided by the total number of grid points over the global land area which can be expressed as 2 s dh i 1 i m 1 12 o m i i 12 100 where o m i is the occurrence i e 0 or 1 of cdhes in month m at grid i i is the total number of grid points over global land area building on this we first compare the spatial distribution of frequency f dh and temporal variation of spatial extent s dh based on gldas and cmip6 models during the historical period 1955 2014 historical simulation data from cmip6 models extend to 2014 the relative change rc in the number of compound events during three future periods i e 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2081 2100 compared with that during the base period 1995 2014 can be expressed as follows 3 rc n f n b n b 100 where n b and n f are the number of compound events in the base period and future period respectively 2 2 3 the mann kendall mk trend and sen s slope test to assess the trend of changes in the spatial extent of different compound event types we apply the mk trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 here the sen s slope is applied to detect the magnitude of the linear trend of spatial extent which can be calculated 4 β m e d i a n x j x i j i where β represents the slope of the trend test x i and x j represent sample values i j for the time series x t t 1 2 n n indicates the length of spatial extent series 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 frequency distribution of cdhes to evaluate the performance of cmip6 models the spatial distributions of the frequency of three compound events cmdhes cadhes and chdhes are calculated first see methods fig 1 illustrates the spatial distribution of the frequency of different types of compound events based on gldas and cmip6 during the historical period from 1955 to 2014 the frequency of three compound events shows an overall consistent pattern which is related to the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural hydrological drought afshar et al 2022 feng et al 2023 zeng et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 specifically the regions with relatively low soil moisture and surface runoff generally correspond well to the dry center of precipitation and vice versa during the historical period qiao et al 2022 a high frequency of cmdhes cadhes and chdhes in central north america northern south america eastern europe southern asia and eastern china is observed from gldas these regions with a high frequency of compound events are generally consistent with results from cmip6 as shown in fig 1 d f indicating that cmip6 models can reproduce the overall spatial distribution of the three types of cdhes to further analyze the frequency difference between gldas and cmip6 the relative bias between gldas and cmip6 is shown in fig 1 g i these assessments reveal that a positive bias exists for cmdhes in certain regions 49 99 of total grids such as eastern south america most of africa southern asia and eastern australia the performance of cmip6 models in simulating compound events is related to the simulation performance of individual variables for example previous studies have shown that simulated precipitation from cmip6 is underestimated in south america and central africa compared with gldas qiao et al 2022 which may contribute to the higher frequency of cmdhes in cmip6 than that in gldas in these regions for cadhes a comparison of the cmip6 and gldas reveals a positive bias in large regions 57 30 of total grids such as eastern south america most of africa southern asia and eastern australia this may be related to the lower surface soil moisture simulated by cmip6 compared with gldas in these regions qiao et al 2022 which likely induces more cadhes in cmip6 models for chdhes the bias between gldas and cmip6 is largely negative in most regions about 70 00 of total grids which is probably because those cmip6 models produce high levels of surface runoff compared with that from gldas qiao et al 2022 causing a small number of chdhes in cmip6 a more detailed look at the regional difference in the frequency of cdhes for six continents i e north america south america europe africa asia and australia between gldas and cmip6 during 1955 2014 is provided in fig 2 with the relative bias between gldas and cmip6 shown in table 1 cmip6 model can reproduce the comparative relationship of the three types of compound events in gldas e g the frequency of cadhes is the highest in almost all continents high consistency between model simulations and gldas exists over europe with a low relative bias for cmdhes larger differences between the frequency of cadhes and chdhes from gldas and cmip6 simulations are shown in africa and australia 3 1 2 historical spatial extent of cdhes we then compare temporal changes in the annual spatial extent of the three types of compound events from 1955 to 2014 across the globe fig 3 the temporal variation in the spatial extent from cmip6 has relatively high pearson correlation coefficients with gldas i e 0 84 0 85 and 0 85 for cmdhes cadhes and chdhes respectively which indicates a relatively good simulation performance from cmip6 models at the global scale the temporal variation highlights a significant increase in the spatial extent of three compound events cmdhes cadhes and chdhes based on gldas especially after the 1990s fig 3 which is generally simulated well from cmip6 models for example the slopes of the spatial extent of cmdhes are 2 55 decade and 2 68 decade based on gldas and cmip6 respectively meanwhile the comparative relationship of spatial extent among three compound events is overall consistent in both datasets specifically the slope of the spatial extent of cadhes 2 80 decade is the highest followed by cmdhes 2 68 decade and chdhes 1 87 decade based on cmip6 models which is highly consistent with the results in gldas i e 2 80 decade 2 55 decade and 2 30 decade for cadhes cmdhes and chdhes respectively moreover we also find larger variability shaded area in the simulation of chdhes as shown in fig 3 c at the continental scale a consistent increase in the spatial extent of different types of cdhes with a high correlation between results from gldas and cmip6 is also shown in almost all continents in fig s1 however some exceptions exist in certain continents such as australia specifically the correlation coefficient of the spatial extent of those compound events between cmip6 models and gldas over australia is relatively low non significant it indicates the low performance of cmip6 models in simulating cdhes in australia which is consistent with previous studies ridder et al 2021 3 2 projection of hydro meteorological variables since changes in compound events are highly dependent on changes in individual variables we first assess changes in global mean temperature precipitation soil moisture and runoff in the 21st century under the ssp5 8 5 scenario fig 4 shows simulations from thirteen cmip6 models in this study these simulations show a continuing increase in temperature from 2021 2040 to 2081 2100 compared with the base period 1995 2014 higher temperature tends to lead to greater rates of evapotranspiration which may cause a higher frequency of agricultural drought as shown by the significant decline of soil moisture in fig 4 for example the soil moisture changes from 0 81 to 4 12 from 2021 2040 to 2081 2100 compared with that during the base period there is also an increase in mean precipitation runoff which changes from 1 66 0 10 in 2021 2040 to 8 27 0 13 in 2081 2100 different directions of individual variables changes also shown at different continents in fig s2 may cause complicated changes in corresponding compound events in the future thus given the interwoven and nonlinear relationships among temperature and hydro meteorological elements i e precipitation soil moisture and runoff in the future it is imperative to evaluate the compound events that span different aspects of the hydrologic cycle i e cmdhes cahdes and chdhes in a warmer climate 3 3 global projection of compound events 3 3 1 change in frequency to assess the future variation of three types of compound events we show the relative changes rc in the frequency of cmdhes cadhes and chdhes during three future periods i e near term mid term and long term under the ssp5 8 5 scenario overall the frequency of three types of compound events i e cmdhes cadhes and chdhes is projected to increase in the three future periods compared with the base period 1995 2014 fig 5 the increase in the frequency of different types of cdhes is consistent over northern south america parts of europe and the mediterranean region which is likely related to enhanced temperature and decreased precipitation shallow soil moisture and surface runoff over these regions in a warming climate fig s3 aadhar and mishra 2020 cook et al 2020 dutta and maity 2022 li and li 2022 naumann et al 2018 stevenson et al 2022 ukkola et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2022 zhao and dai 2022 in addition a slight increase or even decrease in frequency for three compound events is projected in some regions such as parts of extra tropical south america eastern africa and southern asia this is likely related to the increase in precipitation soil moisture surface runoff over those regions as shown in fig s3 for cmdhes the average frequency of cmdhes over global regions with the high model agreement more than 80 of the models agree on the sign of changing pattern enhances by 43 87 during the near term which increases to 73 74 in the long term compared with that during the base period compared with cmdhes the increase in cadhes is larger and more widespread in most regions some evidence has indicated that agricultural drought based on soil moisture is more widespread than drought estimated using precipitation under ssp5 8 5 by the end of the twenty first century cook et al 2020 which further causes more cadhes than cmdhes we confirm that this conclusion generally holds when employing more extreme thresholds than the 50th percentile e g the results based on the 30th and 70th percentile are shown in fig s4 note that some regions with only a marginal increase in cmdhes like northern north america and eurasia are projected to experience a remarkable increase in cadhes precipitation is the most important and direct factor among others affecting soil moisture zhang et al 2008 and the wetting of soil caused by precipitation is an intuitive process in nature koster et al 2004 koster et al 2003 however for some large regions like eurasia covering an extensive range of longitudes and latitudes the variables that can affect soil moisture are more complicated and diverse which may cause a more complex land atmosphere interaction and make the influence of precipitation on soil moisture weaker sang et al 2021 this highlights that precipitation is not the only determinant of soil moisture and other significant processes e g enhanced evaporative demand increased plant water use affecting soil moisture also change with warming cook et al 2020 hua et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 which may cause more concurrence of agricultural drought and high temperature i e cadhes in these regions under a warming climate an extensive and significant increase of chdhes is shown in large regions like northern north america eurasia southern africa and australia as shown in fig 5 g i note that an increase in precipitation over certain regions may not directly translate to enhanced surface runoff for example precipitation is projected to increase over the middle to high latitudes of northern hemisphere due to increased specific humidity and increased water vapor transport from the tropics dutta and maity 2022 ipcc 2021 li and li 2022 however surface runoff decreases in western north america canada and western russia cook et al 2020 as shown in fig s3 in addition we did not find a consistent pattern between changes in cadhes and chdhes based on different thresholds e g the relative change in cadhes is similar to that in chdhes in fig 5 while the relative change in chdhes is larger than cadhes based on a higher threshold as shown in fig s4 which may be related to complex influencing factors of runoff e g watershed features snow and vegetation or uncertainties associated with limited samples from extreme thresholds 3 3 2 change in spatial extent we further assess temporal changes in the spatial extent of different types of compound events from 2015 to 2100 and calculate changes in the slope of spatial extents as shown in fig 6 the significant increase in the spatial extents of cmdhes cadhes and chdhes is projected for different future periods the average spatial extent of three cdhes generally increases from near term to long term period as shown in fig 6 b this indicates that more areas will be affected by cdhes in the future under the ssp5 8 5 scenarios the increased spatial extent of cmdhes is accompanied by increased coverage of high temperatures and decreased coverage of meteorological droughts based on precipitation as shown in previous studies zeng et al 2022 and fig s5 indicating the dominant role of temperature in driving the variation of cmdhes cadhes have the largest increase in spatial extent which is likely due to the increased coverage of both agricultural drought and high temperature fig s5 the spatial extent of hydrological droughts shows a slight increase not significant fig s5 which contributes to less increase in the spatial extent of chdhes compared with that of cadhes fig 6 for the three future periods the slope of changes in different types of cdhes decreases from the near term to the longterm period as shown in fig 6 c for instance the slope of spatial extent for cmdhes changes from 3 28 decade to 1 90 decade from the near term to the mid term and even shows a slight downward trend during the long term 0 55 decade the slope of the increased spatial extent of high temperature decreases from the near term to long term period from 8 25 decade to 0 57 decade as shown in fig s5 which is consistent with the pattern of slope variation in different types of cdhes the slope and changes in the spatial extent of three types of droughts during the three periods are diverse fig s5 such as the decreasing spatial extent of meteorological drought and increasing spatial extent of agricultural drought zeng et al 2022 zhao and dai 2022 the slope of the spatial extent of agricultural drought decrease from the near term to the long term period with the slope of 1 32 decade 1 22 decade and 0 61 decade for the near term mid term and long term respectively an increase but non significant pattern from near term to long term applies to the changes in hydrological drought overall the three compound events will continue to increase by the end of the 21st century but the increase rate will gradually decrease in the future associated with diverse changes in the spatial extent of individual variables 3 3 3 regional projection and uncertainty following ipcc ar6 wgi reference regions iturbide et al 2020 the global land can be divided into 44 regions fig s6 based on that we then assess the regional change in the frequency unit see methods of different types of compound events during three future periods relative to the base period 1995 2014 over these regions fig 7 the frequency of different types of compound events in the future will increase over most regions and a larger increase is projected during the long term period the high increases are shown in several regions such as s central america sca for cmdhes the mediterranean med for cadhes and chdhes in the long term we also assess the uncertainty in the simulation of cdhes at the regional scale by defining the uncertainty as the difference between the 75th and 25th quantiles of the box greve et al 2018 wu et al 2021c the uncertainties among the models are relatively small for cmdhes relative to cadhes and chdhes as shown in fig 7 for most regions the uncertainties during the long term are larger than that during other future periods specifically the percentages of regions with maximum variability between 25th and 75th quantiles in the long term compared with other future periods for the three compound events are 70 45 cmdhes 81 82 cadhes and 81 82 chdhes respectively such uncertainty can result from multiple factors e g physical parameterization and internal variability and needs further investigation in the future 4 discussion 4 1 implication the development of different drought types in the hydrological cycle i e drought propagation has attracted increasing attention in recent decades gevaert et al 2018 van lanen et al 2013 wu et al 2018 under anthropogenic global warming the persistence of warm temperatures and drought propagation highlights the temporal linkage among different types of compound events in the hydrological cycle feng et al 2023 which may take a toll on the socioeconomics and ecosystems in this study we find a significant increase in frequency for cmdhes cadhes and chdhes in different future periods a higher increase in the frequency of three types of cdhes is projected in large regions e g northern south america and europe which underlines the amplified risk of increased cdhes in a warmer climate the cadhes and chdhes based on soil moisture and surface runoff respectively show different spatial responses e g sign and magnitude of variations to cmdhes in some regions thus these compound events cannot substitute as alternatives for each other highlighting the importance and necessity of considering the response of different types of compound events to climate change from the hydrologic cycle perspective 4 2 limitation there are some limitations in this study regarding the inherent uncertainty from climate model simulations and indicator threshold selection although there is robust agreement on the sign of the variations in the frequency of three types of compound events in large regions fig 5 large discrepancies in the magnitude or even sign of these changes among the cmip6 models exist as shown in fig 7 due to the inherent uncertainties in the simulations of precipitation soil moisture runoff and temperature in cmip6 models hou et al 2023 ukkola et al 2020 zhao and dai 2022 uncertainty analysis and quantification in the projection of multiple types of cdhes should be conducted in future studies based on different cmip6 models in addition previous studies highlighted a different changing pattern of surface and total soil moisture drought in some regions like america and europe zhao and dai 2022 besides this study only focuses on surface runoff responding to changes in climate variables at shorter timescales but not total runoff responding at longer time scales touma et al 2015 in defining compound hydrological drought and hot events thus the assessment of changes based on soil moisture of different depths or total runoff berg and sheffield 2017 wang and miao 2022 zhao and dai 2022 zhou et al 2022 is also important to understand the future changes in cadhes and chdhes for example for the future changes in chdhes based on total runoff fig s7 we found that the change pattern is consistent with changes in cmdhes in mid and high latitude regions which is partly due to consistent changes between precipitation and total runoff in these regions cook et al 2020 wang et al 2022 and differ from those based on surface runoff moreover we select the period 1995 2014 as the reference period to assess the changes of future compound events in this study selecting different thresholds based on different reference periods may lead to a discrepancy in variations of extremes jones et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 including cdhes feng et al 2021 for example a considerable positive bias can be found for cmdhes in some regions 65 96 of total grids compared with gldas with relatively larger bias in australia when applying the 1986 2005 as the reference period commonly used in ipcc ar5 ipcc 2013 as shown in fig s8 5 conclusion understanding how drought dynamics will change under persistent high temperatures in the future from a compound perspective is an important but rarely explored research area which involves a series of complex processes e g precipitation soil moisture and runoff across disciplinary boundaries climate meteorology and hydrology based on simulations from cmip6 models and reference data from gldas we evaluate the performance of models in simulating different types of compound droughts and hot events cdhes and assess the future projection of the frequency and spatial extent of different types of cdhes including compound meteorological drought hot events cmdhes compound agricultural drought hot events cadhes and compound hydrological drought hot events chdhes at the global scale under the ssp5 8 5 scenario we found that cmip6 climate models can reproduce the spatial distribution of three types of compound events compared with gldas there is high consistency in the temporal changes of different cdhes between cmip6 and gldas which indicates the relatively good performance of models in simulating temporal changes at the global scale with a larger discrepancy in certain regions such as australia for the future projection under ssp5 8 5 scenarios the frequency and spatial extent of three compound events show a marked increase during three future periods with a relatively large increase in cadhes and chdhes compared with cmdhes globally the average frequency of three compound events i e cmdhes cadhes and chdhes is projected to increase by 73 74 113 95 and 114 17 during the long term 2081 2100 relative to the base period 1995 2014 based on thirteen cmip6 models respectively in addition the uncertainty of cadhes and chdhes is larger than cmdhes in the future in most regions overall the results of this study can provide useful insights into climate model performance for model developers in addition it also provides valuable information for stakeholders to anticipate the negative impacts of cdhes and devise mitigation measures that alleviate the risks of compound extremes across

2354,by leveraging monitoring data for the gran sasso carbonate aquifer during two significant seismic sequences that hit central italy in recent years this study investigates the possibility of using memory enabled deep learning algorithms as meaningful tools for an enhanced modelling of the hydrological response of karst aquifers subject to earthquake phenomena meteorological hydrological and seismic data are used to train and validate long short term memory networks lstm in one and multiple day ahead flow forecasting exercises aimed at assessing model sensitivities to input variables and modelling choices training data and parameters of the models results indicate that the models fairly reproduce the flow patterns for the considered spring in the gran sasso aquifer thus supporting the potential use of these models for hydrological applications in similar areas provided that sufficient data are available for the training of the network keywords earthquake hydrology seismic sequences karst aquifer deep learning lstm central italy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the groundwater flow in fractured karst aquifers is the result of the complex interplay between many components involving hydrological processes e g rainfall and snow accumulation surface runoff infiltration geological and morphological features of the aquifer as well as anthropogenic factors bonacci 2004 ding et al 2020 all these elements affect recharge discharge mechanisms with overlapping effects thus making the identification of individual contribution of each component to the final outflow very difficult duran et al 2020 the quantitative modelling of karst hydrology typically relies on physically based or conceptual models which are however inherently uncertain birk et al 2006 hartmann et al 2014 li et al 2016 zoghbi and basha 2019 duran et al 2020 in seismic areas the situation is even more complex given that earthquakes are known to be responsible for significant alterations in the hydrological systems as a consequence of dynamic strain modifications inducing formation of microcracks fracture cleaning phenomena and temporary changes in permeability brodsky et al 2003 casini et al 2006 wang and manga 2010 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 manga and wang 2015 these alterations cause short and or long term impacts on spring and river flows rojstaczer et al 1995 manga et al 2003 montgomery and manga 2003 manga and wang 2015 mohr et al 2017 petitta et al 2018 di matteo et al 2020 water table roeloffs 1998 wang et al 2004 wang and chia 2008 shi et al 2015 petitta et al 2018 as well as chemical composition of water claesson et al 2004 onda et al 2018 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 barberio et al 2017 nakagawa et al 2020 in recent years the aquifers in the italian apennines have been described in many studies to be prone to hydrological alterations following major seismic events with a common observed increase in spring and streamflow discharge for instance esposito et al 2001 reported significant hydrogeological changes within 200 km from the epicentral zone for four earthquakes that struck central southern apennines in the last two centuries amoruso et al 2011 and adinolfi falcone et al 2012 analyzed the changes in the hydrogeology of the gran sasso carbonate aquifer after the 2009 l aquila earthquake increases in river and spring flows as well as in water table have been registered also for the most recent 2016 2017 seismic sequence in central italy with effects observed up to a distance of 100 km from the epicentral area de luca et al 2018 petitta et al 2018 mastrorillo et al 2020 valigi et al 2019 di matteo et al 2020 despite the relatively large amount of literature on the topic none of these previous studies have tried to quantitatively interpret the relationship between fluctuations in groundwater flow precipitation snowmelt etc and the features of the seismic events e g magnitude and distance between the observation site and the epicenter in such contexts when the underlying relationships cannot be fully explained in physical terms machine learning data driven approaches may be considered useful tools for modelling the hydrological response of the aquifer dikshit et al 2020 these methods starting with simpler artificial neural networks anns have been proved to be effectively employed in many hydrological applications from streamflow forecasting to groundwater and water management modelling sivakumar et al 2002 hu et al 2008 wu et al 2009 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 in recent years to overcome anns limitation in not properly accounting for the sequential order information of input data recurrent neural networks rnns have been developed to selectively convey information across sequence steps kratzert et al 2018 dikshit et al 2020 among rnns long short term memory lstm neural networks hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 have gained increasing attention among hydrologists due to their powerful capability in learning long term dependencies in time series data kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 an et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 the objective of the present paper is then to test the implementation of deep learning algorithms lstms to analyze the possible contribution of these approaches in supporting a quantitative modelling of the hydrological alterations in karst aquifers subject to seismic activity and then to assess their potential as meaningful tools for reliably predicting spring flows in such areas the study region is represented by the northern part of the gran sasso carbonate aquifer impacted by the 2009 and 2016 2017 seismic sequences in central italy which induced abrupt changes in the flow regime of monitored springs details on the available hydrometeorological and seismic variables as well as on the methodological approach followed in this study are provided in section 2 while the results presented and discussed in section 3 form the basis for the conclusions reported in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 overview of the study area and available data the study area fig 1 is the gran sasso carbonate aquifer located in the northern part of the abruzzo region italy which as most of the central southern apennines is a seismic area characterized by normal faulting earthquakes reaching maximum magnitudes close to 7 0 de luca et al 2000 2009 bagh et al 2007 frepoli et al 2017 this is a large fractured aquifer with well defined boundaries extending over an area of about 700 km2 petitta and tallini 2002 and perennial groundwater reserves estimated in the order of 1010 m3 amoruso et al 2011 due to its karst features with joints faults and intense fracturing of rock masses recharge quantities are huge and characterized by a net infiltration of over 800 mm per year boni et al 1986 scozzafava and tallini 2001 on an annual average rainfall of about 1200 mm curci et al 2021 the gran sasso supplies a total discharge of more than 18 m3 s from its springs with the major ones located at the discharge zones at its boundaries since the 1980s after the construction of underground infrastructures including highway tunnels and laboratories a portion of the groundwater has been partially drained and exploited for drinking purposes adinolfi falcone et al 2008 this drainage system consists of two 5 km long channels conveying water to the south western assergi site as fig 1 and north eastern exists of the highway tunnels petitta and tallini 2002 as described in the introduction previous studies described significant short and mid term changes in the hydrological characteristics of groundwater flow at the assergi site after the 2009 earthquake in l aquila with an epicentral distance of about 14 km from as as a possible consequence of changes in the pore pressure and increase in the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer induced by mechanisms of fracture unclogging amoruso et al 2011 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 indeed the available hydrological data measured on april 2009 indicated a sudden increase in the spring discharge which remained higher than the historical flow registered

crucial for the predictive accuracy of black box models no established general instructions exist for setting them hutter et al 2014 reimers and gurevych 2017 kratzert et al 2018 in this study the matlab s deep learning toolbox was used to develop the lstms and therefore after a preliminary assessment most of the hyperparameters were kept at their default values while the ones considered in the sensitivity analysis are described hereinafter adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 based on stochastic gradient descent was employed in all runs in the optimization process one iteration for the complete training dataset is referred to as an epoch and nepochs defines the maximum number of iterations which was randomly changed between 100 and 300 other tested hyperparameters included the

several lead times up to 14 days with respect to the known flow values for a given lead time the procedure consisted in predicting qt 1 at each time step t using the time series of the input variables from 1 to t with the last tlag 1 elements of the input q series q t 1 t lag q t 1 q t replaced by the last tlag 1 values of the predicted series 3 results and discussion 3 1 one day ahead flow forecasting exercise model sensitivities fig 7 summarizes the results for the one day ahead forecast in terms of rmse similar patterns have been observed in terms of mae and r2 between the standardized observed and predicted flows under the different combinations of input variables runs i to x as defined in fig 5 model s hyperparameters nepochs bs and nhu and start date of the training period id train over the 2015 2018 time series the first evident and quite obvious result regards the influence of the antecedent daily flow values on the predictive performances of the developed lstms with the rmse registering an average threefold increase when q is excluded from the input parameters run x in addition while indicating an overall modest influence of the hyperparameters on model accuracy especially for bs and nhu fig 7 highlights some apparently controversial results which however can be explained and used to support general warnings about potential pitfalls that may be encountered when implementing black box models for time series predictions kratzert et al 2018 cho and kim 2022 indeed the first panel of the figure shows that the most noticeable differences in the rmse are a function of id train with minimum errors median values of about 0 15 identified when the training period starts later than june july 2016 i e id train 300 for most of the runs thus suggesting the existence of a best training dataset basically characterized by a significant consistency and similarity with the target dataset this is a direct consequence of the short records available for implementing the learning process which explains besides the observed limited sensitivity of the lstms to the hyperparameters some unexpected results among the different runs in fact fig 7 clearly shows that not only the predictive accuracy does not improve with the number of considered predictors but even worsens when potentially important factors for the gran sasso aquifer as earthquake features or snow accumulation e g amoruso et al 2011 2013 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 are included into the model for instance the most complete runs i or ii provide slightly lower performances than those reported by run iii which excludes sd from the set of predictors such pattern is even more evident when analyzing the results of run v vi and vii characterized by using only hydrometeorological variables as input features but providing the minimum rmses to a certain extent by emphasizing the role of the learning period these results then suggest that the length of the available records could be a limiting factor for deriving robust conclusions on the use of lstms for predicting spring flows in karst aquifers subject to seismic activity 3 2 multiple step ahead flow forecasting exercise in consideration of the discussed problems for deriving solid conclusions when relying only on the most recent 2015 2018 time series for both training and test this section analyzes the results on the test for the 2009 2010 period in order to identify possible reliable insights on the ability of lstms in reproducing the flow features in seismic karst aquifers as the one under investigation to this aim the lstm models providing the best performances in the previous exercise for the different runs fig 7 were selected to be further applied for one and multi day ahead flow predictions over the 2009 2010 period since snow depth records started only on late 2009 after l aquila earthquake fig 3 here we focus on the runs which do not include sd among the input variables namely the most complete iii and ix and the simpler vii relying only on hydrometeorological parameters fig 5 this lag exercise can be seen as a stress test for the predicting ability of the models in consideration of the importance of antecedent flow discharge values indeed when increasing the lead times such influence is partly reduced thus allowing to recognize the possible influence of other factors furthermore tests at longer lead times can be even more interesting for practical applications such as predictions for what if analysis or missing data filling table 2 summarizes the error metrics for the selected runs at different lead times tlag while fig 8 shows for exemplificatory purposes the comparative plots of the 2009 2010 forecasting results obtained from the application of the lstms for the feature combinations iii and vii if excluding the short initialization period the figure depicts a relatively good agreement between the patterns of observed and predicted spring discharges especially at smaller lead times thus indicating a fair ability of the lstm models in resembling the flow features for a test set completely taken out from the training process interestingly while the differences between forecasts and observation become more evident with increasing tlag more markedly for run vii fig 8b the plots highlight the skill of the models in well predicting the sharp flow increase induced by the earthquake event occurred on april 2009 day 100 of the time series such result suggests that the networks seem to have effectively learned the physical mechanisms leading to sudden flow changes after main seismic events in the karst aquifer attributed in the literature from a qualitative perspective to fracture cleaning phenomena and consequent increase in the bulk hydraulic conductivity wang and manga 2010 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 manga and wang 2015 petitta et al 2018 valigi et al 2019 this is quantitatively confirmed by the results shown in table 2 which indicates similar models performances at short lead times with r2 ranging from 0 98 to 0 83 for tlag between 1 and 4 days for the three configurations however when tlag is further increased the performances of run vii the one trained with only hydrometeorological data for the 2015 2018 period drop significantly r2 0 05 while a more gradual and limited worsening with r2 values of about 0 75 0 55 for tlag 7 days can be observed for the other two combinations thus proving the positive effect of the seismic parameters on models accuracy it is worth noting that the good predictions provided by run vii at short lead times are mainly a consequence of the tendency of the model to copy the antecedent discharge values in the time series indeed as shown in the results reported in the previous section the network heavily relies on antecedent flow rates and thus predictions do not deviate much from observations for small tlag while on the other hand to capture the sudden increase in the flow rate for larger tlag information on earthquake events certainly improves the quality of the forecasting runs iii and ix 4 conclusions the characterization and investigation of karst aquifers is a complex task which makes quantitative studies on their governing physical processes quite difficult in recent years because of the excellent performance of data driven approaches in many scientific fields hydrologists have been starting to implement such algorithms in place of or combined with physically based models in their applications given this trend for the first time to the best of our knowledge the present study attempted to investigate the usability and reliability of memory enhanced neural networks lstms for modelling the hydrological behavior of karst aquifers exposed to seismic hazard which exacerbates the system complexity indeed while plenty of literature has been published on the use of machine learning algorithms for purely hydrological applications ardabili et al 2019 no previous studies on the topic have dealt with the inclusion of earthquake impacts into the modelling the results presented here especially in the multiday ahead forecasting exercise demonstrated that albeit machine learning approaches may suffer from limitations arising from insufficient data for model training which may lead to incorrect conclusions as pointed out in the sensitivity analysis discussed in section 3 1 they have potential for a successful use for flow forecasting in seismic karst areas by virtue of their ability in implicitly learning the complex geophysical mechanisms causing sudden alterations in the hydrological properties of the aquifers after main earthquake events clearly the key point will be the possibility of relying on representative long hydrometeorological and seismic time series for a proper training of the networks therefore we promote future studies aimed at corroborating our findings in regions experiencing

karst aquifer deep learning lstm central italy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the groundwater flow in fractured karst aquifers is the result of the complex interplay between many components involving hydrological processes e g rainfall and snow accumulation surface runoff infiltration geological and morphological features of the aquifer as well as anthropogenic factors bonacci 2004 ding et al 2020 all these elements affect recharge discharge mechanisms with overlapping effects thus making the identification of individual contribution of each component to the final outflow very difficult duran et al 2020 the quantitative modelling of karst hydrology typically relies on physically based or conceptual models which are however inherently uncertain birk et al 2006 hartmann et al 2014 li et al 2016 zoghbi and basha 2019 duran et al 2020 in seismic areas the situation is even more complex given that earthquakes are known to be responsible for significant alterations in the hydrological systems as a consequence of dynamic strain modifications inducing formation of microcracks fracture cleaning phenomena and temporary changes

years the aquifers in the italian apennines have been described in many studies to be prone to hydrological alterations following major seismic events with a common observed increase in spring and streamflow discharge for instance esposito et al 2001 reported significant hydrogeological changes within 200 km from the epicentral zone for four earthquakes that struck central southern apennines in the last two centuries amoruso et al 2011 and adinolfi falcone et al 2012 analyzed the changes in the hydrogeology of the gran sasso carbonate aquifer after the 2009 l aquila earthquake increases in river and spring flows as well as in water table have been registered also for the most recent 2016 2017 seismic sequence in central italy with effects observed up to a distance of 100 km from the epicentral area de luca et al 2018 petitta et al 2018 mastrorillo et al 2020 valigi et al 2019 di matteo et al 2020 despite the relatively large amount of literature on the topic none of these previous studies have tried to quantitatively interpret the relationship between fluctuations in groundwater flow precipitation snowmelt etc and the features of the seismic events e g magnitude and distance between the observation site and the epicenter in such contexts when the underlying relationships cannot be fully explained in physical terms machine learning data driven approaches may be considered useful tools for modelling the hydrological response of the aquifer dikshit et al 2020 these methods starting with simpler artificial neural networks anns have been proved to be effectively employed in many hydrological applications from streamflow forecasting to groundwater and water management modelling sivakumar et al 2002 hu et al 2008 wu et al 2009 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 in recent years to overcome anns limitation in not properly accounting for the sequential order information of input data recurrent neural networks rnns have been developed to selectively convey

hydrologists due to their powerful capability in learning long term dependencies in time series data kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 an et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 the objective of the present paper is then to test the implementation of deep learning algorithms lstms to analyze the possible contribution of these approaches in supporting a quantitative modelling of the hydrological alterations in karst aquifers subject to seismic activity and then to assess their potential as meaningful tools for reliably predicting spring flows in such areas the study region is represented by the northern part of the gran sasso carbonate aquifer impacted by the 2009 and 2016 2017 seismic sequences in central italy which induced abrupt changes in the flow regime of monitored springs details on the available hydrometeorological and seismic variables as well as on the methodological approach followed in this study are provided in section 2 while the results presented and discussed in section 3 form the basis for the conclusions reported in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 overview of the study area and available data the study area fig 1 is the gran sasso carbonate aquifer located in the northern part of the abruzzo region italy which as most of the central southern apennines is a seismic area characterized by normal faulting earthquakes reaching maximum magnitudes close to 7 0 de luca et al 2000 2009 bagh et al 2007 frepoli et al 2017 this is a large fractured aquifer with well defined boundaries extending over an area of about 700 km2 petitta and tallini 2002 and perennial groundwater reserves estimated in the order of 1010 m3 amoruso et al 2011 due to its karst features with joints faults and intense fracturing of rock masses recharge quantities are huge and characterized by a net infiltration of over 800 mm per year boni et al 1986 scozzafava and tallini 2001 on an annual average rainfall of about 1200 mm curci et al 2021 the gran sasso supplies a total discharge of more than 18 m3 s from its springs with the major ones located at the discharge zones at its boundaries since the 1980s after the construction of underground infrastructures including highway tunnels and laboratories a portion of the groundwater has been partially drained and exploited for drinking purposes adinolfi falcone et al 2008 this drainage system consists of two 5 km long channels conveying water to the south western assergi site as fig 1 and north eastern exists of the highway tunnels petitta and tallini 2002 as described in the introduction previous studies described significant short and mid term changes in the hydrological characteristics of groundwater flow at the assergi site after the 2009 earthquake in l aquila with an epicentral distance of about 14 km from as as a possible consequence of changes in the pore pressure and increase in the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer induced by mechanisms of fracture unclogging amoruso et al 2011 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 indeed the available hydrological data measured on april 2009 indicated a sudden increase in the spring discharge which remained higher than the historical flow registered before the mainshock for several months after the event as typical in fractured aquifers where recovery to pre earthquake conditions is governed by the time to reblock the fractures manga et al 2012

forecasting exercise model sensitivities fig 7 summarizes the results for the one day ahead forecast in terms of rmse similar patterns have been observed in terms of mae and r2 between the standardized observed and predicted flows under the different combinations of input variables runs i to x as defined in fig 5 model s hyperparameters nepochs bs and nhu and start date of the training period id train over the 2015 2018 time series the first evident and quite obvious result regards the influence of the antecedent daily flow values on the predictive performances of the developed lstms with the rmse registering an average threefold increase when q is excluded from the input parameters run x in addition while indicating an overall modest influence of the hyperparameters on model accuracy especially for bs and nhu fig 7 highlights some apparently controversial results which however can be explained and used to support general warnings about potential pitfalls that may be encountered when implementing black box models for time series predictions kratzert et al 2018 cho and kim 2022 indeed the first panel of the figure shows that the most noticeable differences in the rmse are a function of id train with minimum errors median values of about 0 15 identified when the training period starts later than june july 2016 i e id train 300 for most of the runs thus suggesting the existence of a best training dataset basically characterized by a significant consistency and similarity with the target dataset this is a direct consequence of the short records available for implementing the learning process which explains besides the observed limited sensitivity of the lstms to the hyperparameters some unexpected results among the different runs in fact fig 7 clearly shows that not only the predictive accuracy does not improve with the number of considered predictors but even worsens when potentially important factors for the gran sasso aquifer as earthquake features or snow accumulation e g amoruso et al 2011 2013 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 are included into the model for instance the most complete runs i or ii provide slightly lower performances than those reported by run iii which excludes sd from the set of predictors such pattern is even more evident when analyzing the results of run v vi and vii characterized by using only hydrometeorological variables as input features but providing the minimum rmses to a certain extent by emphasizing the role of the learning period these results then suggest that the length of the available records could be a limiting factor for deriving robust conclusions on the use of lstms for predicting spring flows in karst aquifers subject to seismic activity 3 2 multiple step ahead flow forecasting exercise in consideration of the discussed problems for deriving solid conclusions when relying only on the most recent 2015 2018 time series for both training and test this section analyzes the results on the test for the 2009 2010 period in order to identify possible reliable insights on the ability of lstms in reproducing the flow features in seismic karst aquifers as the one under investigation to this aim the lstm models providing the best performances in the previous exercise for the different runs fig 7 were selected to be further applied for one and multi day ahead flow predictions over the 2009 2010 period since snow depth records started only on late 2009 after l aquila earthquake fig 3 here we focus on the runs which do not include sd among the input variables namely the most complete iii and ix and the simpler vii relying only on hydrometeorological parameters fig 5 this lag exercise can be seen as a stress test for the predicting ability of the models in consideration of the importance of antecedent flow discharge values indeed when increasing the lead times such influence is partly reduced thus allowing to recognize the possible influence of other factors furthermore tests at longer lead times can be even more interesting for practical applications such as predictions for what if analysis or missing data filling table 2 summarizes the error metrics for the selected runs at different lead times tlag while fig 8 shows for exemplificatory purposes the comparative plots of the 2009 2010 forecasting results obtained from the application of the lstms for the feature combinations iii and vii if excluding the short initialization period the figure depicts a relatively good agreement between the patterns of observed and predicted spring discharges especially at smaller lead times thus indicating a fair ability of the lstm models in resembling the flow features for a test set completely taken out from the training process interestingly while the differences between forecasts and observation become more evident with increasing tlag more markedly for run vii fig 8b the plots highlight the skill of the models in well predicting the sharp flow increase induced by the earthquake event occurred on april 2009 day 100 of the time series such result suggests that the networks seem to have effectively learned the physical mechanisms leading to sudden flow changes after main seismic events in the karst aquifer attributed in the literature from a qualitative perspective to fracture cleaning phenomena and consequent increase in the bulk hydraulic conductivity wang and manga 2010 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 manga and wang 2015 petitta et al 2018 valigi et al 2019 this is quantitatively confirmed by the results shown in table 2 which indicates similar models performances at short lead times with r2 ranging from 0 98 to 0 83 for tlag between 1 and 4 days for the three configurations however when tlag is further increased the performances of run vii the one trained with only hydrometeorological data for the 2015 2018 period drop significantly r2 0 05 while a more gradual and limited worsening with r2 values of about 0 75 0 55 for tlag 7 days can be observed for the other two combinations thus proving the positive effect of the seismic parameters on models accuracy it is worth noting that the good predictions provided by run vii at short lead times are mainly a consequence of the tendency of the model to copy the antecedent discharge values in the time series indeed as shown in the results reported in the previous section the network heavily relies on antecedent flow rates and thus predictions do not deviate much from observations for small tlag while on the other hand to capture the sudden increase in the flow rate for larger tlag information on earthquake events certainly improves the quality of the forecasting runs iii and ix 4 conclusions the characterization and investigation of karst aquifers is a complex task which makes quantitative studies on their governing physical processes quite difficult in recent years because of the excellent performance of data driven approaches in many scientific fields hydrologists have been starting to implement such algorithms in place of or combined with physically based models in their applications given this trend for the first time to the best of our knowledge the present study attempted to investigate the usability and reliability of memory enhanced neural networks lstms for modelling the hydrological behavior of karst aquifers exposed to seismic hazard which exacerbates the system complexity indeed while plenty of literature has been published on the use of machine learning algorithms for purely hydrological applications ardabili et al 2019 no previous studies on the topic have dealt with the inclusion of earthquake impacts into the modelling the results presented here especially in the multiday ahead forecasting exercise demonstrated that albeit machine learning approaches may suffer from limitations arising from insufficient data for model training which may lead to incorrect conclusions as pointed out in the sensitivity analysis discussed in section 3 1 they have potential for a successful use for flow forecasting in seismic karst areas by virtue of their ability in implicitly learning the complex geophysical mechanisms causing sudden alterations in the hydrological properties of the aquifers after main earthquake events clearly the key point will be the possibility of relying on representative long hydrometeorological and seismic time series for a proper training of the networks therefore we promote future studies aimed at corroborating our findings in regions experiencing
