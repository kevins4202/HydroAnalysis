2845,the applications of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace on local scales are obstructed owing to the coarser spatial resolution of grace observations much attempts recently have been taken to improve the resolution of grace based water storage estimates based on machine learning algorithms focusing on new algorithm development however there are still two deficiencies in previous grace downscaling research namely the selection of input variables and the scale of model construction in this study the partial least squares regression plsr model firstly is employed to identify the representative predictors associated with grace observations then the performance of two different downscaling schemes namely pixel scale and regional scale models are comprehensively investigated based on a machine learning algorithm known as random forest to enhance the resolution of grace based water storage estimates to the grid resolution as small as 5 km the downscaled results are validated against hydrological model simulations and a number of in situ groundwater level measurements within one of most rapidly urbanized basin in china haihe river basin the plsr model recognizes four variables namely evapotranspiration temperature land surface temperature and soil moisture as the predominant factors acting as the predictors of downscaling models starting with the grace observations two kinds of pixel and regional downscaling schemes are developed the downscaled results were consistent each other and with the original grace data at a broad scale with the correlation up to 0 98 it was found that there was 3 20 times deviation of the results from the model simulation in computation of groundwater depletion rates within plain areas in situ water level measurements highlight that the downscaling models are improved by 36 95 and 23 25 in correlation relative to the original grace data and the simulated groundwater storage anomalies respectively generally the pixel scale model is slightly better than the regional scale model with 69 171 out of 249 observation wells of higher correlation and 53 131 out of 249 observation wells of smaller root mean squared error the high resolution results presented in this study can lead to better understanding on regional water resources and provide quantitative information to water management considering irrigation water use and groundwater consumption keywords grace satellites statistical downscaling partial least squares regression model water storage anomalies haihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate understanding on spatiotemporal characteristics of water storage variation is critical to the evaluation of climate change and the sustainable utilization of water resources rodell et al 2007 tapley et al 2019 for the sake of obtaining water storage estimates soil moisture and ground water the land surface models have been developed on the basis of water and energy balance between atmosphere and land surface the performance of these models is constrained primarily by uncertainties in model physics and parameters meteorological forcing particularly precipitation and deficiencies in the model structure tangdamrongsub et al 2017 zhong et al 2021 alternatively it is difficult to master the dynamic changes of water storage based on in situ measurements owing to the scarcity of gauged stations the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites provide an effective measure to detect terrestrial water storage changes at large scale regions particularly in areas with limited measured data up to now grace has been widely utilized in a number of applications e g retrieving groundwater feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 quantifying drought boergens et al 2020 gerdener et al 2020 measuring massive flood han et al 2021a han et al 2021b and detecting land subsidence wang et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2019 despite these achievements there are still some shortcomings which limit its application in long term hydrological changes e g data gaps sun et al 2020 li et al 2020 li et al 2021 and time lag hachborn et al 2017 additionally care must be taken when grace observations are applied to regions with heterogeneous geomorphological feature akhtar et al 2022 especially the footprint of grace observations is approximately 200 000 km2 as a result of the orbit height 450 450 km 200 000 km2 long et al 2015 which is too coarse to meet the requirements of water resource managers therefore improving the spatial resolution of grace satellites has the great potential to enhance wider applications of grace data there are two commonly used methods to downscale grace observations namely dynamical and statistical approaches the dynamical downscaling can also be called as data assimilation da which integrate grace observations and simulated water storage estimates from hydrological models tangdamrongsub et al 2015 previous studies zaitchik et al 2008 eicker et al 2014 tian et al 2019 have highlighted the benefit of da in improving the spatial resolution of grace data and disaggregating terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa into various water storage components nevertheless the principal drawback of da is computational cost and strong dependence on the uncertain boundary condition of hydrological models zhong et al 2020a the statistical approaches can be considered as alternatives for example recent demonstration with grace data by milewski et al 2019 sahour et al 2020 and vishwakarma et al 2021 to name a few with the advancement of machine learning ml techniques the statistical methods become more feasible in statistical downscaling models it is crucial to identify representative predictors for the performance of model prediction while no effective variable selection method has been proposed yet adamowski and chan 2011 sun et al 2016 most predictors are chosen based on the subjective experience or water balance method and thus these developed models may not be uniformly applicable to other areas there are two different schemes that can be employed to construct ml based downscaling models from the perspective of pixel and regional scale respectively the pixel scale model selects a single pixel as the unit and divides the time series of target variable into training and validation sets to train the downscaling model for example yin et al 2018 presented a downscaling approach based on the close relationship between grace based groundwater storage anomalies gwsa and evapotranspiration et in the north china plain which successfully improve the resolution from 110 km to 2 km chen et al 2019 downscaled the resolution of gwsa estimates from 1 to 0 25 and results revealed that the random forest based downscaling model has a great potential for forecasting local scale groundwater storage however there were abrupt changes in the downscaling results between adjacent pixels yin et al 2022 employed three kinds of downscaling models to improve the resolution of grace based water storage estimates to 0 25 namely multivariable linear regression mlr random forest and noah v2 1 model the downscaled results still suffered from systematic effects and coarser spatial resolution limiting the application in local water resources management on the contrary the regional scale downscaling scheme selects a certain time point e g january 2010 and divides the data values of all pixels into training and validation sets to train the downscaling model for instance zhang et al 2021a utilized the extreme gradient boosting and random forest methods to improve groundwater storage over china generating the 1 km resolution datasets of various water storage components from 2003 to 2016 however the major drawback of this scheme is that whether the downscaling models developed at the national scale can be suitable to arbitrarily small scale regions it should be noted that the temporal resolution of downscaled results is yearly although the spatial resolution can reach 1 km so the generated products cannot capture sub monthly signals e g flood and drought events which greatly limit the application in hydrological research the purpose of this study was to improve the resolution of grace based water storage estimates from 0 5 to 0 05 by integration of the partial least squares regression plsr model and two different downscaling schemes and comprehensively evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of pixel scale and regional scale downscaling schemes specifically we firstly gathered all possible types of input variables used in the previous grace downscaling study the plsr model was employed to assess the importance of each variable to changes in water storage acting as the predominant predictors of the downscaling models the pcraster global water balance pcr globwb simulations and measured groundwater levels were utilized for independent validation so as to evaluate the accuracy of these two schemes our method was applied to the haihe river basin one of the main grain producing bases of northern china with the goal to provide detailed information on the changes in water storage for local water resources management and agricultural production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at the haihe river basin hrb which extends between 112 120 e and 35 43 n fig 1 a it contains a total area of 329 000 km2 consisting of 199 000 km2 of mountains 60 and 130 000 km2 of plains 40 fig 1b wang et al 2021a climatically the hrb is located in a transition region between humid climate and arid climate zhang et al 2017 the annual mean temperature varies from 0 to 14 in the basin while annual precipitation is about 547 mm 75 85 of which falls between june and august ding et al 2015 in recent decades the hrb suffered from the excessive exploitation of groundwater resources resulting from the intensive agricultural irrigation activities fig 1c a series of environmental and geological problems have emerged such as groundwater quality deterioration land subsidence and seawater intrusion which seriously hindered the sustainable development of water resources long et al 2020 it is reported that the annual over exploitation of groundwater resources can reach 7 0 109 m3 in plain areas during the period from 2001 to 2016 http www hwcc gov cn hhxyglj slzl therefore necessary measures must be taken to alleviate these severe problems for the sustainable development of society and human livings 2 2 research framework different kinds of climate and hydrological variables were provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis the european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis version 5 era5 and the global land data assimilation system gldas products two grace mascon solutions were used to provide monthly twsa estimates and the gwsa results are obtained by subtracting the noah v2 1 soil moisture anomalies sma from grace derived twsa and they acted as predictand variables of the downscaling models first the plsr model was employed to identify the predominant factors on water storage changes acting as the predictors of the grace downscaling models then the random forest rf based downscaling models were developed and trained by combining predictor variables e g et and land surface temperature and predictand variables e g gwsa and twsa at the coarser spatial resolution as depicted in fig 2 a then it was assumed that the developed models were applicable at a higher resolution so that the fine resolution input variables were imported to the downscaling models generating the target variable at a higher resolution lastly the performance of downscaling models was investigated against in situ groundwater level measurements and high resolution pcr globwb simulations from the perspective of correlation coefficient and root mean squared error the illustration of the flow information is shown in fig 2 2 3 datasets 2 3 1 grace rl06 mascon solutions gridded rl06 grace mascon products were employed in this study released by the center for space research csr rl06m and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl rl06m the jpl rl06m data are provided on a 0 5 grid while its native resolution is 3 as to the csr rl06m the data are provided on a 0 25 grid with improved coastlines the gain factors released along with twsa estimates were utilized to restore leakage errors of the jpl rl06m data with regard to csr mascon solutions the uncertainties were assumed to be roughly 2 cm equivalent water height as suggested by zheng et al 2020 for detailed descriptions please refer to save et al 2016 save 2020 and wiese et al 2016 2 3 2 climate forcing variables in this study the climate variables included land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi precipitation precp temperature temp and et specifically monthly lst values were supplied by the modis mod11c3 in a 0 05 latitude longitude the lst products are composed of daytime and nighttime observations and calculated by averaging the values from the corresponding month of daily files wang et al 2021b the ndvi data were achieved from mod13c2 version 6 with the monthly scale and 0 05 resolution respectively era5 is the latest climate reanalysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which can provide hourly atmospheric land surface and sea state parameter from 1950 to present huang et al 2013 the climate variables provided by era5 were employed to evaluate the characteristics of precp temp and et variables 2 3 3 water storage components the gldas can take advantages of satellite and ground based measurements advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques so as to generate optimal land surface states and fluxes estimates rodell et al 2004 in this study monthly water storage components provided by noah v2 1 included soil moisture sm plant canopy water pcw and snow water equivalent swe at a 0 25 resolution these above components were transformed to anomaly data relative to the january 2004 december 2009 time mean baseline which were utilized to disaggregate and downscale grace derived twsa estimates 1 tws a grace s m s a gldas s w e a gldas p c w a gldas g w s a where smsagldas sweagldas pcwagldas and gwsa stand for the anomalies relative to 2004 2009 of soil moisture snow water equivalent plant canopy water and groundwater storage respectively 2 3 4 ground based measurements monthly groundwater level measurements were collected to validate the accuracy of downscaled gwsa estimates which were issued by beijing water resources bulletin of china from january 2005 to december 2015 the observations wells were evenly distributed in the haihe river basin as shown in fig 1 it should be noted that we deduced some wells observations with abnormal jumps and outliers during the preprocessing page as for individual bore the groundwater level anomalies δgl were calculated by removing the long term mean between january 2004 and december 2009 from the monthly measurements the δgl data can be transformed to gwsa by multiplying the parameter of specific yield sy practically the sy parameter has the characteristics of highly heterogeneous over the vertical and spatial scales thus it is very difficult to measure its value in this study the δgl data were employed to qualitatively validate the accuracy of grace based results without transforming to gwsa estimates 2 4 methods 2 4 1 partial least squares regression despite the quality of predictors plays a crucial part in the performance of downscaling models there has not been an uniform criterion for the selection of input variables in order to address this problem we firstly collected all predictors used in previous studies related to grace downscaling miro and famiglietti 2018 zhong et al 2020b 2021 vishwakarma et al 2021 specifically the input variables can be categorized into the following types climatic indices e g precipitation and temperature water storage components e g soil moisture and snow water equivalent and topographic factors e g lithology and hydraulic conductivity and so on the plsr was utilized to evaluate the contribution of different predictors to grace based twsa in the hrb the plsr is a multi source data analysis approach according to the principal component analysis pca it can consider the information of explained variables besides the information of explanatory variables in pca hence the most explanatory variables can be effectively extracted for example yuan et al 2019 identified the predominant factors associated with the tws change in different regions of the world using the plsr model variable importance in projection vip was employed to measure the importance of different predictors to the predictand then the selected predictors were applied to the downscaling models the larger the value the greater the influence on twsa it was generally believed that the independent variable with vip 0 8 contributed greatly to the explained dependent variables woldesenbet et al 2017 the vip score for the jth variable was given as follows 2 vi p j p m 1 h r y t m w mj 2 m 1 h r y t m 1 2 where h represents the number of extracted components p stands for the number of predictors tm means the mth component r y tm signifies the explanatory ability of the tm component to the predictand y wmj stands for the marginal contribution of the predictor to the predictand detailed algorithm description can refer to abdi 2010 and vinzi et al 2010 2 4 2 random forest model the rf algorithm belongs to a decision tree based ensemble model which is capable of improving the accuracy and stability of predicted results breiman 2001 specifically given a regression problem the rf first divided the input data into many sub datasets based on bootstrap sampling then each sub dataset was used to train a regression tree finally the trained regression trees were combined to form the prediction model the brief description of the algorithm tailored to this study was as follows step 1 the rf based models were divided into pixel scale and regional scale models and the corresponding dataset dt was constructed at the specified month or the pixel t as 3 d t a t x i y i 1 2 3 n where x i denotes the predictor variable such as evapotranspiration soil moisture etc n stands for the total number of input variables y stands for the target variable i e twsa and finally a t x i y stands for the constructed dataset various combinations of the predictors and the target under the given t the predictor variables are typically given at higher pixel and regional resolutions than the target variable step 2 each rf model was composed of many regression trees which required to be constructed under different combinations of the datasets and they can be obtained from the following equation 4 a t n x i y f b a t x i y n 1 2 3 n tree where ntree is the number of regression trees generated fb is a function based on the bootstrap method and a t n x i y is the sub dataset utilized to the construction of the nth regression tree step 3 the ntree was a key parameter in the forest the large number of this parameter will produce more accurate predictions while the model may be confronted with the risk of over fitting and the computation time will increase in this study the parameters of rf model were optimized by using the grid search technique so as to mitigate the risk of over fitting the construction process of each tree was as follows 5 f t n c a r t t n a t n x i y where f t n is the nth regression tree generated for the specified month or pixel t and car t t n is the short of classification and regression trees used to develop the nth decision tree step 4 finally the best ensemble prediction was computed by averaging all prediction results from the decision trees as by the following equation 6 h t 1 n tree n 1 n tree f t n a t x i where h t is the final result of averaging all regression trees and a t x i stands for the input testing datasets 2 4 3 downscaling models based on machine learning the target resolution of previous downscaling studies is too coarse to meet the requirements of water resources management in local areas e g 0 1 shang et al 2019 and 0 25 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b in this study we substitute 0 05 predictors to obtain the twsa with the target resolution based on the developed downscaling models as mentioned earlier there were two different schemes to construct the grace downscaling models which can be divided into pixel and regional scales with regard to the pixel scale downscaling model it was assumed that the study area consisted of m rows n columns pixels with the spatial resolution of 1 firstly we randomly chose one pixel to develop the downscaling model based on the rf model and the dimension of input variables was ntime v where ntime stands for the length of time and v represents the number of variables this approach assumed that the downscaling model developed at 1 was also suitable to subpixels within the coarse pixel yin et al 2022 so it will generate m n downscaling models as shown in fig 2c1 with regard to the regional scale downscaling models one time point e g january 2003 was chosen and the values of all pixels were divided into training and validation sets the dimensions of predictor and predictand variables were m n v and m n 1 respectively this method assumed that the downscaling methods developed on the whole study area were suitable for all subpixels at the target resolution zhao et al 2018 so the number of downscaling models was ntime as suggested in fig 2c2 the original grace derived twsa maps are compared with two results of downscaled maps for the month of april 2003 and october 2014 aiming to evaluate the discrepancies of spatial distribution between the pre and post downscaling products the specific months are chosen arbitrarily months april and october are six months apart to accentuate the difference in twsa variations similarly the interval of more than ten years can make readers more intuitively to observe the current severe situation caused by the over exploitation recognizing the significance of the south to north water transfer project on the study area 2 4 4 pcr globwb v2 0 model as one of the recently developed global hydrological models the pcr globwb model is a grid based hydrology and water resources model with the daily resolution sutanudjaja et al 2018 the model is forced by three different meteorological data including precipitation temperature and reference potential evapotranspiration pet it can compute soil moisture in two soil layers smupp 0 30 cm smlow 30 150 cm an underlying hydrologically active and replenishable groundwater gwsactive a non renewable groundwater gwsfossil as well as interception and other components additionally anthropogenic water use is also considered in the model which includes irrigation livestock industry and households yang et al 2020 it should be noted that the groundwater component is integrated for the purpose of water balance but with considerably less accurate result rateb et al 2020 currently two versions of pcr globwb models are publicly available one with a coarser spatial resolution of 30 and one with a finer resolution of 5 the model is one of the few models that considers anthropogenic activities and produce water storage at spatial resolution higher than 0 1 thus this study adopted the products to assess the performance of the grace observations before and after downscaling the publicly available of pcr globwb products extended from january 1958 to december 2015 therefore the downscaled period for grace solutions was selected as january 2003 to december 2015 so as to better compare with the modeled results considering the highest resolution of auxiliary datasets and pcr globwb simulations the target resolution of downscaled results was selected as 0 05 for the consistency 2 5 evaluation index the performance of each model was assessed between the downscaled and observed values from the perspective of correlation coefficient cc and root mean squared error rmse specifically the cc index is capable of analyzing the relationship between two datasets while the rmse is utilized to quantify the discrepancies between two variables the equations used to caluclate these two metrics are as follows 7 cc i 1 n y i y o i o i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 rmse i 1 n y i o i 2 n where o stands for the in situ measurements y denotes the forecasted values n represents the number of variables and y and o are the mean values of y and o respectively 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of twsa as indicated in fig 3 both csr rl06m and jpl rl06m series show good consistency from 2003 to 2015 with the cc of 0 97 a remarkable downtrend is observed for the whole hrb at the rate of 15 64 0 90 mm yr and 19 75 0 83 mm yr for csr rl06m and jpl rl06m an agreement is observed between pcr globwb simulations and grace observations during the study period with cc of 0 91 however the downtrend of pcr globwb is overestimated by a large extent with the rate of 29 13 0 69 mm yr especially during the period between 2011 and 2015 pcr globwb overestimates the decline trend with the rate of 36 72 2 82 mm yr relative to the trend of 29 09 3 32 mm yr for grace solutions this result is coincident with the finding of scanlon et al 2018 with the same models large discrepancies can be observed between different mascon solutions from the perspective of spatial characteristics of twsa trends as shown in fig 4 csr rl06m solution displays one severe depletion area which is mainly distributed in the conjunction areas between hebei and henan provinces fig 4a an additional depletion area is detected in jpl rl06m which is mainly located in cangzhou city of hebei province marked with the blue region in fig 4 the arithmetic mean of two solutions is employed as the representative twsa with the purpose of reducing the uncertainty sakumura et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 shown as fig 4c as for pcr globwb simulations the twsa trend is generally larger than grace observation and the notable downtrends are found in the entire plain areas of the hrb fig 4d 3 2 selection of representative predictors for downscaling models after the preliminary screening the variables used not less than 5 times are selected as the dominant forcing factors associated with grace downscaling research as shown in fig 5 a it is worth highlighting that anthropogenic activities play an import role in twsa within the hrb unfortunately these kinds of datasets are only provided in terms of yearly and provincial scales while the input variables of downscaling models are required to be monthly and gridded scales hence anthropogenic activies are rarely considered as predictors in downscaling research these nine variables and grace derived twsa are set as the input and target variables of the plsr model respectively the importance of each variable to twsa can be generated as shown in fig 5b it can be observed that the vip values of et temp lst and sm are larger than 0 80 suggesting that these four variables are the most important variables for the hrb thus these four variables are chosen as the input variables for the rf based downscaling models 3 3 comparison of downscaled twsa and gwsa using two different schemes 3 3 1 downscaled twsa and gwsa trends during 2003 2015 fig 6 suggests the spatial variability of twsa trends from the original and downscaled results during 2003 2015 the overall trends of the downscaled results are consistent with the original grace observations with the cc metrics of 0 99 both downscaling schemes can capture two downtrends in hrb which are consistent with original grace data the biggest difference lies in that the downscaled results provided by the regional scale model are spatially finer fig 6b alternatively there are obvious abrupt changes between adjacent pixels for the downscaled results from the pixel scale approach fig 6c the main reason is that the pixel scale downscaling models are developed at an individual pixel so the signals from surrounding pixels are not taken into account during the model construction correspondingly the regional scale downscaling models can consider the information of all pixels in the study area the comparison of this work with other similar downscaling studies within the hrb is provided in table s1 of the supplementary materials additionally the human withdrawals utilized as the forcing data of the pcr globwb model are applied as the input variables of downscaling models including domestic water demand industrial water demand and livestock demand respectively these relevant results are provided in figs s2 s5 of the supplementrary materials it can be concluded that it is not necessary to consider human withdrawals within the downscaling models in view of the fact that these kinds of datasets are difficult to obtain even when some inaccurate human withdrawals are employed as predictors of downscaling models the performance of downscaled twsa estimates may be degraded in this study the spatial distribution of gwsa trends is similar to that of twsa trends with the cc up to 0 99 while the differences appear mostly in amplitude it indicates that the inter annual trends in twsa are mainly induced by gwsa which coincide with the finding of our previous research yin et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 there are two major groundwater depression areas which are mainly distributed in the southwestern and eastern hrb with the decline trends of 31 12 1 20 mm yr and 25 87 1 24 mm yr between 2003 and 2015 the primary reason for this phenomenon is that the intensive agriculture irrigation and climate change put enormous pressure on water resources for instance it is recorded that hebei province suffers from the serious groundwater consumption among eight provinces within the hrb with the annual average of 15 64 km3 followed by henan province 2 54 km3 from 2003 to 2012 wrpb 2012 3 3 2 downscaled twsa and gwsa in specific months it can be seen in fig 8 a that the majority of the twsa declines is mainly distributed along the southern hrb in april 2003 the depletion signals become more significant from the perspective of affected regions as well as the depletion magnitude in october 2014 with the decreasing amplitude varying from 13 14 cm to 24 73 cm fig 8d specifically the cangzhou city also highlights the remarkable twsa depletion besides the southern hrb moreover these hotspots of groundwater depletion show up to 20 cm of water storage loss in 2003 to approximately 40 cm in 2014 before and after downscaling the twsa preserve better consistency and the downscaled results are able to capture finer spatial features better than that provided by the original grace products generally speaking the model output maps reveal a higher degree of heterogeneity in groundwater behavior relative to grace observations in april 2003 only smaller regions distributed around southern hrb exhibit slight depletion trends in gwsa the groundwater variations are relatively stable even surplus occur in the central regions of the hrb fig 9 a 9c in contrast significant negative values are observed in both southern and central regions of the hrb in october 2014 indicating that the groundwater storage are in a state of serious deficit relative to the previous period the spatial distributions of gwsa are basically consistent before and after downscaling conforming that the reliability and accuracy of the downscaled results 4 discussions 4 1 spatial distribution of correlation coefficients the spatial distribution of cc values between different downscaled and modeled twsa is shown in fig 10 during the period from 2003 to 2015 at the original resolution of the grace data higher correlation can be observed between grace observations and modeled twsa in plain areas with the average cc value of 0 85 fig 10a however little correlation is also found mainly around mountainous areas for the downscaled results the twsa from pixel scale models agree best with that from regional scale models over the whole study area with the cc value above 0 95 implying two different downscaled schemes are consistent from the perspective of time series fig 10b the regional and pixel downscaling results at 0 05 show nearly identical cc in comparison to the modeled twsa see fig 10c and 10d as expected from the findings from fig 10a and 10b the downscaled twsa results show improved correlation with pcr globwb simulations at the plain areas with the average cc value of 0 75 while the average cc value is 0 43 in the mountainous areas of the hrb this is likely due to the deficiency of pcr globwb simulations especially in the mountainous regions concurrently the modeled gwsa is considered from the numerical pcr globwb model as mentioned previously döll et al 2014 accurate estimation of gwsa from global hydrological models remain challenging owing to the inadequate model parameterization the deficiency in the knowledge associated with groundwater recharge abstraction and the limited in situ measurements to be used to calibrate models therefore it can be foreseen that less agreement may be found between the downscaled and modeled gwsa in comparison to that of twsa additionally there are little differences between different downscaling schemes and modeled results fig 11 c and d likewise good correlation can be found in the plain areas with the mean cc value of 0 71 and poor result can be found elsewhere 4 2 spatial distribution of differences in trend the entire hrb undergoes depletion of water storage during the last decade or two fig 5a we examined the results of downscaling in terms of the interannual twsa variation linear trend note that the difference is computed by subtracting pcr globwb simulations from grace based results original and downscaled and shown in fig 12 the bluish color implies where the pcr globwb model overestimates the depletion trend relative to grace observations while the reddish color indicates the opposite from fig 12 it is seen that pcr globwb simulations significantly overestimate the twsa depletion trends in the plain areas while underestimate the depletion signals in the southern mountainous areas fig 12a the downscaled results can capture the additional fine scale signals compared to the original resolution fig 12c and 12d as opposed to 12a the results from the pixel scale models are still blocky fig 12d while the ones from the regional scale models are spatially continuous fig 12c the difference in the trend is also slightly smaller in the regional scale modeling results fig 12c as to two different downscaling schemes fig 12b the difference is more prominent over the areas with larger depletion rates see fig 5 for instance we can see that differences of the twsa trends between the regional scale and pixel scale models are as much as 10 mm yr in the eastern and western hrb where the larger depletion signals were also observed fig 13 shows the same maps as to fig 12 but for gwsa the results are quite similar to the cases of twsa in fig 12 but generally the differences are smaller we selected four contrasting points to assess the differences between different downscaling schemes in detail including a and b presenting significant and insignificant differences in fig 13b and c and d highlighting the overestimated and underestimated of gwsa trends in the pcr globwb simulations fig 13d it can be observed in fig 14 that the gwsa time series based on two different downscaling schemes agree well each other with the coefficients of 0 85 0 97 for these four selected points as to pcr globwb simulations there is no interannual variation in modeled gwsa over the mountainous areas during 2003 2015 points a and d in contrast the pcr globwb model overestimates the depletion signals in the plain areas points b and c specifically modeled gwsa trends are 3 20 times larger than that of downscaled results fig 14b and 14d the possible reason is that we utilize the official pcr globwb code available at https github com uu hydro pcr globwb model to generate various water storage estimates without further processing or calibration which is consistent with earlier studies tangdamrongsub et al 2017 yang et al 2020 this inconsistency highlights that the necessity of processing or calibration of the pcr globwb model based on in situ measurements so as to improve the performance of modeled results within the study area 4 3 validation of downscaled gwsa based on independent groundwater levels we utilize in situ groundwater level measurements for qualitative comparison with the downscaled gwsa results notably the time series are normalized during the calculation of rmse due to the amplitude difference between in situ levels and downscaled results for the original grace based gwsa the comparison against in situ measurements shows the overall cc and rmse of 0 387 and 0 288 respectively particularly it can be seen in fig 15 a that the worst fitting is found in the henan province with the cc rmse metrics of 0 251 0 293 the simulated gwsa fig 15b are compared with the overall cc rmse metrics of 0 431 0 301 conversely both rf based downscaling models fig 15c and 15d can better replicate the long term trends and seasonal variability of in situ observations significant improvement is observed with respect to the cross correlation on average increasing by 36 95 and 23 25 compared to the original and simulated results respectively similar improvement from the downscaling can also be observed in terms of rmse index as shown in fig 15g h with regard to two different downscaling models the pixel scale model is better than that of regional scale model with larger cc and smaller rmse specifically the cc values between in situ measurements and pixel scale results increase from 0 523 to 0 546 while rmse decreases from 0 274 to 0 271 in beijing similar improvements can also be seen in other regions within the hrb the metrics cc rmse obtained by pixel scale models are 0 554 0 275 hebei and 0 679 0 216 henan in comparison to 0 550 0 283 hebei and 0 668 0 225 henan provided by regional scale models the geographical location of these above provinces can be seen in fig 1b meanwhile it is calculated that 68 67 171 out of 249 observation wells of larger cc and 52 61 131 out of 249 observation wells of smaller rmse are obtained by using the pixel scale models therefore it is found that both downscaled models can capture the dynamic changes of in situ measurements and the pixel scale model is slightly better it is noteworthy to mention that the pixel downscaling model takes 10 times longer than the regional downscaling model in our framework see also fig s1 of the supplementary material for the overall pattern between the number of pixels and time consumption for different study areas 5 conclusions the coarser resolution of grace observations has caused tremendous interference to master the dynamic changes in water resources much attempts have been taken to downscale the grace observations based on machine learning algorithms however there has been little study on an effective measure to recognize representative input variables predictors of downscaling models up to now while a majority of the previous works are concerned on the new algorithm improvement there are relatively few studies on investigating the discrepancies between different downscaling schemes this study firstly employs the plsr model to identify the predominant variables related to grace observations within the hrb the plsr model suggests that the dominant climate factors related to twsa include et temp lst and sm within the hrb thus they are used as the representative predictors to the subsequent grace data downscaling two kinds of downscaling models are developed by combining the random forest machine learning algorithm and plsr based predictors which successfully improve the resolution of grace observations from 0 5 to 0 05 generally both pixel and regional downscaling schemes are able to determine the signals at local regions while preserving the characteristics with the original grace observations however the pixel scale downscaling results still suffer from systematic effects related to the original data resolution in areas with larger depletion signals the differences in two kinds of downscaling schemes are more pronounced validation against in situ groundwater level measurements found that the downscaled results exhibit the increased correlation by 36 95 and 23 25 relative to the original and simulated gwsa respectively the downscaled gwsa are obtained with higher accuracy from the pixel scale model with higher cc and smaller rmse our results also indicate that the pcr globwb simulations significantly overestimate 3 20 times the downtrends in plain areas between 2003 and 2015 while underestimate the depletion signals in mountain areas in comparison to the downscaled results generally speaking the downscaling schemes developed in this study not only reveal improved spatial variability but also suggest improved temporal coherence to a number of ground water level data the higher resolution products can lead to better understanding on dynamics of regional water resources and may provide quantitative information useful to water management considering regional irrigation water use and groundwater consumption credit authorship contribution statement wenjie yin methodology investigation

2845,the applications of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace on local scales are obstructed owing to the coarser spatial resolution of grace observations much attempts recently have been taken to improve the resolution of grace based water storage estimates based on machine learning algorithms focusing on new algorithm development however there are still two deficiencies in previous grace downscaling research namely the selection of input variables and the scale of model construction in this study the partial least squares regression plsr model firstly is employed to identify the representative predictors associated with grace observations then the performance of two different downscaling schemes namely pixel scale and regional scale models are comprehensively investigated based on a machine learning algorithm known as random forest to enhance the resolution of grace based water storage estimates to the grid resolution as small as 5 km the downscaled results are validated against hydrological model simulations and a number of in situ groundwater level measurements within one of most rapidly urbanized basin in china haihe river basin the plsr model recognizes four variables namely evapotranspiration temperature land surface temperature and soil moisture as the predominant factors acting as the predictors of downscaling models starting with the grace observations two kinds of pixel and regional downscaling schemes are developed the downscaled results were consistent each other and with the original grace data at a broad scale with the correlation up to 0 98 it was found that there was 3 20 times deviation of the results from the model simulation in computation of groundwater depletion rates within plain areas in situ water level measurements highlight that the downscaling models are improved by 36 95 and 23 25 in correlation relative to the original grace data and the simulated groundwater storage anomalies respectively generally the pixel scale model is slightly better than the regional scale model with 69 171 out of 249 observation wells of higher correlation and 53 131 out of 249 observation wells of smaller root mean squared error the high resolution results presented in this study can lead to better understanding on regional water resources and provide quantitative information to water management considering irrigation water use and groundwater consumption keywords grace satellites statistical downscaling partial least squares regression model water storage anomalies haihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate understanding on spatiotemporal characteristics of water storage variation is critical to the evaluation of climate change and the sustainable utilization of water resources rodell et al 2007 tapley et al 2019 for the sake of obtaining water storage estimates soil moisture and ground water the land surface models have been developed on the basis of water and energy balance between atmosphere and land surface the performance of these models is constrained primarily by uncertainties in model physics and parameters meteorological forcing particularly precipitation and deficiencies in the model structure tangdamrongsub et al 2017 zhong et al 2021 alternatively it is difficult to master the dynamic changes of water storage based on in situ measurements owing to the scarcity of gauged stations the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites provide an effective measure to detect terrestrial water storage changes at large scale regions particularly in areas with limited measured data up to now grace has been widely utilized in a number of applications e g retrieving groundwater feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 quantifying drought boergens et al 2020 gerdener et al 2020 measuring massive flood han et al 2021a han et al 2021b and detecting land subsidence wang et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2019 despite these achievements there are still some shortcomings which limit its application in long term hydrological changes e g data gaps sun et al 2020 li et al 2020 li et al 2021 and time lag hachborn et al 2017 additionally care must be taken when grace observations are applied to regions with heterogeneous geomorphological feature akhtar et al 2022 especially the footprint of grace observations is approximately 200 000 km2 as a result of the orbit height 450 450 km 200 000 km2 long et al 2015 which is too coarse to meet the requirements of water resource managers therefore improving the spatial resolution of grace satellites has the great potential to enhance wider applications of grace data there are two commonly used methods to downscale grace observations namely dynamical and statistical approaches the dynamical downscaling can also be called as data assimilation da which integrate grace observations and simulated water storage estimates from hydrological models tangdamrongsub et al 2015 previous studies zaitchik et al 2008 eicker et al 2014 tian et al 2019 have highlighted the benefit of da in improving the spatial resolution of grace data and disaggregating terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa into various water storage components nevertheless the principal drawback of da is computational cost and strong dependence on the uncertain boundary condition of hydrological models zhong et al 2020a the statistical approaches can be considered as alternatives for example recent demonstration with grace data by milewski et al 2019 sahour et al 2020 and vishwakarma et al 2021 to name a few with the advancement of machine learning ml techniques the statistical methods become more feasible in statistical downscaling models it is crucial to identify representative predictors for the performance of model prediction while no effective variable selection method has been proposed yet adamowski and chan 2011 sun et al 2016 most predictors are chosen based on the subjective experience or water balance method and thus these developed models may not be uniformly applicable to other areas there are two different schemes that can be employed to construct ml based downscaling models from the perspective of pixel and regional scale respectively the pixel scale model selects a single pixel as the unit and divides the time series of target variable into training and validation sets to train the downscaling model for example yin et al 2018 presented a downscaling approach based on the close relationship between grace based groundwater storage anomalies gwsa and evapotranspiration et in the north china plain which successfully improve the resolution from 110 km to 2 km chen et al 2019 downscaled the resolution of gwsa estimates from 1 to 0 25 and results revealed that the random forest based downscaling model has a great potential for forecasting local scale groundwater storage however there were abrupt changes in the downscaling results between adjacent pixels yin et al 2022 employed three kinds of downscaling models to improve the resolution of grace based water storage estimates to 0 25 namely multivariable linear regression mlr random forest and noah v2 1 model the downscaled results still suffered from systematic effects and coarser spatial resolution limiting the application in local water resources management on the contrary the regional scale downscaling scheme selects a certain time point e g january 2010 and divides the data values of all pixels into training and validation sets to train the downscaling model for instance zhang et al 2021a utilized the extreme gradient boosting and random forest methods to improve groundwater storage over china generating the 1 km resolution datasets of various water storage components from 2003 to 2016 however the major drawback of this scheme is that whether the downscaling models developed at the national scale can be suitable to arbitrarily small scale regions it should be noted that the temporal resolution of downscaled results is yearly although the spatial resolution can reach 1 km so the generated products cannot capture sub monthly signals e g flood and drought events which greatly limit the application in hydrological research the purpose of this study was to improve the resolution of grace based water storage estimates from 0 5 to 0 05 by integration of the partial least squares regression plsr model and two different downscaling schemes and comprehensively evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of pixel scale and regional scale downscaling schemes specifically we firstly gathered all possible types of input variables used in the previous grace downscaling study the plsr model was employed to assess the importance of each variable to changes in water storage acting as the predominant predictors of the downscaling models the pcraster global water balance pcr globwb simulations and measured groundwater levels were utilized for independent validation so as to evaluate the accuracy of these two schemes our method was applied to the haihe river basin one of the main grain producing bases of northern china with the goal to provide detailed information on the changes in water storage for local water resources management and agricultural production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at the haihe river basin hrb which extends between 112 120 e and 35 43 n fig 1 a it contains a total area of 329 000 km2 consisting of 199 000 km2 of mountains 60 and 130 000 km2 of plains 40 fig 1b wang et al 2021a climatically the hrb is located in a transition region between humid climate and arid climate zhang et al 2017 the annual mean temperature varies from 0 to 14 in the basin while annual precipitation is about 547 mm 75 85 of which falls between june and august ding et al 2015 in recent decades the hrb suffered from the excessive exploitation of groundwater resources resulting from the intensive agricultural irrigation activities fig 1c a series of environmental and geological problems have emerged such as groundwater quality deterioration land subsidence and seawater intrusion which seriously hindered the sustainable development of water resources long et al 2020 it is reported that the annual over exploitation of groundwater resources can reach 7 0 109 m3 in plain areas during the period from 2001 to 2016 http www hwcc gov cn hhxyglj slzl therefore necessary measures must be taken to alleviate these severe problems for the sustainable development of society and human livings 2 2 research framework different kinds of climate and hydrological variables were provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis the european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis version 5 era5 and the global land data assimilation system gldas products two grace mascon solutions were used to provide monthly twsa estimates and the gwsa results are obtained by subtracting the noah v2 1 soil moisture anomalies sma from grace derived twsa and they acted as predictand variables of the downscaling models first the plsr model was employed to identify the predominant factors on water storage changes acting as the predictors of the grace downscaling models then the random forest rf based downscaling models were developed and trained by combining predictor variables e g et and land surface temperature and predictand variables e g gwsa and twsa at the coarser spatial resolution as depicted in fig 2 a then it was assumed that the developed models were applicable at a higher resolution so that the fine resolution input variables were imported to the downscaling models generating the target variable at a higher resolution lastly the performance of downscaling models was investigated against in situ groundwater level measurements and high resolution pcr globwb simulations from the perspective of correlation coefficient and root mean squared error the illustration of the flow information is shown in fig 2 2 3 datasets 2 3 1 grace rl06 mascon solutions gridded rl06 grace mascon products were employed in this study released by the center for space research csr rl06m and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl rl06m the jpl rl06m data are provided on a 0 5 grid while its native resolution is 3 as to the csr rl06m the data are provided on a 0 25 grid with improved coastlines the gain factors released along with twsa estimates were utilized to restore leakage errors of the jpl rl06m data with regard to csr mascon solutions the uncertainties were assumed to be roughly 2 cm equivalent water height as suggested by zheng et al 2020 for detailed descriptions please refer to save et al 2016 save 2020 and wiese et al 2016 2 3 2 climate forcing variables in this study the climate variables included land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi precipitation precp temperature temp and et specifically monthly lst values were supplied by the modis mod11c3 in a 0 05 latitude longitude the lst products are composed of daytime and nighttime observations and calculated by averaging the values from the corresponding month of daily files wang et al 2021b the ndvi data were achieved from mod13c2 version 6 with the monthly scale and 0 05 resolution respectively era5 is the latest climate reanalysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which can provide hourly atmospheric land surface and sea state parameter from 1950 to present huang et al 2013 the climate variables provided by era5 were employed to evaluate the characteristics of precp temp and et variables 2 3 3 water storage components the gldas can take advantages of satellite and ground based measurements advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques so as to generate optimal land surface states and fluxes estimates rodell et al 2004 in this study monthly water storage components provided by noah v2 1 included soil moisture sm plant canopy water pcw and snow water equivalent swe at a 0 25 resolution these above components were transformed to anomaly data relative to the january 2004 december 2009 time mean baseline which were utilized to disaggregate and downscale grace derived twsa estimates 1 tws a grace s m s a gldas s w e a gldas p c w a gldas g w s a where smsagldas sweagldas pcwagldas and gwsa stand for the anomalies relative to 2004 2009 of soil moisture snow water equivalent plant canopy water and groundwater storage respectively 2 3 4 ground based measurements monthly groundwater level measurements were collected to validate the accuracy of downscaled gwsa estimates which were issued by beijing water resources bulletin of china from january 2005 to december 2015 the observations wells were evenly distributed in the haihe river basin as shown in fig 1 it should be noted that we deduced some wells observations with abnormal jumps and outliers during the preprocessing page as for individual bore the groundwater level anomalies δgl were calculated by removing the long term mean between january 2004 and december 2009 from the monthly measurements the δgl data can be transformed to gwsa by multiplying the parameter of specific yield sy practically the sy parameter has the characteristics of highly heterogeneous over the vertical and spatial scales thus it is very difficult to measure its value in this study the δgl data were employed to qualitatively validate the accuracy of grace based results without transforming to gwsa estimates 2 4 methods 2 4 1 partial least squares regression despite the quality of predictors plays a crucial part in the performance of downscaling models there has not been an uniform criterion for the selection of input variables in order to address this problem we firstly collected all predictors used in previous studies related to grace downscaling miro and famiglietti 2018 zhong et al 2020b 2021 vishwakarma et al 2021 specifically the input variables can be categorized into the following types climatic indices e g precipitation and temperature water storage components e g soil moisture and snow water equivalent and topographic factors e g lithology and hydraulic conductivity and so on the plsr was utilized to evaluate the contribution of different predictors to grace based twsa in the hrb the plsr is a multi source data analysis approach according to the principal component analysis pca it can consider the information of explained variables besides the information of explanatory variables in pca hence the most explanatory variables can be effectively extracted for example yuan et al 2019 identified the predominant factors associated with the tws change in different regions of the world using the plsr model variable importance in projection vip was employed to measure the importance of different predictors to the predictand then the selected predictors were applied to the downscaling models the larger the value the greater the influence on twsa it was generally believed that the independent variable with vip 0 8 contributed greatly to the explained dependent variables woldesenbet et al 2017 the vip score for the jth variable was given as follows 2 vi p j p m 1 h r y t m w mj 2 m 1 h r y t m 1 2 where h represents the number of extracted components p stands for the number of predictors tm means the mth component r y tm signifies the explanatory ability of the tm component to the predictand y wmj stands for the marginal contribution of the predictor to the predictand detailed algorithm description can refer to abdi 2010 and vinzi et al 2010 2 4 2 random forest model the rf algorithm belongs to a decision tree based ensemble model which is capable of improving the accuracy and stability of predicted results breiman 2001 specifically given a regression problem the rf first divided the input data into many sub datasets based on bootstrap sampling then each sub dataset was used to train a regression tree finally the trained regression trees were combined to form the prediction model the brief description of the algorithm tailored to this study was as follows step 1 the rf based models were divided into pixel scale and regional scale models and the corresponding dataset dt was constructed at the specified month or the pixel t as 3 d t a t x i y i 1 2 3 n where x i denotes the predictor variable such as evapotranspiration soil moisture etc n stands for the total number of input variables y stands for the target variable i e twsa and finally a t x i y stands for the constructed dataset various combinations of the predictors and the target under the given t the predictor variables are typically given at higher pixel and regional resolutions than the target variable step 2 each rf model was composed of many regression trees which required to be constructed under different combinations of the datasets and they can be obtained from the following equation 4 a t n x i y f b a t x i y n 1 2 3 n tree where ntree is the number of regression trees generated fb is a function based on the bootstrap method and a t n x i y is the sub dataset utilized to the construction of the nth regression tree step 3 the ntree was a key parameter in the forest the large number of this parameter will produce more accurate predictions while the model may be confronted with the risk of over fitting and the computation time will increase in this study the parameters of rf model were optimized by using the grid search technique so as to mitigate the risk of over fitting the construction process of each tree was as follows 5 f t n c a r t t n a t n x i y where f t n is the nth regression tree generated for the specified month or pixel t and car t t n is the short of classification and regression trees used to develop the nth decision tree step 4 finally the best ensemble prediction was computed by averaging all prediction results from the decision trees as by the following equation 6 h t 1 n tree n 1 n tree f t n a t x i where h t is the final result of averaging all regression trees and a t x i stands for the input testing datasets 2 4 3 downscaling models based on machine learning the target resolution of previous downscaling studies is too coarse to meet the requirements of water resources management in local areas e g 0 1 shang et al 2019 and 0 25 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b in this study we substitute 0 05 predictors to obtain the twsa with the target resolution based on the developed downscaling models as mentioned earlier there were two different schemes to construct the grace downscaling models which can be divided into pixel and regional scales with regard to the pixel scale downscaling model it was assumed that the study area consisted of m rows n columns pixels with the spatial resolution of 1 firstly we randomly chose one pixel to develop the downscaling model based on the rf model and the dimension of input variables was ntime v where ntime stands for the length of time and v represents the number of variables this approach assumed that the downscaling model developed at 1 was also suitable to subpixels within the coarse pixel yin et al 2022 so it will generate m n downscaling models as shown in fig 2c1 with regard to the regional scale downscaling models one time point e g january 2003 was chosen and the values of all pixels were divided into training and validation sets the dimensions of predictor and predictand variables were m n v and m n 1 respectively this method assumed that the downscaling methods developed on the whole study area were suitable for all subpixels at the target resolution zhao et al 2018 so the number of downscaling models was ntime as suggested in fig 2c2 the original grace derived twsa maps are compared with two results of downscaled maps for the month of april 2003 and october 2014 aiming to evaluate the discrepancies of spatial distribution between the pre and post downscaling products the specific months are chosen arbitrarily months april and october are six months apart to accentuate the difference in twsa variations similarly the interval of more than ten years can make readers more intuitively to observe the current severe situation caused by the over exploitation recognizing the significance of the south to north water transfer project on the study area 2 4 4 pcr globwb v2 0 model as one of the recently developed global hydrological models the pcr globwb model is a grid based hydrology and water resources model with the daily resolution sutanudjaja et al 2018 the model is forced by three different meteorological data including precipitation temperature and reference potential evapotranspiration pet it can compute soil moisture in two soil layers smupp 0 30 cm smlow 30 150 cm an underlying hydrologically active and replenishable groundwater gwsactive a non renewable groundwater gwsfossil as well as interception and other components additionally anthropogenic water use is also considered in the model which includes irrigation livestock industry and households yang et al 2020 it should be noted that the groundwater component is integrated for the purpose of water balance but with considerably less accurate result rateb et al 2020 currently two versions of pcr globwb models are publicly available one with a coarser spatial resolution of 30 and one with a finer resolution of 5 the model is one of the few models that considers anthropogenic activities and produce water storage at spatial resolution higher than 0 1 thus this study adopted the products to assess the performance of the grace observations before and after downscaling the publicly available of pcr globwb products extended from january 1958 to december 2015 therefore the downscaled period for grace solutions was selected as january 2003 to december 2015 so as to better compare with the modeled results considering the highest resolution of auxiliary datasets and pcr globwb simulations the target resolution of downscaled results was selected as 0 05 for the consistency 2 5 evaluation index the performance of each model was assessed between the downscaled and observed values from the perspective of correlation coefficient cc and root mean squared error rmse specifically the cc index is capable of analyzing the relationship between two datasets while the rmse is utilized to quantify the discrepancies between two variables the equations used to caluclate these two metrics are as follows 7 cc i 1 n y i y o i o i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 rmse i 1 n y i o i 2 n where o stands for the in situ measurements y denotes the forecasted values n represents the number of variables and y and o are the mean values of y and o respectively 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of twsa as indicated in fig 3 both csr rl06m and jpl rl06m series show good consistency from 2003 to 2015 with the cc of 0 97 a remarkable downtrend is observed for the whole hrb at the rate of 15 64 0 90 mm yr and 19 75 0 83 mm yr for csr rl06m and jpl rl06m an agreement is observed between pcr globwb simulations and grace observations during the study period with cc of 0 91 however the downtrend of pcr globwb is overestimated by a large extent with the rate of 29 13 0 69 mm yr especially during the period between 2011 and 2015 pcr globwb overestimates the decline trend with the rate of 36 72 2 82 mm yr relative to the trend of 29 09 3 32 mm yr for grace solutions this result is coincident with the finding of scanlon et al 2018 with the same models large discrepancies can be observed between different mascon solutions from the perspective of spatial characteristics of twsa trends as shown in fig 4 csr rl06m solution displays one severe depletion area which is mainly distributed in the conjunction areas between hebei and henan provinces fig 4a an additional depletion area is detected in jpl rl06m which is mainly located in cangzhou city of hebei province marked with the blue region in fig 4 the arithmetic mean of two solutions is employed as the representative twsa with the purpose of reducing the uncertainty sakumura et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 shown as fig 4c as for pcr globwb simulations the twsa trend is generally larger than grace observation and the notable downtrends are found in the entire plain areas of the hrb fig 4d 3 2 selection of representative predictors for downscaling models after the preliminary screening the variables used not less than 5 times are selected as the dominant forcing factors associated with grace downscaling research as shown in fig 5 a it is worth highlighting that anthropogenic activities play an import role in twsa within the hrb unfortunately these kinds of datasets are only provided in terms of yearly and provincial scales while the input variables of downscaling models are required to be monthly and gridded scales hence anthropogenic activies are rarely considered as predictors in downscaling research these nine variables and grace derived twsa are set as the input and target variables of the plsr model respectively the importance of each variable to twsa can be generated as shown in fig 5b it can be observed that the vip values of et temp lst and sm are larger than 0 80 suggesting that these four variables are the most important variables for the hrb thus these four variables are chosen as the input variables for the rf based downscaling models 3 3 comparison of downscaled twsa and gwsa using two different schemes 3 3 1 downscaled twsa and gwsa trends during 2003 2015 fig 6 suggests the spatial variability of twsa trends from the original and downscaled results during 2003 2015 the overall trends of the downscaled results are consistent with the original grace observations with the cc metrics of 0 99 both downscaling schemes can capture two downtrends in hrb which are consistent with original grace data the biggest difference lies in that the downscaled results provided by the regional scale model are spatially finer fig 6b alternatively there are obvious abrupt changes between adjacent pixels for the downscaled results from the pixel scale approach fig 6c the main reason is that the pixel scale downscaling models are developed at an individual pixel so the signals from surrounding pixels are not taken into account during the model construction correspondingly the regional scale downscaling models can consider the information of all pixels in the study area the comparison of this work with other similar downscaling studies within the hrb is provided in table s1 of the supplementary materials additionally the human withdrawals utilized as the forcing data of the pcr globwb model are applied as the input variables of downscaling models including domestic water demand industrial water demand and livestock demand respectively these relevant results are provided in figs s2 s5 of the supplementrary materials it can be concluded that it is not necessary to consider human withdrawals within the downscaling models in view of the fact that these kinds of datasets are difficult to obtain even when some inaccurate human withdrawals are employed as predictors of downscaling models the performance of downscaled twsa estimates may be degraded in this study the spatial distribution of gwsa trends is similar to that of twsa trends with the cc up to 0 99 while the differences appear mostly in amplitude it indicates that the inter annual trends in twsa are mainly induced by gwsa which coincide with the finding of our previous research yin et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 there are two major groundwater depression areas which are mainly distributed in the southwestern and eastern hrb with the decline trends of 31 12 1 20 mm yr and 25 87 1 24 mm yr between 2003 and 2015 the primary reason for this phenomenon is that the intensive agriculture irrigation and climate change put enormous pressure on water resources for instance it is recorded that hebei province suffers from the serious groundwater consumption among eight provinces within the hrb with the annual average of 15 64 km3 followed by henan province 2 54 km3 from 2003 to 2012 wrpb 2012 3 3 2 downscaled twsa and gwsa in specific months it can be seen in fig 8 a that the majority of the twsa declines is mainly distributed along the southern hrb in april 2003 the depletion signals become more significant from the perspective of affected regions as well as the depletion magnitude in october 2014 with the decreasing amplitude varying from 13 14 cm to 24 73 cm fig 8d specifically the cangzhou city also highlights the remarkable twsa depletion besides the southern hrb moreover these hotspots of groundwater depletion show up to 20 cm of water storage loss in 2003 to approximately 40 cm in 2014 before and after downscaling the twsa preserve better consistency and the downscaled results are able to capture finer spatial features better than that provided by the original grace products generally speaking the model output maps reveal a higher degree of heterogeneity in groundwater behavior relative to grace observations in april 2003 only smaller regions distributed around southern hrb exhibit slight depletion trends in gwsa the groundwater variations are relatively stable even surplus occur in the central regions of the hrb fig 9 a 9c in contrast significant negative values are observed in both southern and central regions of the hrb in october 2014 indicating that the groundwater storage are in a state of serious deficit relative to the previous period the spatial distributions of gwsa are basically consistent before and after downscaling conforming that the reliability and accuracy of the downscaled results 4 discussions 4 1 spatial distribution of correlation coefficients the spatial distribution of cc values between different downscaled and modeled twsa is shown in fig 10 during the period from 2003 to 2015 at the original resolution of the grace data higher correlation can be observed between grace observations and modeled twsa in plain areas with the average cc value of 0 85 fig 10a however little correlation is also found mainly around mountainous areas for the downscaled results the twsa from pixel scale models agree best with that from regional scale models over the whole study area with the cc value above 0 95 implying two different downscaled schemes are consistent from the perspective of time series fig 10b the regional and pixel downscaling results at 0 05 show nearly identical cc in comparison to the modeled twsa see fig 10c and 10d as expected from the findings from fig 10a and 10b the downscaled twsa results show improved correlation with pcr globwb simulations at the plain areas with the average cc value of 0 75 while the average cc value is 0 43 in the mountainous areas of the hrb this is likely due to the deficiency of pcr globwb simulations especially in the mountainous regions concurrently the modeled gwsa is considered from the numerical pcr globwb model as mentioned previously döll et al 2014 accurate estimation of gwsa from global hydrological models remain challenging owing to the inadequate model parameterization the deficiency in the knowledge associated with groundwater recharge abstraction and the limited in situ measurements to be used to calibrate models therefore it can be foreseen that less agreement may be found between the downscaled and modeled gwsa in comparison to that of twsa additionally there are little differences between different downscaling schemes and modeled results fig 11 c and d likewise good correlation can be found in the plain areas with the mean cc value of 0 71 and poor result can be found elsewhere 4 2 spatial distribution of differences in trend the entire hrb undergoes depletion of water storage during the last decade or two fig 5a we examined the results of downscaling in terms of the interannual twsa variation linear trend note that the difference is computed by subtracting pcr globwb simulations from grace based results original and downscaled and shown in fig 12 the bluish color implies where the pcr globwb model overestimates the depletion trend relative to grace observations while the reddish color indicates the opposite from fig 12 it is seen that pcr globwb simulations significantly overestimate the twsa depletion trends in the plain areas while underestimate the depletion signals in the southern mountainous areas fig 12a the downscaled results can capture the additional fine scale signals compared to the original resolution fig 12c and 12d as opposed to 12a the results from the pixel scale models are still blocky fig 12d while the ones from the regional scale models are spatially continuous fig 12c the difference in the trend is also slightly smaller in the regional scale modeling results fig 12c as to two different downscaling schemes fig 12b the difference is more prominent over the areas with larger depletion rates see fig 5 for instance we can see that differences of the twsa trends between the regional scale and pixel scale models are as much as 10 mm yr in the eastern and western hrb where the larger depletion signals were also observed fig 13 shows the same maps as to fig 12 but for gwsa the results are quite similar to the cases of twsa in fig 12 but generally the differences are smaller we selected four contrasting points to assess the differences between different downscaling schemes in detail including a and b presenting significant and insignificant differences in fig 13b and c and d highlighting the overestimated and underestimated of gwsa trends in the pcr globwb simulations fig 13d it can be observed in fig 14 that the gwsa time series based on two different downscaling schemes agree well each other with the coefficients of 0 85 0 97 for these four selected points as to pcr globwb simulations there is no interannual variation in modeled gwsa over the mountainous areas during 2003 2015 points a and d in contrast the pcr globwb model overestimates the depletion signals in the plain areas points b and c specifically modeled gwsa trends are 3 20 times larger than that of downscaled results fig 14b and 14d the possible reason is that we utilize the official pcr globwb code available at https github com uu hydro pcr globwb model to generate various water storage estimates without further processing or calibration which is consistent with earlier studies tangdamrongsub et al 2017 yang et al 2020 this inconsistency highlights that the necessity of processing or calibration of the pcr globwb model based on in situ measurements so as to improve the performance of modeled results within the study area 4 3 validation of downscaled gwsa based on independent groundwater levels we utilize in situ groundwater level measurements for qualitative comparison with the downscaled gwsa results notably the time series are normalized during the calculation of rmse due to the amplitude difference between in situ levels and downscaled results for the original grace based gwsa the comparison against in situ measurements shows the overall cc and rmse of 0 387 and 0 288 respectively particularly it can be seen in fig 15 a that the worst fitting is found in the henan province with the cc rmse metrics of 0 251 0 293 the simulated gwsa fig 15b are compared with the overall cc rmse metrics of 0 431 0 301 conversely both rf based downscaling models fig 15c and 15d can better replicate the long term trends and seasonal variability of in situ observations significant improvement is observed with respect to the cross correlation on average increasing by 36 95 and 23 25 compared to the original and simulated results respectively similar improvement from the downscaling can also be observed in terms of rmse index as shown in fig 15g h with regard to two different downscaling models the pixel scale model is better than that of regional scale model with larger cc and smaller rmse specifically the cc values between in situ measurements and pixel scale results increase from 0 523 to 0 546 while rmse decreases from 0 274 to 0 271 in beijing similar improvements can also be seen in other regions within the hrb the metrics cc rmse obtained by pixel scale models are 0 554 0 275 hebei and 0 679 0 216 henan in comparison to 0 550 0 283 hebei and 0 668 0 225 henan provided by regional scale models the geographical location of these above provinces can be seen in fig 1b meanwhile it is calculated that 68 67 171 out of 249 observation wells of larger cc and 52 61 131 out of 249 observation wells of smaller rmse are obtained by using the pixel scale models therefore it is found that both downscaled models can capture the dynamic changes of in situ measurements and the pixel scale model is slightly better it is noteworthy to mention that the pixel downscaling model takes 10 times longer than the regional downscaling model in our framework see also fig s1 of the supplementary material for the overall pattern between the number of pixels and time consumption for different study areas 5 conclusions the coarser resolution of grace observations has caused tremendous interference to master the dynamic changes in water resources much attempts have been taken to downscale the grace observations based on machine learning algorithms however there has been little study on an effective measure to recognize representative input variables predictors of downscaling models up to now while a majority of the previous works are concerned on the new algorithm improvement there are relatively few studies on investigating the discrepancies between different downscaling schemes this study firstly employs the plsr model to identify the predominant variables related to grace observations within the hrb the plsr model suggests that the dominant climate factors related to twsa include et temp lst and sm within the hrb thus they are used as the representative predictors to the subsequent grace data downscaling two kinds of downscaling models are developed by combining the random forest machine learning algorithm and plsr based predictors which successfully improve the resolution of grace observations from 0 5 to 0 05 generally both pixel and regional downscaling schemes are able to determine the signals at local regions while preserving the characteristics with the original grace observations however the pixel scale downscaling results still suffer from systematic effects related to the original data resolution in areas with larger depletion signals the differences in two kinds of downscaling schemes are more pronounced validation against in situ groundwater level measurements found that the downscaled results exhibit the increased correlation by 36 95 and 23 25 relative to the original and simulated gwsa respectively the downscaled gwsa are obtained with higher accuracy from the pixel scale model with higher cc and smaller rmse our results also indicate that the pcr globwb simulations significantly overestimate 3 20 times the downtrends in plain areas between 2003 and 2015 while underestimate the depletion signals in mountain areas in comparison to the downscaled results generally speaking the downscaling schemes developed in this study not only reveal improved spatial variability but also suggest improved temporal coherence to a number of ground water level data the higher resolution products can lead to better understanding on dynamics of regional water resources and may provide quantitative information useful to water management considering regional irrigation water use and groundwater consumption credit authorship contribution statement wenjie yin methodology investigation

2846,we conducted several field surveys to measure velocity and channel geometry in 15 cross sections distributed along three reaches in the boi river southern brazil a canyon river that belongs to the most extensive canyon chain in south america the three reaches present respectively canyon transition and floodplain landscapes the resulting data were used to compute the flow resistance a downstream hydraulic geometry analysis indicates that the exponent describing the velocity increases with the discharge and that these values were between 0 3043 and 0 3507 a downstream hydraulic geometry analysis indicates that changes in velocity with discharge are greater than the rate of change of width or depth it is typically found in steep mountain streams laterally confined and it was verified in the canyon reach however despite the transition presents a considerable lateral constriction and the floodplain reach presents mountain river characteristics both reaches did not present such behavior the findings are coherent with other mountain river datasets although the boi river presents distinct geomorphic units such as glide runs in contrast other available datasets are usually characterized by step pool channels flow resistance in the canyon and transition reaches differ in many ways from floodplain reach indicating larger resistance inside the canyon than outside probably related to the landform and grain size in the canyon regression analysis of the combined field dataset indicated that dimensionless unit discharge is an important independent variable to explain variations in velocity and flow resistance we also verified that the use of rickenmann s equation can be helpful to estimate velocity in canyon rivers our findings include i canyon landscape presents higher friction factors than floodplain landscape and ii canyon and transition landscapes are similar in terms of flow resistance during high flow conditions while floodplain present remarkably differences keywords canyon river friction factor flow resistance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared to lowland rivers hydraulics in steep mountain rivers is poorly understood aberle and smart 2003 powell 2014 paixão and kobiyama 2019 powell 2014 commented that most of the works in fluvial hydraulics had been conducted in lowland streams due to their shallow gradient and slow flows which facilitate surveys on the other hand jong 2015 highlights the lack of data on mountain rivers as one of the challenges for the comprehension of mountain hydrology in the third millennium thus mountain and alluvial rivers differ in characteristics such as slope roughness spatial and temporal variability of bed material channel geometry entrenchment ratio and sediment supply wohl 2010 vasconcellos et al 2021 in addition buffington and montgomery 2013 commented that surveying mountain rivers is logistically a big challenge more dangerous and expensive than that of large lowland rivers when considering mountain rivers carving canyons such a challenge becomes much more significant therefore studies on canyon rivers are still scarce even though canyons are present all over the world recent advances in knowledge related to canyon rivers include the valley formation lamb et al 2006 cook et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 fluvial processes nester et al 2007 de waele et al 2010 venditti et al 2014 gasparini 2014 vasconcellos et al 2021 sediment transport inbar and schick 1979 webb et al 1999 topping et al 1999 nester et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 and management kearsley 1999 harpman 1999 mazzali et al 2021 after an extensive search we verified that although some authors have studied river flow in canyons there is no investigation on the flow resistance of canyon rivers there has been an increase in flow resistance studies in mountain rivers especially in the last two decades comiti et al 2007 yochum et al 2014 however there are not a vast number of field studies for mountain rivers and there are no studies on canyon rivers furthermore many studies considering steep channel gradients were carried out using flume modeling i e rickenmann 1991 maxwell and papanicolau 2001 aberle and smart 2003 just recently there has been observed an increase in studies conducted on field surveys i e wiberg and smith 1991 lee and ferguson 2002 comiti et al 2007 afzalimehr et al 2011 david et al 2011 yochum et al 2012 david et al 2013 thus a direct comparison of the flow resistance between high gradient channels and canyon rivers relies on advancing the investigation of canyon rivers river flow prediction plays an essential role in water resource management such as planning projects irrigation systems hydroelectric power systems and water supply systems adnan et al 2017 as river flow in canyon rivers remains unclear in terms of their mechanisms the use of predictive equations can be useful to preliminarily describe the flow in such areas our study explored factors influencing flow velocity and resistance in a canyon river to verify if rivers in canyons are different from unconfined ones in terms of resistance and to develop predictive equations for these hydraulic variables we used field data of discharge velocity and channel morphology from three reaches located in the canyon transition and floodplain landscapes along the boi river located in southern brazil the boi river belongs to the most extensive canyon chain in south america the field data were analyzed and compared to other mountain rivers datasets in order to verify whether predictive equations for mountain rivers are suitable for canyon rivers 2 resistance equations one of the main ways to analyze the flow resistance in open channels is the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 ff 8 g r h s v 2 where ff is the darcy weisbach friction factor g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 rh is the hydraulic radius m s is the channel slope m m 1 and v is the flow velocity m s 1 several authors proposed resistance equations for mountain rivers egashira and ashida 1991 rickenmann 1991 bathurst 2002 aberle and smart 2003 afzalimehr et al 2011 but there are limitations on how and when these equations can be used the underlying assumption of a rectangular channel in most studies may not properly represent the complexity of river processes furthermore the use of an empirically based equation in new sites may increase uncertainty because the relative importance of different sources of resistance can vary among the sites david et al 2010a furthermore a majority of the researches were conducted in step pool channel so they should be only used in this channel type however most of them impose limitations either on the premises or on the study object the former is commonly related to the assumption of rectangular cross sections the latter is the fact that a majority of the researches were conducted in step pools channels thus these kinds of equations are suitable just for the step pool morphology flow resistance of coarse bed channels depends on flow velocity channel slope water depth and grain size hey 1979 sui et al 2010 powell 2014 based on flume studies rickenmann 1991 developed equations to describe the flow resistance considering the hydraulic parameters mentioned above and bed slope as 2 v 1 3 g 0 20 s 0 20 q 0 60 d 90 0 40 0 03 s 0 40 3 v 0 37 g 0 33 s 0 20 q 0 34 d 90 0 35 s 0 008 where q is the discharge per unit width m2 s 1 d 90 is the 90th percentile of bed grain size distribution m used to represent roughness and q is discharge m3 s 1 rickenmann 1991 conducted experiments to measure the flow resistance of clay suspension with and without bedload transport for different channel slope conditions the large set of physical conditions tested and the simplicity of the equation may turn it useful to predict the river flow in ungauged mountain and canyon streams such tested conditions are similar in many ways to the boi river such as high channel slope bedload transport and apport of fine sediments during high flow events furthermore according to david et al 2010a and rickenmann and recking 2011 it is important to include the bed slope as a factor for variations in flow resistance especially when analyzing different sites by these reasons we verified here the validity of rickenmann s equation to predict the river flow in canyon rivers also the studies conducted in the boi river may serve as the first attempt to describe hydraulics in the most extensive canyon chain in south america 3 methods 3 1 study area the study area is the boi river basin 128 km2 located at the border between the rio grande do sul and santa catarina state southern brazil fig 1 the region is characterized by the bluffs of the serra geral formation especially basaltic spills paixão et al 2021 such geological formation dates back to the gondwana rupture and the south atlantic formation highlighting the area s geological heritage furthermore similar geological formations are observed in western africa especially in namibia unesco recognized the region as one of the global geoparks network namely caminhos dos cânions do sul geopark thus it reinforces the environmental and geological relevancies of the study area the hillslopes are steep presenting significant altimetric variation with vigorous embedded valleys and canyons that open forming alluvial fans the basin altitude varies between 1012 and 85 m a s l the itaimbezinho canyon inside the boi river basin has a 5 8 km length and 500 m height according to the köppen geiger classification the regional climate types are respectively cfb and cfa upstream and downstream of the canyon the precipitation is well distributed along the year with an annual mean of 1800 mm the boi river basin belongs to the aparados da serra national park pnas one of brazil s most important conservation areas and the most extensive canyon chain in south america the basin hosts a project for monitoring water with experimental facilities operating since 2017 in the pnas area where one meteorological and two fluviometric stations are measuring data every ten minutes we chose three reaches with approximately 50 m length to perform this study fig 1 the reaches characteristics are described in detail by paixão et al submitted i canyon landscape cl presents a typical canyon view deeply incised on bedrock located entirely inside the itaimbezinho canyon it represents the end of the boi river trail and upstream from this reach the access is restricted by the national park the mean channel slope is 0 03 m m 1 ii transition landscape tl a typical mountain environment with an entrenched valley with steep hillslopes and represents a morphological transition between the canyon landscape and the floodplain landscape the mean channel slope is 0 016 m m 1 iii floodplain landscape pl a typical alluvial fan environment where the floods spread broadly the mean channel slope is 0 010 m m 1 all reaches feature geomorphic units such as bars glide runs banks and pools sequences and present distinct gradient and valley shapes such conditions allowed us to identify three representative reaches for the different portions of the boi river basin to conduct this study fig 2 provides the longitudinal profile of the boi river indicating the three selected reaches furthermore a set of photos is available to provide additional information on the target river 3 2 field measurements and analysis in order to obtain digital elevation model data with 0 10 m resolution for the three study reaches extensive topographic and bathymetric surveys were carried out in the boi river basin using a total station and an rtk gps these field surveys have been conducted since the beginning of the long term monitoring project in the pnas area furthermore we conducted the field surveys during low flow days because of the dangerous situations that frequently occur with high flows we constructed a rating curve by measuring discharges ranging from 0 2 to 36 m3 s 1 with current meters and adcp devices the discharge measurements in the field were conducted monthly meanwhile the automatic fluviometric station with limnimetric scale provided an water level information every 10 min then discharges higher than 36 m3 s 1 were estimated by the rating curve which may cause inherent uncertainty to canyon rivers analysis because the extrapolation methods of the rating curve cannot be appropriately validated with observed measurements for these cases we have information on the water level and the results of the extrapolation of the rating curve thus to obtain the parameters for characterizing the hydraulic geometry we fit the discharge with the observed conditions by simulations we verified the water level during several field surveys conducted in the boi river correlating water level discharge and river flow velocity in the three study reaches we chose three reaches cl tl and pl to analyze the ff values in these reaches in each of which five cross sections were selected as representative ones for the corresponding landscape according to paixão et al submitted which applied the geomorphic units tool gut developed by wheaton et al 2015 the three reaches present an interaction of geomorphic units as glide runs mid and margin attached bars pools and banks besides we used the previous data of grain size distribution obtained by paixão et al submitted in which at least 100 sediments were measured in the field by the zig zag pebble count procedure proposed by bevenger and king 1995 we also followed the procedure of bunte and abt 2001 of measuring and computing the nominal diameter for each sediment to establish the grain size distribution the standard deviation of the grain size distribution σg was also calculated we calculated the downstream hydraulic parameters gleason 2015 using the software hec ras usace 2010 the obtained data were the flow width wetted area hydraulic radius and flow velocity as we monitor the water level every ten minutes and the rating curve is available we could establish a relation between flow discharge and water level for the three reaches thus we performed steady flow simulations for a considered discharge which was the peak discharge for each considered event the hec ras uses equations of mass conservation and momentum teng et al 2017 as a monitoring time interval in the field is 10 min we considered a 10 minutes steady flow simulation the observed values of water level obtained by the two fluviometric stations were used for model calibration thus when the discharge fits the water level the model was considered calibrated we adopted a manning s roughness coefficient n varying between 0 06 and 0 08 to best describe the surveyed conditions which is reasonable for the boi river conditions vasconcellos et al 2021 utilized n 0 03 to alluvial rivers in the mampituba river basin where the boi river basin is located though this n value can be useful for alluvial fans it may not represent the environmental conditions of the present study in a high steep channel the use of simulations was crucial especially for high flow events upper than 36 m3 s 1 for which we had the discharge estimation and the water level observations the use of steady flow simulations is helpful in these cases because the main goal is to evaluate the downstream hydraulic geometry proposed by leopold and maddock 1952 for the cross sections at a given condition the general characteristics of the three reaches are shown in table 1 besides the ff value we calculated the froude number for each cross section 4 fr v g d v g a w v g q v w where fr is the froude number d is the flow depth m w is the river width m a is the wetted area m2 and v is the mean flow velocity m s 1 the use of predictive equations can be useful to preliminarily describe the flow in canyon rivers thus in order to verify if predictive equations are suitable for canyon rivers we directly compared the observed velocities with those predicted with rickenmann s and other mountain rivers equations in addition we calculated the errors between predicted and observed velocities 5 e r r o r v obs v pr v obs 100 where vobs is the observed flow velocity m s 1 and vpr is the predicted flow velocity m s 1 3 3 combined field data for mountain rivers we combined our data with five other datasets from mountain rivers to explore factors that influence mountain rivers velocity and flow resistance the five other datasets were related to high gradient step pool rivers in mountain environments rather than canyon rivers lee and ferguson 2002 studied the pennine hills england over a range of low to intermediate discharges macfarlane and wohl 2003 and curran and wohl 2003 studied the cascade range washington usa wohl and wilcox 2005 studied streams in new zealand comiti et al 2007 studied the rio cordon in italy these 5 studies were carried out in mountain streams with typical step pools morphology this analytic comparison was done to investigate if the boi river presents similar behavior to step pool streams concerning ff in order to reduce the scale effect caused by different channel geometry and hydraulic conditions we evaluated the data in a non dimensional manner similarly to aberle and smart 2003 comiti et al 2007 and ferguson 2007 6 v v g d c 7 q q g d c 3 where v is the non dimensional velocity v is the velocity in m s 1 q is the unit non dimensional discharge and dc is the roughness parameter which is usually considered approximately equal to d 84 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulics in the boi river five representative cross sections in each reach were selected to perform the downstream hydraulic geometry analysis fig 3 thus the data were combined and analyzed for each reach the mean values of v varied slightly among the cl tl and pl reaches ranging from 0 66 m s 1 cl1 q 2 05 m3 s 1 to 3 52 m s 1 tl5 q 236 m3 s 1 meanwhile the mean values of q were from 2 05 m3 s 1 to 275 m3 s 1 fig 4 shows that the velocity exponent m ranged from 0 3043 to 0 3507 and velocity coefficient k ranges from 0 5068 to 0 6212 where v kqm the depth exponent f ranges from 0 3260 to 0 4209 and the depth coefficient c ranges from 0 2747 to 0 5298 where d cqf the width exponent b ranges from 0 1607 to 0 3072 and the width coefficient a ranges from 9 1347 to 13 67 where w aqb the analysis of the downstream hydraulic geometry fig 4 indicated that d increases immediately with q in cl than tl and pl while v tends to increase similarly among the three reaches meanwhile in tl and pl depth increased more rapidly with discharge than velocity furthermore velocity and depth increase more quickly than river width the similar mean velocity and small depth in pl imply a large spread of the water flow in the terrain the pl reach presents typical characteristics of an alluvial fan as described by vasconcelloset al 2021 on the other hand cl offers specific attributes of canyon rivers as defined by paixão et al submitted the tl reach presents d values more similar to pl for low flow conditions and to cl for high flow conditions which characterizes a transitional manner between canyon and floodplain alluvial fan characteristics table 2 indicates that the hydraulic geometry concept was not fully verified in the boi river it was expected that b f m 1 and a c k 1 to validate the hydraulic geometry gleason 2015 however for cl pl and tl the findings show a dispersion of b f m around 1 for the boi river dataset the result was the closest to 1 when analyzing the a c k the results varied considerably studies involving hydraulic geometry usually consider the alluvial river i e allen et al 1994 grison and kobiyama 2011 julien 2015 studies considering mountain rivers usually do not present the verification b f m or a c k i e lee and ferguson 2002 comiti et al 2007 david et al 2010b commented that exponents of hydraulic geometry relations are useful in determining the dominance of grain resistance versus form resistance these authors also commented that in steep mountain streams usually m f b which indicates that changes in velocity with discharge are greater than the rate of change of width or depth with discharge it is a consequence of the reduction in effective hydraulic resistance caused by grain and form roughness that occupy a smaller portion of the flow when discharge is greater such considerations can be verified in the cl reach denoting their lateral constriction however it is not verified in tl and pl reaches which demonstrates an important difference among the three selected reaches in the boi river thus there might be a theoretical limitation on the hydraulic geometry applications to mountain rivers however despite such limitations of b f m and a c k we demonstrate a substantial difference among cl tl and pl it indicates that efforts on hydraulic geometry for mountain rivers should be made and they are helpful to describe such environments the cl presented subcritical fr 1 conditions for all discharges though field survey visual evidence clearly indicated that supercritical flow occurs locally the tl shows similar behavior to cl reach for pl supercritical fr greater than 1 conditions were observed at two cross sections during low flow conditions and some semi critical flow fr 0 92 to 0 97 at the discharges of 22 and 66 2 m3 s 1 the general feature of the boi river data is fr 0 7 the fr values in pl differ statistically from those in the other two reaches it can be noted that pl presents a large variation in fr besides larger median values and dispersion fig 5 the fr values for the boi river dataset permit to obtain a general value of 0 7 although some visual observations indicate fr 1 in some reaches with eq 5 the fr calculation was done considering the entire cross section area thereby some supercritical flow can be observed partially at certain places in the cross section while fr indicates a subcritical flow paixão et al submitted commented that the spread of the river channel and the depositional sediments induced heterogeneity in the pl reach and caused a kind of mixture in geomorphic units presented in the reach thus many transitions in these geomorphic units may cause a significant variation in fr 4 2 flow resistance in the boi river the relation between ff and q is shown in fig 6 for each reach under distinct flow conditions the decrease of ff ranges between 0 168 and 0 196 indicating that the flow resistance decreases approximately with the fifth root of q the highest values of ff occur in low flow periods as expected and the cl reach presents higher flow resistance during the considered discharges in the present study the cl reach presents the steepest gradient the coarsest grain size distribution the lowest average velocities and the most significant channel roughness among the three reaches the lowest mean velocities may be related to the mixture of geomorphic units that improve roughness to the channel and reduce its velocity despite the reach present the higher channel slope the tl reach presents a flow resistance behavior similar to cl meanwhile pl reach differs considerably the lowest ff values were measured and observed in pl even though lower discharges present lower ff values the pl reach shows the lowest resistance for all considered discharge events jarrett 1982 observed a reduction in the flow resistance due to reducing the channel slope along mountain rivers such a decrease was also reported by comiti et al 2007 and suggested by eq 1 in addition according to eq 1 v increases more quickly than rh thus a decrease in ff is expected with an increase in q we demonstrated that the flow resistance is larger for a reach inside a canyon than outside such a difference is probably related to the landform characterized by canyon rivers and grain size distribution in the canyon the w d ratio during the field survey fig 3 solid line in cl tl and pl were 20 25 7 and 39 6 respectively during the extreme event fig 4 dashed line the w d became 9 16 5 and 13 6 when the river flow fills the canyon during rainfall the hydraulic radius increases immediately in cl than in pl elevating the flow resistance in addition the ff reduction with the increase in discharge is similar to the n decrease reported by asano and uchida 2016 which demonstrated that roughness has a bigger influence during low flows than high flows in general the calculation of flow resistance in steep channels is sensitive to measurement errors of channel geometry by performing a detailed topographic and bathymetric survey 0 10 0 10 m of resolution we attempted to reduce the rh and d measurement errors however this kind of error can inevitably persist due to various factors like riverbed mobility in addition our data could be affected by several factors associated with the precision in velocity estimation i the use of a rating curve which may underestimate or overestimate data and ii the inherent errors in the methods used for measuring velocities in rivers such errors are not specific to the boi river measurements in fact they may occur in both mountain and lowland rivers and they are related to the limitation of measuring methods 4 3 effects of unit discharge on velocity we examined the relationship between v and q both of which are dimensionless parameters with d 84 as the roughness parameter d c in eq 6 and 7 the regression considering the entire dataset n 75 r 2 0 881 for the boi river was 8 v 0 60 q 0 45 we also analyzed the cl tl and pl reaches individually fig 7 the data shows that coefficients for the three reaches do not vary in an extensive range the values of coefficient m and k vary from 0 50 to 0 72 and 0 39 to 0 52 respectively as mentioned above due to the lateral constriction of canyon walls the hydraulic radius increases immediately in cl than in pl during the rainfall event elevating the flow resistance it implies an increase in q when d c is almost constant along the entire boi river similar to datasets in step pool rivers aberle and smart 2003 comiti et al 2007 we also found that q is an important variable for describing velocity in canyon rivers table 3 demonstrates the results for the reaches and the entire boi river together with other research the results indicate that q and v present a high correlation among them being useful for explaining a large dataset furthermore the present work showed a higher correlation between these variables than other studies listed in table 3 except for curran and wohl 2003 the results indicate that q was an important independent variable for explaining v for a large dataset however it is important to state the q is not entirely independent because velocity is ultimately present on both sides of the equation comiti et al 2007 found similar results including q and s as important independent variables 4 4 friction factor relationships we also examined the relationship between ff with q fig 8 for cl pl tl reaches and the entire boi river dataset in addition we compared the relationships with literature for mountain rivers the relation between ff and q discharge for the boi river follows the equation obtained by linear regression on the log transformed data n 75 r 2 0 516 9 ff 0 621 q 0 22 the cl tl and pl reaches present a similar behavior in the decrease of ff varying from 0 203 in cl reach to 0 240 in pl reach however absolute values of ff differ from upstream to downstream showing that roughness is larger in cl than pl we obtained an overall negative relationship between ff and q as observed in the literature rickenmann and recking 2011 used a dataset of 2890 field measurements and found better predictions of flow velocities from resistance equations when using discharge as input the comparison with five other datasets which studied mountain rivers shows distinct characteristics among the individual datasets table 4 curran and wohl 2003 and comiti et al 2007 recorded higher resistance factors at comparable dimensionless unit discharge while wohl and wilcox 2005 recorded the lower resistance factors curran and wohl 2003 developed their studies on a channel with a strong contribution of large woods which can increase flow resistance comiti et al 2007 conducted their studies in a step pool channel with the largest channel slope among the considered datasets according to eq 1 the channel slope has a direct influence on flow resistance on the other hand wohl and wilcox 2005 found the lowest ff values because their study was in reaches with the lowest channel slope it occurs probably because their studies were conducted in the lowest channel slope among the datasets the boi river assumed a consistent flow resistance in comparison with the other dataset for mountain rivers for the compared value of q however it presents the lower rate of change of the friction factor with discharge 4 5 velocity prediction we compared predicted and observed velocities using rickenmann s equations eq 2 and 3 and the dataset equations for mountain rivers listed in table 3 fig 9 considering the rickenmann s equation for the boi river dataset fig 9 a the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 23 1 considering the cl tl and pl reaches individually the average errors were 28 3 17 6 and 17 4 respectively the maximum error 84 occurred in cl1 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 0 05 occurred in pl5 under a discharge of 22 m3 s 1 the velocities for the boi river were generally overestimated with rickenmann s equations comiti et al 2007 reported underestimation for flow velocities over 1 m s 1 for the rickenmann s equation however we observed an apparent overestimation for velocities above 3 m s 1 the remarkable difference occurred in cl reach in which the observed velocity was 2 77 m s 1 and the predicted velocity was 5 11 m s 1 an error of 84 6 the rmse 2 m s 1 for velocities up to 3 m s 1 the results are dispersed somewhat evenly around the y x line which represents a very good fit the flow velocity of 3 m s 1 implies discharges above 195 m3 s 1 in the boi river here it is worth mentioning that the field survey to obtain the topographical data was conducted just under a discharge of 2 to 3 m3 s 1 during a low flow period it therefore supports that rickenmann s equation is useful for describing flow velocities in canyon rivers in southern brazil especially in the cases that flow velocity monitoring is not feasible considering the comiti et al 2007 equation for the boi river dataset fig 9 b the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have a mean error of 25 3 considering the cl tl and pl reaches individually the mean errors were 25 24 1 and 26 9 respectively the rmse 2 19 m s 1 the maximum error 67 2 occurred in tl2 under a discharge of 2 89 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 3 occurred in cl5 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 as a general trend comiti et al 2007 equation underestimates velocities for the boi river despite the results are dispersed nearly around the y x line with wohl and wilcox 2005 velocities for the boi river dataset were underestimated fig 9 c considering cl tl and pl reaches a mean error of 42 6 was observed when analyzed individually the mean errors were 36 5 46 3 and 45 1 respectively the rmse 3 7 m s 1 the maximum error 66 occurred at pl2 under a discharge of 2 89 m3s 1 while the minimum error 0 8 occurred at cl1 under a discharge of 2 05 m3s 1 in case of curran and wohl 2003 it is observed that velocities up to 3 m s 1 and velocities larger than 3 m s 1 were underestimated and overestimated respectively fig 9 d for the boi river dataset the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 33 5 the rmse 2 9 m s 1 considering cl tl and pl reaches individually the average errors were 38 1 24 1 and 38 4 the maximum error 105 occurred at cl1 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 0 5 occurred at tl1 under a discharge of 56 96 m3 s 1 similar to wohl and wilcox 2005 with mcfarlane and wohl 2003 velocities for the entire boi river dataset were underestimated fig 9 e for the boi river dataset the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 45 3 considering cl tl and pl reaches individually the average errors were 39 7 49 2 and 46 9 the rmse 3 9 m s 1 the maximum error 74 4 occurred in pl1 under a discharge of 2 89 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 11 8 occurred in cl1 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 with lee and ferguson 2002 velocities in boi river were underestimated fig 9 f for the dataset the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 36 4 when considering the reaches individually the average errors were 32 4 39 4 and 37 1 the rmse 3 1 m s 1 the maximum error 77 occurred in pl2 under a discharge of 2 89 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 1 05 occurred in cl1 under a discharge of 38 9 m3 s 1 the results indicate that rickenmann s equation presents a good performance for the study area when compared to the other datasets although comiti et al 2007 also present good results for velocities larger than 3 m s 1 comiti et al 2007 present results closer to the y x line while rickenmann 1999 overestimated the results the errors in velocities larger than 3 m s 1 occurred in all reaches it means that there is no reach where the proposed equations work better than others 5 final remarks canyon rivers surveys are logistically a big challenge and more dangerous than those in large lowland rivers especially during high flow conditions as observed in other studies estimations of various parameters are susceptible to field measurement errors many researchers e g bathurst 2002 comiti et al 2007 discussed that steep mountain rivers present problems to apply resistance laws primarily because of the quality of input parameters which are difficult to obtain however the downstream hydraulic geometry approach combined with the field obtained data might provide greater insight into the role of flow resistance in canyon rivers supporting estimation of the river flow conditions comiti et al 2007 commented that the scarcity of field data limits the ability to derive statistically sound at a station analysis thus the field measurements permitted us to broaden the findings related to flow resistance in the boi river located inside the most extensive canyon chain in south america by considering the limitations of resistance laws establishment we decided to use a simple efficient and straightforward resistance law i e the darcy weisbach equation despite the inherent uncertainties the findings include i canyon landscape presents higher friction factors than floodplain landscape and ii canyon and transition landscapes are similar in terms of flow resistance with higher flow conditions meanwhile floodplain present remarkably different friction factors probably geomorphic units and dmax exert an essential role in determining flow resistance which should be verified with future research since the present study can be considered as the first study of this kind of canyon river future research will enhance the knowledge of these systems thus supplementary measurements of canyon rivers will be required to expand the findings on this type of river that presents particular importance due to its geological heritage and environmental characteristics furthermore new intermediate reaches between the canyon and floodplain should be investigated such efforts will improve the knowledge of the hydrogeomorphic aspects of canyon rivers credit authorship contribution statement maurício a paixão conceptualization methodology validation formal

2846,we conducted several field surveys to measure velocity and channel geometry in 15 cross sections distributed along three reaches in the boi river southern brazil a canyon river that belongs to the most extensive canyon chain in south america the three reaches present respectively canyon transition and floodplain landscapes the resulting data were used to compute the flow resistance a downstream hydraulic geometry analysis indicates that the exponent describing the velocity increases with the discharge and that these values were between 0 3043 and 0 3507 a downstream hydraulic geometry analysis indicates that changes in velocity with discharge are greater than the rate of change of width or depth it is typically found in steep mountain streams laterally confined and it was verified in the canyon reach however despite the transition presents a considerable lateral constriction and the floodplain reach presents mountain river characteristics both reaches did not present such behavior the findings are coherent with other mountain river datasets although the boi river presents distinct geomorphic units such as glide runs in contrast other available datasets are usually characterized by step pool channels flow resistance in the canyon and transition reaches differ in many ways from floodplain reach indicating larger resistance inside the canyon than outside probably related to the landform and grain size in the canyon regression analysis of the combined field dataset indicated that dimensionless unit discharge is an important independent variable to explain variations in velocity and flow resistance we also verified that the use of rickenmann s equation can be helpful to estimate velocity in canyon rivers our findings include i canyon landscape presents higher friction factors than floodplain landscape and ii canyon and transition landscapes are similar in terms of flow resistance during high flow conditions while floodplain present remarkably differences keywords canyon river friction factor flow resistance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared to lowland rivers hydraulics in steep mountain rivers is poorly understood aberle and smart 2003 powell 2014 paixão and kobiyama 2019 powell 2014 commented that most of the works in fluvial hydraulics had been conducted in lowland streams due to their shallow gradient and slow flows which facilitate surveys on the other hand jong 2015 highlights the lack of data on mountain rivers as one of the challenges for the comprehension of mountain hydrology in the third millennium thus mountain and alluvial rivers differ in characteristics such as slope roughness spatial and temporal variability of bed material channel geometry entrenchment ratio and sediment supply wohl 2010 vasconcellos et al 2021 in addition buffington and montgomery 2013 commented that surveying mountain rivers is logistically a big challenge more dangerous and expensive than that of large lowland rivers when considering mountain rivers carving canyons such a challenge becomes much more significant therefore studies on canyon rivers are still scarce even though canyons are present all over the world recent advances in knowledge related to canyon rivers include the valley formation lamb et al 2006 cook et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 fluvial processes nester et al 2007 de waele et al 2010 venditti et al 2014 gasparini 2014 vasconcellos et al 2021 sediment transport inbar and schick 1979 webb et al 1999 topping et al 1999 nester et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 and management kearsley 1999 harpman 1999 mazzali et al 2021 after an extensive search we verified that although some authors have studied river flow in canyons there is no investigation on the flow resistance of canyon rivers there has been an increase in flow resistance studies in mountain rivers especially in the last two decades comiti et al 2007 yochum et al 2014 however there are not a vast number of field studies for mountain rivers and there are no studies on canyon rivers furthermore many studies considering steep channel gradients were carried out using flume modeling i e rickenmann 1991 maxwell and papanicolau 2001 aberle and smart 2003 just recently there has been observed an increase in studies conducted on field surveys i e wiberg and smith 1991 lee and ferguson 2002 comiti et al 2007 afzalimehr et al 2011 david et al 2011 yochum et al 2012 david et al 2013 thus a direct comparison of the flow resistance between high gradient channels and canyon rivers relies on advancing the investigation of canyon rivers river flow prediction plays an essential role in water resource management such as planning projects irrigation systems hydroelectric power systems and water supply systems adnan et al 2017 as river flow in canyon rivers remains unclear in terms of their mechanisms the use of predictive equations can be useful to preliminarily describe the flow in such areas our study explored factors influencing flow velocity and resistance in a canyon river to verify if rivers in canyons are different from unconfined ones in terms of resistance and to develop predictive equations for these hydraulic variables we used field data of discharge velocity and channel morphology from three reaches located in the canyon transition and floodplain landscapes along the boi river located in southern brazil the boi river belongs to the most extensive canyon chain in south america the field data were analyzed and compared to other mountain rivers datasets in order to verify whether predictive equations for mountain rivers are suitable for canyon rivers 2 resistance equations one of the main ways to analyze the flow resistance in open channels is the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 ff 8 g r h s v 2 where ff is the darcy weisbach friction factor g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 rh is the hydraulic radius m s is the channel slope m m 1 and v is the flow velocity m s 1 several authors proposed resistance equations for mountain rivers egashira and ashida 1991 rickenmann 1991 bathurst 2002 aberle and smart 2003 afzalimehr et al 2011 but there are limitations on how and when these equations can be used the underlying assumption of a rectangular channel in most studies may not properly represent the complexity of river processes furthermore the use of an empirically based equation in new sites may increase uncertainty because the relative importance of different sources of resistance can vary among the sites david et al 2010a furthermore a majority of the researches were conducted in step pool channel so they should be only used in this channel type however most of them impose limitations either on the premises or on the study object the former is commonly related to the assumption of rectangular cross sections the latter is the fact that a majority of the researches were conducted in step pools channels thus these kinds of equations are suitable just for the step pool morphology flow resistance of coarse bed channels depends on flow velocity channel slope water depth and grain size hey 1979 sui et al 2010 powell 2014 based on flume studies rickenmann 1991 developed equations to describe the flow resistance considering the hydraulic parameters mentioned above and bed slope as 2 v 1 3 g 0 20 s 0 20 q 0 60 d 90 0 40 0 03 s 0 40 3 v 0 37 g 0 33 s 0 20 q 0 34 d 90 0 35 s 0 008 where q is the discharge per unit width m2 s 1 d 90 is the 90th percentile of bed grain size distribution m used to represent roughness and q is discharge m3 s 1 rickenmann 1991 conducted experiments to measure the flow resistance of clay suspension with and without bedload transport for different channel slope conditions the large set of physical conditions tested and the simplicity of the equation may turn it useful to predict the river flow in ungauged mountain and canyon streams such tested conditions are similar in many ways to the boi river such as high channel slope bedload transport and apport of fine sediments during high flow events furthermore according to david et al 2010a and rickenmann and recking 2011 it is important to include the bed slope as a factor for variations in flow resistance especially when analyzing different sites by these reasons we verified here the validity of rickenmann s equation to predict the river flow in canyon rivers also the studies conducted in the boi river may serve as the first attempt to describe hydraulics in the most extensive canyon chain in south america 3 methods 3 1 study area the study area is the boi river basin 128 km2 located at the border between the rio grande do sul and santa catarina state southern brazil fig 1 the region is characterized by the bluffs of the serra geral formation especially basaltic spills paixão et al 2021 such geological formation dates back to the gondwana rupture and the south atlantic formation highlighting the area s geological heritage furthermore similar geological formations are observed in western africa especially in namibia unesco recognized the region as one of the global geoparks network namely caminhos dos cânions do sul geopark thus it reinforces the environmental and geological relevancies of the study area the hillslopes are steep presenting significant altimetric variation with vigorous embedded valleys and canyons that open forming alluvial fans the basin altitude varies between 1012 and 85 m a s l the itaimbezinho canyon inside the boi river basin has a 5 8 km length and 500 m height according to the köppen geiger classification the regional climate types are respectively cfb and cfa upstream and downstream of the canyon the precipitation is well distributed along the year with an annual mean of 1800 mm the boi river basin belongs to the aparados da serra national park pnas one of brazil s most important conservation areas and the most extensive canyon chain in south america the basin hosts a project for monitoring water with experimental facilities operating since 2017 in the pnas area where one meteorological and two fluviometric stations are measuring data every ten minutes we chose three reaches with approximately 50 m length to perform this study fig 1 the reaches characteristics are described in detail by paixão et al submitted i canyon landscape cl presents a typical canyon view deeply incised on bedrock located entirely inside the itaimbezinho canyon it represents the end of the boi river trail and upstream from this reach the access is restricted by the national park the mean channel slope is 0 03 m m 1 ii transition landscape tl a typical mountain environment with an entrenched valley with steep hillslopes and represents a morphological transition between the canyon landscape and the floodplain landscape the mean channel slope is 0 016 m m 1 iii floodplain landscape pl a typical alluvial fan environment where the floods spread broadly the mean channel slope is 0 010 m m 1 all reaches feature geomorphic units such as bars glide runs banks and pools sequences and present distinct gradient and valley shapes such conditions allowed us to identify three representative reaches for the different portions of the boi river basin to conduct this study fig 2 provides the longitudinal profile of the boi river indicating the three selected reaches furthermore a set of photos is available to provide additional information on the target river 3 2 field measurements and analysis in order to obtain digital elevation model data with 0 10 m resolution for the three study reaches extensive topographic and bathymetric surveys were carried out in the boi river basin using a total station and an rtk gps these field surveys have been conducted since the beginning of the long term monitoring project in the pnas area furthermore we conducted the field surveys during low flow days because of the dangerous situations that frequently occur with high flows we constructed a rating curve by measuring discharges ranging from 0 2 to 36 m3 s 1 with current meters and adcp devices the discharge measurements in the field were conducted monthly meanwhile the automatic fluviometric station with limnimetric scale provided an water level information every 10 min then discharges higher than 36 m3 s 1 were estimated by the rating curve which may cause inherent uncertainty to canyon rivers analysis because the extrapolation methods of the rating curve cannot be appropriately validated with observed measurements for these cases we have information on the water level and the results of the extrapolation of the rating curve thus to obtain the parameters for characterizing the hydraulic geometry we fit the discharge with the observed conditions by simulations we verified the water level during several field surveys conducted in the boi river correlating water level discharge and river flow velocity in the three study reaches we chose three reaches cl tl and pl to analyze the ff values in these reaches in each of which five cross sections were selected as representative ones for the corresponding landscape according to paixão et al submitted which applied the geomorphic units tool gut developed by wheaton et al 2015 the three reaches present an interaction of geomorphic units as glide runs mid and margin attached bars pools and banks besides we used the previous data of grain size distribution obtained by paixão et al submitted in which at least 100 sediments were measured in the field by the zig zag pebble count procedure proposed by bevenger and king 1995 we also followed the procedure of bunte and abt 2001 of measuring and computing the nominal diameter for each sediment to establish the grain size distribution the standard deviation of the grain size distribution σg was also calculated we calculated the downstream hydraulic parameters gleason 2015 using the software hec ras usace 2010 the obtained data were the flow width wetted area hydraulic radius and flow velocity as we monitor the water level every ten minutes and the rating curve is available we could establish a relation between flow discharge and water level for the three reaches thus we performed steady flow simulations for a considered discharge which was the peak discharge for each considered event the hec ras uses equations of mass conservation and momentum teng et al 2017 as a monitoring time interval in the field is 10 min we considered a 10 minutes steady flow simulation the observed values of water level obtained by the two fluviometric stations were used for model calibration thus when the discharge fits the water level the model was considered calibrated we adopted a manning s roughness coefficient n varying between 0 06 and 0 08 to best describe the surveyed conditions which is reasonable for the boi river conditions vasconcellos et al 2021 utilized n 0 03 to alluvial rivers in the mampituba river basin where the boi river basin is located though this n value can be useful for alluvial fans it may not represent the environmental conditions of the present study in a high steep channel the use of simulations was crucial especially for high flow events upper than 36 m3 s 1 for which we had the discharge estimation and the water level observations the use of steady flow simulations is helpful in these cases because the main goal is to evaluate the downstream hydraulic geometry proposed by leopold and maddock 1952 for the cross sections at a given condition the general characteristics of the three reaches are shown in table 1 besides the ff value we calculated the froude number for each cross section 4 fr v g d v g a w v g q v w where fr is the froude number d is the flow depth m w is the river width m a is the wetted area m2 and v is the mean flow velocity m s 1 the use of predictive equations can be useful to preliminarily describe the flow in canyon rivers thus in order to verify if predictive equations are suitable for canyon rivers we directly compared the observed velocities with those predicted with rickenmann s and other mountain rivers equations in addition we calculated the errors between predicted and observed velocities 5 e r r o r v obs v pr v obs 100 where vobs is the observed flow velocity m s 1 and vpr is the predicted flow velocity m s 1 3 3 combined field data for mountain rivers we combined our data with five other datasets from mountain rivers to explore factors that influence mountain rivers velocity and flow resistance the five other datasets were related to high gradient step pool rivers in mountain environments rather than canyon rivers lee and ferguson 2002 studied the pennine hills england over a range of low to intermediate discharges macfarlane and wohl 2003 and curran and wohl 2003 studied the cascade range washington usa wohl and wilcox 2005 studied streams in new zealand comiti et al 2007 studied the rio cordon in italy these 5 studies were carried out in mountain streams with typical step pools morphology this analytic comparison was done to investigate if the boi river presents similar behavior to step pool streams concerning ff in order to reduce the scale effect caused by different channel geometry and hydraulic conditions we evaluated the data in a non dimensional manner similarly to aberle and smart 2003 comiti et al 2007 and ferguson 2007 6 v v g d c 7 q q g d c 3 where v is the non dimensional velocity v is the velocity in m s 1 q is the unit non dimensional discharge and dc is the roughness parameter which is usually considered approximately equal to d 84 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulics in the boi river five representative cross sections in each reach were selected to perform the downstream hydraulic geometry analysis fig 3 thus the data were combined and analyzed for each reach the mean values of v varied slightly among the cl tl and pl reaches ranging from 0 66 m s 1 cl1 q 2 05 m3 s 1 to 3 52 m s 1 tl5 q 236 m3 s 1 meanwhile the mean values of q were from 2 05 m3 s 1 to 275 m3 s 1 fig 4 shows that the velocity exponent m ranged from 0 3043 to 0 3507 and velocity coefficient k ranges from 0 5068 to 0 6212 where v kqm the depth exponent f ranges from 0 3260 to 0 4209 and the depth coefficient c ranges from 0 2747 to 0 5298 where d cqf the width exponent b ranges from 0 1607 to 0 3072 and the width coefficient a ranges from 9 1347 to 13 67 where w aqb the analysis of the downstream hydraulic geometry fig 4 indicated that d increases immediately with q in cl than tl and pl while v tends to increase similarly among the three reaches meanwhile in tl and pl depth increased more rapidly with discharge than velocity furthermore velocity and depth increase more quickly than river width the similar mean velocity and small depth in pl imply a large spread of the water flow in the terrain the pl reach presents typical characteristics of an alluvial fan as described by vasconcelloset al 2021 on the other hand cl offers specific attributes of canyon rivers as defined by paixão et al submitted the tl reach presents d values more similar to pl for low flow conditions and to cl for high flow conditions which characterizes a transitional manner between canyon and floodplain alluvial fan characteristics table 2 indicates that the hydraulic geometry concept was not fully verified in the boi river it was expected that b f m 1 and a c k 1 to validate the hydraulic geometry gleason 2015 however for cl pl and tl the findings show a dispersion of b f m around 1 for the boi river dataset the result was the closest to 1 when analyzing the a c k the results varied considerably studies involving hydraulic geometry usually consider the alluvial river i e allen et al 1994 grison and kobiyama 2011 julien 2015 studies considering mountain rivers usually do not present the verification b f m or a c k i e lee and ferguson 2002 comiti et al 2007 david et al 2010b commented that exponents of hydraulic geometry relations are useful in determining the dominance of grain resistance versus form resistance these authors also commented that in steep mountain streams usually m f b which indicates that changes in velocity with discharge are greater than the rate of change of width or depth with discharge it is a consequence of the reduction in effective hydraulic resistance caused by grain and form roughness that occupy a smaller portion of the flow when discharge is greater such considerations can be verified in the cl reach denoting their lateral constriction however it is not verified in tl and pl reaches which demonstrates an important difference among the three selected reaches in the boi river thus there might be a theoretical limitation on the hydraulic geometry applications to mountain rivers however despite such limitations of b f m and a c k we demonstrate a substantial difference among cl tl and pl it indicates that efforts on hydraulic geometry for mountain rivers should be made and they are helpful to describe such environments the cl presented subcritical fr 1 conditions for all discharges though field survey visual evidence clearly indicated that supercritical flow occurs locally the tl shows similar behavior to cl reach for pl supercritical fr greater than 1 conditions were observed at two cross sections during low flow conditions and some semi critical flow fr 0 92 to 0 97 at the discharges of 22 and 66 2 m3 s 1 the general feature of the boi river data is fr 0 7 the fr values in pl differ statistically from those in the other two reaches it can be noted that pl presents a large variation in fr besides larger median values and dispersion fig 5 the fr values for the boi river dataset permit to obtain a general value of 0 7 although some visual observations indicate fr 1 in some reaches with eq 5 the fr calculation was done considering the entire cross section area thereby some supercritical flow can be observed partially at certain places in the cross section while fr indicates a subcritical flow paixão et al submitted commented that the spread of the river channel and the depositional sediments induced heterogeneity in the pl reach and caused a kind of mixture in geomorphic units presented in the reach thus many transitions in these geomorphic units may cause a significant variation in fr 4 2 flow resistance in the boi river the relation between ff and q is shown in fig 6 for each reach under distinct flow conditions the decrease of ff ranges between 0 168 and 0 196 indicating that the flow resistance decreases approximately with the fifth root of q the highest values of ff occur in low flow periods as expected and the cl reach presents higher flow resistance during the considered discharges in the present study the cl reach presents the steepest gradient the coarsest grain size distribution the lowest average velocities and the most significant channel roughness among the three reaches the lowest mean velocities may be related to the mixture of geomorphic units that improve roughness to the channel and reduce its velocity despite the reach present the higher channel slope the tl reach presents a flow resistance behavior similar to cl meanwhile pl reach differs considerably the lowest ff values were measured and observed in pl even though lower discharges present lower ff values the pl reach shows the lowest resistance for all considered discharge events jarrett 1982 observed a reduction in the flow resistance due to reducing the channel slope along mountain rivers such a decrease was also reported by comiti et al 2007 and suggested by eq 1 in addition according to eq 1 v increases more quickly than rh thus a decrease in ff is expected with an increase in q we demonstrated that the flow resistance is larger for a reach inside a canyon than outside such a difference is probably related to the landform characterized by canyon rivers and grain size distribution in the canyon the w d ratio during the field survey fig 3 solid line in cl tl and pl were 20 25 7 and 39 6 respectively during the extreme event fig 4 dashed line the w d became 9 16 5 and 13 6 when the river flow fills the canyon during rainfall the hydraulic radius increases immediately in cl than in pl elevating the flow resistance in addition the ff reduction with the increase in discharge is similar to the n decrease reported by asano and uchida 2016 which demonstrated that roughness has a bigger influence during low flows than high flows in general the calculation of flow resistance in steep channels is sensitive to measurement errors of channel geometry by performing a detailed topographic and bathymetric survey 0 10 0 10 m of resolution we attempted to reduce the rh and d measurement errors however this kind of error can inevitably persist due to various factors like riverbed mobility in addition our data could be affected by several factors associated with the precision in velocity estimation i the use of a rating curve which may underestimate or overestimate data and ii the inherent errors in the methods used for measuring velocities in rivers such errors are not specific to the boi river measurements in fact they may occur in both mountain and lowland rivers and they are related to the limitation of measuring methods 4 3 effects of unit discharge on velocity we examined the relationship between v and q both of which are dimensionless parameters with d 84 as the roughness parameter d c in eq 6 and 7 the regression considering the entire dataset n 75 r 2 0 881 for the boi river was 8 v 0 60 q 0 45 we also analyzed the cl tl and pl reaches individually fig 7 the data shows that coefficients for the three reaches do not vary in an extensive range the values of coefficient m and k vary from 0 50 to 0 72 and 0 39 to 0 52 respectively as mentioned above due to the lateral constriction of canyon walls the hydraulic radius increases immediately in cl than in pl during the rainfall event elevating the flow resistance it implies an increase in q when d c is almost constant along the entire boi river similar to datasets in step pool rivers aberle and smart 2003 comiti et al 2007 we also found that q is an important variable for describing velocity in canyon rivers table 3 demonstrates the results for the reaches and the entire boi river together with other research the results indicate that q and v present a high correlation among them being useful for explaining a large dataset furthermore the present work showed a higher correlation between these variables than other studies listed in table 3 except for curran and wohl 2003 the results indicate that q was an important independent variable for explaining v for a large dataset however it is important to state the q is not entirely independent because velocity is ultimately present on both sides of the equation comiti et al 2007 found similar results including q and s as important independent variables 4 4 friction factor relationships we also examined the relationship between ff with q fig 8 for cl pl tl reaches and the entire boi river dataset in addition we compared the relationships with literature for mountain rivers the relation between ff and q discharge for the boi river follows the equation obtained by linear regression on the log transformed data n 75 r 2 0 516 9 ff 0 621 q 0 22 the cl tl and pl reaches present a similar behavior in the decrease of ff varying from 0 203 in cl reach to 0 240 in pl reach however absolute values of ff differ from upstream to downstream showing that roughness is larger in cl than pl we obtained an overall negative relationship between ff and q as observed in the literature rickenmann and recking 2011 used a dataset of 2890 field measurements and found better predictions of flow velocities from resistance equations when using discharge as input the comparison with five other datasets which studied mountain rivers shows distinct characteristics among the individual datasets table 4 curran and wohl 2003 and comiti et al 2007 recorded higher resistance factors at comparable dimensionless unit discharge while wohl and wilcox 2005 recorded the lower resistance factors curran and wohl 2003 developed their studies on a channel with a strong contribution of large woods which can increase flow resistance comiti et al 2007 conducted their studies in a step pool channel with the largest channel slope among the considered datasets according to eq 1 the channel slope has a direct influence on flow resistance on the other hand wohl and wilcox 2005 found the lowest ff values because their study was in reaches with the lowest channel slope it occurs probably because their studies were conducted in the lowest channel slope among the datasets the boi river assumed a consistent flow resistance in comparison with the other dataset for mountain rivers for the compared value of q however it presents the lower rate of change of the friction factor with discharge 4 5 velocity prediction we compared predicted and observed velocities using rickenmann s equations eq 2 and 3 and the dataset equations for mountain rivers listed in table 3 fig 9 considering the rickenmann s equation for the boi river dataset fig 9 a the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 23 1 considering the cl tl and pl reaches individually the average errors were 28 3 17 6 and 17 4 respectively the maximum error 84 occurred in cl1 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 0 05 occurred in pl5 under a discharge of 22 m3 s 1 the velocities for the boi river were generally overestimated with rickenmann s equations comiti et al 2007 reported underestimation for flow velocities over 1 m s 1 for the rickenmann s equation however we observed an apparent overestimation for velocities above 3 m s 1 the remarkable difference occurred in cl reach in which the observed velocity was 2 77 m s 1 and the predicted velocity was 5 11 m s 1 an error of 84 6 the rmse 2 m s 1 for velocities up to 3 m s 1 the results are dispersed somewhat evenly around the y x line which represents a very good fit the flow velocity of 3 m s 1 implies discharges above 195 m3 s 1 in the boi river here it is worth mentioning that the field survey to obtain the topographical data was conducted just under a discharge of 2 to 3 m3 s 1 during a low flow period it therefore supports that rickenmann s equation is useful for describing flow velocities in canyon rivers in southern brazil especially in the cases that flow velocity monitoring is not feasible considering the comiti et al 2007 equation for the boi river dataset fig 9 b the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have a mean error of 25 3 considering the cl tl and pl reaches individually the mean errors were 25 24 1 and 26 9 respectively the rmse 2 19 m s 1 the maximum error 67 2 occurred in tl2 under a discharge of 2 89 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 3 occurred in cl5 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 as a general trend comiti et al 2007 equation underestimates velocities for the boi river despite the results are dispersed nearly around the y x line with wohl and wilcox 2005 velocities for the boi river dataset were underestimated fig 9 c considering cl tl and pl reaches a mean error of 42 6 was observed when analyzed individually the mean errors were 36 5 46 3 and 45 1 respectively the rmse 3 7 m s 1 the maximum error 66 occurred at pl2 under a discharge of 2 89 m3s 1 while the minimum error 0 8 occurred at cl1 under a discharge of 2 05 m3s 1 in case of curran and wohl 2003 it is observed that velocities up to 3 m s 1 and velocities larger than 3 m s 1 were underestimated and overestimated respectively fig 9 d for the boi river dataset the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 33 5 the rmse 2 9 m s 1 considering cl tl and pl reaches individually the average errors were 38 1 24 1 and 38 4 the maximum error 105 occurred at cl1 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 0 5 occurred at tl1 under a discharge of 56 96 m3 s 1 similar to wohl and wilcox 2005 with mcfarlane and wohl 2003 velocities for the entire boi river dataset were underestimated fig 9 e for the boi river dataset the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 45 3 considering cl tl and pl reaches individually the average errors were 39 7 49 2 and 46 9 the rmse 3 9 m s 1 the maximum error 74 4 occurred in pl1 under a discharge of 2 89 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 11 8 occurred in cl1 under a discharge of 195 m3 s 1 with lee and ferguson 2002 velocities in boi river were underestimated fig 9 f for the dataset the predicted velocities for cl tl and pl reaches have an average error of 36 4 when considering the reaches individually the average errors were 32 4 39 4 and 37 1 the rmse 3 1 m s 1 the maximum error 77 occurred in pl2 under a discharge of 2 89 m3 s 1 while the minimum error 1 05 occurred in cl1 under a discharge of 38 9 m3 s 1 the results indicate that rickenmann s equation presents a good performance for the study area when compared to the other datasets although comiti et al 2007 also present good results for velocities larger than 3 m s 1 comiti et al 2007 present results closer to the y x line while rickenmann 1999 overestimated the results the errors in velocities larger than 3 m s 1 occurred in all reaches it means that there is no reach where the proposed equations work better than others 5 final remarks canyon rivers surveys are logistically a big challenge and more dangerous than those in large lowland rivers especially during high flow conditions as observed in other studies estimations of various parameters are susceptible to field measurement errors many researchers e g bathurst 2002 comiti et al 2007 discussed that steep mountain rivers present problems to apply resistance laws primarily because of the quality of input parameters which are difficult to obtain however the downstream hydraulic geometry approach combined with the field obtained data might provide greater insight into the role of flow resistance in canyon rivers supporting estimation of the river flow conditions comiti et al 2007 commented that the scarcity of field data limits the ability to derive statistically sound at a station analysis thus the field measurements permitted us to broaden the findings related to flow resistance in the boi river located inside the most extensive canyon chain in south america by considering the limitations of resistance laws establishment we decided to use a simple efficient and straightforward resistance law i e the darcy weisbach equation despite the inherent uncertainties the findings include i canyon landscape presents higher friction factors than floodplain landscape and ii canyon and transition landscapes are similar in terms of flow resistance with higher flow conditions meanwhile floodplain present remarkably different friction factors probably geomorphic units and dmax exert an essential role in determining flow resistance which should be verified with future research since the present study can be considered as the first study of this kind of canyon river future research will enhance the knowledge of these systems thus supplementary measurements of canyon rivers will be required to expand the findings on this type of river that presents particular importance due to its geological heritage and environmental characteristics furthermore new intermediate reaches between the canyon and floodplain should be investigated such efforts will improve the knowledge of the hydrogeomorphic aspects of canyon rivers credit authorship contribution statement maurício a paixão conceptualization methodology validation formal

2847,accurate quantification of terrestrial evapotranspiration et is essential to understanding the interaction between land and atmosphere as well as the feedback response of vegetation dynamics in our previous work a physically based ecohydrological model called the simple terrestrial hydrosphere sith model was developed to estimate et and the other et related variables based on the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac however the sith model sithv1 still has some deficiencies in the model structure and parameters which can result in potential uncertainty in the estimation of terrestrial et in this study we aimed to address these limitations by developing a new version of the sith model sithv2 the main modifications of the sithv2 model include 1 the vegetation moisture constraint module is updated with vegetation optical depth observations 2 the critical model parameters associated with root distribution are constrained using flux observations 3 the soil module is extended to a three layer module with 5 m of total depth 4 an irrigation input water strategy is applied in the cropland areas and 5 the latest era5 land reanalysis data with a finer spatial resolution are used as the meteorological forcing data the estimated et of the sithv2 model was validated compared at multiple scales i e site plot basin and global with flux data basin water balance data and other mainstream global et products respectively the results demonstrate that the sithv2 model performs better than the sithv1 model with an improvement in the overall model root mean square error of 0 66 mm day 1 plot scale and 98 58 mm year 1 basin scale representing 27 and 22 improvements over the sithv1 model in the same circumstances respectively in addition the performance of the sithv2 model ranks well when compared to the existing terrestrial et models and products the improvements to the sith model should allow improved estimation of terrestrial et and provide support to potential studies in water transfer within the gspac keywords evapotranspiration water stress sith model multi scale verification data availability the generated global terrestrial et dataset of the sithv2 model can be achieved from the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc at http dx doi org 10 11888 atmos tpdc 272728 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a crucial nexus that is tightly coupled with the global water cycle and energy balance oki and kanae 2006 about 65 of land precipitation is supplied by the terrestrial et process ma et al 2021 dorigo et al 2021 which concomitantly consumes more than 50 of the net solar radiation received by the land surface trenberth et al 2009 in recent decades much effort has been devoted to estimating large scale terrestrial et using ecohydrological models and remote sensing technology fisher et al 2008 jung et al 2019 ma et al 2019 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 accurate estimation of terrestrial et fluxes is a key goal of the ecohydrological community and benefits many scientific fields and practical applications such as studies of the water carbon cycle under the scenario of climate change frankenberg et al 2011 held and soden 2006 ma and zhang 2022 zhou et al 2021 the detection of extreme events miralles et al 2019 teuling et al 2010 and agricultural water management allen et al 2011 xu et al 2020 despite the sustained advances in global et modeling that have been achieved over the past few decades ma et al 2021 pan et al 2020 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 there is still a need to characterize the et processes in a more realistic and detailed manner thereby improving et estimation overall among the different models the simple terrestrial hydrosphere sith model zhu et al 2019 was proposed to simulate the terrestrial et process within the context of the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac scanlon and kustas 2012 in brief the sith model depicts an integrated water path between vegetation canopy and groundwater and is one of the few global et models that considers the effect of groundwater in the root zone in regulating soil moisture conditions fan 2015 which can mitigate the impact of drought in areas with a shallow groundwater depth gou and miller 2014 another significant feature in the sith model is the ability to adjust the allocation of potential plant transpiration to different soil layers combined with root distribution and soil water conditions chen et al 2022 reported that the sith model performed well compared to other process based global et models for estimating the different et components such as soil evaporation plant transpiration and canopy intercepted evaporation across various plant functional types pfts nevertheless there are still some limitations to the sith model firstly the previous sith model sithv1 did not take the plant moisture status into account which can lead to potential over estimation when estimating et due to the weak moisture constraint especially in forest ecosystems chen et al 2020 fortunately microwave based remote sensing technology has the capacity to monitor plant water content via the indicator of vegetation optical depth vod which is based on the attenuation of passive and active microwave observations yielded by vegetation jackson and schmugge 1991 moesinger et al 2020 owe et al 2008 in this present study we attempted to incorporate vod into the sith model in order to better characterize water stress for vegetation growth secondly the sithv1 model regards precipitation to be the only source of input water applied to cropland however around 40 of the global cropland is made up of irrigated land which contributes 60 of the global food supply and concurrently consumes approximately 70 of the global freshwater withdrawal from the surface subsurface water system foley et al 2011 siebert and döll 2010 thus an irrigation water use iwu scheme is introduced in the updated sith model based on the authors prior work on satellite based global iwu estimation zhang et al 2022 thirdly plant transpiration generally dominates the total et jasechko et al 2013 and is typically governed by the soil water availability and the root distribution which are given as empirical parameters in the sithv1 model hence in the updated sith model the soil module is changed to three layers and the total depth is extended to 5 m allowing the model to cover the majority of the global root depths for the various pfts canadell et al 1996 maeght et al 2013 in addition the fundamental parameters related to plant root distribution are optimized using global flux observations lastly the meteorological forcing data are replaced by the fifth generation of european reanalysis data era5 land hereafter referred to as era5l to run this updated sith model at a global scale the era5l product is a state of the art reanalysis product developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which offers spatio temporally continuous data at a finer spatial resolution 0 1 globally the focus of this study was to present an updated version of the sith model sithv2 which includes 1 modification of the model structure with new features 2 multi scale validation of the sithv2 model using eddy covariance flux measurements and basin scale water balance estimates and 3 a global comparison of the sith based et estimates with other mainstream global et products in terms of magnitude and trend changes in addition we produced a global daily et dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 1 based on the newly modified sithv2 model 2 methods 2 1 model development in the previous version zhu et al 2019 the sith model was proposed for continuous modeling of the water path in the gspac fig 1 the total et estimated from the sith model is the sum of the bare soil evaporation e s plant transpiration t r and canopy intercepted evaporation e i it is worth noting that the water stress on e s is constrained by the first soil layer while t r is constrained by both the multiple soil layers and the groundwater if the groundwater can recharge to the root zone 1 e t e i e s t r 2 e i f wet α δ δ γ r nc λ 3 e s f sm α δ δ γ r ns g λ 4 t r 1 f wet f v f t i 1 n f smv i t ps i i 1 n t pg i where α is the priestly taylor coefficient which is set to 1

and n is the total number of soil layers n 3 in the sithv2 model r ns and r nc are the net radiation r n allocated to the bare soil and canopy surface w m 2 respectively which are complementary r n r nc r ns their calculation is conducted according to r ns r n exp k r n lai beer 1852 fisher et al 2008 where k r n is the extinction coefficient which is set to 0 6 impens and lemeur 1969 t ps i and t pg i are the potential transpiration from the unsaturated i th layer and saturated i th layer which can be derived from the total potential et by considering the vertical distributions of plant roots and the depth of the groundwater table see details in zhu et al 2019 the f functions are the different constraints on the potential evaporation and transpiration where f wet is the relative surface wetness f v is the vegetation water stress on the plant transpiration f sm is the soil moisture constraint on the bare soil evaporation f smv i is the soil moisture constraint on the plant transpiration at the i th soil layer and f t is the temperature constraint on plant growth among the different constraints f wet f t and f sm can be calculated as 5 f wet min χ s c t p 1 6 f t exp t a t opt t opt 2 7 f sm 0 i f θ i θ wp θ i θ wp θ fc θ wp i f θ wp θ i θ fc 1 i f θ i θ fc where t p is the potential transpiration rate of the canopy χ is the fractional interception occurring during daytime which is set to 0 7 s c is the water storage capacity of the canopy which is defined as the product of precipitation and the leaf area index lai t a is the air temperature c t opt is the optimum plant growth temperature c which can be defined as the air temperature when the product of lai r n and t a is the highest during the growing season θ fc is the soil field capacity θ wp is the soil moisture at the wilting point and θ i is the actual soil moisture at the i th soil layer the first soil layer is only considered for the soil evaporation notably the critical threshold θ c for soil moisture in the sith model is the multifactor influenced parameter representing the state at which soil moisture begins to have a constraint on plant transpiration which dominates the transpiration changes in transitional regimes schwingshackl et al 2017 wang et al 2022 instead of only considering the soil type as a static constant as in the sithv1 model we revised the expression of θ c in the sithv2 model to reflect the characteristic water stress sensitivities for different pfts according to purdy et al 2018 and van diepen et al 1989 8 θ c 1 p θ fc θ wp h θ wp h 9 p 1 1 e t p b 1 h c 10 θ wp h θ wp k where k is a sensitivity index for the soil water content which can be determined as the square root of the canopy height h c θ wp h is the adjusted wilting point for soil moisture when considering h c p is a parameter for regulating θ c between θ fc and θ wp h which can be determined by the potential et e t p and h c and b denotes the weight of h c on θ c which is set to 0 1 thus the soil moisture constraint function for plant transpiration at the i th layer f smv i can be expressed as follows martens et al 2017 11 f smv i 0 i f θ i θ wp h 1 θ c θ i θ c θ wp h k i f θ wp h θ i θ c 1 i f θ i θ c fig 2 illustrates a concept map of the response of f smv to the gradients of soil water content under different biotic and abiotic conditions i e h c and e t p clearly the soil water constraint scheme for transpiration adopted by the sithv1 model yellow line is simplified as a logarithmic function to soil water content where f smv decreases rapidly from the critical point of soil moisture however the new constraint scheme in the sithv2 model provides a wide range of f smv to a specific value of θ based on different h c and e t p values which is more in line with the real situation of vegetation e g forest or grassland where the sensitivity to soil moisture varies over different plant heights with specific environmental conditions furthermore the plant transpiration estimated by the sithv1 model is not constrained by the moisture content of the vegetation status to address this issue we added a plant water stress module based on the microwave remotely sensed vod it has been well documented that vod is closely related to the density type and water content of vegetation and is advantageous for monitoring tropical forest without the effect of cloud liu et al 2011 2015 in the sithv2 model the vegetation water stress f v is described as follows 12 f v v od v od max where v od max is the maximum value for the annual vod time series at each pixel in addition to better estimate the et from irrigated cropland we introduced an iwu scheme into the sithv2 model the irrigation signal can be first identified by the discrepancy between the dynamic changes of soil moisture and precipitation in the irrigated area the volume of the iwu can then be derived based on the balanced relationship of the soil water variations zhang et al 2022 the iwu estimates were obtained from the authors prior work and were integrated into the sith model as exceptional input water applied to the cropland specifically the original monthly iwu estimates for global irrigated land were simply dispersed to the start the middle and the end of a month by weighting of the distribution density of the lai this can be expected to enhance the water supply in the irrigated regions during the growing season especially at a long term time scale i e monthly or yearly 2 2 parameter optimization scheme in the sithv2 model the soil layer is extended to a total depth of 5 m to better accommodate the root zone of forest thus we re optimized two critical parameters d50 and d95 which are fundamental for representing at least 50 or 95 of the root system above the depth of d50 or d95 respectively based on the observed et at each eddy covariance ec flux station we used the differential evolution markov chain de mc algorithm ter braak and vrugt 2008 to obtain the posterior distribution of d50 and d95 globally in general the posterior distribution of the candidate parameter sets ϕ in a bayesian framework can be expressed as 13 f ϕ e t obs f ϕ t 1 t 1 2 π σ 2 exp e t sim ϕ t e t obs t 2 2 σ 2 where f ϕ represents the prior parameter distributions f ϕ e t obs represents the posterior parameter distributions t is the time step i e days t is the total number of observations simulations e t obs is the observed et data at the flux station e t sim is the simulated et from the sithv2 model and σ is the standard deviation of the model error in the de mc algorithm the parameter proposals ϕ p are generated based on two randomly selected chains ϕ r1 and ϕ r2 and the difference is multiplied by a scaling factor ρ and added to the current chain ϕ i 14 ϕ p ϕ i ρ ϕ r1 ϕ r2 e where the scaling factor ρ can be set to 2 38 2 d and d is the dimension of parameter sets and e is selected from a symmetrical distribution and represents a probabilistic acceptance rule in the de mc algorithm specifically in this study we performed 12 chains in parallel with a total of 10000 iterations including a burn in time of 500 iterations during the optimization five fold cross validation was utilized in the parameter optimization approach the flux data were divided into five subsamples with one subsample preserved as the data for validating the model while the remaining four subsamples were used as the target function this cross validation procedure was repeated five times and the results were then averaged to obtain an optimal solution for each site this strategy maximizes the data utilization and can mitigate the overfitting and selection bias in the optimization in addition we employed a double optimization scheme to implement parameter optimization at the pft scale this means that the optimal solutions for each site were first optimized using the site observed et as the target to achieve the best root mean square error at the site level s rmse the optimal parameters for the individual pfts could then be determined based on the posterior distribution of the parameters closest to the obtained s rmse for a particular pft zhang et al 2019b this procedure ensured that the optimized parameters were optimally balanced in each pft specific site even though the length of the valid data varied from site to site the estimated posterior distribution of d50 and d95 for the different pfts are given in appendix fig a 1 2 3 model performance evaluation metrics to ensure that the et related variables can reach equilibrium a 50 year spin up was carried out by repeating the forcing from 2001 to 2005 10 times the model was then run at the end of the spin up to generate the global et estimates we also employed several statistical metrics to quantify the model performance in this study among the different metrics a taylor diagram was used to show the differences between the sithv2 and sithv1 models across multiple flux sites and pfts in a taylor diagram the model performance can be characterized as a comprehensive indicator the taylor skill score ts score which is based on the correlation coefficient r and the normalized standard deviation zhang et al 2017 thus each point in a taylor diagram can be scored as 15 s 2 1 r σ s σ o 1 σ s σ o 2 where s is the ts score bounded by zero and unity where unity represents perfect agreement with the observation and σ s and σ o are the standard deviations of the simulation and observation respectively the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were also included in the statistical analysis for the comparison of the various et models products these metrics are calculated as follows 16 rmse 1 t t 1 t o t m t 2 17 nse 1 t 1 t o t m t 2 t 1 t o t o 2 where o t and m t are the observed and simulated data at time t respectively and o is the mean value of the observed data in general the better the model performance the lower the value of the rmse and the closer the nse value is to 1 3 data 3 1 eddy covariance data we used the observed meteorological and flux data from 175 ec stations globally see table s1 in the supplementary information to optimize the candidate parameters and evaluate model performance at the plot scale these data were obtained from the fluxnet2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 and contain 12 kinds of major pfts under different climate zones fig 3 it should be noted that quality control of the flux data is necessary before using these data in the parameter optimization procedure the flux data half hourly were considered missing in this study if the energy balance residual term i e the net radiation minus the sum of the latent heat sensible heat and geothermal heat exceeded 300 w m 2 linear interpolation was performed on the missing data if the data gap was less than 6 h in a day after the pre processing step the quality of the ec data used in this study was strictly corrected which ensured that the energy closure was generally above 70 at all the different pfts finally the flux data for each selected ec station were processed to a daily time series 3 2 inputs of the sithv2 model for global application 3 2 1 remote sensing data the dynamics of land vegetation are important to determine the energy partitioning when estimating terrestrial et to characterize the variation of vegetation growth the lai dataset version 50 from the global land surface satellite glass product liang et al 2021 was used in this study this lai dataset was initially developed from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data with a spatial resolution of 0 05 for the period of 2001 2018 furthermore to depict the vegetation water content in the sithv2 model we used a vod product from the vod climate archive vodca which is based on microwave observations from multiple sensors and can be divided into different spectral bands moesinger et al 2020 the 0 25 daily x band vodca product with a continuous coverage from 2001 to 2018 was used in this study the land surface net radiation data used in this study were derived from the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system ceres project which provides satellite based observations of the earth s radiation budget kato et al 2018 specifically we selected the synoptic top of atmosphere toa and surface fluxes and clouds syn product and calculated the net surface radiation from the level 3 syn1deg dataset with the up down shortwave longwave flux in addition the global dynamic pft distribution was obtained from the modis land cover product mcd12c1 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 globally sulla menashe et al 2019 the main types of pfts in the mcd12c1 product are in accordance with the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp land cover classification system the details of the selected remote sensing data are summarized in table 1 3 2 2 meteorological and ancillary data the meteorological variables in the sithv2 model including the 2 m air temperature t a surface air pressure p a and the total precipitation p tot were obtained from the era5l product muñoz sabater et al 2021 produced by the ecmwf at a spatial resolution of 0 1 the original half hourly era5l product was selected in this study followed by aggregation to a daily scale to match the temporal interval in the sithv2 model the global soil type map used in the sithv2 model was derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 wieder et al 2014 which combines the available soil information from regional and national institutes worldwide and provides a soil raster database with a 30 arc second resolution 3 3 water balance based evapotranspiration data in addition to evaluating the estimates of terrestrial et at selected flux sites we also used independent et estimates to test the sithv2 model at a basin scale the water balanced evapotranspiration estimates et wb were generated from the residual of the water balance equation 18 e t wb p r δ s where p is the annual precipitation mm year 1 r is annual runoff for each basin and δ s is the changes in terrestrial water storage a total of 49 basins from ma et al 2021 were selected which represent a broad range of climate zones and pfts the precipitation data were acquired from the global precipitation climatology center gpcc full data monthly product version 2018 schneider et al 2018 for most basins while the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism precipitation data daly et al 2008 were used for basins in the continental united states because the prism product is considered to be the most accurate precipitation product for the united states lundquist et al 2015 the measured runoff data for these basins were obtained from the global runoff data center the china sediment bulletin and the united states geological survey the δ s was extracted from the gravity recovery and climate experiment data grace rl06m version 2 0 released by the jet propulsion laboratory wiese et al 2016 3 4 comparative mainstream global et products six mainstream terrestrial et products were selected to compare with the et estimates of the sithv2 model at a global scale the terrestrial et products used in this study were mainly derived from 1 the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam which is a widely used process based et model martens et al 2017 2 the calibration free complementary relationship cr model which is driven by meteorological forcing and is used to calculate et from the point view of atmospheric scope ma et al 2021 3 the fluxcom initiative product which is estimated based on flux observations throughout the globe and a data driven machine learning method jung et al 2019 4 the global land data assimilation system gldas which was developed to assimilate multi source observations and simulations of land surface models to generate credible surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 and 5 era5l which is a cutting edge global reanalysis product with a 0 1 spatial resolution and half hourly temporal interval muñoz sabater et al 2021 notably the et products selected in this study were the most representative models or products among the different types of et estimates we also used et simulations from the ensemble mean of the 20 earth system models in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 which is a mission led by the world climate research programme in contrast to the above mentioned global et products these et simulations were derived by an online earth system instead of meteorological forcing the details of these selected products are provided in table 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 et validation at the plot scale using et observations we validated the et estimates of the sithv2 model at the 175 flux stations and compared the results to those of the sithv1 model the taylor diagrams show the validation results for all the individual sites fig 4a and for the different pfts fig 4b moreover the ts score was used for scoring the model performance which is a comprehensive indicator derived from the statistics of model errors zhu et al 2016 despite the comparable correlation coefficient ranges the sithv2 model is closer to 1 in terms of the normalized standard deviation n std than the sithv1 model fig 4a the violin plots in the bottom panel demonstrate that the 25th to 75th percentile range of the ts score for the sithv1 model is 0 71 to 0 89 with a median value of 0 82 whereas the 25th to 75th percentile range of the ts score for the sithv2 model is 0 82 to 0 93 with a median value of 0 88 thus when all 175 global flux stations are used as a benchmark the estimated et of the sithv2 model is more in line with the observations and the ts score of the sithv2 model is approximately 7 3 more than that of the sithv1 model furthermore we also aggregated the et estimates to the pft scale to test the model performance between sithv1 and sithv2 fig 4b demonstrates that the correlation between the estimated et of the sithv2 model and the observed et in the various pfts is stronger than that of the sithv1 model except for ebf and sav with r values ranging from 0 80 to 0 90 in addition the results of the sithv2 model are more concentrated around the arc with n std 1 indicating that the et estimates of the sithv2 model are closer to the average of the observations furthermore at least one representative site from each pft was selected to demonstrate the superiority of the sithv2 model with multi year monthly averages which can make the contrast in the seasonal variations in model performance even more clearer as shown in fig 5 it is evident that the sithv2 model improves the et estimation to various extents for the different pfts with the reduction of rmse values ranging from 16 5 ru skp from 9 52 to 7 95 mm month 1 to 68 9 cn ham from 13 36 to 4 15 mm month 1 this is mostly due to the modified soil water constraint scheme implemented in the sithv2 model which accounts for the influence of vod and the relocation of roots in different soil layers thereby reducing the over estimation of the old version in most cases to further demonstrate the performance of the new version sithv2 we ran the pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 and the mod16 model mu et al 2011 on these selected sites and calculated their performance at the pft level separately different colored backgrounds as a side by side comparison in addition to the internal comparison between sithv2 and sithv1 as shown in fig 6 the performance of the different models shows a high degree of pft specific variation which can be attributed to the different model structures among the different models the rmse of the sithv2 model is generally the smallest across the 12 kinds of pfts compared to the other models with the median values ranging from 0 48 to 0 83 mm day 1 the average median value of the rmse in all the pfts for the sithv2 model is 0 66 mm day 1 while that for the sithv1 model is 0 90 mm day 1 which suggests that the overall accuracy of the sithv2 model is improved by around 27 when compared to the sithv1 model in terms of rmse statistics furthermore the performance of the pt jpl model is close to that of the sithv2 model in most pfts with an average rmse median value of 0 82 mm day 1 meanwhile the mod16 model shows a wide range of variability across the multiple pfts with the median value of the rmse ranging from 0 62 to 1 29 mm day 1 despite it performing better in the dbf and ebf areas consequently based on the ground benchmark of ec observations from a total of 175 flux stations it is confirmed that the sithv2 model can provide more accurate et estimates across the different pfts compared to the sithv1 model and it also performs well when compared with the pt jpl and mod16 models 4 2 et validation at the basin scale using e t wb unlike the use of ground based data to validate the performance of models at the plot scale the grid based terrestrial et estimates are commonly subject to the limitation of the uncertainty for the scale effect which is caused by the spatial mismatch between the simulated et grid and the ground based flux footprint therefore we used the independent water balanced et data to validate the generated et outputs at the basin scale as described in section 3 4 the magnitude of the et in the major global basins was derived from the water balance equation based on ground or remotely sensed observations of runoff precipitation and changes in terrestrial water storage fig 7a illustrates the scatter plot linear regression between the et estimates of the sithv2 model red and sithv1 model blue for these basins against the water balanced et e t wb over the period from 2003 to 2013 it can be found that the et estimated by the sithv2 model is generally more consistent with the e t wb than that estimated by the sithv1 model with a higher correlation r 0 96 and smaller deviation rmse 98 58 mm year 1 furthermore the sithv2 model shows an improvement of nearly 0 1 compared to the sithv1 model in terms of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the ratio of the simulated et sithv2 to e t wb was also calculated to highlight the spatial distribution of the over or under estimation of the et estimates with e t wb as the benchmark in the majority of basins the difference between the estimated et obtained by the sithv2 model and e t wb is fairly minimal with ratios ranging from 0 8 to 1 2 meanwhile it can be found that the et estimated by the sithv2 model exhibits a certain degree of over estimation of up to double the corresponding e t wb in basins at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere e g siberia and northern canada indeed the freeze thaw processes at high latitudes have a direct effect on soil water content which in turn influences the et process niu and yang 2006 however the current process based et model lacks a meaningful connection of the freeze thaw process and the vast amount of measurable data for calibration such as subsurface ice which makes accurate estimation of et in these specific regions a challenging task moreover we also selected six mainstream global terrestrial et products for a side by side comparison with the sithv2 model at the basin scale fig 8 the correlation relationship r between all the et products and e t wb is very high with a range of 0 93 to 0 97 which indicates the good consistency in the spatial variability of these et products across the selected basins however the accuracies of these et products are relatively diverse with the gldas product having the largest rmse 164 mm year 1 and the smallest nse 0 71 in contrast the cr product performs the best with the smallest rmse 81 83 mm year 1 and the largest nse 0 93 among these products which are similar results to those of the sithv2 model obtained in this study meanwhile the fluxcom et product was produced using substantial ground based flux data with machine learning technology and shows high correlation r 0 97 with the derived e t wb across the different basins however this product shows some over estimation for e t wb in the basins with an arid or cold climate which are often characterized by low et values the performance of the gleam product is similar to that of the sithv1 model with an rmse value of 128 21 mm year 1 and an nse value of 0 82 however the results of the gleam product are significantly higher than the results of the other models in basins with a humid climate e g the amazon region where the maximum value exceeds 1500 mm year 1 in terms of statistical indicators the cmip6 product s rmse 90 56 mm year 1 r 0 97 and nse 0 91 values are in the upper middle level in the overall range but the lowest slope 0 86 and the largest intercept 110 07 mm year 1 are found among these model statistics this indicates that the et estimates of the cmip6 product are significantly under estimated at high values and over estimated at low values in these basins the results of the era5l product also yield a relatively high nse value 0 87 and an rmse value of 110 14 mm year 1 which are similar to the results of the fluxcom product nevertheless despite the era5l product achieving a slope value of 1 its intercept is rather large 72 57 mm year 1 implying an overall over estimation in these 49 basins relative to e t wb it is necessary to emphasize that the different spatial resolutions and production methods of these global et products lead to differences in capturing the spatial details of terrestrial et although their statistical metrics are similar at the basin scale in general the terrestrial et estimated by the sithv2 model is in good agreement with the e t wb at the basin scale and the performance is also at a superior level when compared to the primary global et products available at present 4 3 global comparison of et magnitude and trend analysis the global distribution of the multi year 2001 2018 mean et estimated by the sithv2 model is displayed in fig 9a the estimated terrestrial et exhibits a clear and reasonable geographical distribution with the maximum et appearing in the tropics around the equator 1200 1500 mm year 1 followed by the temperate humid regions 600 1200 mm year 1 and then the alpine and high latitude areas 300 600 mm year 1 and the lowest et is found in the desert and ice regions 100 mm year 1 the latitudinal profile of the estimated et derived by the sithv2 model is in close agreement with the highest confidence curve fig 9b which indicates that the sithv2 model is effective in capturing the variance in global terrestrial et at different latitudes however the et profile estimated by the sithv2 model is positioned lower than that of the other et models in regions south of 40 s this may be related to the increased uncertainty of the era5 based precipitation in south america xiong et al 2022 especially since the assimilation system hardly corrects the systematic bias in the solid precipitation i e snowfall due to the insufficient observations muñoz sabater et al 2021 at the global scale the magnitude of the total terrestrial et estimated by the various global et products is a crucial comparative indicator to compare the estimated terrestrial et volumes we used the overlapping period from 2001 to 2013 which covers the time span for both the sith based et estimates and the other et products as shown in fig 10a the sithv2 model estimates a total annual mean terrestrial et of 70 3 0 6 1 0 3 km 3 which is very close to the gleam estimate 70 4 0 8 1 0 3 km 3 and represents a 6 4 increase over the sithv1 model 66 1 0 6 1 0 3 km 3 the results of these three datasets together with cmip6 are lower than the average value 71 5 1 0 3 km 3 of all the selected global et products whereas the estimated et of the remaining four products is higher than the average value with the cr 73 0 0 7 1 0 3 km 3 and gldas 72 1 3 7 1 0 3 km 3 products being closest to the average and the fluxcom product occupying the highest position 77 6 0 3 1 0 3 km 3 in comparison the reported volume of the terrestrial et derived from the different models products in previous studies has primarily ranged from 65 1 0 3 km 3 to 75 1 0 3 km 3 with individual values of 65 5 1 0 3 km 3 oki and kanae 2006 65 1 0 3 km 3 jung et al 2010 67 9 1 0 3 km 3 miralles et al 2011 74 3 1 0 3 km 3 zhang et al 2015 72 8 1 0 3 km 3 zhang et al 2019a and 71 1 1 0 3 km 3 zeng et al 2014 more recent studies have tended to yield et volumes in excess of 70 1 0 3 km 3 furthermore the energy balancing strategy seems to be more likely to estimate greater et volumes with the magnitude of the global terrestrial et estimate being up to around 75 1 0 3 km 3 jung et al 2019 l ecuyer et al 2015 wild et al 2015 in addition it is worth noting that the time span of the above mentioned et statistics varies across the different studies we divided the global terrestrial et estimates into five main types based on the köppen climate classification system see fig s1 in the supplementary information namely tropical zone dryland zone temperate zone continental zone and polar and alpine zone to compare the differences of the multiple global et products under the different climatic conditions over the globe the et volumes estimated by the different products are more or less equivalent to the average value 32 6 1 4 1 0 3 km 3 in the tropical zone fig 10b except for the cmip6 product which displays obvious under estimation 29 6 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 however the performance of the different et products in the arid zone varies considerably fig 10c among which the et estimate from the fluxcom product 12 9 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 is the highest compared to the others the era5l and cr products obtain comparable et volumes in the dryland zone around 10 0 6 1 0 3 km 3 to 10 5 0 4 1 0 3 km 3 while the result of the sithv2 model is similar to that of the gleam product with 8 8 0 5 1 0 3 km 3 unlike the tropical zone it is interesting to note that the et estimate of the cmip6 product is the second highest for the dryland zone at 12 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 for the temperate zone fig 10d the era5l product shows the highest et estimate 16 3 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 whereas the lowest et volume is estimated by the sithv1 model 13 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 the et estimates from the fluxcom and gldas products in the temperate zone are much higher than the overall average with values of 16 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 and 15 7 0 7 1 0 3 km 3 respectively however the et estimates from the gleam cr and cmip6 products and the sithv2 model are substantially lower ranging from 14 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 to 15 0 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 in the context of continental climatic conditions with considerable daily and annual air temperature variations the sithv1 model tends to under estimate the volume of et 10 6 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 compared to the other terrestrial et products fig 10e in the sithv2 model the estimated total et for the continental climate zone is 11 8 0 3 1 0 3 km 3 which is comparable to the 11 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 for the cr product and the 11 7 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 for the cmip6 product the four remaining products generally estimate higher et values exceeding the average 12 2 0 9 1 0 3 km 3 in the continental climate zone ranging from 12 7 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 gleam to 13 2 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 era5l lastly the total et volume in the polar and alpine zone fig 10f is much lower than in the other zones due to the reduced solar radiation lower temperature and lack of vegetation cover nonetheless the various et products exhibit a degree of variability with the cmip6 product yielding the highest et volume of 2 3 0 01 1 0 3 km 3 and the smallest volume of et is estimated by the sithv1 model 1 47 0 01 1 0 3 km 3 the et volume estimated by the sithv2 model 1 93 0 02 1 0 3 km 3 for the polar and alpine zone is very close to that of the era5l product 1 92 0 03 1 0 3 km 3 comparatively the gleam 1 64 0 03 1 0 3 km 3 fluxcom 1 68 0 003 1 0 3 km 3 and gldas 1 67 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 products yield similar et volumes that are slightly less than the overall average 1 78 0 4 1 0 3 km 3 for this zone the trend of annual global terrestrial et estimated by the sithv2 model from 2011 to 2018 is 0 41 mm year 1 p 0 05 while the trend for the sithv1 model is 0 38 mm year 1 p 0 05 fig 11 it should be emphasized that the valid periods for the comparable et products differ and their overlapping period in this study spans from 2001 to 2013 as a result the confidence interval shrinks after 2013 because of the decreased contribution from the various global et products both versions of the sith model demonstrate a strong correlation with the ensemble mean of the multiple et products which excludes the sith based et estimates indicating that the anomaly trend of the sith based et is realistic and can be used to achieve credible trend analysis for historical periods moreover the sithv2 model is more consistent with the ensemble mean value of the multiple et products in the details compared to the sithv1 model in summary the global terrestrial et produced by the sithv2 model outperforms that of the sithv1 model and the sithv2 model can provide reliable et estimates in terms of global spatial distribution latitudinal profile and multi year et volumes for both a global scale and the various climate zones as well as the anomaly trend of terrestrial et nonetheless the sithv2 model still has some limitations and deficiencies that will require further enhancement in the next stage although the current spatial resolution reaches 0 1 which is globally in line with the era5l product a finer spatial resolution is important for local scale applications to this end downscaling schemes such as sub grid optimization could be an efficient way to generate finer et estimates by combining the advantages of multi source reanalysis and satellite forcing data with different spatial resolutions also for the current version the iwu is regarded as additional rainfall only loosely coupled to the sithv2 model which can ensure water availability to irrigated regions at the monthly yearly scale limited by the monthly iwu estimates but makes it difficult to characterize the irrigation recharge at a fine temporal scale together with the challenge of representing specific irrigation modes i e sprinkler drip or flood irrigation these factors will increase the uncertainty in the simulation of soil water dynamics hence to assimilate satellite based soil moisture into the simulation would be a more direct way of characterizing realistic surface water conditions and further improving cropland et estimation in addition the current model is only applied to the simulation in the vertical direction without the interaction from the neighboring grids by introducing topographic factors e g elevation slope and aspect to describe the lateral water flow between adjacent grid cells this would enhance the simulation of the sithv2 model to three dimensions and could thus greatly expand the application potential at the basin level 5 conclusions this study was dedicated to improving the et simulation in the sith model within the gspac we enhanced the vegetation moisture constraint module by coupling satellite based vod measurements moreover a dynamic adjustment scheme for the critical threshold of soil water content based on different canopy heights and specific environmental conditions was applied in the sithv2 model the extended soil layer with re optimized root distribution parameters was used to better characterize the effect of soil water dynamics on the et simulation we also added an irrigation water strategy as extra input water applied in the croplands zone in addition the meteorological forcing data in the sithv2 model were updated to the state of the art era5l reanalysis product validations against 175 ec stations and water balance data from 49 large river basins suggested that the sithv2 model is more accurate and has less uncertainty than the sithv1 model at both plot and basin scales further multi product evaluations using the water balance approach also demonstrated that the sithv2 model ranks well when compared to most of the mainstream et products lastly a side by side comparison at the global scale indicated that the sithv2 model is consistent with the ensemble mean results of the multiple terrestrial et products both in terms of magnitude and trends this newly improved sith model will provide the necessary framework for estimating et from the gspac and will promote better support for exploring land atmosphere feedback loops ecosystem water consumption and related ecohydrological studies

2847,accurate quantification of terrestrial evapotranspiration et is essential to understanding the interaction between land and atmosphere as well as the feedback response of vegetation dynamics in our previous work a physically based ecohydrological model called the simple terrestrial hydrosphere sith model was developed to estimate et and the other et related variables based on the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac however the sith model sithv1 still has some deficiencies in the model structure and parameters which can result in potential uncertainty in the estimation of terrestrial et in this study we aimed to address these limitations by developing a new version of the sith model sithv2 the main modifications of the sithv2 model include 1 the vegetation moisture constraint module is updated with vegetation optical depth observations 2 the critical model parameters associated with root distribution are constrained using flux observations 3 the soil module is extended to a three layer module with 5 m of total depth 4 an irrigation input water strategy is applied in the cropland areas and 5 the latest era5 land reanalysis data with a finer spatial resolution are used as the meteorological forcing data the estimated et of the sithv2 model was validated compared at multiple scales i e site plot basin and global with flux data basin water balance data and other mainstream global et products respectively the results demonstrate that the sithv2 model performs better than the sithv1 model with an improvement in the overall model root mean square error of 0 66 mm day 1 plot scale and 98 58 mm year 1 basin scale representing 27 and 22 improvements over the sithv1 model in the same circumstances respectively in addition the performance of the sithv2 model ranks well when compared to the existing terrestrial et models and products the improvements to the sith model should allow improved estimation of terrestrial et and provide support to potential studies in water transfer within the gspac keywords evapotranspiration water stress sith model multi scale verification data availability the generated global terrestrial et dataset of the sithv2 model can be achieved from the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc at http dx doi org 10 11888 atmos tpdc 272728 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a crucial nexus that is tightly coupled with the global water cycle and energy balance oki and kanae 2006 about 65 of land precipitation is supplied by the terrestrial et process ma et al 2021 dorigo et al 2021 which concomitantly consumes more than 50 of the net solar radiation received by the land surface trenberth et al 2009 in recent decades much effort has been devoted to estimating large scale terrestrial et using ecohydrological models and remote sensing technology fisher et al 2008 jung et al 2019 ma et al 2019 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 accurate estimation of terrestrial et fluxes is a key goal of the ecohydrological community and benefits many scientific fields and practical applications such as studies of the water carbon cycle under the scenario of climate change frankenberg et al 2011 held and soden 2006 ma and zhang 2022 zhou et al 2021 the detection of extreme events miralles et al 2019 teuling et al 2010 and agricultural water management allen et al 2011 xu et al 2020 despite the sustained advances in global et modeling that have been achieved over the past few decades ma et al 2021 pan et al 2020 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 there is still a need to characterize the et processes in a more realistic and detailed manner thereby improving et estimation overall among the different models the simple terrestrial hydrosphere sith model zhu et al 2019 was proposed to simulate the terrestrial et process within the context of the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac scanlon and kustas 2012 in brief the sith model depicts an integrated water path between vegetation canopy and groundwater and is one of the few global et models that considers the effect of groundwater in the root zone in regulating soil moisture conditions fan 2015 which can mitigate the impact of drought in areas with a shallow groundwater depth gou and miller 2014 another significant feature in the sith model is the ability to adjust the allocation of potential plant transpiration to different soil layers combined with root distribution and soil water conditions chen et al 2022 reported that the sith model performed well compared to other process based global et models for estimating the different et components such as soil evaporation plant transpiration and canopy intercepted evaporation across various plant functional types pfts nevertheless there are still some limitations to the sith model firstly the previous sith model sithv1 did not take the plant moisture status into account which can lead to potential over estimation when estimating et due to the weak moisture constraint especially in forest ecosystems chen et al 2020 fortunately microwave based remote sensing technology has the capacity to monitor plant water content via the indicator of vegetation optical depth vod which is based on the attenuation of passive and active microwave observations yielded by vegetation jackson and schmugge 1991 moesinger et al 2020 owe et al 2008 in this present study we attempted to incorporate vod into the sith model in order to better characterize water stress for vegetation growth secondly the sithv1 model regards precipitation to be the only source of input water applied to cropland however around 40 of the global cropland is made up of irrigated land which contributes 60 of the global food supply and concurrently consumes approximately 70 of the global freshwater withdrawal from the surface subsurface water system foley et al 2011 siebert and döll 2010 thus an irrigation water use iwu scheme is introduced in the updated sith model based on the authors prior work on satellite based global iwu estimation zhang et al 2022 thirdly plant transpiration generally dominates the total et jasechko et al 2013 and is typically governed by the soil water availability and the root distribution which are given as empirical parameters in the sithv1 model hence in the updated sith model the soil module is changed to three layers and the total depth is extended to 5 m allowing the model to cover the majority of the global root depths for the various pfts canadell et al 1996 maeght et al 2013 in addition the fundamental parameters related to plant root distribution are optimized using global flux observations lastly the meteorological forcing data are replaced by the fifth generation of european reanalysis data era5 land hereafter referred to as era5l to run this updated sith model at a global scale the era5l product is a state of the art reanalysis product developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which offers spatio temporally continuous data at a finer spatial resolution 0 1 globally the focus of this study was to present an updated version of the sith model sithv2 which includes 1 modification of the model structure with new features 2 multi scale validation of the sithv2 model using eddy covariance flux measurements and basin scale water balance estimates and 3 a global comparison of the sith based et estimates with other mainstream global et products in terms of magnitude and trend changes in addition we produced a global daily et dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 1 based on the newly modified sithv2 model 2 methods 2 1 model development in the previous version zhu et al 2019 the sith model was proposed for continuous modeling of the water path in the gspac fig 1 the total et estimated from the sith model is the sum of the bare soil evaporation e s plant transpiration t r and canopy intercepted evaporation e i it is worth noting that the water stress on e s is constrained by the first soil layer while t r is constrained by both the multiple soil layers and the groundwater if the groundwater can recharge to the root zone 1 e t e i e s t r 2 e i f wet α δ δ γ r nc λ 3 e s f sm α δ δ γ r ns g λ 4 t r 1 f wet f v f t i 1 n f smv i t ps i i 1 n t pg i where α is the priestly taylor coefficient which is set to 1

soil moisture at the wilting point and θ i is the actual soil moisture at the i th soil layer the first soil layer is only considered for the soil evaporation notably the critical threshold θ c for soil moisture in the sith model is the multifactor influenced parameter representing the state at which soil moisture begins to have a constraint on plant transpiration which dominates the transpiration changes in transitional regimes schwingshackl et al 2017 wang et al 2022 instead of only considering the soil type as a static constant as in the sithv1 model we revised the expression of θ c in the sithv2 model to reflect the characteristic water stress sensitivities for different pfts according to purdy et al 2018 and van diepen et al 1989 8 θ c 1 p θ fc θ wp h θ wp h 9 p 1 1 e t

to 0 1 thus the soil moisture constraint function for plant transpiration at the i th layer f smv i can be expressed as follows martens et al 2017 11 f smv i 0 i f θ i θ wp h 1 θ c θ i θ c θ wp h k i f θ wp h θ i θ c 1 i f θ i θ c fig 2 illustrates a concept map of the response of f smv to the gradients of soil water content under different biotic and abiotic conditions i e h c and e t p clearly the soil water constraint scheme for transpiration adopted by the sithv1 model yellow line is simplified as a logarithmic function to soil water content where f smv decreases rapidly from the critical point of soil moisture however the new constraint scheme in the sithv2 model provides a wide range of f smv to a specific value of θ based on different h c and e t p values which is more in line with the real situation of vegetation e g forest or grassland where the sensitivity to soil moisture varies over different plant heights with specific environmental conditions furthermore the plant transpiration estimated by the sithv1 model is not constrained by the moisture content of the vegetation status to address this issue we added a plant water stress module based on the microwave remotely sensed vod it has been well documented that vod is closely related to the density type and water content of vegetation and is advantageous for monitoring tropical forest without the effect of cloud liu et al 2011 2015 in the sithv2 model the vegetation water stress f v is described as follows 12 f v v od v od max where v od max is the maximum value for the annual vod time series at each pixel in addition to better estimate the et from irrigated cropland we introduced an iwu scheme into the sithv2 model the irrigation signal can be first identified by the discrepancy between the dynamic changes of soil moisture and precipitation in the irrigated area the volume of the iwu can then be derived based on the balanced relationship of the soil water variations zhang et al 2022 the iwu estimates were obtained from the authors prior work and were integrated into the sith model as exceptional input water applied to the cropland specifically the original monthly iwu estimates for global irrigated land were simply dispersed to the start the middle and the end of a month by weighting of the distribution density of the lai this can be expected to enhance the water supply in the irrigated regions during the growing season especially at a long term time scale i e monthly or yearly 2 2 parameter optimization scheme in the sithv2 model the soil layer is extended to a total depth of 5 m to better accommodate the root zone of forest thus we re optimized two critical parameters d50 and d95 which are fundamental for representing at least 50 or 95 of the root system above the depth of d50 or d95 respectively based on the observed et at each eddy covariance ec flux station we used the differential evolution markov chain de mc algorithm ter braak and vrugt 2008 to obtain the posterior distribution of d50 and d95 globally in general the posterior distribution of the candidate parameter sets ϕ in a bayesian framework can be expressed as 13 f ϕ e t obs f ϕ t 1 t 1 2 π σ 2 exp e t sim ϕ t e t obs t 2 2 σ 2 where f ϕ represents the prior parameter distributions f ϕ e t obs represents the posterior parameter distributions t is the time step i e days t is the total number of observations simulations e t obs is the observed et data at the flux station e t sim is the simulated et from the sithv2 model and σ is the standard deviation of the model error in the de mc algorithm the parameter proposals ϕ p are generated based on two randomly selected chains ϕ r1 and ϕ r2 and the difference is multiplied by a scaling factor ρ and added to the current chain ϕ i 14 ϕ p ϕ i ρ ϕ r1 ϕ r2 e where the scaling factor ρ can be set to 2 38 2 d and d is the dimension of parameter sets and e is selected from a symmetrical distribution and represents a probabilistic acceptance rule in the de mc algorithm specifically in this study we performed 12 chains in parallel with a total of 10000 iterations including a burn in time of 500 iterations during the optimization five fold cross validation was utilized in the parameter optimization approach the flux data were divided into five subsamples with one subsample preserved as the data for validating the model while the remaining four subsamples were used as the target function this cross validation procedure was repeated five times and the results were then averaged to obtain an optimal solution for each site this strategy maximizes the data utilization and can mitigate the overfitting and selection bias in the optimization in addition we employed a double optimization scheme to implement parameter optimization at the pft scale this means that the optimal solutions for each site were first optimized using the site observed et as the target to achieve the best root mean square error at the site level s rmse the optimal parameters for the individual pfts could then be determined based on the posterior distribution of the parameters closest to the obtained s rmse for a particular pft zhang et al 2019b this procedure ensured that the optimized parameters were optimally balanced in each pft specific site even though the length of the valid data varied from site to site the estimated posterior distribution of d50 and d95 for the different pfts are given in appendix fig a 1 2 3 model performance evaluation metrics to ensure that the et related variables can reach equilibrium a 50 year spin up was carried out by repeating the forcing from 2001 to 2005 10 times the model was then run at the end of the spin up to generate the global et estimates we also employed several statistical metrics to quantify the model performance in this study among the different metrics a taylor diagram was used to show the differences between the sithv2 and sithv1 models across multiple flux sites and pfts in a taylor diagram the model performance can be characterized as a comprehensive indicator the taylor skill score ts score which is based on the correlation coefficient r and the normalized standard deviation zhang et al 2017 thus each point in a taylor diagram can be scored as 15 s 2 1 r σ s σ o 1 σ s σ o 2 where s is the ts score bounded by zero and unity where unity represents perfect agreement with the observation and σ s and σ o are the standard deviations of the simulation and observation respectively the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were also included in the statistical analysis for the comparison of the various et models products these metrics are calculated as follows 16 rmse 1 t t 1 t o t m t 2 17 nse 1 t 1 t o t m t 2 t 1 t o t o 2 where o t and m t are the observed and simulated data at time t respectively and o is the mean value of the observed data in general the better the model performance the lower the value of the rmse and the closer the nse value is to 1 3 data 3 1 eddy covariance data we used the observed meteorological and flux data from 175 ec stations globally see table s1 in the supplementary information to optimize the candidate parameters and evaluate model performance at the plot scale these data were obtained from the fluxnet2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 and contain 12 kinds of major pfts under different climate zones fig 3 it should be noted that quality control of the flux data is necessary before using these data in the parameter optimization procedure the flux data half hourly were considered missing in this study if the energy balance residual term i e the net radiation minus the sum of the latent heat sensible heat and geothermal heat exceeded 300 w m 2 linear interpolation was performed on the missing data if the data gap was less than 6 h in a day after the pre processing step the quality of the ec data used in this study was strictly corrected which ensured that the energy closure was generally above 70 at all the different pfts finally the flux data for each selected ec station were processed to a daily time series 3 2 inputs of the sithv2 model for global application 3 2 1 remote sensing data the dynamics of land vegetation are important to determine the energy partitioning when estimating terrestrial et to characterize the variation of vegetation growth the lai dataset version 50 from the global land surface satellite glass product liang et al 2021 was used in this study this lai dataset was initially developed from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data with a spatial resolution of 0 05 for the period of 2001 2018 furthermore to depict the vegetation water content in the sithv2 model we used a vod product from the vod climate archive vodca which is based on microwave observations from multiple sensors and can be divided into different spectral bands moesinger et al 2020 the 0 25 daily x band vodca product with a continuous coverage from 2001 to 2018 was used in this study the land surface net radiation data used in this study were derived from the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system ceres project which provides satellite based observations of the earth s radiation budget kato et al 2018 specifically we selected the synoptic top of atmosphere toa and surface fluxes and clouds syn product and calculated the net surface radiation from the level 3 syn1deg dataset with the up down shortwave longwave flux in addition the global dynamic pft distribution was obtained from the modis land cover product mcd12c1 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 globally sulla menashe et al 2019 the main types of pfts in the mcd12c1 product are in accordance with the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp land cover classification system the details of the selected remote sensing data are summarized in table 1 3 2 2 meteorological and ancillary data the meteorological variables in the sithv2 model including the 2 m air temperature t a surface air pressure p a and the total precipitation p tot were obtained from the era5l product muñoz sabater et al 2021 produced by the ecmwf at a spatial resolution of 0 1 the original half hourly era5l product was selected in this study followed by aggregation to a daily scale to match the temporal interval in the sithv2 model the global soil type map used in the sithv2 model was derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 wieder et al 2014 which combines the available soil information from regional and national institutes worldwide and provides a soil raster database with a 30 arc second resolution 3 3 water balance based evapotranspiration data in addition to evaluating the estimates of terrestrial et at selected flux sites we also used independent et estimates to test the sithv2 model at a basin scale the water balanced evapotranspiration estimates et wb were generated from the residual of the water balance equation 18 e t wb p r δ s where p is the annual precipitation mm year 1 r is annual runoff for each basin and δ s is the changes in terrestrial water storage a total of 49 basins from ma et al 2021 were selected which represent a broad range of climate zones and pfts the precipitation data were acquired from the global precipitation climatology center gpcc full data monthly product version 2018 schneider et al 2018 for most basins while the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism precipitation data daly et al 2008 were used for basins in the continental united states because the prism product is considered to be the most accurate precipitation product for the united states lundquist et al 2015 the measured runoff data for these basins were obtained from the global runoff data center the china sediment bulletin and the united states geological survey the δ s was extracted from the gravity recovery and climate experiment data grace rl06m version 2 0 released by the jet propulsion laboratory wiese et al 2016 3 4 comparative mainstream global et products six mainstream terrestrial et products were selected to compare with the et estimates of the sithv2 model at a global scale the terrestrial et products used in this study were mainly derived from 1 the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam which is a widely used process based et model martens et al 2017 2 the calibration free complementary relationship cr model which is driven by meteorological forcing and is used to calculate et from the point view of atmospheric scope ma et al 2021 3 the fluxcom initiative product which is estimated based on flux observations throughout the globe and a data driven machine learning method jung et al 2019 4 the global land data assimilation system gldas which was developed to assimilate multi source observations and simulations of land surface models to generate credible surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 and 5 era5l which is a cutting edge global reanalysis product with a 0 1 spatial resolution and half hourly temporal interval muñoz sabater et al 2021 notably the et products selected in this study were the most representative models or products among the different types of et estimates we also used et simulations from the ensemble mean of the 20 earth system models in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 which is a mission led by the world climate research programme in contrast to the above mentioned global et products these et simulations were derived by an online earth system instead of meteorological forcing the details of these selected products are provided in table 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 et validation at the plot scale using et observations we validated the et estimates of the sithv2 model at the 175 flux stations and compared the results to those of the sithv1 model the taylor diagrams show the validation results for all the individual sites fig 4a and for the different pfts fig 4b moreover the ts score was used for scoring the model performance which is a comprehensive indicator derived from the statistics of model errors zhu et al 2016 despite the comparable correlation coefficient ranges the sithv2 model is closer to 1 in terms of the normalized standard deviation n std than the sithv1 model fig 4a the violin plots in the bottom panel demonstrate that the 25th to 75th percentile range of the ts score for the sithv1 model is 0 71 to 0 89 with a median value of 0 82 whereas the 25th to 75th percentile range of the ts score for the sithv2 model is 0 82 to 0 93 with a median value of 0 88 thus when all 175 global flux stations are used as a benchmark the estimated et of the sithv2 model is more in line with the observations and the ts score of the sithv2 model is approximately 7 3 more than that of the sithv1 model furthermore we also aggregated the et estimates to the pft scale to test the model performance between sithv1 and sithv2 fig 4b demonstrates that the correlation between the estimated et of the sithv2 model and the observed et in the various pfts is stronger than that of the sithv1 model except for ebf and sav with r values ranging from 0 80 to 0 90 in addition the results of the sithv2 model are more concentrated around the arc with n std 1 indicating that the et estimates of the sithv2 model are closer to the average of the observations furthermore at least one representative site from each pft was selected to demonstrate the superiority of the sithv2 model with multi year monthly averages which can make the contrast in the seasonal variations in model performance even more clearer as shown in fig 5 it is evident that the sithv2 model improves the et estimation to various extents for the different pfts with the reduction of rmse values ranging from 16 5 ru skp from 9 52 to 7 95 mm month 1 to 68 9 cn ham from 13 36 to 4 15 mm month 1 this is mostly due to the modified soil water constraint scheme implemented in the sithv2 model which accounts for the influence of vod and the relocation of roots in different soil layers thereby reducing the over estimation of the old version in most cases to further demonstrate the performance of the new version sithv2 we ran the pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 and the mod16 model mu et al 2011 on these selected sites and calculated their performance at the pft level separately different colored backgrounds as a side by side comparison in addition to the internal comparison between sithv2 and sithv1 as shown in fig 6 the performance of the different models shows a high degree of pft specific variation which can be attributed to the different model structures among the different models the rmse of the sithv2 model is generally the smallest across the 12 kinds of pfts compared to the other models with the median values ranging from 0 48 to 0 83 mm day 1 the average median value of the rmse in all the pfts for the sithv2 model is 0 66 mm day 1 while that for the sithv1 model is 0 90 mm day 1 which suggests that the overall accuracy of the sithv2 model is improved by around 27 when compared to the sithv1 model in terms of rmse statistics furthermore the performance of the pt jpl model is close to that of the sithv2 model in most pfts with an average rmse median value of 0 82 mm day 1 meanwhile the mod16 model shows a wide range of variability across the multiple pfts with the median value of the rmse ranging from 0 62 to 1 29 mm day 1 despite it performing better in the dbf and ebf areas consequently based on the ground benchmark of ec observations from a total of 175 flux stations it is confirmed that the sithv2 model can provide more accurate et estimates across the different pfts compared to the sithv1 model and it also performs well when compared with the pt jpl and mod16 models 4 2 et validation at the basin scale using e t wb unlike the use of ground based data to validate the performance of models at the plot scale the grid based terrestrial et estimates are commonly subject to the limitation of the uncertainty for the scale effect which is caused by the spatial mismatch between the simulated et grid and the ground based flux footprint therefore we used the independent water balanced et data to validate the generated et outputs at the basin scale as described in section 3 4 the magnitude of the et in the major global basins was derived from the water balance equation based on ground or remotely sensed observations of runoff precipitation and changes in terrestrial water storage fig 7a illustrates the scatter plot linear regression between the et estimates of the sithv2 model red and sithv1 model blue for these basins against the water balanced et e t wb over the period from 2003 to 2013 it can be found that the et estimated by the sithv2 model is generally more consistent with the e t wb than that estimated by the sithv1 model with a higher correlation r 0 96 and smaller deviation rmse 98 58 mm year 1 furthermore the sithv2 model shows an improvement of nearly 0 1 compared to the sithv1 model in terms of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the ratio of the simulated et sithv2 to e t wb was also calculated to highlight the spatial distribution of the over or under estimation of the et estimates with e t wb as the benchmark in the majority of basins the difference between the estimated et obtained by the sithv2 model and e t wb is fairly minimal with ratios ranging from 0 8 to 1 2 meanwhile it can be found that the et estimated by the sithv2 model exhibits a certain degree of over estimation of up to double the corresponding e t wb in basins at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere e g siberia and northern canada indeed the freeze thaw processes at high latitudes have a direct effect on soil water content which in turn influences the et process niu and yang 2006 however the current process based et model lacks a meaningful connection of the freeze thaw process and the vast amount of measurable data for calibration such as subsurface ice which makes accurate estimation of et in these specific regions a challenging task moreover we also selected six mainstream global terrestrial et products for a side by side comparison with the sithv2 model at the basin scale fig 8 the correlation relationship r between all the et products and e t wb is very high with a range of 0 93 to 0 97 which indicates the good consistency in the spatial variability of these et products across the selected basins however the accuracies of these et products are relatively diverse with the gldas product having the largest rmse 164 mm year 1 and the smallest nse 0 71 in contrast the cr product performs the best with the smallest rmse 81 83 mm year 1 and the largest nse 0 93 among these products which are similar results to those of the sithv2 model obtained in this study meanwhile the fluxcom et product was produced using substantial ground based flux data with machine learning technology and shows high correlation r 0 97 with the derived e t wb across the different basins however this product shows some over estimation for e t wb in the basins with an arid or cold climate which are often characterized by low et values the performance of the gleam product is similar to that of the sithv1 model with an rmse value of 128 21 mm year 1 and an nse value of 0 82 however the results of the gleam product are significantly higher than the results of the other models in basins with a humid climate e g the amazon region where the maximum value exceeds 1500 mm year 1 in terms of statistical indicators the cmip6 product s rmse 90 56 mm year 1 r 0 97 and nse 0 91 values are in the upper middle level in the overall range but the lowest slope 0 86 and the largest intercept 110 07 mm year 1 are found among these model statistics this indicates that the et estimates of the cmip6 product are significantly under estimated at high values and over estimated at low values in these basins the results of the era5l product also yield a relatively high nse value 0 87 and an rmse value of 110 14 mm year 1 which are similar to the results of the fluxcom product nevertheless despite the era5l product achieving a slope value of 1 its intercept is rather large 72 57 mm year 1 implying an overall over estimation in these 49 basins relative to e t wb it is necessary to emphasize that the different spatial resolutions and production methods of these global et products lead to differences in capturing the spatial details of terrestrial et although their statistical metrics are similar at the basin scale in general the terrestrial et estimated by the sithv2 model is in good agreement with the e t wb at the basin scale and the performance is also at a superior level when compared to the primary global et products available at present 4 3 global comparison of et magnitude and trend analysis the global distribution of the multi year 2001 2018 mean et estimated by the sithv2 model is displayed in fig 9a the estimated terrestrial et exhibits a clear and reasonable geographical distribution with the maximum et appearing in the tropics around the equator 1200 1500 mm year 1 followed by the temperate humid regions 600 1200 mm year 1 and then the alpine and high latitude areas 300 600 mm year 1 and the lowest et is found in the desert and ice regions 100 mm year 1 the latitudinal profile of the estimated et derived by the sithv2 model is in close agreement with the highest confidence curve fig 9b which indicates that the sithv2 model is effective in capturing the variance in global terrestrial et at different latitudes however the et profile estimated by the sithv2 model is positioned lower than that of the other et models in regions south of 40 s this may be related to the increased uncertainty of the era5 based precipitation in south america xiong et al 2022 especially since the assimilation system hardly corrects the systematic bias in the solid precipitation i e snowfall due to the insufficient observations muñoz sabater et al 2021 at the global scale the magnitude of the total terrestrial et estimated by the various global et products is a crucial comparative indicator to compare the estimated terrestrial et volumes we used the overlapping period from 2001 to 2013 which covers the time span for both the sith based et estimates and the other et products as shown in fig 10a the sithv2 model estimates a total annual mean terrestrial et of 70 3 0 6 1 0 3 km 3 which is very close to the gleam estimate 70 4 0 8 1 0 3 km 3 and represents a 6 4 increase over the sithv1 model 66 1 0 6 1 0 3 km 3 the results of these three datasets together with cmip6 are lower than the average value 71 5 1 0 3 km 3 of all the selected global et products whereas the estimated et of the remaining four products is higher than the average value with the cr 73 0 0 7 1 0 3 km 3 and gldas 72 1 3 7 1 0 3 km 3 products being closest to the average and the fluxcom product occupying the highest position 77 6 0 3 1 0 3 km 3 in comparison the reported volume of the terrestrial et derived from the different models products in previous studies has primarily ranged from 65 1 0 3 km 3 to 75 1 0 3 km 3 with individual values of 65 5 1 0 3 km 3 oki and kanae 2006 65 1 0 3 km 3 jung et al 2010 67 9 1 0 3 km 3 miralles et al 2011 74 3 1 0 3 km 3 zhang et al 2015 72 8 1 0 3 km 3 zhang et al 2019a and 71 1 1 0 3 km 3 zeng et al 2014 more recent studies have tended to yield et volumes in excess of 70 1 0 3 km 3 furthermore the energy balancing strategy seems to be more likely to estimate greater et volumes with the magnitude of the global terrestrial et estimate being up to around 75 1 0 3 km 3 jung et al 2019 l ecuyer et al 2015 wild et al 2015 in addition it is worth noting that the time span of the above mentioned et statistics varies across the different studies we divided the global terrestrial et estimates into five main types based on the köppen climate classification system see fig s1 in the supplementary information namely tropical zone dryland zone temperate zone continental zone and polar and alpine zone to compare the differences of the multiple global et products under the different climatic conditions over the globe the et volumes estimated by the different products are more or less equivalent to the average value 32 6 1 4 1 0 3 km 3 in the tropical zone fig 10b except for the cmip6 product which displays obvious under estimation 29 6 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 however the performance of the different et products in the arid zone varies considerably fig 10c among which the et estimate from the fluxcom product 12 9 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 is the highest compared to the others the era5l and cr products obtain comparable et volumes in the dryland zone around 10 0 6 1 0 3 km 3 to 10 5 0 4 1 0 3 km 3 while the result of the sithv2 model is similar to that of the gleam product with 8 8 0 5 1 0 3 km 3 unlike the tropical zone it is interesting to note that the et estimate of the cmip6 product is the second highest for the dryland zone at 12 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 for the temperate zone fig 10d the era5l product shows the highest et estimate 16 3 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 whereas the lowest et volume is estimated by the sithv1 model 13 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 the et estimates from the fluxcom and gldas products in the temperate zone are much higher than the overall average with values of 16 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 and 15 7 0 7 1 0 3 km 3 respectively however the et estimates from the gleam cr and cmip6 products and the sithv2 model are substantially lower ranging from 14 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 to 15 0 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 in the context of continental climatic conditions with considerable daily and annual air temperature variations the sithv1 model tends to under estimate the volume of et 10 6 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 compared to the other terrestrial et products fig 10e in the sithv2 model the estimated total et for the continental climate zone is 11 8 0 3 1 0 3 km 3 which is comparable to the 11 5 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 for the cr product and the 11 7 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 for the cmip6 product the four remaining products generally estimate higher et values exceeding the average 12 2 0 9 1 0 3 km 3 in the continental climate zone ranging from 12 7 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 gleam to 13 2 0 2 1 0 3 km 3 era5l lastly the total et volume in the polar and alpine zone fig 10f is much lower than in the other zones due to the reduced solar radiation lower temperature and lack of vegetation cover nonetheless the various et products exhibit a degree of variability with the cmip6 product yielding the highest et volume of 2 3 0 01 1 0 3 km 3 and the smallest volume of et is estimated by the sithv1 model 1 47 0 01 1 0 3 km 3 the et volume estimated by the sithv2 model 1 93 0 02 1 0 3 km 3 for the polar and alpine zone is very close to that of the era5l product 1 92 0 03 1 0 3 km 3 comparatively the gleam 1 64 0 03 1 0 3 km 3 fluxcom 1 68 0 003 1 0 3 km 3 and gldas 1 67 0 1 1 0 3 km 3 products yield similar et volumes that are slightly less than the overall average 1 78 0 4 1 0 3 km 3 for this zone the trend of annual global terrestrial et estimated by the sithv2 model from 2011 to 2018 is 0 41 mm year 1 p 0 05 while the trend for the sithv1 model is 0 38 mm year 1 p 0 05 fig 11 it should be emphasized that the valid periods for the comparable et products differ and their overlapping period in this study spans from 2001 to 2013 as a result the confidence interval shrinks after 2013 because of the decreased contribution from the various global et products both versions of the sith model demonstrate a strong correlation with the ensemble mean of the multiple et products which excludes the sith based et estimates indicating that the anomaly trend of the sith based et is realistic and can be used to achieve credible trend analysis for historical periods moreover the sithv2 model is more consistent with the ensemble mean value of the multiple et products in the details compared to the sithv1 model in summary the global terrestrial et produced by the sithv2 model outperforms that of the sithv1 model and the sithv2 model can provide reliable et estimates in terms of global spatial distribution latitudinal profile and multi year et volumes for both a global scale and the various climate zones as well as the anomaly trend of terrestrial et nonetheless the sithv2 model still has some limitations and deficiencies that will require further enhancement in the next stage although the current spatial resolution reaches 0 1 which is globally in line with the era5l product a finer spatial resolution is important for local scale applications to this end downscaling schemes such as sub grid optimization could be an efficient way to generate finer et estimates by combining the advantages of multi source reanalysis and satellite forcing data with different spatial resolutions also for the current version the iwu is regarded as additional rainfall only loosely coupled to the sithv2 model which can ensure water availability to irrigated regions at the monthly yearly scale limited by the monthly iwu estimates but makes it difficult to characterize the irrigation recharge at a fine temporal scale together with the challenge of representing specific irrigation modes i e sprinkler drip or flood irrigation these factors will increase the uncertainty in the simulation of soil water dynamics hence to assimilate satellite based soil moisture into the simulation would be a more direct way of characterizing realistic surface water conditions and further improving cropland et estimation in addition the current model is only applied to the simulation in the vertical direction without the interaction from the neighboring grids by introducing topographic factors e g elevation slope and aspect to describe the lateral water flow between adjacent grid cells this would enhance the simulation of the sithv2 model to three dimensions and could thus greatly expand the application potential at the basin level 5 conclusions this study was dedicated to improving the et simulation in the sith model within the gspac we enhanced the vegetation moisture constraint module by coupling satellite based vod measurements moreover a dynamic adjustment scheme for the critical threshold of soil water content based on different canopy heights and specific environmental conditions was applied in the sithv2 model the extended soil layer with re optimized root distribution parameters was used to better characterize the effect of soil water dynamics on the et simulation we also added an irrigation water strategy as extra input water applied in the croplands zone in addition the meteorological forcing data in the sithv2 model were updated to the state of the art era5l reanalysis product validations against 175 ec stations and water balance data from 49 large river basins suggested that the sithv2 model is more accurate and has less uncertainty than the sithv1 model at both plot and basin scales further multi product evaluations using the water balance approach also demonstrated that the sithv2 model ranks well when compared to most of the mainstream et products lastly a side by side comparison at the global scale indicated that the sithv2 model is consistent with the ensemble mean results of the multiple terrestrial et products both in terms of magnitude and trends this newly improved sith model will provide the necessary framework for estimating et from the gspac and will promote better support for exploring land atmosphere feedback loops ecosystem water consumption and related ecohydrological studies

secondary forest dominated by oak quercus liaotungensis and a plantation of exotic black locust robinia pseudoacacia based on the combination of precipitation soil water storage and evapotranspiration dynamics four distinct periods were differentiated to explore the evapotranspiration response to the main meteorological factors the correlation matrixes showed that in most investigated days evapotranspiration was limited by soil water storage while an increase in soil water storage shifted dominance from water related to energy related factors the stepwise regression of 5 day dry events in each period had a better fitness when paired with the relationship between the summations of evapotranspiration and dominant factors r2 0 7 p 0 01 for all than the stepwise results for daily averages a receiver operating characteristic roc curve was applied to validate the division and determine thresholds all divisions were thoroughly validated and the soil water storage thresholds of the black locust 120 2 mm and 150 7 mm were higher than those of the oak 105 8 mm and 137 9 mm our results suggest that the oak had an adaptive water consumption strategy while the black locust had a higher sensitivity to soil water insufficiency the method for determining the threshold of soil water storage to separate the dominant factors of evapotranspiration was validated the approach may be applied to other semiarid forest communities with distinct evapotranspiration response patterns keywords evapotranspiration patterns semiarid forests soil water storage threshold receiver operating

semiarid regions such as the chinese loess plateau chen et al 2008 green et al 2019 schwärzel et al 2019 evapotranspiration is a major component of soil water loss and conducts as a crucial process of regional water cycling feng et al 2012 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 for a specific forest over a short period variations in evapotranspiration are affected by both soil water conditions and meteorological factors including radiation temperature and humidity hadiwijaya et al 2020 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019b different forest communities even in the same locality have various evapotranspiration patterns which result in distinct soil water consumption dynamics during continuous dry days chen et al 2007 shinohara and otsuki 2015 zhou et al 2019 quantifying the effects of each factor on evapotranspiration in various patterns can enhance the accuracy of estimating soil water consumption combining the quantified results from different forest communities with recent local climate records is also beneficial for evaluating current restoration achievements several climatic factors have been identified as drivers of evapotranspiration such as radiation wind speed temperature and humidity parajuli et al 2019 penman 1948 valiantzas 2006 although equations such as the penman monteith model include each environmental factor mentioned above they can only provide a limited prediction rather than a real reflection of vegetation water consumption moreover the effects of these factors on evapotranspiration are interrelated and their dynamic combination alternates in dominance a study conducted in northern wisconsin showed that the daily evapotranspiration of upland forests was primarily driven by solar radiation in spring and by vapor pressure deficit vpd in summer due to seasonal phenological changes mackay et al 2007 for the same phenological period in different years the daily evapotranspiration response patterns to primary environmental factors varied particularly after extreme precipitation liu et al 2020 as the effects of radiation and the energy portioning on evapotranspiration were stable across years at a study site with certain latitude and longitude regional evapotranspiration variations could be partially explained by vegetation and microclimate changes yan et al 2020 evidence from morphology and physiology might explain these shifts lyu et al 2022 novick et al 2016b but few studies have explored what triggers these alterations estimation methods adaptive to common environments always require several parameters with complex forms wang et al 2019b whereas simple functions with fewer items have limited applicability li et al 2016 in the loess plateau significant heterogeneity exists both in temporal climatic variation and spatial vegetation distribution an adaptable and concise evapotranspiration estimation approach based merely on soil water content and basic meteorological factors would be beneficial for comparing water consumption behaviors between different forest communities black locust robinia pseudoacacia is one of the most widespread afforestation species on the loess plateau because of its rapid growth nitrogen fixation and drought tolerance attributes xu and liu 2004 however soil water declines as these artificial communities grow and affects the sustainability of the ecosystems chen et al 2008 liaodong oak quercus liaotungensis is a dominant species in natural secondary forests in the central loess plateau yamanaka et al 2014 current research suggests that this species has a normal magnitude and sustainable water consumption cheng et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 yan et al 2016 the liaodong oak can be a reference standard for comparison with black locust for the consumption of soil water resources studies have been conducted focusing on water consuming features to determine the amount and variations in black locust transpiration jiao et al 2018 kume et al 2012 lyu et al 2020 wang et al 2010 precipitation is a commonly recognized factor affecting transpiration variations in black locust from diurnal to interannual temporal scales du et al 2011 he et al 2020 precipitation acts on vegetation indirectly by recharging the soil water thereby affecting the plant s water use méndez barroso et al 2009 theoretically transpiration should respond simultaneously to both precipitation and soil water favoring the latter however a positive relationship between soil water content and sap flow density cannot always be found at both diurnal and monthly scales even in water limited regions with black locust trees zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 precipitation events of similar amount but varying time distributions have been found to result in differences in plant physiological behavior but the mechanism of how soil water changes caused by precipitation influence plant transpiration remains unclear gu et al 2016 stand evapotranspiration directly based on soil water data may be a strong supplement and offer circumstantial evidence of ecological and physiological processes in specific species or areas denager et al 2020 therefore there is a great need to quantify the effects of soil water on evapotranspiration at different time scales and to characterize the community water consuming patterns in relation to soil water dynamics in this study a black locust community and a nearby liaodong oak community were chosen to conduct continuous soil water monitoring and to record climatic factors during 2012 2015 our aims were 1 to graph the soil water and evapotranspiration dynamics in both communities 2 to determine and estimate the influence of the dominant factors on evapotranspiration through seasonal shifts and phenological alternation and 3 to develop a method for evaluating possible threshold of soil water storage representing dominant factor shift we hypothesized that soil water storage usually serves as the main limitation of evapotranspiration for forest communities in the semiarid region and there should be different response patterns to evapotranspiration driving factors with a certain change in soil water storage the results would contribute to specifying community water use strategies by using soil water data and benefit future afforestation practice in the semiarid region 2 materials and method 2 1 study site

classification the calcic cambisol group is the predominant soil type the loess depth usually reaches 50 200 m depending on the topography the gravimetric field capacity and wilting percentage of the soil water content were 20 24 and 3 6 respectively yang and shao 2000 the black locust plantation and the natural secondary forest dominated by liaodong oak are adjacent and a permanent research plot 20 m 20 m was established in each forest stand the black locust plantation was planted approximately 40 years ago and has shown signs of degradation dieback in tall trees in recent years the oak forest is approximately 60 years old with some accompanying species of trees and shrubs such as ameniaca sibirica ulmus macrocarpa cotoneaster multiflorus acer stenolobum platycladus orientalis the plot leaf area index for the black locust plantation and the oak forest during whole leaf stage were around 2 8 m2m 2 and 3 1 m2m 2 respectively du et al 2011 additional basic information on the two plots has been presented in previous studies shi et al 2011 tian et al 2017 2 2 measurements of soil water and meteorological factors in each plot soil water content was monitored using s smc m005 sensors connected to a hobo data logger h21 001 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa and means recorded every half hour six sensors were installed along a profile at an adequate location for each plot at depths of 6 12 30 50 70 and 90 cm in each profile to represent the six horizons along the 1 m profile and their data were marked as swc0 06 swc0 12 swc0 3 swc0 5 swc0 7 and swc0 9 respectively in addition to this profile under automatic monitoring three other profiles were periodically measured using a time domain reflectometry moisture measurement system trime imko micromodultechnik ettlingen germany and the data obtained from two measuring systems had been verified each other lyu et al 2022 the data of the former system were used in this study and weighted mean was calculated for the soil water content over the entire 1 m profile swc0 1 m3 m 3 according to the relative thickness represented by the sensors wilson et al 2001 as follows 1 sw c 0 1 0 08 s w c 0 06 0 07 s w c 0

conversion factor for a 1 m depth daily evapotranspiration on rainless days was calculated using the method of soil water budget as the difference between the sws values at 0 00 on the current day and the next day wilson et al 2001 this method could be simply used to analyze the relationship between evapotranspiration and environmental factors during rainless days though the accuracy of longterm estimates would be affected by possible infiltration and consumption below the monitored depth schelde et al 2011 basic meteorological factors including precipitation solar radiation rs air temperature and relative humidity were measured in an open area near the two plots precipitation was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge davis 7852 davis instruments hayward ca usa connected to

helsinki finland these data were sampled every 30 s and recorded at 30 min intervals using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa additionally two integrated variables vpd and reference evapotranspiration et0 were extracted to evaluate their multifactorial influence on evapotranspiration the vpd was calculated from the air temperature t and relative humidity rh as follows 3 vpd 0 611

of temperature relative air humidity wind speed and radiation related parameters it is primarily used as a standard to describe the comprehensive environmental driving force because it contains nearly all physical factors that influence evapotranspiration allen et al 2005 2 3 data analysis the least significant difference lsd method was applied to test the difference in significance between the data groups to investigate the response features of evapotranspiration to multiple factors the pearson correlation matrix method was used with no multiple comparison adjustment because only the columns involving evapotranspiration were selected and regrouped to explore the response patterns of evapotranspiration under different conditions stepwise regression was utilized to ensure that every item in the regression equations was significant the detailed steps were adding or removing each factor until the akaike information criterion aic reached its minimum value this allowed us to build the final equation keeping the most information with the least variables yamashita et al 2007 the switching points of soil water separating the evapotranspiration patterns of both communities were detected using the receiver operating characteristics roc curve method which is a widely used method to validate the binomial distribution model and measure its threshold pontius and parmentier 2014 data manipulation and figure drawings were conducted using r version 3 5 3 involving the agricolae corrplot customlayout ggplot2 mgcv plyr psych and quantreg packages 3 results 3 1 overall changes of environmental factors and evapotranspiration throughout the four investigated growing seasons the daily data for evapotranspiration in the two investigated communities and basic climatic factors on evapotranspiration along the four growing seasons are presented in fig 1 precipitation varied dramatically at both seasonal and interannual scales the precipitation amounts during the growing season april 1 to october 31 were 449 793 627 and 325 mm for 2012 2015 respectively et0 tended to increase with higher variance in the early growing season before july while it tended to decrease with lower variance after july soil water storage was replenished quickly by effective rainfall events and was consumed relatively slowly by evapotranspiration with different combinations of replenishment and consumption the soil water storage dynamics presented different patterns among the different rainfall years specifically years 2012 and 2013 started their growing seasons with dry condition and the soil water storage changed slightly at low levels whereas 2014 and 2015 started their growing seasons with moist condition and the soil water storage continued to decrease until the rainy season coming thereafter the soil water storage increased with intense rainfall in rainy season particularly in the wet years of 2013 and 2014 and then decreased under dry days in the later season in this study the evapotranspiration of both forest communities was primarily driven by climatic factors and limited by soil water conditions when soil water storage was low before the rainy season 2012 4 1 2012 7 21 and 2013 4 1 2013 7 3 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak was always low regardless of reference evapotranspiration when soil water storage was low even after the rainy season 2012 7 22 2012 10 31 and 2015 6 22 2015 10 31 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak fluctuated with soil water storage when soil water storage was at a fair level before the rainy season 2014 4 1 2014 7 8 and 2015 4 1 2015 6 21 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak showed a similar tendency to the et0 dynamics when soil water storage was at a moist level after the rainy season 2013 7 4 2013 10 31 and 2014 7 9 2014 10 31 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak was historically maintained consistency with the et0 based on the seasonal dynamics of et0 and the interannual variability of soil water storage we divided all 856 rainless days of the four year growing seasons into four distinct periods the dry period before the rainy season db the dry period after the rainy season da the humid period before the rainy season hb and the humid period after the rainy season ha table 1 the four cut offs were set at a point before a major rainfall event that represented the onset of rainy season when et0 and soil water storage showed pronounced changes 3 2 response of daily evapotranspiration to climatic and hydrologic factors during the different periods there was no significant difference in the et0 between the da and hb periods however the et0 of these two periods was significantly p 0 001 lower than that of the db and significantly p 0 001 higher than that of the ha soil water storage varied significantly p 0 0001 among the four periods in both forest communities fig 2 daily evapotranspiration of both communities showed similar ranges to soil water storage except differences in evapotranspiration were not statistically significant between the db and da periods considering these results we deduced that lower soil water storage does not always lead to lower daily evapotranspiration values maintaining normal physiological activities in both communities may require a minimum evapotranspiration amount bréda et al 2006 on the interannual scale there was no consistency in daily evapotranspiration and et0 zhang et al 2015 correlation analyses of daily evapotranspiration in each period suggested variations in the major influencing factors among periods fig 3 significant responses of daily evapotranspiration for both forests to climatic factors including rs radiation vpd temperature and humidity and et0 synthetic climatic factor were only detected in the ha period the correlation coefficients between evapotranspiration of both communities and hydrologic factors such as soil water storage and cumulative precipitation cp generally declined with soil water increasing in the ha period the correlation between daily evapotranspiration and cp became negative in both communities indicating that daily evapotranspiration activities weakened as precipitation accumulated however dependence of daily evapotranspiration on soil water conditions still existed a possible reason for this conflict is that the effects of precipitation consist not only of soil water amelioration but also of indirect factors under wet weather with evapotranspiration drivers declining gradually in the ha period with increasing day of year thus weakened evapotranspiration showed an inverse response to the monotonically increasing cp at the end of the season with relatively adequate water although a specific response to climatic factors occurred in et0 during both dry periods db and da strong correlations were linked with either cp or soil water storage after stepwise regression all equations contained soil water storage implying the limitation of soil water storage in all periods for daily evapotranspiration in both communities table 2 in other words active evapotranspiration only appeared under abundant soil water conditions and soil water storage was always influential at the diurnal scale in all cases all equations except the da period had a cp variable suggesting independent effects of precipitation from soil water storage only equations for the ha period included a climatic factor rs for black locust and et0 for oak in addition these equations had the highest r2 value which represented that the daily evapotranspiration had the best fit in adequate soil water conditions and only then the effects of climatic factors on evapotranspiration would not be removed after stepwise regression 3 3 response of sum and daily mean evapotranspiration to climatic and hydrologic factors in dry events of the different periods trees would change their water use strategies when they are subjected to water stress du et al 2011 accordingly the response patterns of evapotranspiration to climatic factors may also change with decreasing soil water content under continuous dry days to test whether a consistent response could be observed during dry events correlation matrixes and stepwise regression were conducted on the summations of evapotranspiration and environmental factors fig 4 table 3 regression equations for the ha period had the same form as the single variable of et0 summation for both communities in addition the equation in the db period also consists of the et0 summation and rs with a small coefficient significant positive correlations were found between the sums of rs and evapotranspiration in both communities during the db da and ha periods the amount of evapotranspiration responded to the amount of et0 for both communities in the db and ha periods however in the da period a similar response was only found for oak a positive correlation between hydrologic factors soil water storage and cp and evapotranspiration amount was found in the da period for both communities in addition the evapotranspiration amount was well correlated with sws in the db period for black locust and in the ha period for oak significant positive correlations between evapotranspiration amount and dry event length were found in both dry periods db and da for black locust but only in the da period for oak the evapotranspiration amount in the ha period showed a strong correlation with climatic driving factors rs vpd and et0 stepwise regression resulted in a numerical constant for black locust in the hb period because there was no significant relationship between etr summation and any other factors in this period correlation analyses of the daily means of evapotranspiration and environmental factors during each dry event are shown in fig 5 significant relationships between the daily mean evapotranspiration met and climatic factors daily mean rs and et0 were observed during the ha period for both communities hydrological factors were significantly correlated with the daily met of black locust during two dry periods db and da relationships between the daily met and soil water storage in oak were observed in the da period whereas correlation with cumulative precipitation was only observed in the db period stepwise regression equations for daily met and environmental factors for dry events of each period were all statistically significant with all p values being 0 01 table 4 every equation for oak contained a single dominant factor for the black locust community the regression equations for the da and ha periods had a single factor that was the same as that in oak the equation for the db period contained two factors whereas only a numerical constant remained for the hb period similar to the results of the summation analysis table 3 factoring in daily mean et0 could provide a good linear description for both communities in the ha period this indicates that evapotranspiration strength relied heavily and singularly on synthetic climatic factors under adequate soil water conditions 3 4 validation and thresholds of four periods division in this study the dry and humid soil water conditions were defined as negative and positive to draw roc curves respectively the specificity value of a given soil water storage represents the ratio of detected dry conditions to total dry conditions detected dry condition plus false humid condition if the soil water storage is defined as the threshold of dry and humid conditions the closer the specificity value was to 1 the rate of correctly detected dry conditions was higher the same configuration was used between the sensitivity value and the humid condition roc curves on daily sws before and after the rainy season were created separately for each forest community fig 6 all the specificity values were greater than 0 6 suggesting a high accuracy of determination four optimal cut off points for swsr and swsq before rainy season and those after rainy season were 120 2 105 8 150 7 and 137 9 mm respectively the threshold of sws after rainy season should be higher than before rainy season and that for black locust was higher than oak within the same period the integral of this curve is the conventional index for evaluating a binomial classification method the auc area under the curve values of the four validations were 0 840 0 943 0 956 and 0 981 respectively in the same order as mentioned above all auc values in this study were substantially high indicating clear distinction between the two states separated by the threshold from the community aspect roc curves of the oak had larger auc values than those of the black locust in both periods from the period perspective roc curves for both communities after the rainy season had larger auc values than those before the rainy season 4 discussion 4 1 influence of precipitation on soil water and evapotranspiration precipitation has been recognized as a major factor affecting soil water and evapotranspiration especially in arid and semiarid regions mintz and walker 1993 prăvălie et al 2019 owing to the extremely deep groundwater level in the loess plateau rainfall events are closely connected with soil water as the sole source of replenishment zhang et al 2016 in our study soil water storage increased after significant rainfall events and continuously decreased daily until the next rainfall event fig 1 which is consistent with previous research mei et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 the recharge process converts precipitation to available water resources for plants and further changes the process of forest community water consumption mahmood 1996 the correlation matrixes and stepwise regression results showed that precipitation and soil water often had synergistic effects on evapotranspiration figs 3 5 tables 2 4 as for the regression results on daily data throughout each period there were three periods when the dominant factors included both cumulative precipitation and soil water storage for both communities table 2 nevertheless the regression results on daily means during dry events for the oak community yielded a single variable of cumulative precipitation rather than soil water storage in the db period table 4 this phenomenon implied that the effect of soil water storage balanced itself out during continuous dry days whereas the effect of cumulative precipitation on evapotranspiration still existed this is also supported by the suggestion that the oak regulated its transpiration rate according to the total precipitation input rather than the instantaneous soil water availability in the dry season whereas black locust had a stronger response to temporary soil water input from rainfall events du et al 2011 this difference between oak and black locust might be attributed to their water use strategies the black locust community tends to take risky water use strategy under soil water deficiency and take both soil water and precipitation as much as possible the oak community would shut down stomata earlier in morning to cut water consumption in a conservative way lyu et al 2020 in this study the initial soil water storage in the growing season had a strong dependency on the previous year s precipitation fig 1 in the hb period with high soil water storage the evapotranspiration pattern was turbulent with low dependency on all factors especially for the black locust community figs 4 and 5 when an hb period was followed by a da period such as in 2015 the difference between the initial and end values of soil water storage would take a significant proportion of the amount of annual evapotranspiration which was charged from precipitation in the previous year these unsynchronized dynamics could explain why precipitation was not always synchronized with total stand transpiration on an annual scale zhang et al 2015 higher soil water content in early spring would lead to an earlier physiological activity onset of semiarid forest communities and thus increase the annual evapotranspiration amount liu et al 2020 considering patterns of precipitation soil water storage and evapotranspiration it may be more insightful to adopt the time division of the water year instead of the calendar year that has been applied in the western united states redmond and koch 1991 ziaco et al 2020 clearer correlations might be found on an annual scale for precipitation soil water storage and evapotranspiration during wetter years as the soil water storage for evapotranspiration consumption in early growing season is always replenished by precipitation of the previous year in this region 4 2 shift of dominant factors on evapotranspiration and difference between forest communities the dominant meteorological factors on evapotranspiration could be altered by precipitation exclusion or extreme precipitation which might result from changes in soil water conditions liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in addition dominant factors based on a linear relationship with evapotranspiration are always perceived as limiting factors ferguson et al 2016 analysis by dividing climatic factors into water related and energy related factors suggested that the abundance of water related factors would make the linear correlation between energy factors and evapotranspiration more apparent and vice versa mackay et al 2007 wang et al 2019a in the present study linear correlations between evapotranspiration and soil water storage reached statistical significance in all periods for both communities on a daily scale which implied that both communities had insufficient soil water resources under nearly all conditions fig 3 table 2 conversely through analysis of 5 day dry events the total evapotranspiration for both communities were noticeably dominated by the etr in the hb period but only for oak community in the db period table 3 this suggests that an adaptive water consumption strategy was applied by the oak community to resist water limitation on continuous days with decreasing soil water storage whereas in the black locust community only a relatively high soil water storage level caused by extreme precipitation could relieve water limitation enough to shift the dominance from water to energy factors further if water or energy limitations are imposed significant non linear correlations usually presented as exponential saturation functions between water consumption and other factors can be determined jiao et al 2019 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2008 a well fitted exponential saturation function can often be transformed into two linear functions on either side of a threshold wang et al 2019b the linear function before the threshold has a steeper slope whereas the linear function after the threshold has a gentler slope or is parallel to the x axis from our perspective because of the characteristics of the exponential saturation function these fitted results can also be seen as shifts of dominant factors around a certain threshold before the threshold a strong linear correlation indicated the dominant effects of this factor however after the threshold the dominant factor shifted to others connecting local conditions with this discussion soil water should be both the main limitation and the dominant factor on evapotranspiration in most cases when soil water storage exceeds a particular threshold the hydrological limitation is lifted and other factors begin to dominate the sum as well as the strength of evapotranspiration during continuous dry days moreover the discovery of similar shifts in surface conductance an index to evaluate resistance to canopy transpiration supports our inference the dependence of surface conductance and evapotranspiration on soil water content increased with increasing dryness index while the dependence on vpd decreased at the same time based on observations at 38 ameriflux sites novick et al 2016a the results demonstrated the distinct response patterns to evapotranspiration driving factors with soil water storage difference and supported our original hypothesis furthermore a study on the grassland in hebei province of china also found that soil water movement between layers was the driving force to shift response patterns of soil water to potential evapotranspiration wang et al 2021b a similar mechanism should exist in this study because the forest communities in loess plateau may have a deep zone for soil water movement li et al 2022 4 3 soil water storage thresholds determining evapotranspiration patterns as distinct response patterns to evapotranspiration driving factors were detected among periods with soil water storage difference a threshold should be expected even within a period in growing season which is also related to the ecophysiological behavior of the community roc curves turned out to be applicable to such a need generally a diagnostic method is considered acceptable when it obtains an auc value above 0 7 in roc curves and it is considered excellent if the auc value reaches 0 9 swets 1988 in this study all auc values were greater than 0 8 and three of them were greater than 0 9 which means that these four thresholds are acceptable fig 6 when divided by soil water storage evapotranspiration characteristics in the four periods were quite distinct for both communities combining the analysis of the dominant factor shifts the soil water condition can be defined as wet when the soil water storage exceeds these thresholds both before and after the rainy season the black locust community showed higher thresholds than the oak community suggesting that the black locust community had greater demand for soil water resources thereby switching its dominant factors from water related to energy related many indices have been used to evaluate the degree of dryness over a region such as the drought index di standard precipitation index spi standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei palmer drought severity index pdsi and their variations alley 1984 bhuyan erhardt et al 2019 guo et al 2012 li et al 2017 liang et al 2018 tan et al 2015 however rigid background information of either vegetation or soil properties is needed to make these indices representative the values of these quantitative indicators could not provide an insightful judgement if the community in this region is suffering water deficiency but according to our study a clear boundary between dry and wet can be established based on roc curves for a specific community and forest community have distinct response patterns on both sides of the threshold with manifestations of dominant factor shifts our method can determine the threshold of soil water conditions with only continuous soil water and basic climatic data both can be easily obtained from remote sensing techniques or low cost site monitoring kazemzadeh et al 2021 li et al 2020 with these data if certain time periods that evapotranspiration is respectively dominated by water related factors and energy related factors can be found at the same time of year a roc curve can be established to determine and validate the soil water storage threshold between two kinds of periods and after passing validation for a given soil water storage at a time of year it will be easy to judge whether the soil water condition of this specific community is wet or dry as well as to infer the evapotranspiration dominant factors the results also provide a realistic mechanism for modifications of evapotranspiration estimation models zhang et al 2021 nevertheless given that our study covered datasets of two forest communities for four years further studies are still needed for verification over other regions species and timescales 5 conclusion this study identified that in addition to driving factors both precipitation and soil water storage affected evapotranspiration in the two investigated communities the hydrological factors were dominant in evapotranspiration when the soil water resources were insufficient the dominance shifted to energy related factors when the soil water was well supplemented as expressed by cumulative precipitation the oak community showed adaptive evapotranspiration patterns during dry periods while the black locust community had a higher sensitivity to the soil water decrease even during humid periods both communities showed distinct response pattern divisions to the dominant factors before and after the rainy season the soil water storage thresholds of the oak community were lower than those of the black locust community the method for determining the threshold based on soil water storage was proven valid and practicable declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential

semiarid regions such as the chinese loess plateau chen et al 2008 green et al 2019 schwärzel et al 2019 evapotranspiration is a major component of soil water loss and conducts as a crucial process of regional water cycling feng et al 2012 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 for a specific forest over a short period variations in evapotranspiration are affected by both soil water conditions and meteorological factors including radiation temperature and humidity hadiwijaya et al 2020 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019b different forest communities even in the same locality have various evapotranspiration patterns which result in distinct soil water consumption dynamics during continuous dry days chen et al 2007 shinohara and otsuki 2015 zhou et al 2019 quantifying the effects of each factor on evapotranspiration in various patterns can enhance the accuracy of estimating soil water consumption combining the quantified results from different forest communities with recent local climate records is also beneficial for evaluating current restoration achievements several climatic factors have been identified as drivers of evapotranspiration such as radiation wind speed temperature and humidity parajuli et al 2019 penman 1948 valiantzas 2006 although equations such as the penman monteith model include each environmental factor mentioned above they can only provide a limited prediction rather than a real reflection of vegetation water consumption moreover the effects of these factors on evapotranspiration are interrelated and their dynamic combination alternates in dominance a study conducted in northern wisconsin showed that the daily evapotranspiration of upland forests was primarily driven by solar radiation in spring and by vapor pressure deficit vpd in summer due to seasonal phenological changes mackay et al 2007 for the same phenological period in different years the daily evapotranspiration response patterns to primary environmental factors varied particularly after extreme precipitation liu et al 2020 as the effects of radiation and the energy portioning on evapotranspiration were stable across years at a study site with certain latitude and longitude regional evapotranspiration variations could be partially explained by vegetation and microclimate changes yan et al 2020 evidence from morphology and physiology might explain these shifts lyu et al 2022 novick et al 2016b but few studies have explored what triggers these alterations estimation methods adaptive to common environments always require several parameters with complex forms wang et al 2019b whereas simple functions with fewer items have limited applicability li et al 2016 in the loess plateau significant heterogeneity exists both in temporal climatic variation and spatial vegetation distribution an adaptable and concise evapotranspiration estimation approach based merely on soil water content and basic meteorological factors would be beneficial for comparing water consumption behaviors between different forest communities black locust robinia pseudoacacia is one of the most widespread afforestation species on the loess plateau because of its rapid growth nitrogen fixation and drought tolerance attributes xu and liu 2004 however soil water declines as these artificial communities grow and affects the sustainability of the ecosystems chen et al 2008 liaodong oak quercus liaotungensis is a dominant species in natural secondary forests in the central loess plateau yamanaka et al 2014 current research suggests that this species has a normal magnitude and sustainable water consumption cheng et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 yan et al 2016 the liaodong oak can be a reference standard for comparison with black locust for the consumption of soil water resources studies have been conducted focusing on water consuming features to determine the amount and variations in black locust transpiration jiao et al 2018 kume et al 2012 lyu et al 2020 wang et al 2010 precipitation is a commonly recognized factor affecting transpiration variations in black locust from diurnal to interannual temporal scales du et al 2011 he et al 2020 precipitation acts on vegetation indirectly by recharging the soil water thereby affecting the plant s water use méndez barroso et al 2009 theoretically transpiration should respond simultaneously to both precipitation and soil water favoring the latter however a positive relationship between soil water content and sap flow density cannot always be found at both diurnal and monthly scales even in water limited regions with black locust trees zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 precipitation events of similar amount but varying time distributions have been found to result in differences in plant physiological behavior but the mechanism of how soil water changes caused by precipitation influence plant transpiration remains unclear gu et al 2016 stand evapotranspiration directly based on soil water data may be a strong supplement and offer circumstantial evidence of ecological and physiological processes in specific species or areas denager et al 2020 therefore there is a great need to quantify the effects of soil water on evapotranspiration at different time scales and to characterize the community water consuming patterns in relation to soil water dynamics in this study a black locust community and a nearby liaodong oak community were chosen to conduct continuous soil water monitoring and to record climatic factors during 2012 2015 our aims were 1 to graph the soil water and evapotranspiration dynamics in both communities 2 to determine and estimate the influence of the dominant factors on evapotranspiration through seasonal shifts and phenological alternation and 3 to develop a method for evaluating possible threshold of soil water storage representing dominant factor shift we hypothesized that soil water storage usually serves as the main limitation of evapotranspiration for forest communities in the semiarid region and there should be different response patterns to evapotranspiration driving factors with a certain change in soil water storage the results would contribute to specifying community water use strategies by using soil water data and benefit future afforestation practice in the semiarid region 2 materials and method 2 1 study site

classification the calcic cambisol group is the predominant soil type the loess depth usually reaches 50 200 m depending on the topography the gravimetric field capacity and wilting percentage of the soil water content were 20 24 and 3 6 respectively yang and shao 2000 the black locust plantation and the natural secondary forest dominated by liaodong oak are adjacent and a permanent research plot 20 m 20 m was established in each forest stand the black locust plantation was planted approximately 40 years ago and has shown signs of degradation dieback in tall trees in recent years the oak forest is approximately 60 years old with some accompanying species of trees and shrubs such as ameniaca sibirica ulmus macrocarpa cotoneaster multiflorus acer stenolobum platycladus orientalis the plot leaf area index for the black locust plantation and the oak forest during whole leaf stage were around 2 8 m2m 2 and 3 1 m2m 2 respectively du et al 2011 additional basic information on the two plots has been presented in previous studies shi et al 2011 tian et al 2017 2 2 measurements of soil water and meteorological factors in each plot soil water content was monitored using s smc m005 sensors connected to a hobo data logger h21 001 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa and means recorded every half hour six sensors were installed along a profile at an adequate location for each plot at depths of 6 12 30 50 70 and 90 cm in each profile to represent the six horizons along the 1 m profile and their data were marked as swc0 06 swc0 12 swc0 3 swc0 5 swc0 7 and swc0 9 respectively in addition to this profile under automatic monitoring three other profiles were periodically measured using a time domain reflectometry moisture measurement system trime imko micromodultechnik ettlingen germany and the data obtained from two measuring systems had been verified each other lyu et al 2022 the data of the former system were used in this study and weighted mean was calculated for the soil water content over the entire 1 m profile swc0 1 m3 m 3 according to the relative thickness represented by the sensors wilson et al 2001 as follows 1 sw c 0 1 0 08 s w c 0 06 0 07 s w c 0

conversion factor for a 1 m depth daily evapotranspiration on rainless days was calculated using the method of soil water budget as the difference between the sws values at 0 00 on the current day and the next day wilson et al 2001 this method could be simply used to analyze the relationship between evapotranspiration and environmental factors during rainless days though the accuracy of longterm estimates would be affected by possible infiltration and consumption below the monitored depth schelde et al 2011 basic meteorological factors including precipitation solar radiation rs air temperature and relative humidity were measured in an open area near the two plots precipitation was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge davis 7852 davis instruments hayward ca usa connected to

helsinki finland these data were sampled every 30 s and recorded at 30 min intervals using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa additionally two integrated variables vpd and reference evapotranspiration et0 were extracted to evaluate their multifactorial influence on evapotranspiration the vpd was calculated from the air temperature t and relative humidity rh as follows 3 vpd 0 611

of temperature relative air humidity wind speed and radiation related parameters it is primarily used as a standard to describe the comprehensive environmental driving force because it contains nearly all physical factors that influence evapotranspiration allen et al 2005 2 3 data analysis the least significant difference lsd method was applied to test the difference in significance between the data groups to investigate the response features of evapotranspiration to multiple factors the pearson correlation matrix method was used with no multiple comparison adjustment because only the columns involving evapotranspiration were selected and regrouped to explore the response patterns of evapotranspiration under different conditions stepwise regression was utilized to ensure that every item in the regression equations was significant the detailed steps were adding or removing each factor until the akaike information criterion aic reached its minimum value this allowed us to build the final equation keeping the most information with the least variables yamashita et al 2007 the switching points of soil water separating the evapotranspiration patterns of both communities were detected using the receiver operating characteristics roc curve method which is a widely used method to validate the binomial distribution model and measure its threshold pontius and parmentier 2014

environmental factors and evapotranspiration throughout the four investigated growing seasons the daily data for evapotranspiration in the two investigated communities and basic climatic factors on evapotranspiration along the four growing seasons are presented in fig 1 precipitation varied dramatically at both seasonal and interannual scales the precipitation amounts during the growing season april 1 to october 31 were 449 793 627 and 325 mm for 2012 2015 respectively et0 tended to increase with higher variance in the early growing season before july while it tended to decrease with lower variance after july soil water storage was replenished quickly by effective rainfall events and was consumed relatively slowly by evapotranspiration with different combinations of replenishment and consumption the soil water storage dynamics presented different patterns among the different rainfall years specifically years 2012 and 2013 started their growing seasons with dry condition and the soil water storage changed slightly at low levels whereas 2014 and 2015 started their growing seasons with moist condition and the soil water storage continued to decrease until the rainy season coming thereafter the soil water storage increased with intense rainfall in rainy season particularly in the wet years of 2013 and 2014 and then decreased under dry days in the later season in this study the evapotranspiration of both forest communities was primarily driven by climatic factors and limited by soil water conditions when soil water storage was low before the rainy season 2012 4 1 2012 7 21 and 2013 4 1 2013 7 3 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak was always low regardless of reference evapotranspiration when soil water storage was low even after the rainy season 2012 7 22 2012 10 31 and 2015 6 22 2015 10 31 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak fluctuated with soil water storage when soil water storage was at a fair level before the rainy season 2014 4 1 2014 7 8 and 2015 4 1 2015 6 21 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak showed a similar tendency to the et0 dynamics when soil water storage was at a moist level after the rainy season 2013 7 4 2013 10 31 and 2014 7 9 2014 10 31 the evapotranspiration of liaodong oak was historically maintained consistency with the et0 based on the seasonal dynamics of et0 and the interannual variability of soil water storage we divided all 856 rainless days of the four year growing seasons into four distinct periods the dry period before the rainy season db the dry period after the rainy season da the humid period before the rainy season hb and the humid period after the rainy season ha table 1 the four cut offs were set at a point before a major rainfall event that represented the onset of rainy season when et0 and soil water storage showed pronounced changes 3 2 response of daily evapotranspiration to climatic and hydrologic factors during the different periods there was no significant difference in the et0 between the da and hb periods however the et0 of these two periods was significantly p 0 001 lower than that of the db and significantly p 0 001 higher than that of the ha soil water storage varied significantly p 0 0001 among the four periods in both forest communities fig 2 daily evapotranspiration of both communities showed similar ranges to soil water storage except differences in evapotranspiration were not statistically significant between the db and da periods considering these results we deduced that lower soil water storage does not always lead to lower daily evapotranspiration values maintaining normal physiological activities in both communities may require a minimum evapotranspiration amount bréda et al 2006 on the interannual scale there was no consistency in daily evapotranspiration and et0 zhang et al 2015 correlation analyses of daily evapotranspiration in each period suggested variations in the major influencing factors among periods fig 3 significant responses of daily evapotranspiration for both forests to climatic factors including rs radiation vpd temperature and humidity and et0 synthetic climatic factor were only detected in the ha period the correlation coefficients between evapotranspiration of both communities and hydrologic factors such as soil water storage and cumulative precipitation cp generally declined with soil water increasing in the ha period the correlation between daily evapotranspiration and cp became negative in both communities indicating that daily evapotranspiration activities weakened as precipitation accumulated however dependence of daily evapotranspiration on soil water conditions still existed a possible reason for this conflict is that the effects of precipitation consist not only of soil water amelioration but also of indirect factors under wet weather with evapotranspiration drivers declining gradually in the ha period with increasing day of year thus weakened evapotranspiration showed an inverse response to the monotonically increasing cp at the end of the season with relatively adequate water although a specific response to climatic factors occurred in et0 during both dry periods db and da strong correlations were linked with either cp or soil water storage after stepwise regression all equations contained soil water storage implying the limitation of soil water storage in all periods for daily evapotranspiration in both communities table 2 in other words active evapotranspiration only appeared under abundant soil water conditions and soil water storage was always influential at the diurnal scale in all cases all equations except the da period had a cp variable suggesting independent effects of precipitation from soil water storage only equations for the ha period included a climatic factor rs for black locust and et0 for oak in addition these equations had the highest r2 value which represented that the daily evapotranspiration had the best fit in adequate soil water conditions and only then the effects of climatic factors on evapotranspiration would not be removed after stepwise regression 3 3 response of sum and daily mean evapotranspiration to climatic and hydrologic factors in dry events of the different periods trees would change their water use strategies when they are subjected to water stress du et al 2011 accordingly the response patterns of evapotranspiration to climatic factors may also change with decreasing soil water content under continuous dry days to test whether a consistent response could be observed during dry events correlation matrixes and stepwise regression were conducted on the summations of evapotranspiration and environmental factors fig 4 table 3 regression equations for the ha period had the same form as the single variable of et0 summation for both communities in addition the equation in the db period also consists of the et0 summation and rs with a small coefficient significant positive correlations were found between the sums of rs and evapotranspiration in both communities during the db da and ha periods the amount of evapotranspiration responded to the amount of et0 for both communities in the db and ha periods however in the da period a similar response was only found for oak a positive correlation between hydrologic factors soil water storage and cp and evapotranspiration amount was found in the da period for both communities in addition the evapotranspiration amount was well correlated with sws in the db period for black locust and in the ha period for oak significant positive correlations between evapotranspiration amount and dry event length were found in both dry periods db and da for black locust but only in the da period for oak the evapotranspiration amount in the ha period showed a strong correlation with climatic driving factors rs vpd and et0 stepwise regression resulted in a numerical constant for black locust in the hb period because there was no significant relationship between etr summation and any other factors in this period correlation analyses of the daily means of evapotranspiration and environmental factors during each dry event are shown in fig 5 significant relationships between the daily mean evapotranspiration met and climatic factors daily mean rs and et0 were observed during the ha period for both communities hydrological factors were significantly correlated with the daily met of black locust during two dry periods db and da relationships between the daily met and soil water storage in oak were observed in the da period whereas correlation with cumulative precipitation was only observed in the db period stepwise regression equations for daily met and environmental factors for dry events of each period were all statistically significant with all p values being 0 01 table 4 every equation for oak contained a single dominant factor for the black locust community the regression equations for the da and ha periods had a single factor that was the same as that in oak the equation for the db period contained two factors whereas only a numerical constant remained for the hb period similar to the results of the summation analysis table 3 factoring in daily mean et0 could provide a good linear description for both communities in the ha period this indicates that evapotranspiration strength relied heavily and singularly on synthetic climatic factors under adequate soil water conditions 3 4 validation and thresholds of four periods division in this study the dry and humid soil water conditions were defined as negative and positive to draw roc curves respectively the specificity value of a given soil water storage represents the ratio of detected dry conditions to total dry conditions detected dry condition plus false humid condition if the soil water storage is defined as the threshold of dry and humid conditions the closer the specificity value was to 1 the rate of correctly detected dry conditions was higher the same configuration was used between the sensitivity value and the humid condition roc curves on daily sws before and after the rainy season were created separately for each forest community fig 6 all the specificity values were greater than 0 6 suggesting a high accuracy of determination four optimal cut off points for swsr and swsq before rainy season and those after rainy season were 120 2 105 8 150 7 and 137 9 mm respectively the threshold of sws after rainy season should be higher than before rainy season and that for black locust was higher than oak within the same period the integral of this curve is the conventional index for evaluating a binomial classification method the auc area under the curve values of the four validations were 0 840 0 943 0 956 and 0 981 respectively in the same order as mentioned above all auc values in this study were substantially high indicating clear distinction between the two states separated by the threshold from the community aspect roc curves of the oak had larger auc values than those of the black locust in both periods from the period perspective roc curves for both communities after the rainy season had larger auc values than those before the rainy season 4 discussion 4 1 influence of precipitation on soil water and evapotranspiration precipitation has been recognized as a major factor affecting soil water and evapotranspiration especially in arid and semiarid regions mintz and walker 1993 prăvălie et al 2019 owing to the extremely deep groundwater level in the loess plateau rainfall events are closely connected with soil water as the sole source of replenishment zhang et al 2016 in our study soil water storage increased after significant rainfall events and continuously decreased daily until the next rainfall event fig 1 which is consistent with previous research mei et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 the recharge process converts precipitation to available water resources for plants and further changes the process of forest community water consumption mahmood 1996 the correlation matrixes and stepwise regression results showed that precipitation and soil water often had synergistic effects on evapotranspiration figs 3 5 tables 2 4 as for the regression results on daily data throughout each period there were three periods when the dominant factors included both cumulative precipitation and soil water storage for both communities table 2 nevertheless the regression results on daily means during dry events for the oak community yielded a single variable of cumulative precipitation rather than soil water storage in the db period table 4 this phenomenon implied that the effect of soil water storage balanced itself out during continuous dry days whereas the effect of cumulative precipitation on evapotranspiration still existed this is also supported by the suggestion that the oak regulated its transpiration rate according to the total precipitation input rather than the instantaneous soil water availability in the dry season whereas black locust had a stronger response to temporary soil water input from rainfall events du et al 2011 this difference between oak and black locust might be attributed to their water use strategies the black locust community tends to take risky water use strategy under soil water deficiency and take both soil water and precipitation as much as possible the oak community would shut down stomata earlier in morning to cut water consumption in a conservative way lyu et al 2020 in this study the initial soil water storage in the growing season had a strong dependency on the previous year s precipitation fig 1 in the hb period with high soil water storage the evapotranspiration pattern was turbulent with low dependency on all factors especially for the black locust community figs 4 and 5 when an hb period was followed by a da period such as in 2015 the difference between the initial and end values of soil water storage would take a significant proportion of the amount of annual evapotranspiration which was charged from precipitation in the previous year these unsynchronized dynamics could explain why precipitation was not always synchronized with total stand transpiration on an annual scale zhang et al 2015 higher soil water content in early spring would lead to an earlier physiological activity onset of semiarid forest communities and thus increase the annual evapotranspiration amount liu et al 2020 considering patterns of precipitation soil water storage and evapotranspiration it may be more insightful to adopt the time division of the water year instead of the calendar year that has been applied in the western united states redmond and koch 1991 ziaco et al 2020 clearer correlations might be found on an annual scale for precipitation soil water storage and evapotranspiration during wetter years as the soil water storage for evapotranspiration consumption in early growing season is always replenished by precipitation of the previous year in this region 4 2 shift of dominant factors on evapotranspiration and difference between forest communities the dominant meteorological factors on evapotranspiration could be altered by precipitation exclusion or extreme precipitation which might result from changes in soil water conditions liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in addition dominant factors based on a linear relationship with evapotranspiration are always perceived as limiting factors ferguson et al 2016 analysis by dividing climatic factors into water related and energy related factors suggested that the abundance of water related factors would make the linear correlation between energy factors and evapotranspiration more apparent and vice versa mackay et al 2007 wang et al 2019a in the present study linear correlations between evapotranspiration and soil water storage reached statistical significance in all periods for both communities on a daily scale which implied that both communities had insufficient soil water resources under nearly all conditions fig 3 table 2 conversely through analysis of 5 day dry events the total evapotranspiration for both communities were noticeably dominated by the etr in the hb period but only for oak community in the db period table 3 this suggests that an adaptive water consumption strategy was applied by the oak community to resist water limitation on continuous days with decreasing soil water storage whereas in the black locust community only a relatively high soil water storage level caused by extreme precipitation could relieve water limitation enough to shift the dominance from water to energy factors further if water or energy limitations are imposed significant non linear correlations usually presented as exponential saturation functions between water consumption and other factors can be determined jiao et al 2019 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2008 a well fitted exponential saturation function can often be transformed into two linear functions on either side of a threshold wang et al 2019b the linear function before the threshold has a steeper slope whereas the linear function after the threshold has a gentler slope or is parallel to the x axis from our perspective because of the characteristics of the exponential saturation function these fitted results can also be seen as shifts of dominant factors around a certain threshold before the threshold a strong linear correlation indicated the dominant effects of this factor however after the threshold the dominant factor shifted to others connecting local conditions with this discussion soil water should be both the main limitation and the dominant factor on evapotranspiration in most cases when soil water storage exceeds a particular threshold the hydrological limitation is lifted and other factors begin to dominate the sum as well as the strength of evapotranspiration during continuous dry days moreover the discovery of similar shifts in surface conductance an index to evaluate resistance to canopy transpiration supports our inference the dependence of surface conductance and evapotranspiration on soil water content increased with increasing dryness index while the dependence on vpd decreased at the same time based on observations at 38 ameriflux sites novick et al 2016a the results demonstrated the distinct response patterns to evapotranspiration driving factors with soil water storage difference and supported our original hypothesis furthermore a study on the grassland in hebei province of china also found that soil water movement between layers was the driving force to shift response patterns of soil water to potential evapotranspiration wang et al 2021b a similar mechanism should exist in this study because the forest communities in loess plateau may have a deep zone for soil water movement li et al 2022 4 3 soil water storage thresholds determining evapotranspiration patterns as distinct response patterns to evapotranspiration driving factors were detected among periods with soil water storage difference a threshold should be expected even within a period in growing season which is also related to the ecophysiological behavior of the community roc curves turned out to be applicable to such a need generally a diagnostic method is considered acceptable when it obtains an auc value above 0 7 in roc curves and it is considered excellent if the auc value reaches 0 9 swets 1988 in this study all auc values were greater than 0 8 and three of them were greater than 0 9 which means that these four thresholds are acceptable fig 6 when divided by soil water storage evapotranspiration characteristics in the four periods were quite distinct for both communities combining the analysis of the dominant factor shifts the soil water condition can be defined as wet when the soil water storage exceeds these thresholds both before and after the rainy season the black locust community showed higher thresholds than the oak community suggesting that the black locust community had greater demand for soil water resources thereby switching its dominant factors from water related to energy related many indices have been used to evaluate the degree of dryness over a region such as the drought index di standard precipitation index spi standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei palmer drought severity index pdsi and their variations alley 1984 bhuyan erhardt et al 2019 guo et al 2012 li et al 2017 liang et al 2018 tan et al 2015 however rigid background information of either vegetation or soil properties is needed to make these indices representative the values of these quantitative indicators could not provide an insightful judgement if the community in this region is suffering water deficiency but according to our study a clear boundary between dry and wet can be established based on roc curves for a specific community and forest community have distinct response patterns on both sides of the threshold with manifestations of dominant factor shifts our method can determine the threshold of soil water conditions with only continuous soil water and basic climatic data both can be easily obtained from remote sensing techniques or low cost site monitoring kazemzadeh et al 2021 li et al 2020 with these data if certain time periods that evapotranspiration is respectively dominated by water related factors and energy related factors can be found at the same time of year a roc curve can be established to determine and validate the soil water storage threshold between two kinds of periods and after passing validation for a given soil water storage at a time of year it will be easy to judge whether the soil water condition of this specific community is wet or dry as well as to infer the evapotranspiration dominant factors the results also provide a realistic mechanism for modifications of evapotranspiration estimation models zhang et al 2021 nevertheless given that our study covered datasets of two forest communities for four years further studies are still needed for verification over other regions species and timescales 5 conclusion this study identified that in addition to driving factors both precipitation and soil water storage affected evapotranspiration in the two investigated communities the hydrological factors were dominant in evapotranspiration when the soil water resources were insufficient the dominance shifted to energy related factors when the soil water was well supplemented as expressed by cumulative precipitation the oak community showed adaptive evapotranspiration patterns during dry periods while the black locust community had a higher sensitivity to the soil water decrease even during humid periods both communities showed distinct response pattern divisions to the dominant factors before and after the rainy season the soil water storage thresholds of the oak community were lower than those of the black locust community the method for determining the threshold based on soil water storage was proven valid and practicable declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential

research has been guided by the overarching goal of bridging environmental geochemistry and hydrology it has evolved over her career meeting the demand of emerging research topics and directions hydrology has traditionally been the science of water quantity and availability and has gradually evolved to become a highly interdisciplinary earth and environmental science crossing engineering chemistry physics and geosciences clifford 2002 sivapalan 2018 the chemical aspects of hydrology have historically included topics such as groundwater quality and acid mine drainage kirchner 2003 nordstrom et al 2015 however emerging research topics call for meaningful integration of bio geochemistry hydrology and other related disciplines kite and melwani daswani 2019 li 2019 paola et al 2006

and resources systems both topics require an understanding of the intricate interactions of fluids chemicals and porous media soils rocks under a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions one important feature of dr peters work is recognizing and respecting the complexity of those systems in her early work she focused on chemical mixtures and their biodegradation in the environment while her more recent work has focused on chemical physical heterogeneity in rock materials other important signatures of dr peters research include the utilization of a constellation of tools to provide cutting edge characterizations of rock materials using spectroscopic imaging and microscopic techniques experimental work under high pressure and high temperature conditions and reactive transport modeling the peters group is among the first to couple a high pressure high temperature core flooding experimental apparatus with high resolution x ray computed tomography x ray ct ellis et al 2013 ellis et al 2011 in real time deng et al 2015 the group also developed image processing methods to extract morphological and mineralogical information from x ray ct images deng et al 2013 deng et al 2016a ellis and peters 2016 and applied microscopic and synchrotron based spectroscopic techniques to open up new possibilities of examining the complexity of real rock materials crandell et al 2012 kim et al 2021a kim et al 2022 peters 2009 another example is the in operando experiments leveraging these techniques in real rock based microfluidic systems deng et al 2020 these efforts have pushed the boundaries of experimental systems in the pursuit of unraveling reactive transport processes in rock materials equally important is the use of reactive transport models to investigate the impacts of morphological and mineralogical heterogeneity on the evolution of porous and fractured media deng and peters 2019 li et al 2006 li et al 2007b nogues et al 2013 spokas et al 2018 in this review we highlight select research topics from dr peters research group that showcase her contributions in bridging environmental geochemistry and hydrology we start with a summary of the work on characterization of geological materials section 2 followed by experimental investigations of biogeochemical reactions section 3 we also summarize some major findings from work by the peters group on pore network reactive transport modeling and upscaling of reaction rates section 4 and on fracture alteration using the integrated characterization experimental and modeling approach section 5 we end this review article with mentorship stories and reflections section 6 and a few concluding remarks section 7 2 mineral characterization imaging and quantitative image analyses have emerged as powerful means of characterizing porous media samples to determine mineralogy and details beyond those available from traditional bulk sample laboratory techniques seminal work in this area from the peters group demonstrated the utility of both 2d and 3d laboratory and synchrotron imaging to characterize reactive properties of porous and consolidated geologic media this includes 2d scanning electron microscopy sem 3d x ray computed tomography x ray ct imaging and synchrotron x ray fluorescence xrf microscopy as detailed in the next sections and highlighted in fig 1 2 1 mineral characterization using sem imaging the utility of sem imaging to provide details on mineral distribution and implications for reactivity was first explored in peters 2009 sem backscattered electron bse and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds images of sandstone thin sections were collected and analyzed to determine the mineralogy and statistical distribution of minerals with respect to the pore space in sem bse images the amount of electron backscatter depends on the mean atomic number of the material allowing a relative identification of minerals more precise mineral identification is facilitated through integration of eds analysis which provides elemental information peters 2009 developed an automated segmentation algorithm to classify the pixels in the bse images into four categories pores minerals with mean atomic number less than quartz e g mg chlorite kaolinite montmorillonite albite quartz and minerals with mean atomic number greater than quartz e g k feldspar apatite calcite titanium dioxide pyrite etc a threshold optimization algorithm identifies the inflection point of overlapping grayscale intensity distributions for each category and the optimum threshold value is chosen by minimizing the sum of the normalized differentials between pixel categories this segmentation approach reliably generates reproducible segmentation results fig 1a once segmented mineral maps were analyzed to consider mineral abundances volume fractions and the distribution of mineral phases with respect to the pore space notably novel quantification of the accessibility of mineral phases defined as those adjacent to the pore space were generated large discrepancies between mineral abundances and mineral accessibilities were observed high atomic number mineral phases present in moderate volume fractions 1 6 in the considered sandstone samples had consistently low accessibilities conversely low atomic number mineral phases largely kaolinite in the considered samples had much higher accessibility than abundance these phases were largely present as grain coatings on quartz and other minerals this observation has important implications for assessing the reactivity of porous media where reactivity may be over or under estimated based on volume fractions alone these initial analyses of mineral accessibility inspired efforts beyond the peters group on quantifying mineral accessibility and accessible surface areas beckingham et al 2017 kareem et al 2017 lai et al 2015 landrot et al 2012 ma et al 2021 qin and beckingham 2019 dr peters group has also leveraged 2d sem imaging to understand reaction induced changes in porous media with the aim of ultimately improving understanding of permeability evolution crandell et al 2012 here the pore structure of mineral dissolution precipitation experiments in the context of the hanford wa site was preserved by flowing a low viscosity epoxy through the column after experiments concluded thin sections were then created along the length of the column and analyzed via 2d sem bse and eds imaging images revealed uniform coatings of secondary zeolite mineral precipitates on all grain surfaces fig 1b an image erosion dilation approach with a sample specific bias correction factor was developed to quantify pore and pore throat size distributions from 2d images fig 1b changes in the pore structure due to secondary mineral precipitation were determined by using this approach to analyze the pore structure of the reacted sample in addition to a set of images with the secondary minerals digitally removed this analysis revealed that while secondary minerals occurred as a uniform coating on all grain surfaces this resulted in non uniform variations in the pore network structure where some small pore throats were removed due to clogging 2 2 mineral characterization using 3d x ray ct imaging the increase in the capability and availability of laboratory x ray ct instrumentation has expanded the use of 3d x ray ct imaging for reactive porous medium systems in these systems an x ray beam passes through the sample and the resulting grayscale images reflect variations in x ray attenuation of the material precise mineral identification is not feasible from attenuation data alone where several minerals have similar x ray attenuation coefficients by combining x ray ct imaging with 2d sem bse and eds imaging however important reactive mineral phases may be identifiable as illustrated in ellis and peters 2016 in the study of ellis and peters 2016 a method was developed to segment calcite an important reactive mineral in systems such as geologic co2 sequestration in 3d x ray ct images of a carbonate rich caprock specimen after 3d x ray ct imaging the sample was sectioned and prepared for imaging with 2d sem bse and eds calcite pixels in sem images were identified based on bse grayscale intensity and the elemental eds maps the processed 2d mineral map was then registered with the 3d x ray ct image and the corresponding calcite area in the slice of the x ray ct image was labeled fig 1c the average grayscale intensity for calcite was then quantified and utilized to identify calcite throughout the 3d x ray ct image the resulting processed 3d image was used to consider fracture reactivity in the context of geologic co2 sequestration for different 2d cross sections extracted from the processed image simulations revealed that accounting for calcite distribution along a fracture is critical for predicting reaction induced fracture permeability evolution deng and peters 2019 spokas et al 2018 coupling of 2d sem imaging with 3d x ray ct imaging for mineral identification was adopted in work beyond the peters group toward understanding fracture evolution in basalts menefee et al 2017 and inspired subsequent machine learning based approaches asadi and beckingham 2021 guntoro et al 2019 kim 2021a 2 3 mineral characterization using synchrotron xrf and applications of machine learning applications of synchrotron techniques to characterize various features of geologic media are increasing with improved capabilities and availability to researchers most notably the technique of synchrotron micro xrf is a powerful tool for the characterization of elements at environmentally relevant scales in these systems two dimensional mapping of elements is possible by placing samples on rastering stages and measuring the intensities of fluorescence x rays generated from momentary displacement of electrons as materials are excited by incident x rays many recent advancements to synchrotron facilities allow for coupled data acquisition such as simultaneous measurements of fluoresced x rays and diffracted x rays lanzirotti et al 2016 sutton et al 2017 while the technique of xrf alone cannot identify mineral phases recent work from the peters group presents a method of coupling xrf data with x ray diffraction xrd data and utilizes machine learning to draw out not only recognizable but also unapparent relationships between element composition embedded in xrf data and mineral content embedded in xrd data kim et al 2021a the coupled xrf xrd methodology is referred to as the synchrotron based machine learning approach for raster smart mapping which is a classifier that can characterize rock samples for their mineral content including a suite of carbonate e g calcite aragonite dolomite sulfide e g pyrite pyrrhotite oxide e g pyrolusite and silicate e g quartz minerals kim et al 2021a fig 1d for a mineral phase to be identifiable and labelled by the smart classifier data including coupled xrf intensities and xrd based mineral labels were first generated and then inputted into a machine learning algorithm referred to as a neural network for training purposes once trained a mineral phase could be labelled from any micro xrf dataset without the need for additional xrd analyses which is time consuming in terms of the data collection and interpretation advancements made in this work help address the limitations of conventional methodologies of mineral characterization such as the need for sample destruction the dependence on elemental ratios or the lack of spatial resolution to resolve nano and micro scale features furthermore the ability to generate millimeter scale mineral maps that can capture multi mineral presence for each pixel revealed many new opportunities for mineral reactivity characterization including accurate quantifications of mineral abundances not limited by single mineral presence per pixel quantifications of grain sizes and identification of host minerals of trace elements and their quantities utilizing complementary element maps kim et al 2022 characterizations of various consolidated shale rock samples at micrometers led to a new approach of quantifying mineral accessibility and this is presented in kim et al 2022 this new method allows for estimation of mineral accessibility as a function of surrounding reactive mineralogy the surrounding reactive mineralogy may dissolve away and expose the embedded phase rather than allowing only mineral accessibility via pore spaces the methodology was applied to analyze the accessibility of reactive fluids to pyrite grains embedded within the carbonate and silicate matrices of the eagle ford shale locating pyrite grains and quantifying their accessibility is important because of their elementally heterogeneous and toxic nature and on the basis that carbonate minerals are especially soluble in acidified fluids kreisserman and emmanuel 2018 zhang et al 2017 in the eagle ford shale sample analyzed pyrite was found to be mostly embedded in a relatively insoluble quartz phase however dissolution of reactive mineral phases can create new conduits for flow dynamically changing the degree of accessibility to initially inaccessible mineral phases deng et al 2020 such scenarios would be relevant in systems like geologic co2 sequestration where injected solutions often induce alterations to contacting mineralogy due to its reactivity and this concept is and has been constantly recognized throughout the works of the peters group 3 experimental studies of biogeochemical reactions the development of new mineral characterization techniques was conducted alongside research on organic and inorganic biogeochemical contaminants experiments examining contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals and co2 were coupled with geochemical modeling to better assess the fate and transport of these contaminants and to understand their stability after treatment with different remediation methods the general strategy of using theory based modeling to complement experimental work to gain mechanistic insight has continued to be a hallmark of dr peters work the coupling of experiments and modeling has also allowed predictions to be made at longer timescales than experimentally possible and with changes in temperature pressure and chemical conditions these capabilities are critical for optimizing contaminant treatment methods and for identifying research gaps that need to be bridged to more accurately model biogeochemical reactions in the environment across scales 3 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bioavailability and biodegradation early research in dr peters group focused on transport and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs via coupled laboratory experiments with mathematical modeling inspired by some of dr peters doctoral at carnegie mellon e g peters and luthy 1993 and peters and luthy 1994 and postdoctoral work at the university of michigan e g mukherji et al 1997 the peters group explored the phase behavior of coal tar dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls found at former manufactured gas plant sites which are mixtures of hundreds of compounds primarily pahs most pahs are solids in their pure form making it necessary to quantify the relationship between napl composition and liquid phase stability in order to effectively perform risk assessment and predict the effectiveness of potential remediation techniques including the use of surfactants key contributions of the work included quantifying how shifts in multicomponent napl composition e g as more soluble pahs dissolve into aqueous phases impact napl stability and determining the cases in which ideal solubility theory is inadequate for predicting pah napl phase stability the insight gained concerning the behavior of pahs in mixtures has had important implications for understanding pah solubility and bioavailability these efforts were the first steps toward quantifying the most significant factors that ultimately determine pah biodegradation rates guha et al 1998 peters et al 1999 peters et al 1997 peters et al 2000 the biodegradation of pahs was further examined with the goal of quantifying biodegradation kinetics previously it had been established that an inverse relationship is typically observed between pah molecular weight and the biodegradation rate in environmental systems coupling monod biodegradation kinetic modeling with experiments and careful considerations of which simplifying assumptions are acceptable vs which should not be made the peters group showed that the observed variation in rates was mostly associated with bioavailability in subsurface environments where dnapls are typically found the phase behavior and subsequent impacts on bioavailability proved critical for overall observed pah transformation rates guha et al 1999 knightes and peters 2003 knightes and peters 2006 once these effects were quantified and models refined the molecular structure and biodegradation rate relationships were quantified independent of bioavailability constraints in this case the inverse relationship between molecular weight and biodegradation rate is not observed key considerations instead include molecular shape and the number and position of alkyl substituents in the absence of bioavailability constraints the rate limiting factor for pah biodegradation is how well the pah molecule is able to fit into the bacterial enzyme active site in the correct position wammer and peters 2005 wammer and peters 2006 this work enabled biodegradation kinetic parameters to be predicted with improved accuracy which would not have been possible without systematically quantifying and explaining all the other factors influencing observed pah transformation rates 3 2 mineralization 3 2 1 mineralization for heavy metals removal in addition to understanding the biodegradation of organic pahs in the environment dr peters group also worked towards understanding the fate and transport of heavy metals heavy metals are highly toxic non biodegradable substances that tend to bioaccumulate in organisms these concerns have led to the development of technologies that can remove heavy metals from and or stabilize heavy metals in contaminated waters and soils ranging from precipitation processes and membrane filtration to ion exchange and adsorption fu and wang 2011 the peters group has conducted work specifically on understanding mineralization and coprecipitation processes that can cost effectively remove heavy metal ions the use of na2so4 for example to induce co precipitation and form minerals such as barite baso4 can be an efficient and affordable method of heavy metal removal from contaminated waters the low solubility of barite its long term stability and the fast kinetics of precipitation that can lead to higher incorporation of trace elements makes barite an ideal candidate for co precipitation treatments barite co precipitation has been used for the removal of heavy metals from waters produced by oil and gas operations he et al 2014 the stabilization of radioactive contaminants in nuclear wastes tokunaga et al 2018 vinograd et al 2018 and the removal of metals from mining wastewater kondash et al 2014 ma et al 2017 weber et al 2021 advances in mineral characterization have also pushed the boundaries for examining co precipitation processes across scales ling et al 2018 experiments were performed to examine the co precipitation of haso4 2 or sr2 in baso4 at low 0 003 m nacl and high salinities 1 0 m nacl directly from aqueous solutions solutions containing bacl2 nacl and trace na2haso4 or srcl2 were directly mixed with na2so4 to precipitate baso4 interestingly high salinities produced nano scale compositional zoning with local enrichment of sr or as as confirmed by the synchrotron nano xrf maps fig 2 the observation of enriched sr or as zones indicated that during particle growth a more optimal solution condition exists that may yield increased removal of trace hazardous ions from solution the ability to identify these optimized solution conditions has far reaching implications for water treatment methods that use co precipitation using nano xrf in conjunction with other bulk techniques for solid and solution analyses hunter et al 2020 suggested that sr incorporation into baso4 could be improved by increasing the addition of sulfate increasing the barite saturation index to be 3 or by establishing an increased sr ba ratio however experiments at a barite saturation index of 2 34 showed zones of enriched sr along with a greater diversity in particle sizes ranging from 2 to 10 µm fig 2b the results point to a need to understand relationships between particle size range the number of particles forming and how these variables affect incorporation and distribution of sr into the solid phase during co precipitation which can then be used to help optimize trace element removal further work on relating co precipitation with classical nucleation theory has provided further insight on different controls on co precipitation kinetics poonoosamy et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 the ability to use nano xrf to assess solution conditions for contaminant removal during co precipitation will inform future models to better predict kinetically controlled co precipitation these advances will help develop more tailored efficient and cost effective water treatment methods that incorporate targeted optimal solution conditions for increased contaminant removal during co precipitation 3 2 2 mineralization for the security of subsurface co2 dr peters interests in mineralization have also fused with her work on safely securing subsurface co2 which will be further discussed in the next section after extensive work understanding mineral dissolution and flow in the subsurface the peters group began exploring how targeted mineral precipitation could be used to decrease flow in porous media in targeted mineral precipitation particles with a temperature responsive coating could be designed and injected to reach the location of a leak where they react and produce mineral precipitates to decrease flow plattenberger et al 2020 flow reduction would be desirable if for example a leak occurred from a geologic co2 reservoir to explore the feasibility of targeted mineral precipitation technology the casio3 polymorphs wollastonite and pseudowollastonite were examined using reactive transport modeling for their ability to react with co2 and to reduce permeability in porous media ling et al 2021 the model found that at 150 c and 1 1 mpa co2 pseudowollastonite was more effective at sealing leakages by precipitating a thicker seal of calcite amorphous sio2 and the calcium silicate hydrate tobermorite in the region of co2 exposure in contrast wollastonite produced only a thin seal of calcite in the model the differences observed between the two polymorphs were caused by differing dissolution rates and mineral solubilities the model also examined the complex impacts of co2 solubility co2 pressure ph and temperature on producing desirable mineral precipitates for permeability reduction and extrapolated experimental conditions to more realistic field conditions for the subsurface simulations indicate that field conditions would produce favorable tobermorite and calcite precipitates that could effectively reduce permeability experiments conducted in sand columns with injected wollastonite and pseudowollastonite similarly highlighted the ability of pseudowollastonite to reduce permeability in porous media through the formation of caco3 siox and platelike crystalline calcium silicate phases plattenberger et al 2019 plattenberger et al 2018 dissolution experiments found that the plate like calcium silicate phases were more resistant to dissolution in acid than caco3 alone plattenberger et al 2018 to further understand targeted mineralization others have explored how mineralization in porous media affects the physical properties of a rock formation including its ability to fracture under stress menefee et al 2020 beyond using mineralization for the security of subsurface co2 the work examining calcium silicate reactivity with co2 has also led to studies examining calcium silicates for applications in producing low carbon cements plattenberger et al 2020 3 2 3 mineralization for coupled co2 sequestration and heavy metals removal recognizing that carbonate minerals are also known to coprecipitate with many environmentally relevant heavy metals and with growing interests in carbonate minerals for their suitability as sinks for co2 from the atmosphere recent works from dr peters group were inspired to bridge mineralization work on heavy metal removal with efforts and research output on co2 sequestration the mechanism of carbon mineralization in the form of carbonate minerals is outlined as one of six negative emission technologies in the national academies research agenda on negative emissions technologies published in 2019 national academies of sciences 2019 further carbonate minerals are appropriate host minerals for coprecipitation with trace elements due to their ability to incorporate multiple foreign elements into their crystal structures because industrial waste solutions are abundant in calcium they are an excellent option for coupling co2 sequestration with wastewater treatment through calcium carbonate mineralization in response to the call for advancing research into negative emission technologies and the need to treat contaminated wastewaters recent and ongoing works from dr peters group have advanced knowledge on calcium carbonate precipitation in the presence of trace elements including arsenic zinc copper cadmium chromium and barium hunter et al 2021 with an emphasis on mineral characterization using a suite of synchrotron imaging and microscopy techniques including nano xrf micro xrf and nano transmission x ray microscopy txm experimental systems involving carbonation of fly ash leachate or mining wastewaters were designed to simulate conditions relevant for calcium carbonate precipitation the overall extent of trace element uptake and distribution of trace elements within the crystals were quantified and characterized using synchrotron nano xrf capabilities hunter et al 2021 observed preferential incorporation of ions such as as and cr throughout most of the precipitated calcium carbonate particles while ions such as zn and cu co precipitated with iron coatings only on the particle edges rather than in the bulk calcium carbonate sem and txm based imaging captures the physical morphology and physical distributions of the trace elements in the precipitated caco3 phases fig 3 a d analysis of the aqueous phase revealed nearly complete 90 uptake of the trace element species from the solution via crystal incorporation or surface adsorption hunter et al 2021 kim et al 2021a kim et al 2021b results from these studies highlighted the potential of utilizing calcium carbonate precipitation to control fate and transport of heavy metals in our environment as the removal of trace ions through co precipitation is a kinetically dominated process predictions of trace element removal are often underestimated using thermodynamic models he et al 2014 hunter et al 2020 rosenberg et al 2014 weber et al 2018 work from dr peters group has highlighted this underestimation by thermodynamic models hunter et al 2020 and pointed out that the actual measurements of ion incorporation in a multi ion system were directly correlated to the solubility of an ion s metal carbonate phases hunter et al 2021 most recently the group is focusing on improving geochemical models of these controls on complex systems to make better predictions of multi ion incorporation during coprecipitation as well as the stability of these trace elements under various environmentally relevant conditions e g exposure to acidified solutions fig 3e beyond co precipitation work on carbonate dissolution precipitation reactions has been a prominent theme in the peters group efforts to better understand reaction mechanisms in the laboratory as illustrated in this section are complemented by studies that explore physical and chemical heterogeneities that can be expected in the field as detailed in the following sections these efforts inform and allow for upscaling connecting laboratory scale experiments to the field scale particularly in the context of geologic carbon sequestration 4 reactive transport modeling at the pore network scale and beyond the first research project on geological carbon sequestration in princeton kicked off around 2000 exploring ideas of safe storage of co2 in deep subsurface bruant et al 2002 one storage mechanism is mineral trapping the sequestration of co2 in the form of mineral precipitates via rock dissolution and re precipitation of carbonate giammar et al 2005 reaction thermodynamics and kinetics of these geochemical reactions are typically measured in well mixed reactors without considering mass transport limitations in this context an important question is how do natural system characteristics in particular chemical and physical heterogeneities influence rates of mineral dissolution and carbon mineralization efforts of answering this question resulted in papers that explored the use of pore scale network modeling to understand and quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneities and incomplete mixing on mineral co2 reaction rates at the pore network scale under conditions relevant to geological co2 sequestration pore scale network modeling was used to explore scaling effects on geochemical reaction rates li et al 2006 the transport and geochemical reactions anorthite dissolution and kaolinite precipitation were simulated in individual pores accounting for heterogeneities of both physical and mineral properties mass balance principles were then used to calculate reaction rates at the pore network aka continuum scale results showed that at high co2 concentrations reactions occurred rapidly such that concentrations of reactive species and reaction rates varied from pore to pore by orders of magnitude as a result the scaling effect i e the discrepancy in reaction rates in pores versus rates averaged over hundreds of pores continuum scale or pore network scale was significant at low co2 concentrations reactions occur much slower such that the scaling effects were relatively small meaning that rates at individual pores were similar to those at the pore network scale these results indicated that increased acidity and rapid mineral reactions associated with geological sequestration can generate conditions where it is important to consider the scaling effects the pore scale network model enables the representation of pore to pore heterogeneities in pore size and mineral reactivity at the pore network scale thereby quantifying the heterogeneity effects on network scale reaction rates li et al 2007b pore scale network models were constructed to represent sandstones with anorthite and kaolinite present in various amounts and in different spatial patterns fig 4 results showed that effects of spatial distribution were significant when small proportions of reactive minerals were distributed in largely non reactive sandstone and when reactive minerals were closely clustered and oriented parallel to the main flow direction conversely spatial distributions that maximized the rates of mass transport to and from reactive minerals such as small mineral clusters or reactive clusters oriented transverse to the main flow direction minimized the effects of heterogeneity similar conclusions have been made later when understanding rates of carbonate dissolution and bioremediation wen and li 2018 li et al 2011 li et al 2008 with the presence of spatial heterogeneity and incomplete mixing questions arise regarding the accuracy of field measurements of pore water chemistry li et al 2007a such measurements often average aqueous concentrations in many pores with high concentration gradients to answer these questions aqueous concentrations averaged over the entire pore network were used as mathematical analogs of field measured solute concentrations results showed that under conditions where incomplete mixing arose averaged concentrations and analogously field measured concentrations did not accurately reflect reaction progress over the length scale of several millimeters anorthite dissolution rates can be overestimated by a factor of three for kaolinite even the reaction direction cannot be correctly determined from the averaged concentration due to its highly nonlinear reaction rate law kaolinite precipitation occurred in individual pores whereas the averaged concentrations indicated that kaolinite should dissolve at the network scale the extent of error depends on the extent of incomplete mixing conditions that homogenize concentration fields such as small reactive mineral clusters abundant reactive minerals and very fast or very slow flow rates minimize errors introduced by averaging these results indicate that averaging of concentrations over a network may partly contribute to the often cited laboratory field rate discrepancy white and brantley 2003 and have important implications for interpreting field data these studies were among the first that used pore scale network modeling to explore reactive transport processes pore scale network modeling has traditionally been used to understand multiphase flow dynamics blunt et al 2002 these studies have inspired further reactive transport simulation work using pore scale network modeling to understand coupled hydrological and geochemical reactions in natural systems blunt et al 2013 an example is to understand and quantify carbonate reactions and the associated porosity and permeability evolution under high pressure co2 acidified conditions relevant to geological carbon sequestration kim et al 2011 nogues et al 2013 nogues et al 2013 showed that permeability increased extensively with carbonate dissolution however a far from equilibrium injection solution surprisingly produced less permeability change than a near to equilibrium solution at the same ph because ph buffering from increased carbonate ion concentration inhibited further reaction in addition it was observed that dissolution induced changes led to a small permeability reduction while small amounts of precipitation led to large changes in permeability broadly these studies were among the early works that explored the effects of spatial heterogeneities in regulating flow and biogeochemical reactions they have inspired later studies on the effects of physical and chemical heterogeneities at scales beyond the pore and pore network scales for a myriad of reactions and under a variety of conditions examples include carbonate and silicate dissolution within the pore scale li et al 2008 at the column centimeters scale li et al 2014a salehikhoo and li 2015 salehikhoo et al 2013 and at the meter scale atchley et al 2014 jung and navarre sitchler 2018 wen and li 2017 wen and li 2018 effects of spatial heterogeneities have also been explored for microbe mediated reactions such as sulfate and iron oxide reduction in the context of uranium bioremediation bao et al 2014 li et al 2011 li et al 2010 the impacts of mineral spatial heterogeneities on permeability evolution have seen sustained interest over the years beckingham 2017 bensinger and beckingham 2020 sabo and beckingham 2021 steinwinder and beckingham 2019 the theme of mineral heterogeneity carries on in and beyond the peters group and this is highlighted through studies of fractured media elaborated in the next section deng et al 2015 deng et al 2018a deng et al 2018b 5 fracture alteration triggered by geochemical reactions integrating physical chemical heterogeneity in investigations of subsurface or hydrological systems is particularly essential in fractures fractures are important features in rock materials as they serve as preferential pathways for fluid flow and mass transport bear 1993 berkowitz 2002 their presence typically controls the hydraulic properties of porous media and thus the long term security of caprocks in geologic carbon storage systems and the performance of various aquifers and reservoirs fracture properties evolve with local physical chemical conditions and therefore predictive understanding of how they respond to natural and anthropogenic perturbations is important in hydrological models fractures can be represented by an equivalent continuum approach a dual porosity permeability approach a dual multi continua approach or by a discrete fracture network deng and spycher 2019 doughty 1999 hyman et al 2015 long et al 1982 warren and root 1963 the permeability of fractures is typically estimated based on a power law relationship with respect to fracture aperture or volume which was developed for parallel fractures and is also known as the cubic law snow 1969 the evolution of fracture permeability due to chemical alteration is traditionally accounted for by using the same relationship but with changing porosity aperture or by using modified relationships based on studies of chemically simplified systems e g single mineral rock samples izgec et al 2010 szymczak and ladd 2009 dr peters group has added realism to the investigations by examining samples of complex mineralogy under conditions that are relevant to the deep subsurface environment 5 1 geochemical alteration of fractures ellis et al 2011 is the first of a sequence of studies from the peters group that demonstrated the complex dependence of fracture alteration on mineral composition the study was enabled by an experimental system that couples a high pressure core flooding apparatus and x ray ct imaging a fossiliferous carbonate core from the amherstburg formation was fractured and exposed to the flow of a co2 saturated brine with a ph of 4 4 under a confining pressure of 10 mpa the core is composed of approximately equal amounts of dolomite and calcite which account for 90 of the bulk and small amounts of quartz k feldspar and clay minerals the fracture geometries before and after reacting with the acidic brine were characterized using high resolution x ray ct images significant dissolution of calcite was observed leading to increases in fracture apertures however the fracture did not open uniformly and the non slow reacting mineral bands created comb tooth like structures in addition a microporous layer was observed on the fracture surface which as confirmed by the sem images is composed of dolomite and silicate rich minerals that remain after the preferential removal of calcite fig 5 the altered layer is an important feature that affects long term fracture evolution and has also been observed in several other fracture experimental studies deng et al 2016b noiriel and deng 2018 noiriel et al 2007 x ray ct images from the experiment were used in deng et al 2013 to quantify how these complex morphological features can impact the hydrodynamic properties of the fracture unstructured tetrahedral meshes were generated from the fracture geometries before and after reactions and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were performed to calculate the hydraulic aperture b h which is related to fracture permeability by the cubic law the study showed that b h is smaller than the geometric aperture b g and that the difference is larger for the post reaction fracture the ratio of b h b g is approximately 0 7 for the pre reaction fracture and is reduced to approximately 0 45 after the reaction this decrease is a result of the increase in surface roughness caused by both the comb tooth like structures and the altered layer by devising a ternary segmentation method the authors were able to separate the altered layer from the intact matrix it was shown that the altered layer even though it accounts for less than 15 of the fracture volume covers 70 of the fracture surface unevenly and thus further increases fracture surface roughness this means that the widely used power law relationship between fracture volume aperture and fracture permeability will no longer apply the increase of the fracture permeability caused by calcite dissolution is mitigated by the complex morphological changes that arise from mineral compositional heterogeneity in addition to affecting surface roughness the altered layer can also influence the fracture permeability by particle mobilization and clogging in an experimental study using the same rock sample under similar conditions as ellis et al 2011 ellis et al 2013 observed substantial calcite dissolution but with permeability reduction microbeam ca k edge xanes x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra were collected in locations where fracture closure was observed and the data confirmed that the closing was not caused by secondary precipitation but rather was a result of the deposition of particles dislodged from the upstream altered layer it was later shown by another study that particle disaggregation and detachment from the altered layer depend on the abundance of the fast reacting minerals in the rocks and the porosity of the altered layer deng et al 2017 the altered layer arising from complex mineral composition can also have important impacts on subsequent chemical evolution in the work of deng et al 2020 a novel microfluidic experimental system fabricated using a carbonate rich eagle ford shale was coupled with synchrotron based spectroscopic characterization techniques as such more detailed characterization of the textural and mineralogical changes in the altered layer was made possible the study showed that the altered layer grows at a decreasing rate because the dissolution of the fast reacting calcite was increasingly limited this is because the altered layer undergoes an armoring effect strongly limiting diffusion and preventing continued calcite dissolution furthermore xrf and xanes data revealed co existence of as and fe bearing minerals which remained in the altered layer but became more exposed as confirmed by the increased surface area in the altered layer measured from the x ray ct images therefore the chemical evolution not only will affect long term alteration of the fractures but also mobilization and migration of toxic metals while the altered layer is caused by mineral compositional heterogeneity features such as the comb tooth like structures observed in ellis et al 2011 are primarily controlled by mineral spatial heterogeneity using a 2d reactive transport model deng and peters 2019 systematically investigated the impacts of mineral spatial distribution on the evolution of fracture hydraulic properties the 2d reactive transport model was developed and benchmarked based on a fracture flow experimental study of a homogeneous limestone deng et al 2015 the experimental study highlighted the impacts of fluid chemistry on channelization in fractures which typically results in disproportionately fast increase in fracture permeability for a given fracture volume increase the b h b g ratio is larger than one when channelization develops in fractures whereas the b h b g ratio is below one when surface roughness increases as discussed above the modeling investigation showed that channelization can be promoted or suppressed depending on the spatial distribution of the reactive mineral specifically when the reactive mineral is connected and in sync with the favored flow path for the given geometry channelization is promoted and fracture permeability increases rapidly fig 6 a b otherwise channelization that would be expected based on the geometry alone will not develop in another study deng et al 2018b showed that the formation of the porous altered layer can also shift the flow conditions under which channelization would form for a given fracture geometry 5 2 fracture alteration under coupled chemical mechanical controls in the experimental study of ellis et al 2013 the post reaction x ray ct images showed dissolution of asperities which could also lead to fracture closure and permeability reduction however as the x ray ct images were not taken under confining pressure the interactions between chemical and mechanical processes could not be studied conclusively in order to investigate fracture alteration under confining stress spokas et al 2018 coupled the reactive transport model from deng and peters 2019 with a mechanical model and performed simulations with different abundances and spatial distributions of the reactive mineral it showed that while the abundance of the reactive mineral has an impact on fracture permeability initially by affecting fluid reactivity downstream the trajectories of fracture permeability are mostly controlled by mineral spatial distributions for a nodular spatial pattern asperities that remain can keep the fracture open while dissolution continues to enlarge flow pathways and thus increase permeability in contrast for a banded spatial pattern because any channelization would be suppressed the increase in fracture permeability from dissolution is dampened fig 6c in a homogeneous rock the increase in fracture permeability from dissolution is limited as the fracture is compressed under normal stress when the asperities are dissolved the experimental work of spokas et al 2019 further investigated the geomechanical changes triggered by chemical alteration of fractures in the experimental study fractured eagle ford shale cores were exposed to an acidic and neutral flow and then subjected to compression and shearing a porous altered layer was observed on the fracture surface in the acidic flow experiment fig 7 a after compression and shearing the altered layer collapsed fig 7b and the produced particles remained in the fracture resulting in fracture permeabilities that are one to two orders of magnitude lower than the post compression fracture permeabilities in the neutral flow experiment this layer of fine particles can also prevent the formation of interlocking asperities and therefore reduce the friction strength consequently it is likely that the risk of a slip event increases this comparative experimental study provides valuable insights into how chemical alteration features that arise from mineral heterogeneity can impact fracture mechanical strength collectively the experimental and modeling studies in this subsection demonstrate how mineral composition and spatial distribution can impact fracture morphology and the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the fractures they underscore the need to account for these factors in developing generalized rules for describing fracture evolution e g the cubic law for fracture permeability 6 mentorship to date dr peters has mentored more than fifty undergraduate students 5 master students 13 phd students and 7 postdocs through her teaching research advising and mentorship infused with passion care fairness and inspiration her commitment has had a profound impact on many of her students dr peters often goes out of her way to support her mentees for example the graduate course modeling of geochemical kinetics and reactive transport now regularly offered was first offered to a single student such that the student could meet the course requirement in preparation for the general examination otherwise known as the phd qualifying exam in many universities a certain number of major courses need to be taken in the first two years at princeton when planned courses are not offered for unexpected reasons the impacts can be devastating to a student dr peters however ensured no student was negatively affected by such situation by tailoring a specialized course in the case of this student dr peters leads a dynamic research team which provides opportunities for every member to grow for example she welcomes and supports undergraduate students to gain hands on experience in the laboratory one of her senior thesis supervisees prof benjamin runkle now at the university of arkansas reflected on his experience and commented i remember how well she welcomed me into her group letting me attend group meetings and journal article discussions encouraging me in the lab even to do the most basic tasks we studied biofilm growth together and she gave such encouragement about navigating the ups and downs of science her feedback on my thesis was insightful and it was even given a departmental prize oftentimes dr peters asks graduate students to explain basic concepts when undergraduate students without background knowledge are present at group meetings this ensures productivity and engagement from the undergraduates while also giving graduate students the opportunity to teach while encouraging this mentoring opportunity within group and internal and external collaborative research she makes certain that her mentees reach out to her when feeling uncomfortable in the process and assures them that it is the advisor s duty to watch out for their interests dr peters is dedicated to the resolution of water and energy challenges and adopts an interdisciplinary approach in solving these challenges in her research also while based in the department of civil and environmental engineering cee she has integrated the importance of taking on the water and energy challenges with an interdisciplinary approach in her teaching dr peters leads by example and her impact has carried over to the succeeding generation of professors prof peter nelson now at the colorado state university took dr peters introduction to environmental engineering and decided to major in cee from this course he commented now that i am a faculty member in a civil and environmental engineering department myself i make it a priority to expose high school students and early undergraduates to the water side of cee so that they may be aware of the great opportunities in the field another project that exemplified dr peters dedication to the field and mentorship was during the time following the catastrophic earthquake in haiti which occurred in 2010 in response to the disaster she led multidisciplinary student teams to develop disaster relief technologies that would provide clean drinking water and electricity her power in a box team designed and constructed a portable 5 kw wind turbine in a shipping container for deployment to off the grid communities and this project won a prestigious award from the u s epa p3 student competition in sustainable design in 2012 one mentee reflected that one important role of the mentor is to light the way this is exactly what dr peters has been practicing in her mentorship and such approach to her advising illuminates different possibilities for her mentees and helps them to pursue a path of their choosing 7 concluding remarks in this highlights paper we reviewed a collection of studies from dr peters group that showcase her contributions in bridging environmental geochemistry and hydrology her research program spans and couples the fields of hydrology geochemistry and beyond crossing areas of expertise necessary for addressing current and important scientific and practical challenges via a suite of characterization experimental and modeling methods the peters group has advanced understanding of complex biogeochemical conditions and their impacts on the evolution of fractured porous media particularly of their hydraulic properties the findings provide the basis for developing predictive capabilities regarding fluid rock interactions the resulting migration of fluids and the associated hydrogeochemical processes these predictive capabilities are critical for a scientific understanding of earth s critical zone li et al 2017 and the sustainable use of subsurface energy systems deng et al 2021 the co evolution of research objectives and cutting edge methodology developments to target complex questions in hydrology and biogeochemistry highlight the power of combining tools and knowledge across disciplines to solve difficult environmental problems in addition to contributing new knowledge and tools for addressing traditional and emerging challenges in the field of hydrology dr peters impacts are amplified through her mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students many of which are the next generation of researchers and mentors working on tackling various aspects of today s challenges 8 bios reflections 8 1 hang deng hang is an assistant professor in the department of

mentorship continued after my graduation in addition to research she has been very supportive and encouraging of my involvement in various professional services and in diversity equity and inclusion efforts i feel comfortable approaching her with my questions problems regarding career and personal development as i know i can always count on her for guidance and support she is very generous in sharing her stories and providing advice her experiences as the only female faculty in the department when she first started at princeton and now as the first female chair in the department are not only inspirational but also help me put things into perspective i find myself more appreciative of the progress that their generations have led more aware of the challenges that remain and more confident that i will be able to make a difference as well she is such a good role model in every aspect she is willing to step out of her comfort zone when developing her research program is dedicated to her family and takes on teaching advising and mentoring as a very serious responsibility and a privilege she once said to me that being able to work with students is like being given a gift this is something that i will hold dear to my heart as i take on the role of professor myself 8 2 li li li li is the barry and shirley isett professor in civil and environmental engineering at penn state university university park she was in peters group pursuing a doctoral degree in environmental engineering and water resources from 1999 to 2005 she later worked at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory as a postdoc and as a research scientist before joining the faculty at penn state in 2009 her groupasks questions on how changing climate and human activities regulate water flow biogeochemical processes and water quality under diverse climate geology and land use conditions i grew up academically as an environmental chemist with bachelor s and master s degrees in environmental chemistry before joining the peters group i was expected to continue along this path during my phd possibly adding some microbiology insights when quantifying biodegradation rates of organic contaminants somewhat akin to kris wammer s in my second year in graduate school i took a class on numerical methods a topic that i was exposed to for the first time i was fascinated by the magical power of coding feeding them equations and numbers and they would spit out numbers forecasting the temporal and spatial trajectory of anything numerical modeling however was not peters expertise at that time what should i do to reconcile the two my fascination for a completely different research trajectory and my loyalty to my advisor and phd project as an international student i could suffer from substantial financial consequence if i lose peters support can i tell her how should i tell her a couple of agonizing months quickly flew by i finally decided to talk to catherine i remember the sunlight brightly glancing through her office windows shining so happilyit almost stung i heard myself babbling telling her the change of my heart and that i prefer not to continue biodegradation project i apologized for disappointing her and then i stopped without any idea of what was going to happen next the air felt stagnant as iftime stopped she did not say anything for a while probably still sinking in the news the silence feltlike a century then i saw a smilespreadingon her face she seemed almost amused why are you so nervous lili she asked i worry that i will disappoint and upset you and you will kick me out of your group her smile grew bigger this comes as a surprise for sure but i am happy for you you figured out what excites you obviously you will need to change your project but we can figure something out she said many people do not know what excites them you are fortunate to figure that out don t you think that is great really yes we can work something out she patted on my shoulder my heart lightened as if a heavy mountain was lifted inmeetings that followed we planned how to move forward bringing in my numerical methods professor as a co advisor at that moment i did not realize how empowering she and that conversation have been she taught me to go after my passion there will be a way even it appearsthousands of miles away that idea has very much emboldened me and shaped my academic career later since then my research topics have evolved jumping between distant topics that require learning new ideas concepts and approaches but i always know that there is a way to get there even if i cannot see it right away in the back of my mind peters smiles at me beaming with pride as i make every jump 8 3 julie j kim julie kim is currently a ph d candidate in the department of civil and environmental engineering at princeton university she joined professor peters group in 2017 after receiving her bachelor s degree in civil and environmental engineering from carnegie mellon university where dr peters also received her ph d degree professor peters dedication to the success of each of her students and her commitment to providing the right balance of guidance and flexibility are just a few of the things that make her a respectable advisor what makes catherine so knowledgeable and up to date on her students work comes from her efforts to be actively involved and hand on with students experiments as an example catherine makes every effort to travel with students to the multi day synchrotron experiments and braces through the multiple late night experiments together she provides support before and during such experiments but allows students to lead synchrotron experiments which is an invaluable experience for graduate students like myself catherine is a mentor who genuinely cares about the success of her students and our future endeavors her advice on how to prepare for a career after graduate school but more importantly the training on academic professionalism and a constant reminder to put our engineering hats on to not forget the environmental motivation behind our work are just the few things that make her an admirable mentor professor peters is a role model to many of her students including myself for her leadership dedication to teaching research and family and for her successful career as a woman in engineering 8 4 florence t ling flo ling earned a ph d in geosciences at pennsylvania state university in 2016 after which she worked with dr peters as a postdoctoral research associate at princeton university she is now an assistant professor of environmental science at la salle university conducting research on environmental mineralogy and geochemistry i have truly valued the mentorship that dr peters provided catherine s achievements as a ground breaking woman in science and as the first female chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering at princeton has been an inspiration for female leaders in stem i have always appreciated her open ness in talking about the challenges of balancing work and family and the struggles that she encountered during her career a valued piece of scientific advice that i received from her was the push to be bold be brave the philosophy was not something i had previously considered imbuing into my scientific work but it has helped me grow in my confidence to pursue new research projects with a lessened fear of failure 8 5 lauren e beckingham lauren e beckingham is an assistant professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at auburn university after finishing her b s in environmental engineering at michigan technological university in 2007 she joined the peters group at princeton university where she completed her ph d in 2012 she was then a geochemical postdoctoral fellow at lawrence berkeley national laboratory 2012 2015 before joining auburn university in 2016 her expertise and interests are in understanding water rock interactions in environmental systems particularly in subsurface energy systems including geologic co2 sequestration and compressed energy storage if you have met catherine you undoubtedly noticed her friendly open demeanor and intellectually creative spirit as evident by the author group here as well as many others catherine is inspirational where many of her former students have followed academic pursuits with their own desires to further inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers catherine s academic family often goes beyond the bounds of the e quad where she strives to get to know her students as scientists and people i ve often reflected on the quote how you spend your days is how you spend your life catherine is a superb example that while not easy it is feasible to be an excellent educator leader and top tier researcher while maintaining apersonal life where you spend time with family and even learn something new like how to play the piano 8 6 kristine h wammer kris wammer is associate dean of research and interdisciplinary programs in the college of arts sciences and a professor of chemistry at the university of st thomas after completing her b a in chemistry at st olaf college in 1997 she joined the peters group at princeton and earned her ph d in 2003 she then completed a dreyfus environmental chemistry postdoctoral fellowship at the university of minnesota prior to joining the faculty at st thomas in 2005 her research group studies the fate and transformation of biologically active contaminants in aquatic systems with a particular focus on aquatic photochemistry she considers catherine her first and best role model for believing it is possible to effectively balance administrative work a research lab and a family and personal life i joined catherine s group in 1997 when she was about half of the way towards tenure the group was small at the time consisting of me a master student and a more senior phd student the story that comes to mind most readily when i think of catherine s guidance and mentorship is from 2001 when i found out i was pregnant with my first child at the time i was methodically working through a series of pah biodegradation experiments which required long sometimes overnight stays in the lab to perform we kept a little cot under one of the lab bench cutouts to allow me to get some rest between collecting data points i told catherine about my pregnancy almost immediately i think she was second to know after my husband because i knew we would need to take a look at safety concerns catherine was thrilled for me i remember her telling me that because she had known so many women who waited to have children and then struggled with fertility that she had wanted to encourage me to consider having children during graduate school if that was my desire i remember her support feeling like such a relief i was nervous about the logistics of how i was going to pull off keeping up with an intense experimental schedule while pregnant but knowing that she would be understanding and help support my success was huge because it was so early in the pregnancy i didn t want to tell too many people so i remember having a meeting with the environmental health and safety officer catherine and one other female phd student li li the ehs officer had gone through the list of compounds with which i worked and we came up with a game plan for what it was safe for me to do and what i d need to avoid and ask for help with i m so grateful for the support my last set of that particular series of experiments wrapped up in september 2001 and i gave birth to a healthy baby girl in november at the time there were no systems in place to accommodate pregnant graduate students the official policy was that i should go on unpaid leave but that would also mean losing my health insurance as a result officially i took no time off i read papers and wrote from home when i could but stayed away from the lab for several weeks while i recovered from giving birth and learned how to be a new mother without such a supportive and understanding mentor i can easily imagine that i might have had to drop out and not finish my phd i wonder how many stories similar to mine from that era and earlier did not have a happy ending due to a different mentorship experience author

undergraduate students with her kindness encouragement and confidence in them these students are now at different stages of their scientific careers and are following her steps in nurturing the next generation of scientists with diverse backgrounds in various types of institutions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction dr catherine a peters research has been guided by the overarching goal of bridging environmental geochemistry and hydrology it has evolved over her career meeting the demand of emerging research topics and directions hydrology has traditionally been the science of water quantity and availability and has gradually evolved to become a highly interdisciplinary earth and environmental science crossing engineering chemistry physics and geosciences clifford 2002 sivapalan 2018 the chemical aspects of hydrology have historically included topics such as groundwater quality and acid mine drainage kirchner 2003 nordstrom et al 2015 however emerging research topics call for meaningful integration of bio geochemistry hydrology and other related disciplines kite and melwani daswani 2019 li 2019 paola et al 2006 strydom et al 2019 vonk et al 2019 this has led to the development of one important branch of hydrology hydrobiogeochemistry valenzuela diaz et al 2020 wang et al 2015 furthermore along with the growing importance of the water energy food nexus cai et al 2018 scanlon et al 2017 the field of hydrology has broadened its foci taking journal of hydrology as an example an increasing body of articles has been published on subsurface energy systems akstinat 2019 burg and gersman 2016 wolff boenisch and evans 2014 and on complex processes in pores and fractures gharedaghloo et al 2018 kang et al 2014 li et al 2014b sadhukhan et al 2014 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 dr peters work has mostly revolved around two major themes the transport and fate of contaminants and subsurface energy and resources systems both topics require an understanding of the intricate interactions of fluids chemicals and porous media soils rocks under a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions one important feature of dr peters work is recognizing and respecting the complexity of those systems in her early work she focused on chemical mixtures and their biodegradation in the environment while her more recent work has focused on chemical physical heterogeneity in rock materials other important signatures of dr peters research include the utilization of a constellation of tools to provide cutting edge characterizations of rock materials using spectroscopic imaging and microscopic techniques experimental work under high pressure and high temperature conditions and reactive transport modeling the peters group is among the first to couple a high pressure high temperature core flooding experimental apparatus with high resolution x ray computed tomography x ray ct ellis et al 2013 ellis et al 2011 in real time deng et al 2015 the group also developed image processing methods to extract morphological and mineralogical information from x ray ct images deng et al 2013 deng et al 2016a ellis and peters 2016 and applied microscopic and synchrotron based spectroscopic techniques to open up new possibilities of examining the complexity of real rock materials crandell et al 2012 kim et al 2021a kim et al 2022 peters 2009 another example is the in operando experiments leveraging these techniques in real rock based microfluidic systems deng et al 2020 these efforts have pushed the boundaries of experimental systems in the pursuit of unraveling reactive transport processes in rock materials equally important is the use of reactive transport models to investigate the impacts of morphological and mineralogical heterogeneity on the evolution of porous and fractured media deng and peters 2019 li et al 2006 li et al 2007b nogues et al 2013 spokas et al 2018 in this review we highlight select research topics from dr peters research group that showcase her contributions in bridging environmental geochemistry and hydrology we start with a summary of the work on characterization of geological materials section 2 followed by experimental investigations of biogeochemical reactions section 3 we also summarize some major findings from work by the peters group on pore network reactive transport modeling and upscaling of reaction rates section 4 and on fracture alteration using the integrated characterization experimental and modeling approach section 5 we end this review article with mentorship stories and reflections section 6 and a few concluding remarks section 7 2 mineral characterization imaging and quantitative image analyses have emerged as powerful means of characterizing porous media samples to determine mineralogy and details beyond those available from traditional bulk sample laboratory techniques seminal work in this area from the peters group demonstrated the utility of both 2d and 3d laboratory and synchrotron imaging to characterize reactive properties of porous and consolidated geologic media this includes 2d scanning electron microscopy sem 3d x ray computed tomography x ray ct imaging and synchrotron x ray fluorescence xrf microscopy as detailed in the next sections and highlighted in fig 1 2 1 mineral characterization using sem imaging the utility of sem imaging to provide details on mineral distribution and implications for reactivity was first explored in peters 2009 sem backscattered electron bse and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds images of sandstone thin sections were collected and analyzed to determine the mineralogy and statistical distribution of minerals with respect to the pore space in sem bse images the amount of electron backscatter depends on the mean atomic number of the material allowing a relative identification of minerals more precise mineral identification is facilitated through integration of eds analysis which provides elemental information peters 2009 developed an automated segmentation algorithm to classify the pixels in the bse images into four categories pores minerals with mean atomic number less than quartz e g mg chlorite kaolinite montmorillonite albite quartz and minerals with mean atomic number greater than quartz e g k feldspar apatite calcite titanium dioxide pyrite etc a threshold optimization algorithm identifies the inflection point of overlapping grayscale intensity distributions for each category and the optimum threshold value is chosen by minimizing the sum of the normalized differentials between pixel categories this segmentation approach reliably generates reproducible segmentation results fig 1a once segmented mineral maps were analyzed to consider mineral abundances volume fractions and the distribution of mineral phases with respect to the pore space notably novel quantification of the accessibility of mineral phases defined as those adjacent to the pore space were generated large discrepancies between mineral abundances and mineral accessibilities were observed high atomic number mineral phases present in moderate volume fractions 1 6 in the considered sandstone samples had consistently low accessibilities conversely low atomic number mineral phases largely kaolinite in the considered samples had much higher accessibility than abundance these phases were largely present as grain coatings on quartz and other minerals this observation has important implications for assessing the reactivity of porous media where reactivity may be over or under estimated based on volume fractions alone these initial analyses of mineral accessibility inspired efforts beyond the peters group on quantifying mineral accessibility and accessible surface areas beckingham et al 2017 kareem et al 2017 lai et al 2015 landrot et al 2012 ma et al 2021 qin and beckingham 2019 dr peters group has also leveraged 2d sem imaging to understand reaction induced changes in porous media with the aim of ultimately improving understanding of permeability evolution crandell et al 2012 here the pore structure of mineral dissolution precipitation experiments in the context of the hanford wa site was preserved by flowing a low viscosity epoxy through the column after experiments concluded thin sections were then created along the length of the column and analyzed via 2d sem bse and eds imaging images revealed uniform coatings of secondary zeolite mineral precipitates on all grain surfaces fig 1b an image erosion dilation approach with a sample specific bias correction factor was developed to quantify pore and pore throat size distributions from 2d images fig 1b changes in the pore structure due to secondary mineral precipitation were determined by using this approach to analyze the pore structure of the reacted sample in addition to a set of images with the secondary minerals digitally removed this analysis revealed that while secondary minerals occurred as a uniform coating on all grain surfaces this resulted in non uniform variations in the pore network structure where some small pore throats were removed due to clogging 2 2 mineral characterization using 3d x ray ct imaging the increase in the capability and availability of laboratory x ray ct instrumentation has expanded the use of 3d x ray ct imaging for reactive porous medium systems in these systems an x ray beam passes through the sample and the resulting grayscale images reflect variations in x ray attenuation of the material precise mineral identification is not feasible from attenuation data alone where several minerals have similar x ray attenuation coefficients by combining x ray ct imaging with 2d sem bse and eds imaging however important reactive mineral phases may be identifiable as illustrated in ellis and peters 2016 in the study of ellis and peters 2016 a method was developed to segment calcite an important reactive mineral in systems such as geologic co2 sequestration in 3d x ray ct images of a carbonate rich caprock specimen after 3d x ray ct imaging the sample was sectioned and prepared for imaging with 2d sem bse and eds calcite pixels in sem images were identified based on bse grayscale intensity and the elemental eds maps the processed 2d mineral map was then registered with the 3d x ray ct image and the corresponding calcite area in the slice of the x ray ct image was labeled fig 1c the average grayscale intensity for calcite was then quantified and utilized to identify calcite throughout the 3d x ray ct image the resulting processed 3d image was used to consider fracture reactivity in the context of geologic co2 sequestration for different 2d cross sections extracted from the processed image simulations revealed that accounting for calcite distribution along a fracture is critical for predicting reaction induced fracture permeability evolution deng and peters 2019 spokas et al 2018 coupling of 2d sem imaging with 3d x ray ct imaging for mineral identification was adopted in work beyond the peters group toward understanding fracture evolution in basalts menefee et al 2017 and inspired subsequent machine learning based approaches asadi and beckingham 2021 guntoro et al 2019 kim 2021a 2 3 mineral characterization using synchrotron xrf and applications of machine learning applications of synchrotron techniques to characterize various features of geologic media are increasing with improved capabilities and availability to researchers most notably the technique of synchrotron micro xrf is a powerful tool for the characterization of elements at environmentally relevant scales in these systems two dimensional mapping of elements is possible by placing samples on rastering stages and measuring the intensities of fluorescence x rays generated from momentary displacement of electrons as materials are excited by incident x rays many recent advancements to synchrotron facilities allow for coupled data acquisition such as simultaneous measurements of fluoresced x rays and diffracted x rays lanzirotti et al 2016 sutton et al 2017 while the technique of xrf alone cannot identify mineral phases recent work from the peters group presents a method of coupling xrf data with x ray diffraction xrd data and utilizes machine learning to draw out not only recognizable but also unapparent relationships between element composition embedded in xrf data and mineral content embedded in xrd data kim et al 2021a the coupled xrf xrd methodology is referred to as the synchrotron based machine learning approach for raster smart mapping which is a classifier that can characterize rock samples for their mineral content including a suite of carbonate e g calcite aragonite dolomite sulfide e g pyrite pyrrhotite oxide e g pyrolusite and silicate e g quartz minerals kim et al 2021a fig 1d for a mineral phase to be identifiable and labelled by the smart classifier data including coupled xrf intensities and xrd based mineral labels were first generated and then inputted into a machine learning algorithm referred to as a neural network for training purposes once trained a mineral phase could be labelled from any micro xrf dataset without the need for additional xrd analyses which is time consuming in terms of the data collection and interpretation advancements made in this work help address the limitations of conventional methodologies of mineral characterization such as the need for sample destruction the dependence on elemental ratios or the lack of spatial resolution to resolve nano and micro scale features furthermore the ability to generate millimeter scale mineral maps that can capture multi mineral presence for each pixel revealed many new opportunities for mineral reactivity characterization including accurate quantifications of mineral abundances not limited by single mineral presence per pixel quantifications of grain sizes and identification of host minerals of trace elements and their quantities utilizing complementary element maps kim et al 2022 characterizations of various consolidated shale rock samples at micrometers led to a new approach of quantifying mineral accessibility and this is presented in kim et al 2022 this new method allows for estimation of mineral accessibility as a function of surrounding reactive mineralogy the surrounding reactive mineralogy may dissolve away and expose the embedded phase rather than allowing only mineral accessibility via pore spaces the methodology was applied to analyze the accessibility of reactive fluids to pyrite grains embedded within the carbonate and silicate matrices of the eagle ford shale locating pyrite grains and quantifying their accessibility is important because of their elementally heterogeneous and toxic nature and on the basis that carbonate minerals are especially soluble in acidified fluids kreisserman and emmanuel 2018 zhang et al 2017 in the eagle ford shale sample analyzed pyrite was found to be mostly embedded in a relatively insoluble quartz phase however dissolution of reactive mineral phases can create new conduits for flow dynamically changing the degree of accessibility to initially inaccessible mineral phases deng et al 2020 such scenarios would be relevant in systems like geologic co2 sequestration where injected solutions often induce alterations to contacting mineralogy due to its reactivity and this concept is and has been constantly recognized throughout the works of the peters group 3 experimental studies of biogeochemical reactions the development of new mineral characterization techniques was conducted alongside research on organic and inorganic biogeochemical contaminants experiments examining contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals and co2 were coupled with geochemical modeling to better assess the fate and transport of these contaminants and to understand their stability after treatment with different remediation methods the general strategy of using theory based modeling to complement experimental work to gain mechanistic insight has continued to be a hallmark of dr peters work the coupling of experiments and modeling has also allowed predictions to be made at longer timescales than experimentally possible and with changes in temperature pressure and chemical conditions these capabilities are critical for optimizing contaminant treatment methods and for identifying research gaps that need to be bridged to more accurately model biogeochemical reactions in the environment across scales 3 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bioavailability and biodegradation early research in dr peters group focused on transport and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs via coupled laboratory experiments with mathematical modeling inspired by some of dr peters doctoral at carnegie mellon e g peters and luthy 1993 and peters and luthy 1994 and postdoctoral work at the university of michigan e g mukherji et al 1997 the peters group explored the phase behavior of coal tar dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls found at former manufactured gas plant sites which are mixtures of hundreds of compounds primarily pahs most pahs are solids in their pure form making it necessary to quantify the relationship between napl composition and liquid phase stability in order to effectively perform risk assessment and predict the effectiveness of potential remediation techniques including the use of surfactants key contributions of the work included quantifying how shifts in multicomponent napl composition e g as more soluble pahs dissolve into aqueous phases impact napl stability and determining the cases in which ideal solubility theory is inadequate for predicting pah napl phase stability the insight gained concerning the behavior of pahs in mixtures has had important implications for understanding pah solubility and bioavailability these efforts were the first steps toward quantifying the most significant factors that ultimately determine pah biodegradation rates guha et al 1998 peters et al 1999 peters et al 1997 peters et al 2000 the biodegradation of pahs was further examined with the goal of quantifying biodegradation kinetics previously it had been established that an inverse relationship is typically observed between pah molecular weight and the biodegradation rate in environmental systems coupling monod biodegradation kinetic modeling with experiments and careful considerations of which simplifying assumptions are acceptable vs which should not be made the peters group showed that the observed variation in rates was mostly associated with bioavailability in subsurface environments where dnapls are typically found the phase behavior and subsequent impacts on bioavailability proved critical for overall observed pah transformation rates guha et al 1999 knightes and peters 2003 knightes and peters 2006 once these effects were quantified and models refined the molecular structure and biodegradation rate relationships were quantified independent of bioavailability constraints in this case the inverse relationship between molecular weight and biodegradation rate is not observed key considerations instead include molecular shape and the number and position of alkyl substituents in the absence of bioavailability constraints the rate limiting factor for pah biodegradation is how well the pah molecule is able to fit into the bacterial enzyme active site in the correct position wammer and peters 2005 wammer and peters 2006 this work enabled biodegradation kinetic parameters to be predicted with improved accuracy which would not have been possible without systematically quantifying and explaining all the other factors influencing observed pah transformation rates 3 2 mineralization 3 2 1 mineralization for heavy metals removal in addition to understanding the biodegradation of organic pahs in the environment dr peters group also worked towards understanding the fate and transport of heavy metals heavy metals are highly toxic non biodegradable substances that tend to bioaccumulate in organisms these concerns have led to the development of technologies that can remove heavy metals from and or stabilize heavy metals in contaminated waters and soils ranging from precipitation processes and membrane filtration to ion exchange and adsorption fu and wang 2011 the peters group has conducted work specifically on understanding mineralization and coprecipitation processes that can cost effectively remove heavy metal ions the use of na2so4 for example to induce co precipitation and form minerals such as barite baso4 can be an efficient and affordable method of heavy metal removal from contaminated waters the low solubility of barite its long term stability and the fast kinetics of precipitation that can lead to higher incorporation of trace elements makes barite an ideal candidate for co precipitation treatments barite co precipitation has been used for the removal of heavy metals from waters produced by oil and gas operations he et al 2014 the stabilization of radioactive contaminants in nuclear wastes tokunaga et al 2018 vinograd et al 2018 and the removal of metals from mining wastewater kondash et al 2014 ma et al 2017 weber et al 2021 advances in mineral characterization have also pushed the boundaries for examining co precipitation processes across scales ling et al 2018 experiments were performed to examine the co precipitation of haso4 2 or sr2 in baso4 at low 0 003 m nacl and high salinities 1 0 m nacl directly from aqueous solutions solutions containing bacl2 nacl and trace na2haso4 or srcl2 were directly mixed with na2so4 to precipitate baso4 interestingly high salinities produced nano scale compositional zoning with local enrichment of sr or as as confirmed by the synchrotron nano xrf maps fig 2 the observation of enriched sr or as zones indicated that during particle growth a more optimal solution condition exists that may yield increased removal of trace hazardous ions from solution the ability to identify these optimized solution conditions has far reaching implications for water treatment methods that use co precipitation using nano xrf in conjunction with other bulk techniques for solid and solution analyses hunter et al 2020 suggested that sr incorporation into baso4 could be improved by increasing the addition of sulfate increasing the barite saturation index to be 3 or by establishing an increased sr ba ratio however experiments at a barite saturation index of 2 34 showed zones of enriched sr along with a greater diversity in particle sizes ranging from 2 to 10 µm fig 2b the results point to a need to understand relationships between particle size range the number of particles forming and how these variables affect incorporation and distribution of sr into the solid phase during co precipitation which can then be used to help optimize trace element removal further work on relating co precipitation with classical nucleation theory has provided further insight on different controls on co precipitation kinetics poonoosamy et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 the ability to use nano xrf to assess solution conditions for contaminant removal during co precipitation will inform future models to better predict kinetically controlled co precipitation these advances will help develop more tailored efficient and cost effective water treatment methods that incorporate targeted optimal solution conditions for increased contaminant removal during co precipitation 3 2 2 mineralization for the security of subsurface co2 dr peters interests in mineralization have also fused with her work on safely securing subsurface co2 which will be further discussed in the next section after extensive work understanding mineral dissolution and flow in the subsurface the peters group began exploring how targeted mineral precipitation could be used to decrease flow in porous media in targeted mineral precipitation particles with a temperature responsive coating could be designed and injected to reach the location of a leak where they react and produce mineral precipitates to decrease flow plattenberger et al 2020 flow reduction would be desirable if for example a leak occurred from a geologic co2 reservoir to explore the feasibility of targeted mineral precipitation technology the casio3 polymorphs wollastonite and pseudowollastonite were examined using reactive transport modeling for their ability to react with co2 and to reduce permeability in porous media ling et al 2021 the model found that at 150 c and 1 1 mpa co2 pseudowollastonite was more effective at sealing leakages by precipitating a thicker seal of calcite amorphous sio2 and the calcium silicate hydrate tobermorite in the region of co2 exposure in contrast wollastonite produced only a thin seal of calcite in the model the differences observed between the two polymorphs were caused by differing dissolution rates and mineral solubilities the model also examined the complex impacts of co2 solubility co2 pressure ph and temperature on producing desirable mineral precipitates for permeability reduction and extrapolated experimental conditions to more realistic field conditions for the subsurface simulations indicate that field conditions would produce favorable tobermorite and calcite precipitates that could effectively reduce permeability experiments conducted in sand columns with injected wollastonite and pseudowollastonite similarly highlighted the ability of pseudowollastonite to reduce permeability in porous media through the formation of caco3 siox and platelike crystalline calcium silicate phases plattenberger et al 2019 plattenberger et al 2018 dissolution experiments found that the plate like calcium silicate phases were more resistant to dissolution in acid than caco3 alone plattenberger et al 2018 to further understand targeted mineralization others have explored how mineralization in porous media affects the physical properties of a rock formation including its ability to fracture under stress menefee et al 2020 beyond using mineralization for the security of subsurface co2 the work examining calcium silicate reactivity with co2 has also led to studies examining calcium silicates for applications in producing low carbon cements plattenberger et al 2020 3 2 3 mineralization for coupled co2 sequestration and heavy metals removal recognizing that carbonate minerals are also known to coprecipitate with many environmentally relevant heavy metals and with growing interests in carbonate minerals for their suitability as sinks for co2 from the atmosphere recent works from dr peters group were inspired to bridge mineralization work on heavy metal removal with efforts and research output on co2 sequestration the mechanism of carbon mineralization in the form of carbonate minerals is outlined as one of six negative emission technologies in the national academies research agenda on negative emissions technologies published in 2019 national academies of sciences 2019 further carbonate minerals are appropriate host minerals for coprecipitation with trace elements due to their ability to incorporate multiple foreign elements into their crystal structures because industrial waste solutions are abundant in calcium they are an excellent option for coupling co2 sequestration with wastewater treatment through calcium carbonate mineralization in response to the call for advancing research into negative emission technologies and the need to treat contaminated wastewaters recent and ongoing works from dr peters group have advanced knowledge on calcium carbonate precipitation in the presence of trace elements including arsenic zinc copper cadmium chromium and barium hunter et al 2021 with an emphasis on mineral characterization using a suite of synchrotron imaging and microscopy techniques including nano xrf micro xrf and nano transmission x ray microscopy txm experimental systems involving carbonation of fly ash leachate or mining wastewaters were designed to simulate conditions relevant for calcium carbonate precipitation the overall extent of trace element uptake and distribution of trace elements within the crystals were quantified and characterized using synchrotron nano xrf capabilities hunter et al 2021 observed preferential incorporation of ions such as as and cr throughout most of the precipitated calcium carbonate particles while ions such as zn and cu co precipitated with iron coatings only on the particle edges rather than in the bulk calcium carbonate sem and txm based imaging captures the physical morphology and physical distributions of the trace elements in the precipitated caco3 phases fig 3 a d analysis of the aqueous phase revealed nearly complete 90 uptake of the trace element species from the solution via crystal incorporation or surface adsorption hunter et al 2021 kim et al 2021a kim et al 2021b results from these studies highlighted the potential of utilizing calcium carbonate precipitation to control fate and transport of heavy metals in our environment as the removal of trace ions through co precipitation is a kinetically dominated process predictions of trace element removal are often underestimated using thermodynamic models he et al 2014 hunter et al 2020 rosenberg et al 2014 weber et al 2018 work from dr peters group has highlighted this underestimation by thermodynamic models hunter et al 2020 and pointed out that the actual measurements of ion incorporation in a multi ion system were directly correlated to the solubility of an ion s metal carbonate phases hunter et al 2021 most recently the group is focusing on improving geochemical models of these controls on complex systems to make better predictions of multi ion incorporation during coprecipitation as well as the stability of these trace elements under various environmentally relevant conditions e g exposure to acidified solutions fig 3e beyond co precipitation work on carbonate dissolution precipitation reactions has been a prominent theme in the peters group efforts to better understand reaction mechanisms in the laboratory as illustrated in this section are complemented by studies that explore physical and chemical heterogeneities that can be expected in the field as detailed in the following sections these efforts inform and allow for upscaling connecting laboratory scale experiments to the field scale particularly in the context of geologic carbon sequestration 4 reactive transport modeling at the pore network scale and beyond the first research project on geological carbon sequestration in princeton kicked off around 2000 exploring ideas of safe storage of co2 in deep subsurface bruant et al 2002 one storage mechanism is mineral trapping the sequestration of co2 in the form of mineral precipitates via rock dissolution and re precipitation of carbonate giammar et al 2005 reaction thermodynamics and kinetics of these geochemical reactions are typically measured in well mixed reactors without considering mass transport limitations in this context an important question is how do natural system characteristics in particular chemical and physical heterogeneities influence rates of mineral dissolution and carbon mineralization efforts of answering this question resulted in papers that explored the use of pore scale network modeling to understand and quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneities and incomplete mixing on mineral co2 reaction rates at the pore network scale under conditions relevant to geological co2 sequestration pore scale network modeling was used to explore scaling effects on geochemical reaction rates li et al 2006 the transport and geochemical reactions anorthite dissolution and kaolinite precipitation were simulated in individual pores accounting for heterogeneities of both physical and mineral properties mass balance principles were then used to calculate reaction rates at the pore network aka continuum scale results showed that at high co2 concentrations reactions occurred rapidly such that concentrations of reactive species and reaction rates varied from pore to pore by orders of magnitude as a result the scaling effect i e the discrepancy in reaction rates in pores versus rates averaged over hundreds of pores continuum scale or pore network scale was significant at low co2 concentrations reactions occur much slower such that the scaling effects were relatively small meaning that rates at individual pores were similar to those at the pore network scale these results indicated that increased acidity and rapid mineral reactions associated with geological sequestration can generate conditions where it is important to consider the scaling effects the pore scale network model enables the representation of pore to pore heterogeneities in pore size and mineral reactivity at the pore network scale thereby quantifying the heterogeneity effects on network scale reaction rates li et al 2007b pore scale network models were constructed to represent sandstones with anorthite and kaolinite present in various amounts and in different spatial patterns fig 4 results showed that effects of spatial distribution were significant when small proportions of reactive minerals were distributed in largely non reactive sandstone and when reactive minerals were closely clustered and oriented parallel to the main flow direction conversely spatial distributions that maximized the rates of mass transport to and from reactive minerals such as small mineral clusters or reactive clusters oriented transverse to the main flow direction minimized the effects of heterogeneity similar conclusions have been made later when understanding rates of carbonate dissolution and bioremediation wen and li 2018 li et al 2011 li et al 2008 with the presence of spatial heterogeneity and incomplete mixing questions arise regarding the accuracy of field measurements of pore water chemistry li et al 2007a such measurements often average aqueous concentrations in many pores with high concentration gradients to answer these questions aqueous concentrations averaged over the entire pore network were used as mathematical analogs of field measured solute concentrations results showed that under conditions where incomplete mixing arose averaged concentrations and analogously field measured concentrations did not accurately reflect reaction progress over the length scale of several millimeters anorthite dissolution rates can be overestimated by a factor of three for kaolinite even the reaction direction cannot be correctly determined from the averaged concentration due to its highly nonlinear reaction rate law kaolinite precipitation occurred in individual pores whereas the averaged concentrations indicated that kaolinite should dissolve at the network scale the extent of error depends on the extent of incomplete mixing conditions that homogenize concentration fields such as small reactive mineral clusters abundant reactive minerals and very fast or very slow flow rates minimize errors introduced by averaging these results indicate that averaging of concentrations over a network may partly contribute to the often cited laboratory field rate discrepancy white and brantley 2003 and have important implications for interpreting field data these studies were among the first that used pore scale network modeling to explore reactive transport processes pore scale network modeling has traditionally been used to understand multiphase flow dynamics blunt et al 2002 these studies have inspired further reactive transport simulation work using pore scale network modeling to understand coupled hydrological and geochemical reactions in natural systems blunt et al 2013 an example is to understand and quantify carbonate reactions and the associated porosity and permeability evolution under high pressure co2 acidified conditions relevant to geological carbon sequestration kim et al 2011 nogues et al 2013 nogues et al 2013 showed that permeability increased extensively with carbonate dissolution however a far from equilibrium injection solution surprisingly produced less permeability change than a near to equilibrium solution at the same ph because ph buffering from increased carbonate ion concentration inhibited further reaction in addition it was observed that dissolution induced changes led to a small permeability reduction while small amounts of precipitation led to large changes in permeability broadly these studies were among the early works that explored the effects of spatial heterogeneities in regulating flow and biogeochemical reactions they have inspired later studies on the effects of physical and chemical heterogeneities at scales beyond the pore and pore network scales for a myriad of reactions and under a variety of conditions examples include carbonate and silicate dissolution within the pore scale li et al 2008 at the column centimeters scale li et al 2014a salehikhoo and li 2015 salehikhoo et al 2013 and at the meter scale atchley et al 2014 jung and navarre sitchler 2018 wen and li 2017 wen and li 2018 effects of spatial heterogeneities have also been explored for microbe mediated reactions such as sulfate and iron oxide reduction in the context of uranium bioremediation bao et al 2014 li et al 2011 li et al 2010 the impacts of mineral spatial heterogeneities on permeability evolution have seen sustained interest over the years beckingham 2017 bensinger and beckingham 2020 sabo and beckingham 2021 steinwinder and beckingham 2019 the theme of mineral heterogeneity carries on in and beyond the peters group and this is highlighted through studies of fractured media elaborated in the next section deng et al 2015 deng et al 2018a deng et al 2018b 5 fracture alteration triggered by geochemical reactions integrating physical chemical heterogeneity in investigations of subsurface or hydrological systems is particularly essential in fractures fractures are important features in rock materials as they serve as preferential pathways for fluid flow and mass transport bear 1993 berkowitz 2002 their presence typically controls the hydraulic properties of porous media and thus the long term security of caprocks in geologic carbon storage systems and the performance of various aquifers and reservoirs fracture properties evolve with local physical chemical conditions and therefore predictive understanding of how they respond to natural and anthropogenic perturbations is important in hydrological models fractures can be represented by an equivalent continuum approach a dual porosity permeability approach a dual multi continua approach or by a discrete fracture network deng and spycher 2019 doughty 1999 hyman et al 2015 long et al 1982 warren and root 1963 the permeability of fractures is typically estimated based on a power law relationship with respect to fracture aperture or volume which was developed for parallel fractures and is also known as the cubic law snow 1969 the evolution of fracture permeability due to chemical alteration is traditionally accounted for by using the same relationship but with changing porosity aperture or by using modified relationships based on studies of chemically simplified systems e g single mineral rock samples izgec et al 2010 szymczak and ladd 2009 dr peters group has added realism to the investigations by examining samples of complex mineralogy under conditions that are relevant to the deep subsurface environment 5 1 geochemical alteration of fractures ellis et al 2011 is the first of a sequence of studies from the peters group that demonstrated the complex dependence of fracture alteration on mineral composition the study was enabled by an experimental system that couples a high pressure core flooding apparatus and x ray ct imaging a fossiliferous carbonate core from the amherstburg formation was fractured and exposed to the flow of a co2 saturated brine with a ph of 4 4 under a confining pressure of 10 mpa the core is composed of approximately equal amounts of dolomite and calcite which account for 90 of the bulk and small amounts of quartz k feldspar and clay minerals the fracture geometries before and after reacting with the acidic brine were characterized using high resolution x ray ct images significant dissolution of calcite was observed leading to increases in fracture apertures however the fracture did not open uniformly and the non slow reacting mineral bands created comb tooth like structures in addition a microporous layer was observed on the fracture surface which as confirmed by the sem images is composed of dolomite and silicate rich minerals that remain after the preferential removal of calcite fig 5 the altered layer is an important feature that affects long term fracture evolution and has also been observed in several other fracture experimental studies deng et al 2016b noiriel and deng 2018 noiriel et al 2007 x ray ct images from the experiment were used in deng et al 2013 to quantify how these complex morphological features can impact the hydrodynamic properties of the fracture unstructured tetrahedral meshes were generated from the fracture geometries before and after reactions and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were performed to calculate the hydraulic aperture b h which is related to fracture permeability by the cubic law the study showed that b h is smaller than the geometric aperture b g and that the difference is larger for the post reaction fracture the ratio of b h b g is approximately 0 7 for the pre reaction fracture and is reduced to approximately 0 45 after the reaction this decrease is a result of the increase in surface roughness caused by both the comb tooth like structures and the altered layer by devising a ternary segmentation method the authors were able to separate the altered layer from the intact matrix it was shown that the altered layer even though it accounts for less than 15 of the fracture volume covers 70 of the fracture surface unevenly and thus further increases fracture surface roughness this means that the widely used power law relationship between fracture volume aperture and fracture permeability will no longer apply the increase of the fracture permeability caused by calcite dissolution is mitigated by the complex morphological changes that arise from mineral compositional heterogeneity in addition to affecting surface roughness the altered layer can also influence the fracture permeability by particle mobilization and clogging in an experimental study using the same rock sample under similar conditions as ellis et al 2011 ellis et al 2013 observed substantial calcite dissolution but with permeability reduction microbeam ca k edge xanes x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra were collected in locations where fracture closure was observed and the data confirmed that the closing was not caused by secondary precipitation but rather was a result of the deposition of particles dislodged from the upstream altered layer it was later shown by another study that particle disaggregation and detachment from the altered layer depend on the abundance of the fast reacting minerals in the rocks and the porosity of the altered layer deng et al 2017 the altered layer arising from complex mineral composition can also have important impacts on subsequent chemical evolution in the work of deng et al 2020 a novel microfluidic experimental system fabricated using a carbonate rich eagle ford shale was coupled with synchrotron based spectroscopic characterization techniques as such more detailed characterization of the textural and mineralogical changes in the altered layer was made possible the study showed that the altered layer grows at a decreasing rate because the dissolution of the fast reacting calcite was increasingly limited this is because the altered layer undergoes an armoring effect strongly limiting diffusion and preventing continued calcite dissolution furthermore xrf and xanes data revealed co existence of as and fe bearing minerals which remained in the altered layer but became more exposed as confirmed by the increased surface area in the altered layer measured from the x ray ct images therefore the chemical evolution not only will affect long term alteration of the fractures but also mobilization and migration of toxic metals while the altered layer is caused by mineral compositional heterogeneity features such as the comb tooth like structures observed in ellis et al 2011 are primarily controlled by mineral spatial heterogeneity using a 2d reactive transport model deng and peters 2019 systematically investigated the impacts of mineral spatial distribution on the evolution of fracture hydraulic properties the 2d reactive transport model was developed and benchmarked based on a fracture flow experimental study of a homogeneous limestone deng et al 2015 the experimental study highlighted the impacts of fluid chemistry on channelization in fractures which typically results in disproportionately fast increase in fracture permeability for a given fracture volume increase the b h b g ratio is larger than one when channelization develops in fractures whereas the b h b g ratio is below one when surface roughness increases as discussed above the modeling investigation showed that channelization can be promoted or suppressed depending on the spatial distribution of the reactive mineral specifically when the reactive mineral is connected and in sync with the favored flow path for the given geometry channelization is promoted and fracture permeability increases rapidly fig 6 a b otherwise channelization that would be expected based on the geometry alone will not develop in another study deng et al 2018b showed that the formation of the porous altered layer can also shift the flow conditions under which channelization would form for a given fracture geometry 5 2 fracture alteration under coupled chemical mechanical controls in the experimental study of ellis et al 2013 the post reaction x ray ct images showed dissolution of asperities which could also lead to fracture closure and permeability reduction however as the x ray ct images were not taken under confining pressure the interactions between chemical and mechanical processes could not be studied conclusively in order to investigate fracture alteration under confining stress spokas et al 2018 coupled the reactive transport model from deng and peters 2019 with a mechanical model and performed simulations with different abundances and spatial distributions of the reactive mineral it showed that while the abundance of the reactive mineral has an impact on fracture permeability initially by affecting fluid reactivity downstream the trajectories of fracture permeability are mostly controlled by mineral spatial distributions for a nodular spatial pattern asperities that remain can keep the fracture open while dissolution continues to enlarge flow pathways and thus increase permeability in contrast for a banded spatial pattern because any channelization would be suppressed the increase in fracture permeability from dissolution is dampened fig 6c in a homogeneous rock the increase in fracture permeability from dissolution is limited as the fracture is compressed under normal stress when the asperities are dissolved the experimental work of spokas et al 2019 further investigated the geomechanical changes triggered by chemical alteration of fractures in the experimental study fractured eagle ford shale cores were exposed to an acidic and neutral flow and then subjected to compression and shearing a porous altered layer was observed on the fracture surface in the acidic flow experiment fig 7 a after compression and shearing the altered layer collapsed fig 7b and the produced particles remained in the fracture resulting in fracture permeabilities that are one to two orders of magnitude lower than the post compression fracture permeabilities in the neutral flow experiment this layer of fine particles can also prevent the formation of interlocking asperities and therefore reduce the friction strength consequently it is likely that the risk of a slip event increases this comparative experimental study provides valuable insights into how chemical alteration features that arise from mineral heterogeneity can impact fracture mechanical strength collectively the experimental and modeling studies in this subsection demonstrate how mineral composition and spatial distribution can impact fracture morphology and the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the fractures they underscore the need to account for these factors in developing generalized rules for describing fracture evolution e g the cubic law for fracture permeability 6 mentorship to date dr peters has mentored more than fifty undergraduate students 5 master students 13 phd students and 7 postdocs through her teaching research advising and mentorship infused with passion care fairness and inspiration her commitment has had a profound impact on many of her students dr peters often goes out of her way to support her mentees for example the graduate course modeling of geochemical kinetics and reactive transport now regularly offered was first offered to a single student such that the student could meet the course requirement in preparation for the general examination otherwise known as the phd qualifying exam in many universities a certain number of major courses need to be taken in the first two years at princeton when planned courses are not offered for unexpected reasons the impacts can be devastating to a student dr peters however ensured no student was negatively affected by such situation by tailoring a specialized course in the case of this student dr peters leads a dynamic research team which provides opportunities for every member to grow for example she welcomes and supports undergraduate students to gain hands on experience in the laboratory one of her senior thesis supervisees prof benjamin runkle now at the university of arkansas reflected on his experience and commented i remember how well she welcomed me into her group letting me attend group meetings and journal article discussions encouraging me in the lab even to do the most basic tasks we studied biofilm growth together and she gave such encouragement about navigating the ups and downs of science her feedback on my thesis was insightful and it was even given a departmental prize oftentimes dr peters asks graduate students to explain basic concepts when undergraduate students without background knowledge are present at group meetings this ensures productivity and engagement from the undergraduates while also giving graduate students the opportunity to teach while encouraging this mentoring opportunity within group and internal and external collaborative research she makes certain that her mentees reach out to her when feeling uncomfortable in the process and assures them that it is the advisor s duty to watch out for their interests dr peters is dedicated to the resolution of water and energy challenges and adopts an interdisciplinary approach in solving these challenges in her research also while based in the department of civil and environmental engineering cee she has integrated the importance of taking on the water and energy challenges with an interdisciplinary approach in her teaching dr peters leads by example and her impact has carried over to the succeeding generation of professors prof peter nelson now at the colorado state university took dr peters introduction to environmental engineering and decided to major in cee from this course he commented now that i am a faculty member in a civil and environmental engineering department myself i make it a priority to expose high school students and early undergraduates to the water side of cee so that they may be aware of the great opportunities in the field another project that exemplified dr peters dedication to the field and mentorship was during the time following the catastrophic earthquake in haiti which occurred in 2010 in response to the disaster she led multidisciplinary student teams to develop disaster relief technologies that would provide clean drinking water and electricity her power in a box team designed and constructed a portable 5 kw wind turbine in a shipping container for deployment to off the grid communities and this project won a prestigious award from the u s epa p3 student competition in sustainable design in 2012 one mentee reflected that one important role of the mentor is to light the way this is exactly what dr peters has been practicing in her mentorship and such approach to her advising illuminates different possibilities for her mentees and helps them to pursue a path of their choosing 7 concluding remarks in this highlights paper we reviewed a collection of studies from dr peters group that showcase her contributions in bridging environmental geochemistry and hydrology her research program spans and couples the fields of hydrology geochemistry and beyond crossing areas of expertise necessary for addressing current and important scientific and practical challenges via a suite of characterization experimental and modeling methods the peters group has advanced understanding of complex biogeochemical conditions and their impacts on the evolution of fractured porous media particularly of their hydraulic properties the findings provide the basis for developing predictive capabilities regarding fluid rock interactions the resulting migration of fluids and the associated hydrogeochemical processes these predictive capabilities are critical for a scientific understanding of earth s critical zone li et al 2017 and the sustainable use of subsurface energy systems deng et al 2021 the co evolution of research objectives and cutting edge methodology developments to target complex questions in hydrology and biogeochemistry highlight the power of combining tools and knowledge across disciplines to solve difficult environmental problems in addition to contributing new knowledge and tools for addressing traditional and emerging challenges in the field of hydrology dr peters impacts are amplified through her mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students many of which are the next generation of researchers and mentors working on tackling various aspects of today s challenges 8 bios reflections 8 1 hang deng hang is an assistant professor in the department of

mentorship continued after my graduation in addition to research she has been very supportive and encouraging of my involvement in various professional services and in diversity equity and inclusion efforts i feel comfortable approaching her with my questions problems regarding career and personal development as i know i can always count on her for guidance and support she is very generous in sharing her stories and providing advice her experiences as the only female faculty in the department when she first started at princeton and now as the first female chair in the department are not only inspirational but also help me put things into perspective i find myself more appreciative of the progress that their generations have led more aware of the challenges that remain and more confident that i will be able to make a difference as well she is such a good role model in every aspect she is willing to step out of her comfort zone when developing her research program is dedicated to her family and takes on teaching advising and mentoring as a very serious responsibility and a privilege she once said to me that being able to work with students is like being given a gift this is something that i will hold dear to my heart as i take on the role of professor myself 8 2 li li li li is the barry and shirley isett professor in civil and environmental engineering at penn state university university park she was in peters group pursuing a doctoral degree in environmental engineering and water resources from 1999 to 2005 she later worked at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory as a postdoc and as a research scientist before joining the faculty at penn state in 2009 her groupasks questions on how changing climate and human activities regulate water flow biogeochemical processes and water quality under diverse climate geology and land use conditions i grew up academically as an environmental chemist with bachelor s and master s degrees in environmental chemistry before joining the peters group i was expected to continue along this path during my phd possibly adding some microbiology insights when quantifying biodegradation rates of organic contaminants somewhat akin to kris wammer s in my second year in graduate school i took a class on numerical methods a topic that i was exposed to for the first time i was fascinated by the magical power of coding feeding them equations and numbers and they would spit out numbers forecasting the temporal and spatial trajectory of anything numerical modeling however was not peters expertise at that time what should i do to reconcile the two my fascination for a completely different research trajectory and my loyalty to my advisor and phd project as an international student i could suffer from substantial financial consequence if i lose peters support can i tell her how should i tell her a couple of agonizing months quickly flew by i finally decided to talk to catherine i remember the sunlight brightly glancing through her office windows shining so happilyit almost stung i heard myself babbling telling her the change of my heart and that i prefer not to continue biodegradation project i apologized for disappointing her and then i stopped without any idea of what was going to happen next the air felt stagnant as iftime stopped she did not say anything for a while probably still sinking in the news the silence feltlike a century then i saw a smilespreadingon her face she seemed almost amused why are you so nervous lili she asked i worry that i will disappoint and upset you and you will kick me out of your group her smile grew bigger this comes as a surprise for sure but i am happy for you you figured out what excites you obviously you will need to change your project but we can figure something out she said many people do not know what excites them you are fortunate to figure that out don t you think that is great really yes we can work something out she patted on my shoulder my heart lightened as if a heavy mountain was lifted inmeetings that followed we planned how to move forward bringing in my numerical methods professor as a co advisor at that moment i did not realize how empowering she and that conversation have been she taught me to go after my passion there will be a way even it appearsthousands of miles away that idea has very much emboldened me and shaped my academic career later since then my research topics have evolved jumping between distant topics that require learning new ideas concepts and approaches but i always know that there is a way to get there even if i cannot see it right away in the back of my mind peters smiles at me beaming with pride as i make every jump 8 3 julie j kim julie kim is currently a ph d candidate in the department of civil and environmental engineering at princeton university she joined professor peters group in 2017 after receiving her bachelor s degree in civil and environmental engineering from carnegie mellon university where dr peters also received her ph d degree professor peters dedication to the success of each of her students and her commitment to providing the right balance of guidance and flexibility are just a few of the things that make her a respectable advisor what makes catherine so knowledgeable and up to date on her students work comes from her efforts to be actively involved and hand on with students experiments as an example catherine makes every effort to travel with students to the multi day synchrotron experiments and braces through the multiple late night experiments together she provides support before and during such experiments but allows students to lead synchrotron experiments which is an invaluable experience for graduate students like myself catherine is a mentor who genuinely cares about the success of her students and our future endeavors her advice on how to prepare for a career after graduate school but more importantly the training on academic professionalism and a constant reminder to put our engineering hats on to not forget the environmental motivation behind our work are just the few things that make her an admirable mentor professor peters is a role model to many of her students including myself for her leadership dedication to teaching research and family and for her successful career as a woman in engineering 8 4 florence t ling flo ling earned a ph d in geosciences at pennsylvania state university in 2016 after which she worked with dr peters as a postdoctoral research associate at princeton university she is now an assistant professor of environmental science at la salle university conducting research on environmental mineralogy and geochemistry i have truly valued the mentorship that dr peters provided catherine s achievements as a ground breaking woman in science and as the first female chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering at princeton has been an inspiration for female leaders in stem i have always appreciated her open ness in talking about the challenges of balancing work and family and the struggles that she encountered during her career a valued piece of scientific advice that i received from her was the push to be bold be brave the philosophy was not something i had previously considered imbuing into my scientific work but it has helped me grow in my confidence to pursue new research projects with a lessened fear of failure 8 5 lauren e beckingham lauren e beckingham is an assistant professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at auburn university after finishing her b s in environmental engineering at michigan technological university in 2007 she joined the peters group at princeton university where she completed her ph d in 2012 she was then a geochemical postdoctoral fellow at lawrence berkeley national laboratory 2012 2015 before joining auburn university in 2016 her expertise and interests are in understanding water rock interactions in environmental systems particularly in subsurface energy systems including geologic co2 sequestration and compressed energy storage if you have met catherine you undoubtedly noticed her friendly open demeanor and intellectually creative spirit as evident by the author group here as well as many others catherine is inspirational where many of her former students have followed academic pursuits with their own desires to further inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers catherine s academic family often goes beyond the bounds of the e quad where she strives to get to know her students as scientists and people i ve often reflected on the quote how you spend your days is how you spend your life catherine is a superb example that while not easy it is feasible to be an excellent educator leader and top tier researcher while maintaining apersonal life where you spend time with family and even learn something new like how to play the piano 8 6 kristine h wammer kris wammer is associate dean of research and interdisciplinary programs in the college of arts sciences and a professor of chemistry at the university of st thomas after completing her b a in chemistry at st olaf college in 1997 she joined the peters group at princeton and earned her ph d in 2003 she then completed a dreyfus environmental chemistry postdoctoral fellowship at the university of minnesota prior to joining the faculty at st thomas in 2005 her research group studies the fate and transformation of biologically active contaminants in aquatic systems with a particular focus on aquatic photochemistry she considers catherine her first and best role model for believing it is possible to effectively balance administrative work a research lab and a family and personal life i joined catherine s group in 1997 when she was about half of the way towards tenure the group was small at the time consisting of me a master student and a more senior phd student the story that comes to mind most readily when i think of catherine s guidance and mentorship is from 2001 when i found out i was pregnant with my first child at the time i was methodically working through a series of pah biodegradation experiments which required long sometimes overnight stays in the lab to perform we kept a little cot under one of the lab bench cutouts to allow me to get some rest between collecting data points i told catherine about my pregnancy almost immediately i think she was second to know after my husband because i knew we would need to take a look at safety concerns catherine was thrilled for me i remember her telling me that because she had known so many women who waited to have children and then struggled with fertility that she had wanted to encourage me to consider having children during graduate school if that was my desire i remember her support feeling like such a relief i was nervous about the logistics of how i was going to pull off keeping up with an intense experimental schedule while pregnant but knowing that she would be understanding and help support my success was huge because it was so early in the pregnancy i didn t want to tell too many people so i remember having a meeting with the environmental health and safety officer catherine and one other female phd student li li the ehs officer had gone through the list of compounds with which i worked and we came up with a game plan for what it was safe for me to do and what i d need to avoid and ask for help with i m so grateful for the support my last set of that particular series of experiments wrapped up in september 2001 and i gave birth to a healthy baby girl in november at the time there were no systems in place to accommodate pregnant graduate students the official policy was that i should go on unpaid leave but that would also mean losing my health insurance as a result officially i took no time off i read papers and wrote from home when i could but stayed away from the lab for several weeks while i recovered from giving birth and learned how to be a new mother without such a supportive and understanding mentor i can easily imagine that i might have had to drop out and not finish my phd i wonder how many stories similar to mine from that era and earlier did not have a happy ending due to a different mentorship experience author
